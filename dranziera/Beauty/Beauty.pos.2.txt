 I 'm very pleased with the Epicuren line of facial products . The Herbal cleanser is gentle . My skin does n't feel dry after using , and it rinses-off completely .
 I 've been using it for a couple of years and it works really well . It has a very faint , fresh smell -LRB- just barely a hint of citrus ? -RRB- , but is virtually odorless . It is also not greasy at all . I 've had trouble finding a moisturizer that keeps me from looking like an oil slick .
 Placed order on 7/4 and received 7/6 . Very fast service and will use this company again ! This smells wonderful and the bottle is very cute .
 I love this lipstick ! I have used it for years and there 's nothing like it . It goes on smoothly and lasts for hours . Better than any designer lipstick I have ever used !
 I have been using this product for several years . The quality is high and the matte finish lasts well . The fact that it is broad makes it easy to handle - I use it both as a lip liner and a lip `` stick '' . What I like , in addition to the soft and smooth finish , ease of application , is the fact that you can sharpen it right down to the last 1/2 '' ! I am buying just about every color but I like the natural colors the best . What more can be said ? Great color selection , easy to use , high quality product , fast service from the vendor , all at a low price .
 I have used this lipstick for years . I was so disappointed when I learned that Duane Reade was no longer carrying it . I immediately goggled the item and was pleased to have found it . This lipstick is better than any designer lipstick I have every used ! It goes on smoothly and wears very well . I plan to stock up on them so I will certainly be ordering some more .
 I love this lipstick . It 's a liner and lipstick in one . It stays on well and has a nice finish . I usually top it with a glossy chapstick to give it a little more shine . The Valentine shade is too red for me , but I love Rosebud . Just wish the colors on the computer were a little more true to the actual color . It 's hard to pick the right shade .
 i found this product a few years ago and have been looking for it . it is wonderful . the color is great and it stays on . very easy to apply . love it .
 I love this hand cream . It 's non-greasy , lightly scented and does what it claims . I highly recommend it .
 I 've used this creme for years ; great hand creme and I 've used it on my face as well ; very light fragrance ; get it ; you wo n't be sorry
 I first discovered this at the Q & have been using it ever since . It 's a great hand cream ... not greasy in any way like some others , which are like oil slicks . There is a fragrance , but it 's very light , not offensive . It has cleared up some age spots & leaves my hands very soft . It 's great for my cuticles . I 'm a nail polish wearer , but find this seems to peel the polish off . This 4oz jar lasts a long time too . I only gave 4 stars because of the issue I have with the nail polish , but I would still recommend this hand cream .
 I 've been using this hand creme for awhile and I just LOVE IT ! It has a very nice smell . I keep one tube at work , another one by my bed and a jar in the bathroom . This is one of my favorite Lather products -LRB- another one is the sweet almond face moisturizer & exfoliating creme -RRB-
 I 'm using this on my hands and feet . After one week my rough , dry , cracked footsies are soft and smooth . I 've never seen such a dramatic improvement with any other product . Ca n't recommend it highly enough !
 I remember when I used to use this spray , I was 15 !!! Love the smellDifferent smell bring different memories
 First Christmas from a boy in high school . Love it . So glad I found it ... . Need to order it again .
 Perfume was received in great condition . Was delivered at estimated delivery date . Would buy again from this seller .
 I loved this set so much that I already bought another . I have really dry hands , and the soap alone works wonders . Adding the lotion is a bonus . This brand makes really good products . I also bought their orange cranberry body lotion and their tubes of powerful handcreme from amazon . I love them all ! I am highly allergic to most beauty products and none of these cause me any problems . I highly recommend this set and the other Lather products . By the way , this set is packaged beautifully in a pretty mesh bag .

 I really like the lipstick and would like to order another color by the same manufacturer if it is available . Need to get back in touch and try to find it . I was pleased with the accuracy of the order and speed at which it was delivered ... would buy from them again .
 They sent me lipstick that was mislabled ; it said 115 Russet , but was actually Burgandy . I still have not received may refund .
 This was just the moisturizer I was looking for ! The label says it 's for guys , but I love the scent and how it makes my face feel so I do n't care that I 'm using a `` guy 's facial lotion '' ! I ca n't stop touching my face after I put it on -LRB- and neither can my hubby !! -RRB- This is a little expensive , but a little really goes a long way for this product .
 Okay , since confession 's good for the soul I 'll admit it - I 'm a bathroom bandit . If there 's a new potion , lotion , jar or bottle on the guy counter in our bathroom , I ca n't resist taking a sniff , then maybe a dab , and -LRB- sad to say -RRB- even appropriating same . Such was the case with Cosmetic Lad from Lush.Of course , it 's geared for guys but , believe me , it 's also great for gals . This yummy smelling cream softens skin and keeps those disobedient wisps of hair in place . It 's particularly soothing after being in the sun or exposed to wintry blasts.The fragrance is fresh , clean , fruity -LRB- smells great on men -RRB- . Healing and smoothing ingredients in the cream are Shea butter , cocoa butter , and aloe vera gel . For good measure the formula also includes chamomile , lavender honey , almond oil , and wheatgrass.Yep , what 's good for the goose delights the gander .
 This is a good product for the money . There are some features I would like to mention though . I received No manual for the appliance at all . Also , its difficult figuring out exactly how much water you should add to the glass container . It seems like you have to fill it ALL the way , and the steamer will cut off when it reaches about half way or less .
 These sponges just do a great job of keeping the callus off of my feet . Much better than the stones .
 Cantaloupe Kiss -LRB- P20 -RRB- Shisedo Lipstick is an older lipstick & discontinued , but I found it on Amazon ... yay ! ... & this is my 5th one ! . . it is the perfect summer color for blondes ... I mix & match it with a lighter shade of lipstick in the summer & a darker shade of lipstick in the fall ... it is gorgeous both ways ! It goes on creamy ... simply beautiful .
 This lipstick shade has been discontinued . I was lucky to get it through Amazon !!
 The winter in our high , dry desert makes it especially tough on hands . I had recieved the Lather AHA Evening Primrose Handcream as a gift and began using it . -LRB- I have handcreams in nearly every room of my house , my purse and my car and nothing seemed to give relief for my chapped hands -RRB- . Within two days of using this handcream , the chapped , scratchy fingers were gone and in their place were smooth fingertips ! I ordered the package of three -- dropped one in my purse and gave the other 2 to my friends who had the same complaint . They love it too ! I 'm sure they will be purchasing the same thing soon . I ca n't rave enough about it .
 All winter , I have been trying various hand , body , and face creams on my hands , trying desparately to help my very dry hands . But , still my hands kept cracking , bleeding , and breaking out . I am highly allergic to many beauty products , so I was not really getting my hopes up , but it had great reviews here and on other sites , so I gave it a try and WOW ! WIthin just a couple days the cracks and rashes started to heal . It has only been 10 days since I started using it and my hands are smooth and free of injuries , even if I forget to put it on for the day . I have never had anything work so well so fast ! I have started using it on my nasty dry elbows and am starting to see similar effects . Even though it is a little high priced to use as a body cream , I think I will try it on my ultra dry legs next ! I am going to be a regular for this great cream . By the way , I LOVE the scent as well !
 I received the order as ordered and I have used this for years and Neutrogena is my favorite hand cream .
 I have been using this for years because every application lasts a long time and yet your hands do n't feel greasy or oily . to the touch .
 Works wonderfully for dry chapped hands and rough heels too . Same great formula , but too bad they changed the Original Scent . The Original Scent had a nice perfume-like fragrance , but this New Scent smells like a man-product . Next time , I 'm getting the Unscented one instead .
 During the winter months I often have dry , chapped hands . I have never been able to find anything to completely remedy this until now . This hand cream is amazing ! A Small amount goes a long way and soothes your skin immediately . Within a day , my hands no longer felt raw , and began to return to their smooth supple form from summer time . I highly suggest you try this if you suffer from dry hands , it works quite well . You wo n't be disappointed !
 REMUEVE MUY BIEN EL MAQUILLAJE , Y DEJA LA CARA SIN RESIDUOS DEL PRODUCTO , NO ES GRASOSO . EL PRECIO FANTASTICO !!!

 This mascara gives a very natural look -LRB- if you want a dramatic change , this is not what you 're looking for -RRB- to your lashes . It defines them and picks up any that are lighter and makes them all look slightly thicker . These is no clumping and my lashes do n't get stuck together either .
 Avalon Organics sunscreen rubs on clear , has no scent , and protects my little guy 's skin from sun damage . I applied this 20 minutes before taking a nice long walk in the sun today , and his skin is still white as snow . Amazing product , I 'll definitely buy this again .
 Great sunscreen for our baby . We are very concerned with SPF protection AND with keeping harmful chemicals away from her . This sunscreen does both . It is pleasant , not greasy and scent free . We live in Georgia where the sun can be brutal and she wears this all day at the beach -LRB- with a couple of re-applications -RRB- and she has never gotten burned . We are VERY happy with this product .
 Everyone in my family uses this sunscreen . It rubs in easily and is n't greasy at all . Great protection overall and no harsh chemicals !
 We 've only had a couple opportunities to use the sunscreen on our infant -LRB- once at 4 months , another time at 7 months -RRB- and we kept her in the shade most of that time so it was hard to say just how effective it was . However , I can say that her skin did not react in any way and it had a pleasant smell.The real test was when her dad used the sunscreen one day -LRB- we had run out of adult sunscreen -RRB- . He applied it once in the morning and was out in the sun all day -LRB- watching tennis -RRB- and did not burn at all . We were very impressed .
 I purchased this for my 8 month old for his trips to the playground . Since living in southern california , the sun is very strong . Lotion goes on smooth without any white residue . It doesnt have a strong smell , maybe a subtle pleasant one . My son seems to be liking it and no sunburns thus far ! I recommend it !
 This is a great sunblock , and great ones are hard to come by . This one has a light fresh scent and has good coverage for everyday adventures . I use this product myself not just for my baby .
 I bought this for my baby daughter because of the low SPF . It has worked pretty well so far . I 've only seen a little pink on her . I would recommend this for other babies . Next year we will use a higher SPF
 I purchased this for my 2 1/2 year old grandson who comes to visit when we are at the shore . His parents only use organic products on him . This was a great price and delivery was fast .
 I use Avalon Organics Lavender bath and shower gel in bath and for hands in bathroom . Love the smell and the way it lathers into soft bubbles .
 This stuff is great !! is non irritating to the skin and the lavender scent relaxes you while in the bath or shower . Highly recomend this brand and soap !!
 Overall , I 'm pleased with the product . I keep it in a ziplock bag in my freezer and use it when I want to destress or shake off a killer headache . The material is soft , and the pac is just the right weight to put the perfect amount of pressure on my aching eyes . My only qualm is that it is n't as fragrant as I 'd hoped it would be , and it 's only getting less so -LRB- despite the fact that I always store it in a sealed bag , as indicated in the care instructions -RRB- .
 I had purchased this as a gift . This set appears to be one that you 'd get free at a Department store if you purchased XX dollars in the same brand . The set came in a clear plastic bag that is n't really suitable as a gift in my opinion .
 I heard about this product for the first time in a Black Hair magazine . One of the celebrities swore by this and I was desperate to find a really good pomade and decided to give it a try.I 'm hooked now !!! I used this product while I was deployed to Iraq and then of course back in the states . I 've used it in hot and cold climates and it never disappoints . I have tried other pomades and either they make my hair too stiff , cause too many flakes , or they simply do not smooth the hair down.Pros : * It is not sticky and does not cause embarrassing white flakes around your hairline . * Has a pleasant smell and works wonders on smoothing edges down or slick back hair styles . * Does not make your hair stiff . * Washes out easily . * Works excellent on ethnic hair . * A little definitely goes a long way , so it saves you money in the long run when used sparingly.Cons : * It may seem too expensive for some , but if you 're in doubt please refer to the last bullet above .
 I really love this wax . It allows you to shape and define without the heaviness or `` goo '' of other products . It arrived on time and was an easy transaction .
 I have been searching for a lip product that would go on and feel like a gloss , but look like a lipstick for , what seems like , forever . I almost ca n't believe that I found it ! I get so many compliments on my lips now . I am horrible at putting on lipstick , and gloss was never enough color for me . So , this product is perfect for people like me . Yay !
 I found that it looked like they were going to be discontinuing this product at my local store so when I found it here online I decided to stock up . The color is a light pink with a touch of shimmer and in a gloss form . I hope I 'm wrong in that they are not discontinuing but it seems lately that every color or fragrance that I love gets nixed .
 I 've used this for 2 + years now . It was so convinient to be able to find it online & not have to search through racks at the drugstore .
 It seems ridiculous to rate this product as it is no longer available , and if it is , the price is through the roof . It sold for $ 6.50 when it was available and is now being sold at $ 65 . I loved the product , but not at that price . Unfortunately Revlon did not produce a substitute . Pity .
 Used a number of years and can no longer find in the stores . Adds a light color to the lips and nice shine , but does n't stay on very long .
 The seller sent item as described and promptly I would purchse from this seller again , Thank you and I appreicate the promptness .
 I have been using this lipstick for a long time . I love it . My favorite color is the pink lightning .
 If I 'm just running to the grocery store I do n't necessarily feel the need for full makeup and lipstick . This lip glide -LRB- which I thought was discontinued because the local shops do n't sell it anymore -RRB- is a great consistency and the Sheerly Burgundy is the perfect natural color for my corpselike lips . It makes the lips look healthy and gives you a bit of a finished look without having to go with the full color lipstick . Highly recommended . I have used Subscribe & Save because I do n't want to run out of it !
 I agree with what most of the reviewers have said , but want to add that in my opinion the color is not pink at all , it is more a brownish/plum/coppery color .
 Why does everything I love get discontinued ? Well , this is a great lipstick , the color is fabulous and it leaves your lips shiny , but not lip gloss poppin shiny . NOT long wearing , but very easy to apply , just click and go .
 You cant find this lipwtick hardly anywhere . I found it , you shipped it immediately and thanks !
 This product is absolutely great , works perfectly , it is very convenient to hold it , not too heavy , does n't hurt my fingers , does n't loose its sharpness . I am very happy about it and yes , shipping and handling was as described by the seller . Thank you
 Great for natural kinky-type african hair . Gives lovely defined curls without excessively drying hair . Another moisturizer is still required though and this can always pose a challenge in terms of the two products mixing well and not causing precipitation of little white flakes.Sep 9 , 2012 update - Okay I bought the green one , Olive Styling Gel , at a local store and it 's waaaaaay better than the blue !!! NO FLAKING and hair feels softer . Oh and I forgot to mention about the blue as well these gels are not greasy . Now the green one takes a while to be absorbed into the hair , so you may have to use a lot the first day you use it or after every shampoo but the next day it does n't take much .
 I absolutely can not live without this gel . I am Black with natural hair , and the way this specific blue gel lays my hair down it is incredible ! And it holds ALL day , with no real hard , stiff , flaky mess to deal with later .
 I love this product . It always leaves my hair feeling soft , no frizz , no sticky residue , and it keeps the curl in all types of weather .
 This dryer is high speed ... the air pushes out fast !!!! Also the cord is n't one that will become twisted . High quality and great performance !
 High volume air flow , heats up rapidly . A gift for my wife and she loves it , la de day de dah
 Far superior than Just for Men . It lasts longer an color is much more accurate . I use dark brown and when I tried Just for Men , dark brown turned my hair black -LRB- following the instructions word by word -RRB- . Unfortunately , it 's not easy to find this product reason why I tried Just for Men .
 Recommended to me by my brother . Wash , towel try and apply the mousse . Tames your tresses and adds body .
 Great product , Fantasia Liquid Mousse is the best mousse I have ever used . I used it for several years , then Walgreens discontinued carrying this item . I looked for it locally for a long time , but finally gave up , thinking I would never be able to find it again . This year while cleaning out cabinets I found an old , almost empty bottle of Fantasia , I decided to look for it on amazon and to my surprise there it was . Amazon is the best . Thank you .
 good I 've used it -LRB- faithfully -RRB- for some 23 years ? suttle and very very apealing scent that carries itself through the day ONLY downfall = it 's hard too find in many or ANY beauty supply stores ...
 I love this and have used it for years . Love that it 's a liquid not foam so I can just spray it directly on my hair instead of having to put it in my hands to apply it -LRB- then my hands get all sticky , yuck . -RRB- Controls my hair really well -LRB- I have curly hair that frizzes easily when it 's humid or rainy , and yeah I use antifrizz control but I need more than that . -RRB- And I love the convenience of buying it from Amazon.com instead of searching from store to store to buy it .
 We love this product from Adults , teenagers , to children . we all use it , some as mousse and some as hair spray and some of us as frizz control .
 This product is great for men who want to add a little styling help to their hair without the look OR SMELL of traditional hair products .
 I love this lipstick ! I have used it for years and there 's nothing like it . It goes on smoothly and lasts for hours . Better than any designer lipstick I have ever used !

 I usually buy my Lush products in Whistler , BC . I 'm so happy that Amazon is carrying these wonderful products online -- the only Lush store right now in the US is in San Francisco . I 've had this little tub -LRB- 3.5 oz -RRB- of Helping Hands for a few months now and it really soothes dry hands and arms . It has a light scent , too . It contains linseed oil , almond oil , shea butter , and cocoa butter , so it 's a thicker lotion that stays a long time on your skin . You need only use a dab of this lotion at a time -- a little goes a long way . It also has glycerine in it , which some people do n't like but it does n't bother me . The products at Lush are all handmade without animal ingredients and make really fun gifts .
 This is the only one I 'll ever buy again ! When my son was born , I had my hand in water a whole lot , cleaning bottles , washing up , cleaning house and so on . My hands got really dry and flaky . I bought a variety of products and none had a lasting , healing effect . They all seemed to only provide temporary relief . Then I was recommended the Helping Hands cream and I hesitated at first , because it is a bit pricey . I walked into a lush store and picked up a small container of it to try and I was hooked instantly . The thing is , if you are too busy to lotion your hands every time you washed your hand and all you want is the miracle cream that restores your hands overnight than this is the product for you .
 I 've never used this product before but decided to buy it on a recommendation from a friend.I 'm currently living in Japan and my house is thinly insulated . With the weather getting colder it gets to the 30s-40s overnight inside -LRB- not to mention being exposed a lot outside -RRB- . With that , and all the washing I do all day at work , my hands have really taken a beating.The scent is interesting ... I think I notice the lavender the most ... but is not too strong or overpowering . Right after I put in on there is a ` slick ' sensation , which dissipates quickly and then all I notice is that my hands are softer and much more comfortable . Just in a short period of time I have noticed a big difference in the way my hands look and feel -- so much better!I am very happy with this product and recommend it highly!JTG
 I love this handcream . I cut my thumb really bad , and used this when my scar was healing , and it definitely helped with the peeling and dryness . My cuticles also get really dry because I wash my hands a lot for my job , and this keeps them moisturized and non-flaky . It feels silky , and not sticky , and I like the way it smells . Plus , you only need a dab , and the tub lasts a long time . I also used it on a bad sunburn , and it felt really good , too !
 Helping Hands is similar to `` Smitten '' in its addictive quality and seems even more moisturizing . It looks like strawberry yogurt with a delicate pink color and rich creamy texture . Linseed gel , Almond oil , Shea butter and Cocoa butter mingle with Honey , Lavender oil and African Marigold oil.This is one luxurious cream with a delicate fragrance and super moisturizing qualities . If you love this amazing product you may also want to look for `` Butterball , '' `` Dream On , '' `` Alkmaar , '' `` Gratuitous Violets , '' `` Honey Trap lip balm , '' and `` Skinny Dip . '' ~ The Rebecca Review
 A little goes a long way . This stuff is great and worth every cent .
 I love this item ! I love that it 's a cute and tiny and silver mesh . It 's my current wallet . I love that I can see everything in it and it 's easily transferrable between purses or my pocket , depending on my needs . I have been a fan of this company for years . Their mesh bags last a long time and can withstand abuse pretty well too . I have one for my makeup , one for my wallet and one for my knitting supplies .
 I 've been using this shampoo exclusively for 9 years . It is the BEST ! I am not sensitive to chemicals , so I have not had the problems the other posters have had . This product is consistently excellent and nothing else has cleaned my hair so effectively . I have very thick , very fine hair . It is a dirty blonde , and even though it 's not extremely oily hair , it shows the dirt easily . This shampoo is the only shampoo I 've had that cleans my hair so well I do n't have to wash it again for days -- and it does n't hurt my foiled highlights . Also , I have super healthy hair , I always have , I just wash it and go .
 Overall , I 'm pleased with the product . I keep it in a ziplock bag in my freezer and use it when I want to destress or shake off a killer headache . The material is soft , and the pac is just the right weight to put the perfect amount of pressure on my aching eyes . My only qualm is that it is n't as fragrant as I 'd hoped it would be , and it 's only getting less so -LRB- despite the fact that I always store it in a sealed bag , as indicated in the care instructions -RRB- .
 I have been wearing this product for a couple of years and love it . My Avon Lady drives me crazy so I was looking for a new place to buy Avon . I was thrilled that Amazon carried Avon products . I like this eye cream better than anything I have tried .
 This product is great . I just started using it and it felt like my skin was jumping of excitement . It 's fresh and no bad scent . After just a week of using it my eyes feel more alert and younger . I recommend this eye cream to everyone !
 Not greasy , nor thin , this cream is whipped soft and easily absorbed . I have 57 year old eyes and use it morning and night under and around my eye area . My skin feels replenished and looks hydrated and the little lines that crease when I smile appear less etched into my face . I use the thicker lotion in the top portion of the container at night only to smooth lined areas above my upper lip as well as the laugh lines . This is my fourth order of Anew Contouring Eye Cream through Amazon and I am completely happy and hooked on the product . It is a must !
 This product really works . Shows results . I even use it over my makeup around crows feet and they demisish right away . I will keep buying this product .
 I love this product . It 's the only thing I have found that actually reduces the puffiness above and pouches below my eyes . When I go a few days without it I really notice the difference . Being able to buy it or any other product on Amazon.com , and save $ $ $ , is always a welcome thing on my budget !
 Have been using for a while . This is some of the best I have used and I have tried it all . Nice smell and feel .
 This is a repeat order product for me . I 've been using this Avon Anew product for at least 6 yrs and at 54 people always tell me they think I 'm in my 30 's !! Guess it must be doing something great for me eyes !!
 my wife uses this product and is well pleased with it , received on time and in excellent condition
 I love all of Avon 's Anew products and use the eye cream in the morning and at night . Great stuff !
 This product is light and easy to aply without tugging on your delicate eye skin . My eyes are very smooth since I 've been wearing it . The shipping it very fast also .
 Best ever eyes cream . The top can be used as a moisturizer to blend in your concealer and give you eyes a dewey , soft finish . I 'm 52 and going ... I have no crows - feet . Goes on smooth
 The book was written in easy to understand instructions and helped you to understand why things happen .
 Imperialis works wonders if you have combination skin , and it does it with a spicy smell . This is the first and only face moisturizer I have encountered that has not caused breakouts . Thanks Lush !!!
 I have been so impressed that every Lush product I 've tried so far has done exactly what it said it does , and Imperialis is no exception . I have dry skin that used to have minor break outs -LRB- go figure -RRB- and I 've tried so many products that either dry it out , or I end up slathered in oil and shiny.Imperialis balanced my skin PERFECTLY . It is absorbed well , and so quickly . You only need a little bit and it goes a long way . But my favorite thing is how calming it is on my skin !
 Moisturizer can be a real problem zone for combination skin . It seems to be easy enough to find cleansers and toners that will handle both oily and dry skin , but moisturizer is it 's own issue . What 's good for oily areas never moisturizes dry regions , and that which is emollient enough for dry patches overwhelms oily parts . In Imperialis Lush has created a moisturizer that actually works for a combination face . Imperialis really does work on all parts of a combination face - at least most of the time . The one exception I 've found is really extreme winter weather - for that I need something stronger for my dry patches . But for most days , this is just perfect . This moisturizer also smells pleasantly of herbal lavender . This is a staple in my beauty routine .
 I loved this moisturizer during the summer but alas , I wo n't be reordering now that the cod has set in . I have normal non-breakout prone , but I do need a bit of a heavier moisurizer for the winter.It does as promised -LRB- neutralizing the t-zone , etc. -RRB- and the smell is feminine . I would reccommend this for girls under 30 y/o because it lacks a bit in the revitalizing department . But do note that this cream does not contain SPF . LUSH sells another -LRB- more expensive -RRB- cream which does .
 I love this stuff !! This is the first moisturizer I 've ever purchased from LUSH , and I was not disappointed ! My skin gets dried out very easily so I need something that can keep it balanced , and zap it back to normal when gets really dry . I 'm just about out of this stuff and this is the first moisturizer I 've ever had that has n't stopped working after a certain period , so I would say this is the best stuff I 've ever used . :-RRB- I wish it were cheaper , but the quality does make it worth the price , that and a little goes a long way . I was n't crazy about the smell when I first started using it , but it has definitely grown on me . As moisturizing as this stuff is , my skin is fussy and I think I may have to look for something a bit heavier for the Winter so I 'll see what else LUSH has , but I can definitely say , yes I would buy this again .
 I have oily skin in the forehead area , but my cheeks are dry . I used to use Celestial moisturizer from Lush . Which I think it 's perfect for me during the winter . But for warmer climate ... I prefer Imperialis . It does n't make my forehead oily and hydrated my cheeks . Also , I prefer the smell of this moisturizer over the Celestial . I love the smell of the lavender and orange ... it 's very relaxing
 I have pugs so naturally I was given this as a gift . Beautifully packaged . Wonderful quality . This pug has been in my guest bathroom for two years . I wo n't let anyone use it !
 I love this lipstick ! I have used it for years and there 's nothing like it . It goes on smoothly and lasts for hours . Better than any designer lipstick I have ever used !
 I have been using this product for several years . The quality is high and the matte finish lasts well . The fact that it is broad makes it easy to handle - I use it both as a lip liner and a lip `` stick '' . What I like , in addition to the soft and smooth finish , ease of application , is the fact that you can sharpen it right down to the last 1/2 '' ! I am buying just about every color but I like the natural colors the best . What more can be said ? Great color selection , easy to use , high quality product , fast service from the vendor , all at a low price .
 I have used this lipstick for years . I was so disappointed when I learned that Duane Reade was no longer carrying it . I immediately goggled the item and was pleased to have found it . This lipstick is better than any designer lipstick I have every used ! It goes on smoothly and wears very well . I plan to stock up on them so I will certainly be ordering some more .
 I love this lipstick . It 's a liner and lipstick in one . It stays on well and has a nice finish . I usually top it with a glossy chapstick to give it a little more shine . The Valentine shade is too red for me , but I love Rosebud . Just wish the colors on the computer were a little more true to the actual color . It 's hard to pick the right shade .
 i found this product a few years ago and have been looking for it . it is wonderful . the color is great and it stays on . very easy to apply . love it .
 I have been searching for a lip product that would go on and feel like a gloss , but look like a lipstick for , what seems like , forever . I almost ca n't believe that I found it ! I get so many compliments on my lips now . I am horrible at putting on lipstick , and gloss was never enough color for me . So , this product is perfect for people like me . Yay !
 I found that it looked like they were going to be discontinuing this product at my local store so when I found it here online I decided to stock up . The color is a light pink with a touch of shimmer and in a gloss form . I hope I 'm wrong in that they are not discontinuing but it seems lately that every color or fragrance that I love gets nixed .
 I 've used this for 2 + years now . It was so convinient to be able to find it online & not have to search through racks at the drugstore .
 It seems ridiculous to rate this product as it is no longer available , and if it is , the price is through the roof . It sold for $ 6.50 when it was available and is now being sold at $ 65 . I loved the product , but not at that price . Unfortunately Revlon did not produce a substitute . Pity .
 Used a number of years and can no longer find in the stores . Adds a light color to the lips and nice shine , but does n't stay on very long .
 The seller sent item as described and promptly I would purchse from this seller again , Thank you and I appreicate the promptness .
 I have been using this lipstick for a long time . I love it . My favorite color is the pink lightning .
 If I 'm just running to the grocery store I do n't necessarily feel the need for full makeup and lipstick . This lip glide -LRB- which I thought was discontinued because the local shops do n't sell it anymore -RRB- is a great consistency and the Sheerly Burgundy is the perfect natural color for my corpselike lips . It makes the lips look healthy and gives you a bit of a finished look without having to go with the full color lipstick . Highly recommended . I have used Subscribe & Save because I do n't want to run out of it !
 I agree with what most of the reviewers have said , but want to add that in my opinion the color is not pink at all , it is more a brownish/plum/coppery color .
 Why does everything I love get discontinued ? Well , this is a great lipstick , the color is fabulous and it leaves your lips shiny , but not lip gloss poppin shiny . NOT long wearing , but very easy to apply , just click and go .
 You cant find this lipwtick hardly anywhere . I found it , you shipped it immediately and thanks !
 Book and price were excellent . I am very pleased with the item . It has been extremely informative with helping train our new GSD .
 GREAT GIFT !! MY MOM LOVES IT , IT HELPS A LOT WITH HER SINUS HEADACHES .
 Ih ave started doing vintage hairstyles , and one product kept popping up on the vintage hairstyle forums and tutorials . Lottabody setting lotion . I was doing pin curls , velcro rollers , and rag curls with wet sets and using an cheap curl setting lotion from Wal Mart . Well I thought let 's look into this Lottabody.Okay , the lotion is a liquid , complete liquid . The instructions tell you to use it on dry hair . I 've done my hair on both . I have exceptionally fine hair that waves , my girlfriend has thick curly hair and her daughters have thick straight hair . We all did some dry and wet sets using Lottabody and had really amazing results . The styles stayed put but were quite touchable - and shiny . We did finger waves and big curls and pompadours and ringlets and rockabillys . We made this setting lotion work for its name . The curls really held up . I was very impressed.There is a slight fragrance to the lotion , it 's meh , not great , not bad , but it does n't last at all . I could still smell my conditioner when all was said and done.I bought two bottles at the time . I expect that it will last me a while . But , I would n't want to run out either .
 thinner than expected but did last all day although it flaked as well , was soft , and managed curls well enough
 This worked really well for my straight hair that refuses to ever hold a curl . Using this on my hair before setting pin curls worked great ! My curls lasted all night . However , the consistency of this product is much more liquid than lotion . Very easy to get too much . I found that I only needed a few drops per curl to set it properly . Use too much and you get hard curls .
 Using this product for years . It works well with my hair texture . It 's hard to find in stores so I am glad I found it on amazon .
 Great product that really holds . It 's enabled me to try some new styles in the hottest and most humid summertime weather , And the styles held up for hours ! I highly recommend !
 I love the Pre de Provence Soaps with Shea Butter ! and the Apple Pear has a pleasant lite scent - No heavy , oily moisturizing feeling .
 This lightly scented , and creamy bar smells just like fresh pears and lathers nicely . I could not recommend this soap more highly . Not too perfumy , just light and fresh , suitable for men or women .
 I used this stuff when I was a teenager and then when I had to start paying my own way I went to the drugstore options . At one point in my twenties I got something from Neutrogena and I broke out in these tiny little flesh colored bumps that itched . I figured it was time . So I got this toner with the Pamplemousse and I 've never looked back . This brand is so reliable . Everything I get works wonders . I also use the skin repair oil in the winter . I just ca n't say enough great stuff about Yonka ! My mother used Yonka too and she always looked younger than her age and had great radiant skin . Five stars are n't enough !
 I 've been using this toner for a little over a year on a daily basis and it is by far , the best product and I 've ever used . I use it in the mornings and nights and do n't even need any moisturizer at all . I am so thankful I found this product ; I can not go back and use anything else .
 THIS `` LOTION '' IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL LOTION . IT IS MORE LIKE A MIST . BUT IT DEFINITELY WORKS LIKE A LOTION MINUS THE FEELING OF A HEAVY OR EVEN LIGHT LOTION . I USED TO USE A PRODUCT BY SOTHY 'S FOR MY DAILY MOISTURIZER , BUT THIS HAS TAKEN ITS PLACE . YOU LIGHTLY `` MIST '' YOUR FACE AFTER CLEANSING AND GENTLY PAT INTO THE SKIN.THIS IS A MUST HAVE , NO MATTER IF YOU ARE OLD OR YOUNG -LRB- AND I 'M YOUNG -RRB- .
 I have dry sensitive skin , so am hesitant to use a regular toner , yet I still get pimples , so sometimes need something extra . I am an addict for Yonka products and also use their day lotion , night creme , eye contour , hydration mask , and fruit peel ... their products are excellent ! Gentle but extremely effective . This toner is perfect . I spray on a cotton square after washing , and before my creme , and it cleans up any extra goop without any drying at all !!! Try it , and it will be your toner for life !
 I first learned about this product in one of my recent Living magazine issues . Apparently , Martha Stewart uses this on the set whenever she needs an added touch of hydration and moisture . So , what 's good enough for Martha is good enough for me . Well , it 's absolutely FANTASTIC ! I leave the bottle on my desk at work and whenever I need a touch of hydration and moisture , I give myself a spritz ! I look forward to using this product and trying other Yonka products as well ! -RRB- for a very long time . Highly recommend it to those that travel/fly !
 for your skin . No Drying , cracking or tightness results from this able toner . Even for on the spot fixes , Yonka brings us a product that dissolves acne and speeds healing . Recommended for anyone looking for a natural product that is non-drying .
 YonKa has the best products I 've ever used ! This toner is wonderful ; very ; moisturizing , absorbs completely ; leaves skin feeling very soft and refreshed . Was leery of toners in the past as I 've found them to be drying ; but this one is wonderful . My facialist recommended this line and I 'm so glad I found it . All of YonKa 's products have a great aromatherapy benefit as well .
 I have used this lotion for 6 months now on my very dry skin , and not only is it refreshing to spray on my face , but it has a lovely , herbal scent .
 I absolutely love this toner . I use this toner twice daily and even made myself a mini spray bottle to carry with me while traveling.Finding the right toner is not always the easiest search like all beauty products considering there are So many and many of them are drying . I was using witch hazel from time to time to cut cost in effect which the alcohol in it would dry out my skin causing acne an fine lines . This product is very healing and refreshing . I have noticed my larger pores shrink and tighten . I am pleased with this product .
 Have used Yonka products for the past five years and absolutely love it . The Yonka lotion is a very mild astringent , but because it is alcohol free , it does not dry out your skin - feels awesomely refreshing .
 the next best thing when ya simply cant wash your hair the everyday way ... two thumbs up for this product
 If you are frustrated with fog and have tried all sorts of mask positioning tricks , forget it . These are the only things that really work . Adhesive is annoying at first , but easy to get used to when you realize how well these work . Encourage your hospital to stock these .
 This is the best ! I search the world for safe lotions to use . I love this one , it smells good and it works .
 Like all Yonka products , this is high quality and works incredibly well . Follow it up with Yonka Vital Defense . You 'll be really pleased with the results .
 MY HAIR TEXTURE HAS CHANGED OVER TIME DUE TO HAIR COLORING , AGE , AND MEDICATIONS I TAKE . HOWEVER , I HAVE USED THIS HAIR PRODUCT PANTENE RESTORATIVE LOTION FOR YEARS NOW . IT IS A GREAT PRODUCT THAT ADDS MOISTURE AND SHINE TO YOUR HAIR , MAKES IT LESS FRIZZY . I LOVE IT . I HAVE TRIED OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS BUT ALWAYS COME BACK TO THIS PRODUCT . I GIVE IT A FIVE AND I GIVE AMAZON A FIVE FOR THEIR SPEEDY SERVICES IN DELIVERING ANY PRODUCT OR ITEM I HAVE ORDERED .
 I mix a dot of this shadow with a dot of Urban Decay shadow base -LRB- has a tiny bit of shimmer -RRB- . Then tap , tap , tap it onto eyelids and blend it a bit . Stays all day , no creasing , no crepe ! Hard to find , but cream shadow is the best . Add darker and/or lighter colors of powder shadow with a brush and you are set - day into night ! Removes with soap and water or remover ... not stubborn !
 Unlike a lot of astringents , this is a `` toner '' with little or no alcohol , so there 's no need to rinse off after application . It 's meant to be left on . I have combination skin , that tends to get a little dry in the winter -LRB- as a man who shaves , I need to moisturize after shaving in the morning -RRB- , and this toner miraculously treats my face properly after washing at night , before bedtime -- no moisturizer required . It has a pleasant , unobtrusive fragrance , too -LRB- sort of citrus-y , but not overpowering -RRB- . -LRB- For summer , I useZia 's Ultimate Toning Mist for Normal/Oily Skinwhich goes on a bit lighter , better suited for warm , humid summer nights . -RRB- Sometimes in winter I 'll follow this up with Zia Herbal Moisture Gel -LRB- which I think they 've discontinued -RRB- , an oil-free gel that does a fantastic treat for my skin , repairing the damage of shaving and exposing my face to winter winds.The sprayer is very effective , easy to spritz just enough on your face and conserve the toner.The price may seem a little high for 4 oz , but this is Good Stuff , lasts a while since you 're only misting it on your face , and comes in a very attractive glass bottle . I 'm pleased to find it on Amazon as the local , affordable `` health food '' chains have suspended carrying Zia . If you have skin that 's sensitive to other astringents , give this a try .
 Zia 's `` Ultimate Toning Mist for Normal/Oily Skin '' is the first item in the Zia line that I 've purchased , and if the quality of the purchase is any indication , I 'll be researching and buying other items from their line , as well!I was looking for an anti-oxidant for my skin . My search led me to Zia 's product.Zia mixes lycopene with vitamins and alpha lipoic acid . Their blend comes in a spray mist that has a light citrus scent . Zia claims that it will refresh and control oil while firming skin and refining pores . I 'm just ordered my third bottle on my one year anniversary with the product . I can tell you that using the mist makes me feel incredibly refreshed -- the directions call for you to apply to face and throat , and then follow with moisturizer while your face is still damp , helping to smooth the flow of moisturizer to skin . I can seriously say that I 've had no oil control problems with my face -LRB- under foundation or without -RRB- using Zia 's mist than before.Does it firm skin ? Prevent wrinkles ? Hard to say ; I ca n't really claim that , but I can tell you that , at nearly 50 , I 've actually had compliments on the appearance and texture of my skin from friends ; and this is the first time that ever happened !
 Unlike a lot of astringents , this is a `` toner '' with little or no alcohol , so there 's no need to rinse off after application . It 's meant to be left on . I have combination skin , that tends to get a little dry in the winter -LRB- as a man who shaves , I need to moisturize after shaving in the morning -RRB- , but in summertime I do n't need to moisturize as much , and this formulation is better suited to my complexion during the humid Southern summers . -LRB- For winter , I useZia 's Ultimate Toning Mist for Normal/Dry Skinwhich is not quite as astringent and light as this formulation . -RRB- It has a pleasant , unobtrusive fragrance , too -LRB- sort of citrus-y , but not overpowering -RRB- . The sprayer is very effective , easy to spritz just enough on your face and conserve the toner.The price may seem a little high for 4 oz , but this is good stuff , lasts a while since you 're only misting it on your face , and comes in a very attractive glass bottle .

 This is a great product although I much prefer the Daytime Renewl which contains a hexapeptide that is reasonably priced incomparson to similar products out there . This product is heavy in anti-oxidents andreally does appear to make a difference . Price wise Amazon is verycompetitive , the shipping was very slow
 Zia has some good products . I tried the oil-free moisturizer because I have combination skin and most moisturizers tend to give me a shiny forehead . The Zia doe n't give me much shine and is also good for the dryer areas of my face . During the winter , I do use a heavier moisturizer on my dryer areas as the Zia is too light for those areas but still does a fine job on my oilier areas.It 's light and absorbs easily . The fragrance is very light and good for men . The ingredients list is good.The downside is that it 's a little pricy for what you get . Better priced than some , more expensive than others .
 Oil containing products make me break out so I 've always had to use one of the much less common oil-free mositurizers . After a few weeks of using the Zia , I was astonished at how much happier and youthful my skin looked . It absorbs well and I do n't feel anything on my skin once it 's in . In winter I sometimes have to reapply a little at night . It does n't have sunscreen . It 's not inexpensive , but it 's worth it for the result . Zia has come out with new product lines since this one and I 've tried a few and they 're good overall as a brand . This particular product is magical as far as my face is concerned and I hope they never discontinue it .
 I resent the requirement of twenty more words to say that this is an excellent moisturizer ! However , it is . So there !!!
 I ca n't use any products with oils , and this is the only oil-free natural moisturizer that I have tried that I like . It makes my skin soft and hydrated and looks great under make-up . Love it !
 I bought this lotion -LRB- from another website -RRB- because it contains alpha lipoic acid , one of my favorite anti-aging skincare ingredients . The lotion is lightweight , refreshing , neither oily nor overly dry after it absorbs into the skin , & the light citrusy scent is uplifting & enjoyable . I like the good ingredients in this lotion -LRB- except for the parabens ! -RRB- . Two ounces lasts a really long time for me because I use this primarily as a hand lotion at work rather than for my face , though sometimes I use it on my face too if it feels particularly parched.The bottle is great packaging too - frosted glass pump bottle that can be reused , & the dispenser swivels open/closed so there 's no extra cap needed . I got this for $ 22 just 3 months ago & suddenly I see that the price jumped $ 5 - $ 6 at the place from where I bought this - that 's disappointing ! But I like the lotion enough to likely repurchase even at the higher price -LRB- though unhappily -RRB- .
 I have tried a LOT of oil-free moisturizers , and this is my fave . It sinks right in and leaves my skin nice and moisturized with no extra shine . This is my winter moisturizer for my allover oily skin .
 I have been sampling serums and moisturizers and I find myself comparing whatever I 'm trying to this moisturizer every time . Is it better than the Zia one ? No ? I 'll pass . When they say ` oil free ' they mean it . This is a super lightweight serum consistency and absorbs immediately . Does n't leave a film or creamy oily feeling sitting on my skin . The citrusy scent is nice . This is perfect for my combination skin during spring , summer and fall . I do sometimes need a thicker moisturizer during winter , as this will not touch the flakes . The price for this is just fine - I would even pay more for it because its so great . If they could improve on it at all , it would be removing or replacing the parabens in it .
 This is a great all-natural , organic face moisturizer , and I love that it does n't clog pores but still keeps my skin from getting to dried out . It even works pretty well through the winter , although if you have drier skin , you may wish to switch to a heavier product in the winter . Also , this has a nice , light scent . I 'm very pleased with Zia products in general . They 're a bit pricey compared to non-organic products , but for organic products they 're pretty reasonable and very high quality .
 I just love this product . It looks like it would be greasy but it 's not . It soaks into my skin instantaneously and does n't leave an oil slick like many others do . The pikake scent transports me right back to Maui -- absolutely heavenly . I highly recommend this product .
 Love the silky feeling it leaves on your skin and the light fragrance that does n't overwhelm . I try to never run out of it .
 Amazing face wash ! Super gentle , but leaves my face completely clean . I have sensitive skin , but I 've had no problems at all with this product . Does n't dry out my skin either .
 This is THE best body cream I have ever used ! It leaves your skin so soft and makes you feel so good , and of course the gardenia scent is one of my favorites so that is an extra bonus . When you apply this , your skin soaks it up like a sponge , and used every night it will soften any rough spot - even your heels ! Absolutely wonderful !!
 Rich cream that has a wonderful gardenia scent but minus a point coz it has parabens in it ! I would have thought a company like this would be paraben free .
 This is the BEST product for skin that I have ever used . It is wonderful on your face , as well as any other part of your body that you want to use it on . I swim a lot and am in the sun , and this keeps my skin from being dry . If I could , I would just bathe in it !!!
 I love this scent . I have worn it for a long time . I love the purse size . I 've only had the bigger sizes before now
 My sister was the first one to have it , and once I smelled it on her I had to have it
 Many women 's perfumes or parfum 's smell similar to lysol.This , however , is a beautifully bottled scent that glistens a virtual bouquet when smelledyou wont be sorryMen , get it for yours . You 'll be adored for it!highly reccomendenjoy
 This scent is very reminiscent ofDolce and Gabana 's Light Blue it 's a little sweeter just as fresh but has a lingering bitter dry down ... The bottle is very cute I gave it too my sister I do n't think it agrees with my chemistry
 Have you ever had a wall-mounted hair dryer ? This is great ! I will never have any other style hair dryer again !
 Wall mounted dryer was easy to install , and it works great ! It does n't take up too much room on the wallI and I also like the night light .
 I did my research and this came as advertisted . Mounting was easy . My wife loves not having to put away the old one .
 Works great . Drys fast . No more cords all over my counter . Great value for the money . Conair has always been reliable for me so that 's why I choose that brand .
 Love this wall mounted compact hairdryer , it does n't take up much room on the wall and has plently of power on high , and just enough power on low , love the built in night light . Quick delivery , powerful item for being compact , would recommend this hairdryer if you want a wall mounted one like in the hotels .
 I have installed several wall mount dryers in the past . Conair was easy and has a moderate noise level . It took all of ten minutes to mount on the wall . Consider this dryer that is used by Motels ... must be a REASON ! : - -RRB-
 This hair dryer is great ! It is light weight and dries my hair very quickly . It was easy to install , too . The nightlight did not work on the hair dryer I purchased , but that does n't affect the quality of the hairdryer .
 Hi , I 'm ordering this dryer based on the reviews , but I thought I might mention that there are other Conair 134R listings on Amazon at various prices.The other listings are treated as separate products by Amazon even with their own -LRB- positive -RRB- reviews.So be sure to check the other listings as the prices can be much better .
 My last two Conair wall-mount blow dryers were quality products that lasted about 12 years each . I 'm not expecting any less with my third .
 This product has my full recommendation . All the features are user friendly . The night light is an added feature that has now replaced an old night light in the bathroom . The temperature of the hair dryer isneither to hot or to cool -LRB- kinda like the porage the 3 bears told about in their story -RRB- . My Conair is a replacement dryer and if something were to happen to the dryer I would not hesitate to purchase another one .
 This is just what we have been looking for . We ordered another one for our new house -LRB- left our last one when we sold our house -RRB- and it was too big . This is very compact and works great . Now if you had really long hair you probably would n't like it . Only two heat settings which is fine for us . Shuts off automatically when you hang up . Reasonably priced .
 We had been looking for a wall mount unit for a while and this one is exactly what we needed . Sturdy wall mount will make sure it does n't come crashing down after daily use of removing the dryer . Just like a hotel bathroom only better ...
 I LOVE this hair dryer , and I do n't have to worry about knocking it off where I keep it like I did my other hair dryer .
 I needed a wall mounted hair dryer and this one fitys the bill . It 's not as powerful as some free standing -LRB- low speed almost too low , high speed is about normal -RRB- but it does the job when the kids/grandkids come visiting . AND , it dries hair !
 NICE HAIRDRYER ... WORKS WELL AND MEETS MY NEEDS . THE ONY THING IS THE NIGHTLIGHT IT HAS DOESN ; T REALLY ILLUMINATE ANYTHING , SO IT DOESN ; T REALLY SERVE IT 'S PURPOSE ... OTHER THAN THAT ... NO COMPLAINTS & iexcl ;
 I love my wall mount hairdryers ! I 1st discovered them when staying at the Sheraton Waikiki and had to have one . I now have one in every bathroom = `` s 3 ! They are especially nice for guest bathrooms because they are out in plain sight for use . They also have plenty of blowing power -LRB- 1600V -RRB- , they are quiet , do n't take up room , they have a night light and they are very easy to install .
 This is a very good wall mount dryer that takes up very little space and works well on all hair styles .
 Super product . Used one in a Holiday Inn Epress motel recently and tried to buy one at the motel but they were out . I got on the internet when returning from our vacation and found the same one that we liked at the motel . We tried to find it in various stores while on vacation to no avail . In fact , not many stores even offer wall mount hair dryers . This one also has a night light that comes on automatically when the lights are out . The 1600 watts drys the hair real fast .
 I have had this same model for the past 7 or 8 years . When my old one died , I had been so happy with it , that I replaced it with the same product . It is a great dryer . It dries my hair quickly , fits nicely in my hand , and is compact enough that it does n't take up too much space on the wall . I love the nightlight feature . I would definitely recommend this product !
 After having gone through 3 models of a competing brand over a period of 4 years -LRB- the last of which lasted only 2 months -RRB- , I decided it was time to find a different manufacturer . My need was for a wall mounted unit , similar to those found in most motels . While there are a number of manufacturers for hand held dryers , wall mounted options are limited.The Conair installed easily - but I substituted molly bolts for the mounts included in the package . The result is a very strong installation , but the supplied mounting options might also have worked as well.To keep the cord out of the way , I wrap it around the wall mount.I have had the dryer for 3 months and it is working fine . It has 2 speeds - both of which satisfy my needs.There is a night light feature that some will find to be of value - it goes off when you turn on a light or when the daylight is sufficient.So far , I think I have found the answer to my need for a wall mount dryer - and if it lasts for a number of years , I know I have .
 This is a great hair dryer and it is nice and compact . Easy to install . If you like the ones at the finer motels you will love this one . Also has a night light .
 This hair dryer by Conair is really great . The handle is easy to hold onto and it dries my hair fast after I get out of the shower . The nightlight is a plus but really for me the hair dryer itself is what counts . It 's not too noisy ; fits well in its wall mounted holder and the cord , if you wish , allows you to move it around somewhat without having to change wall outlets.Installation was a breeze ; and this has worked well for some time now . I highly recommend this hair dryer .
 I purchased this hair dryer month ago for my wife who was looking for wall mounted model like what she used to have when being in hotels . I made a search and ended up with this Conair model based on features , performance and customer reviews . Now she is asking me to order another one for the kids bathroom .
 I had one of these in my master bath in my prior house . Loved it . Could n't find it anywhere but Amazon . Just recently purchased and just waiting to get it up . Works well and quickly . And best of all , it 's on the wall . Not on my counter and not in my cabinet and not in a drawer . It is there and handy when I need it . Would recommend for anyone with quick and simple hairstyles .
 I have been wanting one of these for a long time . The price was right so I decided to order it . So glad I did . The wall mounting was super easy - not many tools required and it was installed in less than 5 mins ! I like the night light feature . It 's not too bright - just enough light . It 's powerful enough to dry my hair fast without damaging it . I love home nice it is to have easy access to it without it being on the counter . Very happy !
 My wife loves the convenience of having it next to the bathroom mirror . Easy to install , attractive , and takes up very little space .
 This cream is very light and not greasy or oily . It hydrates the skin without feeling like your wearing a heavy moisturizer
 I am 42 and have sensitive dry combination skin . I have dry patches in the summer and my face actually chaps in the winter . I have tried everything from exfoliation and cleansers to moisturizers and creams . This product is the only I have found in all my years that can renew my skin and keep it healthy looking . I use it daily through the year and as a night cream as needed in the winter . I can not say enough about this effective light and clean hydrator .
 Even though the price is high , it probes to be a good product . My wife is quite pleased with it .
 Excellent products . Why are they so hard to find on store shelves ? Wal * Mart and K-Mart , Bed Bath & Beyond , and other related stores take heed !
 I love these braided mesh bath straps . They do a great job of exfoliating the skin while getting to the hard places on your body -- like your back , etc. . They 're hard to find in the stores -LRB- at least the ones I 've been in -RRB- and you ca n't beat the price . It 's a no-brainer in my opinion . I 'm very happy with the product .
 i have purchased a similar bath strap to this before and liked it enoughto try and replace it . I could not find it at the time so I ordered bath strapsthat were different . I ended up throwing them away because they wereunsatisfactory . I gave up for some time then tried again . This time I foundthese that are much like the ones I liked . They turned out to be not onlymuch better but less expensive too . I love these .
 I remember these items from childhood , but could not locate anything like this locally . Great little tool !
 Gave this as a gift . They said they liked it . I bought an extra of the glycerine soap and it smells nice .
 The odor on this one is really good , i bought as a present for my husband and he love it , really.The price is good , as well as the free shipping .
 This is a very interesting scent with cinnamon & cherry notes that are sweet smelling . Men that do not like sweet-smelling fragrances , will not like this . It is also more of a young person 's fragrance . It has good longevity , but the scent does not develop much . This would be more of an autumn or winter scent . However , overall it is a great value for Amazon 's price .
 Fragrance is ok . Good for daily use . Not overpowering . Subtle.Does not smell like a good expensive men 's cologne . Average .
 Product came very quickly and was exactly what I was looking for . Have n't seen this cologne in many years on our local store shelves or drugstores . The 15 year old bottle that I had still smelled exactly like the one that I received .
 just got this colone and it smells great !!! for the price you ca n't beat it . if you do n't have a lot of money to spend and want to smell good , this ones for you !!! will be checking out more of their products . thanks ...
 This is the best curl activator out there . I love it . My hair curls , holds its curl , and keeps its curl all day long . It is a little sticky at first but what I do is spray my hair , curl it , let it sit while I curl all my hair then run a brush through it or my fingers and it takes the sticky , strong feeling out while holding my curls in .
 Skin by Alison Raffaele makes one of the best concealers on the market . It 's smooth and creamy with a high concentration of pigment . It provides great , smooth coverage , even when applied sparingly.Also , try her foundation sponges for perfect application of liquid foundation .
 Samba has been my choice of cologne since receiving as a gift 25 years ago . My sons have started using more so I got them their own bottles . Clean scent , not overpowering , long lasting .
 Its great , If this is the only way that I can purchase Samba then I will . I have love this cologne for year , and you can not find it in any store .
 Been using it for a long time , is a very sweet smell that is very pleasant , i recomended to anyone !!!
 This is a cologne that is light and sweat but , not overpowering , Good for everyday . It is hard to find in departement stores , except occaisonaly in discount outlets . Not expensive but , does not last as long as some more expensive colognes .
 I was happy to find this Samba online for my boyfriend . It smells wonderful on him . Not overpowering and very sexy with his chemistry . I am going to order a few more bottles to have on hand .
 I used to love this scent when I was in my early 20s and then it became almost impossible to find at any retail store . I was super happy to find it here and glad I have one bottle now that will last me a good time . One of my favorites with a mix of citrus and spices - uplifting scent . Greatly recommended .
 Really ca n't go wrong with this one right here . Been wearing this for years . It 's basically the swiss army knife of my cologne selection . Perfect for any season and weather . Perfect for any occasion ; formal , informal , and casual . Also with this one you do n't have to worry about over-applying . You can put it all over your upper , and it might come off strong for the first 5 min , but it 'll wear down to a light aura that you can be confident in . Also , this one does n't seem to be too common in the states ; unlike cool water , curve , aspen , burberry , jovan , hollister , hummer , calvin klein , etc. . So you should n't have to worry about smelling like someone 's ex . For whatever reason this fragrance was popular in Puerto Rico from what I could tell , but I 'm no expert on trends and all that . I just know the smell of a decent cologne and when it 's appropriate . So if you 're like me ; style is young and fresh 365 days out of the year , your game is natural , and your personality stands out more than your appearance ; then this cologne is right up your alley .
 This is the cologne I wore in high school -LRB- 15 + years ago -RRB- . It has a clean , sweet smell and will last all night . I promise . I do n't know why this scent never really caught on , but every time I wore it out somewhere , the girls would inevitably ask what it was . It 's very distinctive - in a good way !
 My mom wore this cologne for about the last 10 years of her life . Her clothing was saturated with it and its scent still triggers memories of her . I was n't sure it would work for me , either emotionally or physiologically , but I have come to love it as much as she did , and I have gotten several compliments from strangers in stores when wearing it . It is sweet and old-fashioned , and very long lasting -LRB- at least for me -RRB- . Also the amount you get for the price is a true bargain these days .
 My mother was so surprised that I had been able to find her favorite perfume . I was delighted by the good value.Thank you !
 The scent is very nice and reminds me of Charles Of The Ritz Original which is n't made anymore . It 's not exactly the same but it is close .
 I have had a hard time finding this parfume and now order it faithfully.Great buy . Nice fragance . Cross between a floral and a musk.Lighter than obsession .
 I read somewhere at Raffine fragrance was for `` mature '' women . I guess that means I 'm an old fuddy , duddy , but I do n't care . This is a wonderful , but little known fragrance that has been around since the 1980 's . It is hard to find and I 'm afraid they may be discontinuing it but my sister and I love it . It is spicy and woodsy . I always get compliments when I wear it . It arrived super fast , was packed well and was exactly as described .
 I 've been wearing Raffinee for years and to this day , I 'm still getting comments . I love it . It cost more at stores . That 's why I order it online and you ca n't beat the price .
 I was introduced to the fragrance many years ago by my sister-in-law . I thought it was such a soft and alluring fragrance that I started using it . I have gotten so many nice comments from people . The main thing is that it has never changed in its fragrance . I was so fortunate to find it listed on AMAZON , and at the fairest price I ever bought it at . Thanks AMAZON for making it available to me at the price you had it marked . I have ordered from AMAZON throughout the years and have NEVER been disappointed in what I received .
 This item arrived just as described in the review . It was purchased for my mother to replace an old bottle she enjoyed .
 I could not believe how fast this item arrived ! My Mom absolutely loved her perfume that I gave her for Christmas .
 Raffinee is an amazing spray ! The smell is intoxicating and I getcompliments everywhere I go ! I 've had men ask me the name of it , howto spell it and who makes it ! One gentleman actually told me that hewould have to tell his wife about Raffinee ! Ladies , I 'm serious , thisfragrance is the bomb ! Even had women come to me and ask me what I waswearing ! Raffinee is always going to be included in my fragrance collection!Sincerely , A Raffinee Fan !!!!!!!! Thanks to Amazon.com also !
 I bought this for a dear friend who mentioned to me that this perfume was no longer available . Imagine her screams of delight when I gave this to her . Thank you so much !!! Fast Delivery !
 Bought this `` unsmelled '' from Amazon.The scent out of the bottle is pretty sweet/floral -- but it mellows out after a bit -LRB- as scents tend to do -RRB- into a nice , lingering floral with some hints of spice .
 Oh my goodness . This is definitely a french perfume ... very sultry . Expect tons of compliments from everyone ... I think this is my favorite perfume for a night out or a black tie affair ... oh yes ! Oolala girls . . buy this one .
 This is the best product I 've ever used for my face.The cleanser contains a toner , which helps keep your pores smaller and leaves your skin feeling great -LRB- not oily -RRB- . The scent is light and not overpowering like some other products . So over time , you really do n't get tired of it.It is rather pricy , but it does n't take much . The directions indicate that you only use a drop the size of a pearl , and my experience is that it is enough .
 Be careful if you have an allergy to Ragweed . This cleanser has chamomile extract which is in the same family as ragweed . Made my face itchy and red . Other than that I liked the product .
 As far as face SCRUBS goes , This is the best on the market . It 's not too harsh , has just enough grit to get the job done , and if you leave it on your face for a bit you 'll feel the menthol soothing your skin.I 've been using it for years . I 've tried a number of others , but keep coming back to this .
 Man in my life loves this . He is n't a `` product '' person , so it must be excellent for him to like it .
 At last , a facial cleanser for REAL men ... guys who enjoy the odd beer and who reject the Hollywood-look of those hairless , over-pampered , pretty-boy millionaires.Occasionally , we too want to hydrate and tone our skin -LRB- provided that all surfactants are sulfate-free -RRB- without our women-folk accusing of us of going soft . Now , thanks to the terminally hilarious , breath-takingly handsome guitarist of international acclaim , we can.More than ever I want to embrace the chubby frame of the fat funster himself , Mr Jack Black , and express my gratitude by kissing him all over his body in ... er , ... a manly but not ... y' know , er , in a. . . gay sort of way .
 Used to buy sponges like this at local stores . For some reason they all stopped carrying it and started carrying more natural looking sponges . They are all courser and fall apart after a couple of weeks of use . This sponge lasts for months and is much softer . Great sponge .
 Ca n't say enough good things about this bath sponge . I 'd been buying them in the stores and all of a sudden could n't find them anymore . They are a great size , lather well , and have a great surface for cleansing as well as exfoliating the body - soft but not too soft to exfoliate .
 This item is getting harder to find even on the internet . I prefer them over the more common mesh ones found today .
 I have used this product before ; and , have been unable to find them until I came to this website.I will more than likely purchase more if they still have them here.The speed in which I received said item was excellent.Thanks for such a great product and great service .
 Tough and durable comes in a package of three . Soft on the skin and dries out fairly quickly .
 I have been looking for sponges like this in stores and could not find one anywhere . This sponge holds together , where others fall apart after using a couple of times . Great product !
 Just what I was looking for.I have used this product in the past , but could not find in my local market anymore . I am very pleased .
 After looking in every store I could think of for these sponges , I thought I would have to give up . I even tried other types and most were too scratchy . And I really dislike those nylon puff balls . Pretty as they are they just are n't my cup of tea . So I was thrilled , actually , to find these at Amazon . They are exactly what I was looking for . Thanks !
 Like several had said , I ca n't find sponges like this in stores anywhere ... only the `` natural '' sponges or plastic loofas . Anything close is garbage ; the last one I found at a grocery store fell apart within months . This , on the other hand , is hands down the best shower sponge I 've ever had . It holds soap far better than my last one , so I go through less bar soap as a result . It 's very soft as well . I 've been using it for a few months , and it has held up very well ... the pack of three should last me a long time .
 this is exactly what i was looking for in all sorts of stores . seriously , I do not understand why you ca n't find these anymore .
 I have used these sponges in the past , and then could n't find them in stores anymore . I was thrilled to find them online , and they are just as good as I remember . For anyone who prefers a real bath sponge , these are the ones . With a pack of three , I know they will last me for years .
 Delivery time exceeded expectations . I have purchased the product before and it performs as expected .
 THE SIZE OF THE SPONGE IS A LITTLE LARGER THAN I LIKE , BUT IT HOLDS A LOT OF SUDS . I WILL BUY THESE AGAIN IN THE FUTURE . I ONLY USE WASH RAGS FOR SHAVING .
 I like this for use daily to feel very clean without drying or making my skin irritated . Last a long time if you watch how you squize it out . It will come out to fast if you hold it up and down .
 This face cream is amazing ! I have been using for about a month and put it on first , before any other products , in the morning and evening . It has cleared up my mild acne and leaves my skin fresh , soft and clear in the morning . I can not say enough about this product it is really wonderful .
 Herzoz makes wonderful products that really do change the way your skin acts and looks . Oxygen is great for skin . This product stands up to its reputation .
 I figured that maybe LUSH would have something for my super-dry , very finicky sensitive over-35 skin . I picked this up on a whim with very few expectations but I have to say that my skin is smoother , super-soft , comfortable , no tightness at all . My makeup just glides on the morning ! In three months of using this as a night cream , my skin has n't broken out once , my redness has subsided , my skin tone has improved , flakiness has disappeared and even the wrinkles on my forehead have softened somewhat.I will say that it is greasy going on and leaves my face feeling slick for quite a while afterwards . As I use this only at night , this does n't bother me at all . The colour and smell are kind of like peanut butter at first , from the sesame oil I expect , but then this is a natural prodouct mainly . The texture is super-creamy -- think tahini.I do n't like the LUSH packaging for their skincare - cheap paper-plastic bendy tub with a cheap plastic lid like on a margarine container . The lid does n't go on properly after a few uses and I 've ended up depotting it to something nicer with a better lid . Despite this , I will repurchase this often .
 I started having problems with dry skin many years ago and it was starting to seem as though nothing would work until I discovered Skin Drink Moisturizer from LUSH . Within weeks my skin no longer had dry patches or scaliness and my skin was absolutely glowing ! I have tried other more expensive products and this continues to beat all of them !
 I like this product . It is very smooth and sure helps with the dryness . I would order it again .
 What cold weather does to my skin should be a sin . Unfortunately , it 's not -LRB- at least it 's not listed on any of the shalt-not rosters that I 've come across -RRB- . So , without the help of a higher authority I 've done battle on my own . Need I add what you already know ? It was a losing skirmish until Lush Skin Drink.Slathering on heavy moisturizers -LRB- all that promised to soothe and smooth -RRB- only resulted in excessive oiliness or a dreaded break-out . Wearing a scarf over my face when facing blustery winds made crossing streets problematic.Skin Drink to the rescue ! This moisturizer has all the necessities to revive dry skin but proportionately so that it is light and quickly absorbed . For me , it has protected and hydrated.Just added this to my already long list of Lush ca n't - do-withouts . - Gail Cooke
 My face gets really dry sometimes because I wash it too much or it 's cold outside and the air 's dry but I do n't have to worry about that at all . I do n't even need that much just a couple drops because it 's a really thick and quality moisturizer . And it smells good , it smells like roasted almonds and avocados . Which I like because it 's more natural and organic like that .
 I have very bad skin and as a result I have to use lots of moisturizer . I have tried plenty of other moisturizers and this one is the best . I live in Florida and so I care about how the moisturizer reacts under heat . With most moisturizers the moisturizer will show up clearly on your face and can be awkward . This moisturizer does n't do that . It is not too thick -LRB- think Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Moisturizer -RRB- and not too thin . It also seems to be organic , which is nice . It 's does n't have an annoyingly strong smell like many moisturizers . For full disclosure , I am a guy and do n't usually spend a lot on moisturizers . This is the most expensive moisturizer I have ever bought , so maybe it should n't come as a surprise that it 's also the best .
 I have to say , as an esthetician , I really LOVE this facial moisturizer . LOVE IT.I 've tried many very expensive creams and this one is great . You can not beat the value.I have normal to dry skin . This is a very hydrating cream which I use sparingly at night and in the morning . If you have more of a normal complexion , you can still use this , only use less and on always apply to damp skin.Excellent hydration and pure , natural ingredients . -LRB- have you read the ingredients in your products lately ?? ... if you can not pronounce them , you probably might want to stay away from them since many times they are petroleum-based . -RRB- We are lucky to have a few Lush stores in the Minneapolis area.I suggest this product , or for very-dry skin , they have a great one called `` Skin Nanny '' . Try it ... use it on damp skin -LRB- do n't need much -RRB- and I also use a bit more around my eye area.So far this is the best moisturizer I 've found and is great for sensitive skin .
 This is the only moisturizer I 've found that gets me through dry alpine winters . It 's really amazing and works great - which makes up for the so-so scent .
 I have fair , extremely sensitive skin prone to flaky bouts of eczema . Most moisturizers actually sting and/or trigger my skin problems . This product is one of the very few that does not . I actually think it is reducing the frequency of flare-ups . It goes on smooth and cool and you can practically hear your skin sigh with relief . Results-wise , my skin absolutely does look -LRB- and feel -RRB- younger and more even-toned , with no flaky or zitty patches . A little goes a long way , too . I 'll buy this product again and again .
 I have been on the search for a pure vanilla smelling natural lotion FOREVER ... i finally found it . It smells AMAZING !!! I get sooooo many compliments ... people always think there are cookies near by when they smell it on me.It goes on smooth , not sticky ... and keeps my skin hydrated , soft and smelling AWESOME all day.I will be buying this till the end of time .
 I really like this stuff ! It smells like sugar cookies to me . It is the best smelling vanilla around by far . I have tested so many vanilla scents VS , Bed , bath and beyond , body shop , Aqualina , Lanilla ; all which smell either too powerful or grandma-ish . NOt this stuff , it is so light and sweet . I so wish they made a perfume .
 My daughter 's favorite body butter and now ... it 's hard to find . I bought it for her birthday . She was ecstatic.Nothing quite smells like Lalicious !
 This body butter is the BEST I 've ever tried , and I 've tried a lot . It 's truly like cream . It goes on smooth and makes your skin so soft . I love the vanilla scent . I 've also tried the coconut , which happens to be my favorite , but this is a great one too . This is by far the best body lotion EVER .
 I first tried the white ginger perfume when my mother in law brought some as a gift for me from Hawaii . I love it and so does my daughter . Over the years we 've tried a variety of TerraNova products and have been impressed with each and every one . Their lotions leave your skin particularly soft . My mother in law passed away about 8 years ago and every Christmas we order a variety of TerraNova procucts to make her a part of our holidays .
 This fragrance is already deservedly well-praised on sites such as Perfume Smellin ' Things , I Smell Therefore I Am , and Basenotes . There 's little I can add , but I 'll summarize
 I decided to try this after using `` pink sugar '' for years . I love this perfume and get tons of compliments on it , just like pink sugar . Some of my friends have purchased their own bottles . It is sweet , but not sickly sweet . Do n't buy it if you dont like smelling like food . People tell me I smell like brownies all the time , which is fine by me . I ca n't wait too see what they will create next !
 LOVE Deci Dela ; it is probably my favorite fragrance , and one that had been quickly discontinued by the time I got around to trying to buy some after using up a unsolicited department store sample I received in the mail . I never forgot it and finally located some Cheaper online at Thefragrancefactory.com
 It really works . Took about 6 mths for me and the veins around my nose are so much better . I use way less makeup now to cover them up.To make it work
 I bought this product with a healthy dose of skepticism as you usually do n't see much results from any beauty products and I had tried other brands for the couple of little broken capillaries near my eye . I know this is going to sound crazy , but within 3 days I saw the largest one start to decrease . I 've only been using it for two weeks , but I can definitely tell that it has been decreasing steadily every day that I use it . I 'm putting it on twice a day and super happy . It has n't removed them completely yet , but it says to give something like 2-6 weeks to work -LRB- do n't remember exactly -RRB- , so maybe it will . Either way , my skin seems happy about it , and it 's less obvious so that 's good.I recommend it !
 I 'm on my third jar . Works great ! I use to do IPL treatments every six months , but no more ! I use this cream twice a day . It did take about two months for the first jar to work , so be patient .
 Derma E Clear Vein Creme works well to heal bruises quickly.I have n't found it to make spider veins disappear , but I think it reduces some of the discomfort from them , and continue to use it for both purposes .
 I have used Jurlique Moisture Replenishing Day Cream for over 10 years and my skin CAN NOT survive without it . I use other products from Jurlique and have never been unhappy . My skin truly is for the better and never has been irritated or clogged from it . This is a very rich thick moisturizing cream . If it were possible I would swim in this cream , my skin loves it so much . Enjoy ! Also - great price !!!
 I love this moisturizer !!! I have been using it for years . My skin drinks it in and feels so soft . I love that it has so many natural ingredients . It smells really nice , too . It does have these little grit-like bead things in it , but you can mash them with your fingers and they become cream . I really love finding it for cheaper than where I usually get it !
 The best . My favorite . Love this product . I tend to have dry skin and this is the most nurturing , moisturizing face cream I have found . Leaves a beautiful glow too . Highest rating !
 I swear by Jurlique and have been a devotee since 2000 . So , last winter , when my face became very dry due to an extreme weather change , I purchased this cream and their rosewater balancing mist to help remedy the situation . Needless to say , Jurlique came to my rescue and I still use this cream as part of my evening skin regimen . However , since this cream is thick I doubt I 'll be using it during the warmer months.Last thing . This cream , as some have mentioned , does have a scent but I do n't find it distracting . I actually like it because it 's a `` reminder '' of the cream 's floral ingredients.I gave this product 4 stars because of the fact that I ca n't use it all year round . Otherwise , this product is 5-star worthy .
 Although is is called `` Day Cream '' , this all natural prodjuct is a perfect facial cream after cleansing at night . I trust Jurlique products , and it was recommended to me by my dermatologist . Amazon has the best price around , and efficient delivery . If you have sentitive skin , Jurlique Moisture Replenishing Day Cream is the facial day or night cream for you .
 I LOVE LOVE LOVE Jurlique products . Especially this cream as it 's amazing !! My face turned into a nightmare after I moved to NYC and this product literally saved my face . I discovered it at a Trump Spa in Florida a few years back and have been obsessed every since ! I use this cream in the winter at night over retinol and a tiny bit in the day under Bare Escentuals makeup . A tiny bit goes a long way so you only need a drop for your whole face . If you use too much it can become overwhelming and possibly make you break out . The key is a tiny bit and it will actually clear up your skin . If you use it properly , you will literally start seeing your face glow . People ask me all the time what I use on my face and all I can say is JURLIQUE !!! I use the clarifying cream in the summer during the day and the nightcream at night . . Again , the key is moderation . .
 This cream is nice but on the thicker side . I love how it feels on my skin but I will not need to be using it daily as a night cream . It works great for dry patches anytime as well . Try this cream if you have very dry skin - you will see results immediately . I do n't care for the smell , but I do n't hate it either .
 I USE THIS PRODUCT ALL YEAR LONG IT IS THE BEST AND THE PRICE IS FABULOUS , WOULD RECOMMEND THIS FOR MEN AND WOMEN .
 I absolutely love this cream . My skin feels and stays so soft , I only wish it came in a larger container . I would recommend it to a friend , over and over again . My mom came to visit and she liked it so much she took one of mine home with her .
 This product has been out for many years and it is still the best facial cream on the market . Out performs many brands that are 3 x more expensive .
 My girlfriend told me about this cream . I have had a problem with light acne in my late 20 's due to dryness of my skin . This completely cleared my skin , gave it a glow and made my makeup look better on my face . It 's a night cream but I use it during the day as well . I was a little heavy at first , but my skin became acclimated to it and now it 's just really soft and supple . Great product and the price can not be beat !
 I 've been using Nutura since 1999 and my skin is still smooth and soft , I am 41 years old , looking good . It 's a great face cream
 I would have given it 5 starts but for the scent - I do n't like scented products on my face , but I really like how it works . The consistency is medium-weight
 I used this years ago , and now that I have found it again , I am very pleased . I love the way it makes my face feel when I apply it under makeup . And , the smell is the same as it was so long ago . Maybe it is just the nostalgia , but I love this product .
 I love this stiff . i use to sale avon and fell in love with it . it is great year round . I hate to be w/out it .
 Used by my grandmother and by my mother , I 'm never without Nurtura . It 's a wonderful night cream . Avon has many good skin care products at reasonable prices .
 I have been using this moisturizer for years . It blends into the skin and is non-greasy . An excellent facial moisturizer !
 This is a wonderful beautifying cream . I use it to blend my makeup and on my skin to soften dry skin . I get compliments when I wear it . I am not sure if it stops wrinkles , but I know it makes my makeup application go on so much better and leaves a glow to my skin . I hope Avon never stops making it .
 I 've been using this product for years and it 's the only moisturizer I would ever use on my face . I would recommend this product to others .
 I have been using this hairspray for years . Not only is it fairly inexpensive , but it gets the job done and adds shine as well . This is performance quality hairspray .
 Although this hairdryer has only to settings it is just right for drying my hair.I only use it when I am in a hurry to day my hair otherwise I let my hair dry by itself.The night light is very convenient and I have had no trouhle with it . IIt is small enough so it does not get in the way of my medicine cabinet or vanity drawers with the hanging cord .
 We were always leaving the hair dryer on the counter as it was hot and we did n't want to put it away where it might touch something . Then off we went and it sat on the counter until the next time it was needed . Drove me crazy ! Yes , I could have picked it up and put it away , but that just did n't happen most of the time.Thought if hotels had these wall mounts , then they might be available out there . We have purchased three of these for different bathrooms , had them for quite awhile now and never had an issue with them failing after a few months . Easy to mount . Alot more attractive than a dryer sitting around on a counter or taking up needed space in the small cabinet under the sink . Love the night light , it is out of the way , shuts off when you replace it , and looks attractive.Would recommend this definitely .
 This dryer works great and saves space . I have one at our home and at our Lake House . I love the night lite it has . Its easy to hang on the wall and looks nice too .
 Love these dryers ! Had one for 9 years , finally burned out . Just bought 2 more . So convenient to have it right there on the wall , and the night light is a bonus .
 This is a great Hair Dryer . I have had two of them Plenty of heat and power . Night light has night sensor . Only problem with this hair dryer is there are two tabs on the housing to turn it off automatically if you place it back while running that have broken off of both hair dryers . P > S > I always turned it off but those tabs still broke with regular use . The hair dryer will still mount but has a habit of falling easily if disturbed .
 I have had this hair dryer for 4 or 5 years now , every day use . It has worked flawlessly . The only thing is the small plastic parts that hold the hand unit in the base . After a few years they cracked and fell off.Not to despair , I just balled up a small amount of double stick clear tape & put it behind the parts . Works perfect again . I highly recommend this product .
 THis dryer is great - especially for the price . Easy to mount . Two settings High is hot and blows hard and low is significantly cooler and blows rather soft . I am not a real glam girl so the settings work for me .
 I love my new wall mounted hair dryer . It 's like being in a hotel room . I would recommend this item to anyone .
 This dryer is small and fits out of the way on the wall . This one replaces one just like it that lasted for years and years . It does a great job drying both my longer hair and my husband 's short hair .
 I bought 2 ! One for the master bath and one for the kids bath . It has helped with the clutter in the kids bathroom soooo much ! And since it 's out all the time it reminds my girls to dry their hair . I LOVE it ! I would recommend it to anybody with kids .
 Powerful & good looking wallmount hair dryer . Try different brand and still thinking Conair did a good job on this one . Easy to install , not too loud , no complain !!!
 We started using this model 10 years ago - it 's so much better than putting it in a drawer or leaving it on the counter all the time . This dryer has a night light but it 's not bright enough to be your only night light in the bathroom . We 're on our 3rd Conair wall mount dryer -LRB- all the same model -RRB- . The first one lasted about 5 years - it 's actually good for a hair dryer that gets daily use . The first one died -LRB- I contributed by not cleaning it enough -RRB- . The 2nd had a little piece of plastic that broke off in the holder - when you put the hair dryer back in the wall mount , there 's a little plastic piece that holds it in securely and that piece was damaged . # 2 lasted about 4 years , so not too bad for daily use -LRB- the dryer was fine , it was the holder -RRB- . Hopefully this lasts at least 4 years again .
 This is our second unit after 10 years of daily service . The original unit worked fine until the internal fan that pulls air through the unit shattered . We mounted a 2nd unit on the same wall bracket in about 5 seconds and are again happy campers .
 I owned this exact product for about 5 years before it `` died '' . I was pleased with its performance , so I purchased the same dryer again . My only objection was that the plastic clips which hold the dryer in place broke easily , and the part of the cord that attaches to the dryer came loose . Both of these things happened within a couple of years , but did not impair the functioning of the product .
 Works well , could have a little longer cord . the directions for mounting are like many , you have to translate a poor picture .
 We had these in our old home and left them so as not to disturb the wallpaper . We were so happy to find them again and they discounted $ 10 for buying two . That 's so great . It is awesome not to have to look for your hairdryer and put it away each time !
 I love that my hair dryer is no longer cluttering up my sink area . The cavity behind the wallmount is spacious and allows me the hide the extra power cord that I do not need . I really like the night light too . The 1600 watts may be a ittle underpowered for some but it is fine for me .
 Great little dryer . Small , light yet powerful . Easy to mount . What more can be saidabout a good product . Plan to buy a couple more for our other bathrooms aswell as a back up to keep on hand . My Wife loves it and that 's important .
 Currently on the 3rd hair dryer in 10 years so happy with product and cost is very reasonable.Availability of wallmount dryers is limited to a few models .
 After seeing one of these at a motel , decided we needed a wall mounted hair dryer . For our small bathroom , it is very convient and easy to use . Mounting was simple , all hardware provided.We liked the wall mount as it saves time not having to take a dryer out of the drawer , then out of a case and plug it in . While not as powerful as the older dryer , the time saved just taking it off the wall base and turn it on makes up for it . That 's all . Take it off , turn it all and you are receiving a blast of hot air.Another feature is that it comes with a night light that does go off when the bathroom light goes on . Would recommend this highly .
 This is the second time I 've bought this model/unit . The first one lasted over 4 years , and has seen extensive use . I stopped using the first unit when it made grating noises on high . There was never a noise on low . Dryer functionality was never compromised , but I felt a new one was the prudent course of action , and retire the old one . I would highly recommend this model . It is easy to install , convenient to use , and the nightlight is a bonus , expecially if you are prone to make nocturnal visits to bathroom in the middle of the night . It puts out very good heat , and high an low are different enough in velocity/heat to enable one to make a choice for different situations . A fine product .
 I have owned three of these wall-mounted hair dryers because they perform well and look good . The main problem I have had on EVERY one is that the small plastic side pieces that hold the dryer into the wall mount will eventually crack and break off . This will cause the dryer to no longer securely attach to the wall unit . This was mentioned by other reviewers as well , so it is definitely a design flaw . Otherwise , it is a good little appliance .
 got this Conair Wallmount hair dryer about a month ago to replace the one we had for about 15 years that finally blew up . It 's the most convenient dryer you can own . Did n't even have to replace the wall mount bracket . New unit was exactly the same as the old . But - got ta say I 'm really glad we kept the old unit . The rear filter screen on the new unit fell right off out of the box . The 2 little tabs that snap the screen onto the main housing were like melted smooth and could not be fixed . But the screen on the old unit was an exact match . So - snap-off , snap-on , and viola , back in business . Lucky for us . And Amazon . Or they 'd have to pay for an exchange . And we 'd be stuck using a clunky , 10 pound albatross dryer for bout a week or so . Amazon 's delivery was 1-2 days quicker than I expected . Good price too . Oh , the built in night light is real handy too . Worked great for at least 15 years .
 These are great . I have them in all my bed and breakfast rooms . They are enjoyed by all and used a lot . The night light is very handy also !
 As the other reviewers all said , it does work well while it lasts.Ours started overheating but I used tweezers to get all the dust out of the back . This helped for a little bit but it completely burned out . We had it about a year which is as long as the warranty is good for . : -LRB-
 This hair dryer is the same or similar to units we have used in hotels when we have traveled . It is compact but powerful . The extra feature of a night light is very nice for our home use . We have one in our master bath and our guest bath and would recommend this item to friends .
 This item is great if you have a small bathroom like I do . It hangs on the wall and is convenient . It does n't have any features and only two speeds may be a drawback for some . But that is really all I need . It has no attachments but I just use my own brush to control my hair as I blow dry .
 Great , convenient product . My husband had one and it lasted for years . He looked all over for another one , and was really happy to find this one that would fit in his small bathroom .
 I selected this modeal as I had a previous model of this same hair dryer that finally failed after a few years of good service . I purchsed the model 134R and it fit on the previous model 's base plate , so I did not have to re-mount to the wall . The light is now a LED version , which saves power but but puts out much less light than the older model - so it is not really suitable as a night light for the bathroom as the older model was -LRB- otherwise I would have given 5 stars -RRB- . The dual dryer settings are useful and the high setting is quite powerful - plenty for ay hair type in my opinoin . It is a noisy unit and can get quite warm , but performs as I expected . Overall , a good value for the money .
 Saves space and easy to mount . The night light is on a LED sensor so no turning on or off .
 This is my second one purchased . The last hairdryer ran for over 2 years , with two people using it everyday . Delivery was fast and item was exactly what we were looking for . The dryer hangs nicely on the wall and works well .
 These are my 3rd and 4th . Had to leave 1 and 2 at my old house . Perfect size , speed and temp .
 Only had this item for about a week , but so far it seems to work well . Got it mounted on the wall and it works . The only thing I 'm not thrilled with is the night-light built into the base is extremely dim . Its bordering on the unhelpful level of dimness . It would be nice if this was just a bit brighter , but thats not why we bought it anyway , we got it for the hair dryer . My 3 ladies of the house have used it and like it so far . Hopefully it will last a while , but if not , its not an expensive accessory , so we 'll have to see how long it lasts .
 This is our 2nd one . The 1st lasted at least 8 years . My wife & daughter love the convenience of having it mounted in the bathroom . The night light is a nice extra .
 While it may not be the most powerful or versatile hair dryer available , it is certainly the most convenient . I bought this as a replacement for the exact same model that lasted several years . My wife wanted this one replaced when the plastic internal fan blades broke apart , but that was after 5-10 years of regular use . My wife has one or two others that have specialty attachments and are probably more powerful , but this is the one that she uses as the primary one , because it is always right there , nothing to pull out and plug in etc. . It 's just there and it is powerful enough to handle most every requirement . I use it infrequently but my short hair is dry in less than a minute .
 workes very good . i like it because it hang on the wall out of the way
 I love the hair dryer I have one in the Master bathroom . Needed one in the main one for guests . Thank you .
 I bought this to replace one just like it , I have used it everyday for at least 5years , I love the way it is out of the way , and right at your finger tips .
 This is the second time I have bought this dryer . My housekeeper accidently broke the little latch on the first one so it would n't atay hung up anymore . I had the first one for about 3 or 4 years & I loved it enough to repurchase rather than getting another brand or style . Highly recommend this dryer for its convenience and quick hair drying !
 Works great , looks good and was easy to install.The only con ... wish it had a longer cord .
 Being able to have a blow dryer at hand , rather than stuffed in some drawer or cabinet , makes the morning routine so much easier . One tip ... to prevent overheating , do occasionally remove the screen from the back of the dryer . Once the screen has been removed , built up lint can be accessed and cleaned easily .
 Great product , sleek design and high powered wall mount hair dryer . Would highly recommend
 The dryer was as described , and we are pleased with its design and appearance . It was well-packed and mailed promptly .
 I purchased the Conair Wallmount Dryer because we absolutely wore out our last one and we loved that one so much that we bought another . I have these hairdryers in both of our bathrooms and they are so handy because they are right there . Just pick it up and turn it on and you are ready to go . Great product .
 We 've owned three of this model hair dryer now . The first one lasted five years and the second lasted 4 1/2 years . That 's roughly $ 6/year which allows me to justify replacing the unit with the same model . That and the fact that the mount is already on the wall . Of course , we still have our backup hair dryer which is a Gillette Pro-Max that I received 30 + years ago when I was sixteen . That one is still going strong .
 We love this . So convenient to have it right there ready to go in the bathroom . I highly recommend this .
 The clip on our old one finally broke after years of usage . The girls liked it so much I bought another one - definitely a good value . Keeps the dryer handy but out of the way . And as a bonus they had n't changed the mounting system so I just pulled the old one off the wall , adjusted the cord length and snapped the now one in .
 This Conair Wallmount Dryer with LED night light was my second purchase . My first Conair served and lasted me a long time , therefore , there was no question that I needed and wanted to have it replaced with one of the same .
 I needed a wall mount for space . The unit is compact and easy to use . I would recommend this product to anyone .
 Great price for a great product . has a small light that turns on while your bathroom light is off , i would highly recommend it .
 I put this in a rental condo and it is terrific . The LED night light is a wonderful feature to the unit .
 It 's perfect . If this sounds like it would work for you , you should buy it . We could talk about the idea of a hair drier on the wall , but if it appeals to you this is a very good product .
 A great product and works perfectly . I love that the dryer is off the bathroom counter . The mounting directions were a little confusing , though . And the back plate was a little tough to get off .
 Prior to ordering this on Amazon I have used Mane 'n Tail Conditioner and absolutely love how this makes my hair feel . My hair is a little past my shoulders , color service every 6 to 8 weeks , has always been relatively thin so I am very picky about which conditioner to use . Like most conditioners works best when used midway through the hair to the ends and left on for at least 5 minutes . Obviously it helps and pays off to get your ends trimmed every 6 to 8 weeks to keep them from splitting and once a week use a shampoo to remove build up from hairspray , gel , mousse or any other hair products you may use . In looking at the directions on the bottle it says it can also be used as a leave in conditioner too -LRB- have not tried this method on my hair . Mane 'n Tail has a gentle , clean scent that works with almost any shampoo . The Mane 'n Tail Shampoo did not do much for my hair -LRB- in case you are wondering about that -RRB- but I tend to use different types of shampoo for mild cleansing and nice scent then conditioner , mix and match . I would highly recommend this product it 's a one of a kind . Hope this is helpful to anyone wanting to try this product .
 -LRB- Coming from someone who usually uses $ 40 conditioner from the stylist -RRB- I 've been using this with the Main 'n Tail shampoo to help re-build my hair . I have naturally dark brown -LRB- almost black -RRB- thick , coarse , curly hair - but I 've bleached it to almost white and I straighten it every day ... needless to say my hair needed some love . After one use I was REALLY impressed with how soft my hair was even after blow drying it , I 'm definitely excited to continue use and see what other wonders it can do . -LRB- Always let conditioner sit on your hair as long as possible for the best results ! I leave it in at LEAST 5 mins while I shower -RRB-
 I wanted to try a new shampoo that was different - this one lathers great & smells really nice too . I ended up finding it at my local Walgreens for cheaper so from now on I will be buying it there .
 This is a good item . if you like a non harsh conditioners to give the beachy look , buy this . It 's only few bucks for 32 oz so it would last for 2/3 years if you use it like me about once or twice a month to give my hair a break for your hair regular routine .
 Oddly enough , a lot of people seem to be of the belief that I was born on April 6th . -LRB- The fact that I put April 6th under `` Birthdate '' on my Ammyland Profile Page may have played a small part in the confusion , but that 's just a guess . -RRB- In truth , I was born on the Eighth of August -LRB- which sure beats the Ides of March as a birthdate -RRB- . This , of course , makes me a LEO THE LION . And when you are Leo The Lion , you are `` The King Of The Jungle '' , and people expect you to look like the top cat ; you ca n't exactly go out in public looking like a dog . And that 's why when I wash what 's left of my hair -LRB- which is n't often and is n't much -RRB- I use MANE ` N TAIL Conditioner exclusively -LRB- except for when I use another brand of conditioner -RRB- . It is important that my mane is the cat 's meow when I cat around . Now in my 47th year , there 's a lot of competition from younger cats , and if I want to catch the eye of a lovely lioness , I simply must look my best . Any lion who would wash his mane ` n fail to follow it up with MANE ` N TAIL Conditioner should be flogged within an inch of one of his nine lives with a cat-o ' - nine-tails ! There 's simply no excuse - other than laziness - for not taking the little extra time to put the exquisite finishing touch of MANE ` N TAIL Conditioner on your washing . Do n't you wish to look like a real cool cat from mane to tail before showing off your latest dance moves in front of the ladies ? Do n't be a lazy lion!MANE ` N TAIL Conditioner will impart so much luster to your hair that it will make that other luster , Jimmy Carter , downright jealous . It works so well that you may have to shave your head and send your hair to Father Xavier Rojas for Confession . Split ends ? MANE ` N TAIL healed mine so well that I had to be fitted with a colostomy bag ! If you want to continue with your cat and mouse game of running from one conditioner to another , you 're just wasting your time because all the hep cats know that quality hair products BEGIN ` N END with MANE ` N TAIL - the first and last name in hair care . Any lion who says I 'm lyin ' had better `` Put ` em up ! Put ` em up ! I can fight you with one paw tied behind my back . I can fight you standing on one foot . '' -LRB- I have withheld one star only because my MANE ` N TAIL Conditioner does n't turn into a gazelle sandwich and a saucer of milk at midnight . -RRB- You can be sure that this cat needs all the help he can get , and after I 'm done shampooing my mane , I always finish the job with MANE ` N TAIL Conditioner before leaving my lair and venturing into those Dens of Iniquity , chasing tail on a Saturday night . -LRB- Even though at my age , the tail I end up chasing is always my own . -RRB-
 I ordered 2 bows , because there was a deal offered . I 'm glad I did , they are beautiful and fit perfectly . The shipping was fast and I would highly recommend this seller .
 My hands were very raw , from itching so much , so I selected this cream , and it was very soothing , did not burn the open cuts . I am all healed up now , no more rough skin , I apply it 3 or 4 times daily , I am happy that I found this special cream .
 Heard about the line from a friend , and decided to try a couple of versions . Nice , light scented , smooth and creamy lotion . Working well for the psoriasis rash , will definitely continue buying this product .
 My mother has really bad eczema and nothing has worked . I gave her this and she was shocked it stopped the itching right away .
 I have suffered with eczema all my life and normally use Eucerin right after my bath for maintenance . For flare ups , I usually use hydrocortisone mixed in with Eucerin , but now , I just apply the Psorzema Creme a couple of times and the flare up is gone!I also have been using it for my baby girl since she was 4 weeks old . I love the fact that it is all natural and steriod free ! Another mother recommended this product , and I 'm SO thankful she did ! Our pedi told us it was baby acne at first , but then it got a lot worse ... flaky , dry , red , and irritated . At first I mixed it with the hydrocortisone to relieve it quickly to prevent infection , and after 1 application of the mixture , it was gone ! Since then , I only apply it after her bath , and it 's never come back ! She 's now almost 4 months!I was a little skeptical at first , esp . with the price . The 4oz jar lasts awhile though ... a little bit really goes a long way , so do n't let the price deter you from purchasing . It lasted us almost 3 months ! I would definitely recommend this product and give it a try !
 I purchased this cream and the Psorzema lotion . After having tried `` everything on the market '' for my kids ' severely dry , sensitive skin and eczema , I can honestly say this line was the least-irritating . Most products cause burning/itching for my children . Of the entire time they had this cream applied -LRB- say , 20 days -RRB- , only a couple days did one say that it caused them irritation . That 's a big deal for us . While I do n't think it moisturized any longer than other products we 've tried , at least it did n't do anymore damage . Not sure if we 'll buy the cream again , but definitely the lotion , which is a little more practical for kids who do n't sit still very long .
 I 've had eczema all of my life and I understand that it wo n't just go away ; it has to be treated consistently . So far this Psorzema Creme seems to be the best I 've come across . It actually relieves the itching and keeps it at bay without being harmful like topical steroids . That means that I can use as much of it as I need and as often as I need . As a former topical steroid user , that means A LOT . Plus it never makes it worse before it gets better , which is what I 've experienced with other products .
 Derma E products are awesome ... and natural . This is one of several I use . Has really helped my dry , dry skin .
 This cream is wonderful for my daughter 's skin . We have almost completely eliminated the need for steroid creams with the use of this homeopathic cream .
 For a while , I thought was suffering from rosacea . The dermatologist tried a few treatments on me that ALL fried my skin and left me worse off than I was to begin with . I 've been using this cream for about a year and a half now along with pine tar soap which is very moisturizing and the red , blotchy is almost completely gone and my skin feels smooth and soft now.I was buying this in the health food stores , but it 's 3-5 dollars cheaper on amazon than in the stores . Plus I do n't have to pay for the gas to drive there .
 My son has had eczema since he was 8 weeks old . we have been trying numerous lotions and finally found a combination that seems to wor . We put this on my son every night after his bath and then put aquaphor on top of it . We have been doing this for a couple of months and it keeps most of the eczema under control .
 This cream really does wonders for dry and rash-prone skin . If you use it immediately after showing , it keeps skin soft and balanced all day without feeling greasy .
 I have excema and have to change products every 5 years or so . Been using for about a year and so far so good
 I love this product ! Its not greasy at all ! I use it for spots of psoriasis on my scalp , its never greasy and really helps alleviate the flaking and itching . I will be buying more when this jar is empty .
 Last winter I tried a sample of this cream . They were giving it away at my local health food store . I few pouches saved me from itching the whole season . Now , even though it is just October , I decided to get ready and buy it in advance because every other cream I tried failed . I did not try anything that is chemically based though so , I would not speak of those creams . But as far as all natural ingredients - this cream worked the best .
 This is truly a miracle cream ! I have had psoriasis for years and have been using prescription cortisone creams with very little improvement . Shopping in Whole Foods one day , passing the healthcare products section , I spotted Psorzema cream and figured it was worth a try . In less than one week there was such a remarkable improvement in my condition that both myself and my physician husband were absolutely astounded . It is greaseless , odorless , and extremely quick drying . Swanson has the best price with super fast shipping . Anyone with psoriasis or eczema should definitely give this product a try .
 I have eczema primarily on the soles of my feet and the palms of my hands . I have n't had a severe breakout in the past two years , but at its worst , it took several prednisone treatments to get it under control . Once under control , I was using a product by Ferndale Laboratories called SBR-Lipocream -LRB- skin barrier cream -RRB- . I used the SBR cream mainly after showering -LRB- hydrating the skin , and sealing in the moisture -RRB- , and it worked great to keep my eczema under control . Ferndale has discontinued that product -LRB- though they have newer products that I have not tried -RRB- . When I was looking for a replacement , I ran across good reviews of Psorzema Cream and decided to give it a try . My eczema is mild compared to others , but I have to say that this is the best creme I 've tried -LRB- and I 've tried many -RRB- . Not only does it quickly clear up my minor breakouts , it immediately relieves the itching . I 've bought many many items through amazon , and been happy with every purchase , but this is the first purchase that compelled me to write a reivew . I 've been using Psorzema for the past 6 months , and highly recommend .
 I am going crazy trying to find the right product for eczema . I have been using pine tar soap and olive soap for cleansing , then argan oil and/or tamanu oil with Kiehls body lotion and Aveeno Anti-Itch Cortisone cream on top of that . I have read that cortisone is not good to use long term because when you quit using it , the eczema comes on twice as bad and then there is the issue of cortisone being absorbed into your system thus causing liver damage . Sigh . So I decided to try this because it is - ta DA ! - all natural blah blah blah . I put in on and it felt nice initially but within the hour my spots were itching again . I am using tamanu oil under it -LRB- I recommend Teliaoils Madagascan tamanu oil -RRB- which seems to help . It is a pleasant cream to use , unscented , moderately moisturizing but it really does nothing toward healing the abominable curse that is eczema . I have ordered another product called Gormel cream which has 20 % urea in it and we will see how that goes . This Psorzema cream would probably be great for someone who just has sensitive skin but no psoriasis or eczema . It will not worsen the condition but will not help it either - for me , anyway . Good fortune to all those seeking relief and please comment if you know of a good remedy ... ******** Update 12/7/2012 ******** My skin problem was not eczema at all , it turned out to be a fungal infection - so please take my review with a grain of salt . Since I do not have experience with how it works on psoriasis or eczema , I have changed my rating from 3 to 4 stars .
 My son has terrible eczema , and has since shortly after birth . We have tried everything suggested to us by our pediatrician and dermatologist , and while some things helped , nothing could consistantly get rid of the all over rash or do much for the really bad patches . We finally tried this and after 2 days of rubbing it in once per day , the all over rash was GONE . The patches even disappeared ! This stuff is amazing and I wish I had known about it the first year of his life ! We are due with our next soon , and am planning to use it on both of our sons to prevent eczema .
 after useing for a couple of weeks all of my exzema cleared up ! I have tried everything and nothing worked in the past , If I could I would give it ten stars
 I purchased this face cream for my wife . She has rosacea and this is one of the least expensive creams she can purchase for her face . She was buying this from one of the local stores , but since I got her the Psorzema Creme ' , she 's been getting it from Amazon . Thank you Amazon for making our lives a little easier and saving us a few pennies .
 I have been using this on my son -LRB- 1 year old -RRB- to relieve his eczema patches . It really works and because there are no steroids I can apply it often without worry .
 Just what the Spa therapist ordered . Do it at home , do n't keep paying others to touch you when you can enjoy this one yourself !
 i got this for $ 25 and i got everything listed above . i think i may have already written a review for claiborne sport but anyways , it 's good to be different from what everyone else is wearing . i believe i spent less and got more on amazon than what i would 've paid in a dept. store for just the cologne . i get complimented every so often and usually get asked what i am wearing . it 's light and sweet and does n't have a musky smell to it . one of my favorites . you may like if u like eternity , pleasures , or kenneth cole reaction ... usually cheaper than the more popular scents but does n't sacrifice quality .
 I love this eyeliner . I am Asian so my eyes are very dark and sometimes I find lining my eyes in black makes them look smaller . This Shiseido blue makes my eyes pop and seem brighter . Also , it goes on very smoothly and stays on pretty well . This liner has been very hard to find lately and I do n't know if it 's been discontinued or just does n't get distributed here in the U.S. as much . I plan on buying a few more to keep in stock !
 I liked this item , the prise is cheap but the look of the item is not.Made by zippo USA with type C. i bought two till now i will buy more
 I love this lighter ! The matte texture gives it a really cool feeling . This is the second of these Zippos I have owned after sadly losing my first one . Great buy , great price . Ca n't ever go wrong with a good Zippo ! = -RRB-
 Ca n't beat a Zippo . Created so soldiers had a reliable fire source , windproof and clever use as a spot remover when you take it out of the case.Just rub the batting on the spot and the fluid dissolves it . Do n't forget to store extra flints under the batting .
 I like the lighter , very good quality , the color and feel is real nice , it fits as a collector item
 I always knew zippo was the way to go on long lasting lighters , but I always had in the back of my head that it wasnt good quality . Well this lighter has proved me wrong . This lighter is amazing ! It is made very well and it is very scratch resistant . I love this lighter and will continue to use it . This lights is fantastic for just about anything ! I might just have to pick up a few more to add to my new and starting collection . Great lighter 5/5
 Great buy for a wonderful perfume set ; I would recommend this set to all women and the price is excellent compared to other places that sell it
 My son is sensitive to many fragrances and dyes . We tried this because it was on a list of safe products . This spray sunblock goes on easily and is very effective ! I carry it in my purse now because the spray application is so easy !
 This is my 2nd favorite nail polish color , the first is OPI 's Natasha & Boris . This one is great cause its super light , I would call it a ballerina pink . Looks great with one coat or two .
 This color is beautiful on nails and toes . It goes on easy and looks great for days .
 I fell in love with this color and i HAD to find it!When i finally got it i was so happy!HOWEVER the color is so much more lighter than you see.Even with 2 coats it looks like raspberries . but still cute !
 This is hands down my FAVORITE fall/winter nail color . It is the PERFECT maroon/oxblood/burgundy . Received SO many complements while having this on . . Its a must have : -RRB-
 I was so glad to have been able to find this on Amazon . Essie discontinued it and I love it . I have used two bottles of it over the past several years and am sad to know this one will probably be the last bottle I will be able to find .
 I really like the Essie nail polish line . You get a great polish for the price . I rated this color a 4 only because it is a translucent pink and I wanted more coverage of a light pink then a clear pink . If you like a light pink/clear polish look then this is perfect for you .
 This is a very pretty color that will look great on any skin tone . I honestly bought it because I heard this was the color Kate Middleton wore on her wedding day . I purchased it here because it was cheaper than in stores , and I could n't find it in any stores ! I 'm glad I got this shade that I can wear and I know where I can buy another bottle when I run out of this shade .
 Color reminds me of fuschia a deep rich pink . Color goes on smoothly . It is exactly what I was expecting tried the color in a salon prior to buying . I love Essie products
 I love this color ! I am really glad I decided to get it ! I will purchase more Essie products in the future !
 Beautiful deep rich red color , and such a unique name ! High quality polish , no streaking or chipping . Very satisfied with this brand . Similar quality to other professional polishes like OPI , China Glaze and Zoya !
 This is a gorgeous royal blue . It goes on smooth without streaking . I prefer essie polish to any other brand , I have real nails and others do not last as long w/o chipping . I change my polish once a week , so I do n't know how long you could go before `` having '' to change . I just like to change colors . I do know that after a week of wear there is NO sign of chipping at all . The shine on this is superb , no top coat needed . I would like to thank the seller -LRB- HOUSE OF ACCESSORY -RRB- for wonderful service ! Item arrived on time and packaged so there was no chance of damage during shipment . I have had VERY BAD service from -LRB- NAIL DISCOUNT -RRB- I was not at all pleased with them ! Just a tip ... beware who you buy from !
 I have been searching for a good light pink that does not go on see through and looks professional . And I finally found it . Love this color !
 I ordered this polish in white -LRB- blanc -RRB- . I was worried that like some other white polishes I 've seen that it would end up looking like I 'd put white out on my nails . Or that the color would n't be a true white . But this polish went on very smooth and the color is wonderful . I 've never used Essie before , but I think I 've found a new favorite polish .
 Bordeaux is the perfect dark red nail polish . I often ask for it when having my nails done in a salon . I especially love using it on my toe nails . I was having a problem finding it in drugstores , as it 's an older shade . However I got it easily through Amazon and at a good price , too . For a glam occasion I like to use it on my finger nails . The name conjures up France and sipping a deep red vintage . That 's a good description of Bordeaux .
 This color is a very pretty rose gold metallic color that goes very well with nude clothes and gold accessories . I really like this color and it is most certainly a legitimate Essie Nail polish .
 The polish was nicely packaged and also it came on time . It came as described and the polish was bend new .
 If you are looking for a dense but not glue-y holo polish , then buy this immediately . The formula is incredible , the glitter is packed full of reflection and the bottle glows with rainbows .
 A nice light creamy clear coat . I work as a waitress so having chip free nails is almost impossible ! So I love to wear something shear that does n't show wear and tear too much . Overall a great color .
 This is good , but not as pink as I 'd hoped . It was a little chalkier looking and I ended up using a different Essie color . I had ordered it for my wedding , but have used it other times for different days .
 Awesome Product ! Love the color , love the brand ! Essie is up there as one of the nail polish greats !
 I 've never been able to find this color except for at the actual nail salon and finally I found it and own it and could n't be happier !! Thank u !!
 I 've tried a lot of Essie colors in this light pink range . This is the best , in my opinion , as it does not turn yellow and has a nice , pearly look with a bit of pink
 This is the perfect red shade of nail polish ... not too red and not too pink . Just that right mix !
 Arrived quickly and in great condition . Perfect white with a little bit of sparkle , but not glitter . Is n't young or silly - very chic , can be worn for work .
 This seller is probably one of the best I 've ever bought from . I ordered the nail polish color Sole Mate , and got it in a very timely manner . Also it was wrapped to where it would n't break.The color is n't actually what I thought it was be . I thought it would be more of a maroon , but it 's more of a purplish plum color . Nonetheless I still love it , and I totally love this buyer . I WILL be buying from them again !!
 This basically gives a &#34; your nails , but better &#34; look - it is a sheer and ladylike pink . Good for everyday or work wear as well as for more formal occasions . Easy to apply , goes on smooth , dries pretty quickly , and reflects the light beautifully . Recommended .
 im not much of a red girl but i saw this and thought it looked nice when i received it and tried it on i fell in love ! it is the perfect red i want to buy ten of them so i never run out !
 It was so easy to find on amazon.com . My manicurist had this color , and I loved it and wanted it for touchups . Sure beats driving all over to find it . Looks better on than in the bottle .
 I found this color to be neutral and elegant with a nice shine . Perfect for professional environment where you ca n't go to crazy with funky nail colors . Need 2 coats to appreciate the color . Also very fast shipping . I would definitely recommend this product !
 Marshmallow is a really common name drop around nail polish blogs , especially when it comes to combining it with glitter and making glitter sandwiches and the like . That 's why I purchased it , and it did n't disappoint . Application is smooth , color is ... delicious and marshmallow looking . . ? Keep in mind it is a jelly and takes several coats to become opaque , but I knew and expected and desired this going in . And Essie , as a more fancy brand than your average drug store polish , still holds a not-too-steep price point .
 I love essie 's nail color Bungle Jungle . It has a great sheen and color goes with many clothes items . Happy with my choice and with the seller.Definitely 5 stars !
 This was a trendy color this summer and I enjoyed it . The color is the same as it looks in the bottle after 2 coats .
 Sand of a Beach is a shimmery neutral that I love to use . I was lucky to find it from an Amazon provider . It is the perfect color for almost any time of year and for any occasion . It arrived carefully packaged and a couple of days earlier than promised ! I would not hesitate to purchase from this provider again .
 I love the color of this nail polish ! It is a beautiful light pink , and it goes with almost anything . The only problem I have had is that it needs about 2 coats , but 2 coats sometimes congeals and gets smudged . I can not figure it out ! But other than that , it is a great polish .
 This is such an amazing color forEveryday wear or a French manicure , so nice that I ALWAYS get compliments on the color even from the folks at the nail salon doing my nails . I wear this color all year long .
 No problems with order . Color is pretty . Picked it by recommendation from Beth Stern . Figured she would know what to choose !
 this order arrived quickly . it was packaged to avoid breakage . included in the package was a recycle bag that can be used for purchases such as groceries . also , included was a sample bottle of Good to Go by essie . i will definitely order from this vendor again .
 I feel the quality of the Essie products are great for the monies . I do have problems finding my favorite colors in the store . I have however been able to find the colors wanted online .
 The color is more coral/orange than I expected , but I am pleased with it nonetheless . Two coats of it will give you full coverage -LRB- unlike other Essie colors . -RRB- Looks good with the high gloss sheen , as well as with the Matte About You top coat .
 When the sun SIZZLES , my toes need to REFLECT IT w / their own SIZZLE . . `` CLICK IT OR TICKET '' BY ESSIE IS THE ANSWER . SORRY TO HEAR IT 'S BEEN DISCONTINUED ... BUT I FOUND IT ON AMAZON & I 'M SO GRATEFUL !! THANKS AMAZON . . ALWAYS A FAN !
 Essie 's Fishnet Stocking is just perfect . It 's red . It 's not glittery , shimmer , or satiny ... it 's just RED . A very refreshing and no nonsense bold crayon-like red . It 's approach to nail color is what I 'm really loving about the Essie line . All Essie colors that I 've tried are darker on your nails than in the bottle ... consistently too . Like most of the other colors , this shade is heavily pigmented . My last 3 manicures were in this color . That 's how much I love it . It 's classic , it 's basic , and it 's not one of those shade you really had to be in a particular mood to wear . Best of all , I can wear it without being constantly reminded of Christmas .
 I got the Essie polish on sale , for the price it looked worth a shot . From the first coat I was impressed , it goes on smoothly and evenly with little effort ! No bubbling or streaking ! Even with two coats , it was perfect!Two coats , a topcoat , and this polish lasted me two whole weeks . I work with my hands a lot and do a lot of typing , so this was pretty phenomenal . For the price point of this polish , I really did n't expect a whole lot.This color looks very red , very bright , in the bottle . I almost did n't get it , but decided what the heck . -LRB- Imagine my surprise to see the color name , I would hope you do n't see this color after . . well ... but anyway -RRB- I am very fair and red normally looks horrible on me for everyday wear , but this color really warmed up my skintone . It looked good on my shorter length nails , too . I expected it to draw attention to the fact that my nails were so short but this is a very rich , deep , living color . It has just enough metallic to not look flat and uninteresting , it gleams ever so slightly as you move your hands . So pretty!The plus side is that I did n't get any staining afterwards , and it was easy to remove . Even with a basecoat red seems to cause problems for my nails but this was easy on , easy off , and I loved it . Great product and I 'm an Essie convert when I want regular polish ! -LRB- You should try gel nails ... but that 's a different review ! -RRB-
 It is the best color I have been looking for a long long time , a little bit peach , and blush , and nude , big love ! High recomend !!!
 I love Essie nail polish ! This review is specifically for `` Aruba Blue . '' `` Mademoiselle '' review is below.This is a dark blue , not navy , but a deep Royal blue . There is shine but no sparkle , and the coverage is amazing . The polish consistency is thin but even , and goes on in thin coats . -LRB- If yours does n't , you might want to get a thinner -RRB- . Two coats is more than enough for deep color , and since it goes on thin you can either use Seche Vite topcoat for bulk or CND Air Dry for thin coverage . Color lasts well , does NOT chip , and there is no streaking past the first coat . This , like all other dark-pigmented polish , will wear off the tips and may mark paper that you are writing on or books you are reading . Applying a second top coat a day or so after polish will help keep the color on your nails and not on your paper.I have noticed that this color will get in between the nail and the flesh on the side of your nail . It stains pretty well so color removal can take a few more cotton balls than is expected . When removing polish the pigment will travel along the remover and can stain under the nail with a dusky blue color . This can and will stain cuticle debris left on nails . A slight buffing after polish removal and scrubbing with soap and a nail brush resolves this problem.Mademoiselle by Essie is perfect for French Manicures . It is rather sheer , no matter what it looks like in the bottle , and WILL streak if you are not careful . As a solid color three coats looks pretty good , but you can still see the tips of your nails if they are long . Over a snow-white french tip this looks beautiful . When someone wants a pale pink , I always recommend this . Remember though , it is NOT opaque , and never will be . -LRB- When will Essie or OPI make an opaque pink like Orly 's `` Kiss the Bride ? '' -RRB-
 The Moonstruck is my favorite neutral Essie color . My order came quick and the polishes were in perfect condition . Definitely look forward to being a regular costumer .
 I have very fair skin and this color looks absolutely great on me . it really stands out and i get a ton of compliments . the color is a little different than the picture shown online but it is still a bright and vibrant color , perfect for summer or if you 're just looking for a quick pick me up to brighten your day .
 This color may not be everyone 's cup of tea - it is super sheer . Essie 's site recommends it for french manicures , but I just use it on it 's own . I was frustrated with opaque polishes because chipping is so obvious , but I wanted something a bit more exciting than clear . Essie No-Prenup fits the bill perfectly ! One or two coats gives your nails a natural , healthy , rosy tint but is sheer enough that mistakes and chipping are not obvious . It 's a clean and simple look . Love , love , love .
 This pink is fantastic with my fair skin tone , although I 'd imagine it 's pretty much universally flattering . One coat gives your nails a super-sheer wash of ballet-slipper pink . If you prefer a more opaque finish , it 's as easy as a few extra coats . The polish dries with a lightly shiny finish - not at all shimmery , but just glossy enough that I did n't need a top coat . Word of advice
 This polish color reminds me of cotton candy with a glitter and sparkle ... it would be a great alternative to use for a french manicure it would be fun ... great seller fast delivery ...
 Beautiful pale pink - not too pink - with a hint of gleam . It is n't shimmery but has almost an irredenscent look about it . Only wish Essie still made/sold this color . It is off the shelves and I can only find it online . Also wish Essie would make the shelac/gel polishes and definitely in this color !
 I really like this shade , but I find that he coverage is rather inconsistent . I have applied two coats to my nails , and the color is sort of splotchy . When I was touching up my nails , I added a 3rd coat , and it seemed to make the color really pop . I would recommend applying 3 light coats and you will get the full richness of this incredible red . I think this is my new favorite color . It 's glamourous and also bright and feminine . It is a bold red , but nor orange or gothy . I really like the way it looks on my skin tone .
 This pinkish color is soooo pretty . It is a bright pink that looks really great in sunshine . Just a cream color without glitters . And the quality is decent . Only one coat is enough . But I apply two coats anyway . And it stays on my nails perfectly for five days until I want to switch the color ! It 's amazing .
 I love Essie products , but they 're so expensive . I was so pleased when I found them on Amazon at great prices . I got the Bordeaux and I love it . It looks great on both hands and toes . The color is same as what you see in the picture -LRB- or at least i , t appears so on my netbook screen . -RRB- If you 're thinking Essie products are a little too expensive for you , pay the extra bucks and treat yourself . You wo n't regret it . It lasts twice longer than any other miracle nail polish I ever owned , and it DOES NOT CHIP . My manicure looked just as good after 2 weeks as the day I made it -LRB- except for the gap in between the cuticles and polish line -- too bad nails grow so fast -RRB- . GREAT PRODUCT !
 Awe , this color Marshmallow by Essie holds a special place in my heart . I used this white nail polish for white on white french manicures for 10 years and I used to get compliments non stop . I wear short dark nails now but I never forgot where it all started for me , with Essie Marshmallow . Best white polish ever .
 I purchased nail polish from this company . The order came very fast the company kept in contact with me to make sure I was satisfied with my order . They even called me ! Awesome place to shop !
 I love Essie ! It 's a great nail polish !!! The price is very good ! This time I bought `` Catwalk '' the color is beautiful . I get lots of compliments !
 Typical I do n't buy Essie brand nail polish besides their ridge filling base but this color attracted me . I was always worried about how this color would look on my dark brown skin tone but once I gave in and bought ; I do n't know what the doubt was about ! It looks great on me and I have a feeling it 'd look better on all skin types . I really do n't like to brushes on Essie nail polish because it does n't give me that professional finish look I enjoy at a nail salon but overall the color is great . A great base and top coat will allow this color to last at least 2 days , possibly more .
 I love Essie products . I have at least 30 of their polishes , ranging from sheer pinks all the way to the darkest blacks . This color looks really good on my skin tone -LRB- black , caramel skin tone -RRB- . I love the fact that with a simple coat of Essie base coat , 2 coats of polish , and a coat of top coat , my nails will look good for at least 5 days with proper maintenance.Most people who are complaining about their polish not lasting need to follow a few simple steps to make it last longer.1-Thin coats are best . Thick coats tend to lead to more porous polish . More porous = more likely to chip.2-Dry manicures are better than wet ones . If you polish after soaking your nails for any period of time , the nail bed expands . Drying then causes it to contract , making it more likely to have base coat and thus nail polish that does n't adhere properly.3-Wear gloves when washing dishes .
 I 've been searching everywhere for this color ! It 's the perfect nude in my opinion . :-RRB- Definitely my new staple nail polish color .
 Essie is my favorite nail polish brand , the amount of shades made is incredible and while they stay on the safe and pretty side they are stunning and slightly different enough that I want to have them all . Two coats are all I need for shiny , strong nails and with a good top coat it lasts a few days.In the past I would stick to pale colors such as Ballet Slipper , Potato Fields , Sugar Daddy , Waltz or Marshmallow . Now I love the black wine color called Wicked but my absolute favorite is Geranium - a wild , flaming orange/red tomato that people always seem to complement me on . I wear it with short nails of course and since getting it two weeks ago I am unable to change it , I repainted my nail 3 times since and they have been Geranium all the way through . Great for the summer , I ca n't wait to break out my flip flops and rock my toes with this color.If you have nails and love to paint them then you ca n't go wrong with Essie ! - Kasia S.
 Love this color - not too sheer , not too heavy . Perfect for both french manicures and just alone for a clean , pretty look .
 I was originally gifted this nail polish in a sample size and I used it up in a record amount of time . It is , hands down , my favorite Essie color ever . It looks good on all skin tones and it neutral . You only need two coats - it 's not like other `` pastel '' nail colors , where you have to do a ton of layers . I recommend this to every one would loves a neutral color and/or Essie . It 's the best !!!!!
 I never write review but I felt like I needed to do this for this product . It is one of the best polishes that I have bought , the color is absolutely amazing , goes on smoothly and lasts well . I will be comming back to Essie to try the other colors .
 I love Essie products and I love this color . It is a shade darker than I thought , but it works !
 All the Essie nail polish colors are terrific . This particular color is one of the beauties I love to wear on both fingers and toes .
 I had been looking all over town for this exact Essie color after seeing it at a nail salon . It is a great pink color for summer ! Product arrived early -LRB- a few days before the estimated arrival date -RRB- and it was exactly as it was described . I am a very happy customer !
 I purchased Aruba blue and boy do I love it !! it 's the perfect cobalt blue . I have caramel skin and it went well with my complexion . My mother who is fairer tried this on and it looked just as amazing on her . I think any girl of any shade can rock this color .
 This nail polish really must look good on all skin tones ... just like In Style magazine recommended . It looks great on my toes . Not too pale , not too pink , just right !
 I bought this color for my bridesmaids , for them to wear it polish for my wedding . It came out very pretty and smooth but it was a little light . The girls layered on about four layers and it looked great !
 Essie products are always the very best . Have lots of nail polish from Essie and I am never disappointed . Go Essie !
 It was a gift , so I cant tell much about the product . But the girl who received it was quite happy .
 I love this color so much ! I got compliments on this color . Essie is a good nail company . The shipper also sent this product very fast .
 I bought this to replace my first bottle of Essie Innocent when it spilled in my luggage on a flight . I love the color so much I had to replace it ! I have very fair skin and this color looks great .
 Wearing dark colored nail polish in the fall lends a great air of sophistication to any outfit . Wear this polish , and you 'll get into the classiest clubs in town !
 Nice color , Kinda a light peachish color . The order arrived very quickly . I had to put on a good 4 or 5 coats on each nail to make the color really show which is why its 4 stars not 5 .
 I am always on the lookout for astonishing nail color . I do not have pretty hands . I have a lot of red in my skin and dark , bright polishes seem to emphasize this . I have tried Essie Ballet Slippers and Essie Mademoiselle , but found them to be just a bit lighter than what I wanted and it also took at least four coats to produce the desired result . Who has time for that ? Two coats of Delicacy covers well ; three is better followed by Essie topcoat . My nails look neat , finished and not bare but they do n't scream `` I 've been polished '' either . The polish has just enough pink to give definition with a very slight pearl appearance . It 's a perfect shade for me .
 This is a light pink shade with an opalescent effect . It is long-wearing and a perfect choice for the base coat of a French manicure . The shade is subtle yet attractive . It 's wonderful for a pedicure as well . The color will work for all skin tones , and small chips are hardly noticeable . It 's the `` go-to '' shade for any occasion . Great color for nails of all lengths . Essie products are known for their quality , but I held back a rating star due to price point .
 Great quality - just as described . FYI - Comes out a little darker on the nails .
 I LOVE Essie ! This is the greatest nail polish ; I can get a full five + days out of my manicure . This color is so great ; it has a little shimmer to give some interest and dimension to red .
 This is a good shade . Its very close to OPIs Vampire State Building from way back when , if not exactly like it . Essie is good polish . Two coats will do yah ...
 the perfect white color i 've been looking for . not too sheer , not too white-out looking . definitely need at least 2 coats , but the finished product is gorgeous and simply classic . bought from the same third party seller i 've purchased most of my nail polish from . no issues . thanks amazon !
 I was so disappointed that my favorite nail color has been discontinued by Essie , and so happy to find it on Amazon ... yay ! The vendor sent it out very promptly , and they arrived in perfect condition !
 I ordered this essie nail colour FED UP its beautiful color I really liked it , I was wearing it at a party my friend gave at his house and he even noticed it and said he really likes the color , and there were guests there the women gave me a lot of compliments too and asked what colour it was and what brand so I told them everything and where they can buy for lower prices , again thank you amazon for great beauty products you carry for lower prices .
 Quick , solid delivery , product is as gorgeous as I was hoping it would be ! I 've come to expect good quality from essie nail polish and this did not disappoint . I kept staring at my nails all day after painting them , lol .
 I bought Essie because I am falling in love with their nail polishes , since they are fast drying and long lasting . However , this one was a little too watery . While I was applying it , a few drops dripped onto the table . I have never experienced this with any other Essie nail polishes . Speaking of the color , its a cream white color , and its usually opaque in 2 coats . Its an okay polish , I would n't re-purchase .
 This polish has a metallic shimmer to it that makes it look really great . This has been my favorite polish color since I got it .
 When I opened the bottle , this looked a little like a brown and I am NOT a brown polish girl . Once I put it on , I was relieved and excited ! Love this color !
 I love this color ! However , the formula of the polish is a little thin and runny . I needed 3 coats to get it opaque , but it looked beautiful .
 Bought this after seeing it won some beauty award and I was looking for a nice neutral pink . It is pretty but it very sheer , like clear nail polished classed up a notch . Pretty , but nothing special . No problems with chipping etc. .
 Essie is the only fingernail polish I use . This is such a beautiful color . I look forward to coming seasons of color .
 I love this polish . The color is a perfect brown and it goes on so smooth . It is well worth the money .
 It 's such a beautiful deep red color that I 've never seen before , 2 coats work great , but if you go for 3 the color is just perfect ! Ecspecially for pale skin ladies ! This color is perfect for fall , and for me , I added glitter to 1/2 of my nail near the cuticles and it just works great for Christmas !!! A must have !
 My local stores were out of this my favorite color . I decided to look on line and i 'm glad I did . I received my polish promptly and I 'm very happy with this purchase .
 This is a deep rich red that you can wear casually and formally as well . It has a creme feel to it .
 This is MY ALL TIME FAVORITE NAIL POLISH . PERIOD . It is such a great color and it looks good with my skin color -LRB- olive -RRB- . I take it with me whenever I go to the nail salon in case they do n't have it . I call it true blood because it kinda reminds me of the show : -RRB-
 * Description from essie.com
 I expected Swing Velvet to be more of a dark pink shimmer but it has a lot of red tones to it . It 's slightly more pink than Thigh High , but the two are very close .
 I love this polish . The color is very subtle , pretty and sophisticated . This polish works well with everything . I ca n't wait to wear it again !
 i love the color . my mom used to wear nail polish like this in her early days and when i got her this she really liked it . Its not a brown colo. its kind of a dark brown with a hint of dark red . really nice !!
 Overall I would rate this 4 stars . The product came intact , wrapped very nicely in bubble-wrap and was not opened or spilled . The color is displayed a little brighter in the picture than it is when you see it in real life . It takes about three coats in order to get the color to show up on your nail and not have your nail show through under the polish .
 The only gripe I have about this is that I wish it was BIGGER !! I hate using a whole one =-LRB- The scent is so incredibly soothing and it really helps you sleep . For serious insomniacs , -LRB- like me -RRB- try throwing this bomb in your tub and then add a LUSH `` Dreamtime Bath Melt '' I only use one half of each instead of just one whole bomb and nothing else ... and instead of just being relaxed and `` sleepy '' , I can hardly keep my head up in the tub and keep nodding off ! One of the greatest baths ever . I just would n't stay in the tub for very long in case you fall asleep ;-RRB- I never last that long before I have to get out of the tub and crash .
 This along with Big Shampoo , was my first try of Lush 's products , I purchased several bath bombs -LRB- Big Blue , Sex Bomb , as well as the promo free ButterBall -RRB- since they had pretty good reviews ... I am a true believer in the Bath as Therapy ! So , of course I wanted to check this stuff out , and let me just say ... Honeeee , Those that have n't should !!! Waving not Drowning is NO joke , you are instantly RELAAAAAXXED ... Smells very nice , not overpowering and you can indeed doze off , so be careful ; 0 -RRB- Oh , and the Big Shampoo , is a keeper too!Girls , as I type this review I am enjoying my all over fragrance , literally from Head To Toes ! Feelin ' Da'Sexy !
 This and the rest of the bath bombs in the Lush collection leave your skin silky smooth . Ive used other bath products but these bombs leave my skin the silkiest ive ever felt . Whatever is in those bombs just envelops your body in a shell of silk , thats how it actually feels when you get out of the bath . Ive tried this bomb , the rainbow warrior and butterball . They all smell good and leave you feeling great . My only complaint is it takes a long time to recieve them . 4 stars .
 This bomb is pretty nice , it smells of lavender with a little woodsy and herbal kick to it , but it is a small bomb and not as strongly scented / powerful in its aromatherapy uses as it could be.There is a new bomb coming out soon -LRB- I got to test it as a Lush forum prize ! -RRB- called Golden Slumbers that the owner of Lush has been testing out and will be in the US soon , which is almost straight lavender and knocks my socks off ! It is a large bomb with golden shimmers in it , and the power/strength of scent of this bomb is incredible . Waving Not Drowning was relaxing but did n't make me sleepy , while Golden Slumbers knocked me * out * . So keep an eye out for Waving Not Drowning 's big brother , and in the meantime , try using two if you are an insomniac and need more `` kick '' than this one provides . Dreamtime melt is also very soothing , and sometimes I cocktail my Lush by using half Dreamtime and half Waving .
 Like the first reviewer said , this bath bomb is not HUGE -- but I think that statement needs a little clarification so you other shoppers/readers are n't turned off ... As far as I know , there are three -LRB- 3 -RRB- sizes of bath bombs that LUSH makes , and I 've only seen the hugest ones -LRB- I think they 're like 28 oz . -LRB- HUGE -RRB- , and they 're over $ 15 each -RRB- in their catalogs -LRB- or online -RRB- -- plus they only come in four `` flavors . `` So , those mega-bombs are not what you should measure other bombs by . The rest of LUSH 's bombs are approx . 6.3 oz . or 3.1 oz . on average -LRB- I just checked -RRB- -- `` waving not drowning '' happens to be the smaller of the two . -LCB- The larger bath bombs are the ones like `` big blue , '' `` youki-hi , '' `` honey bee , '' `` sex bomb '' etc. . . The smaller ones include `` butterball '' and `` fizzy o'therapy , '' and maybe one other besides this one . -RCB- `` Waving not drowning '' was actually the first LUSH bath bomb I tried , and its `` small '' -LRB- - ish -RRB- size , soothing lavender color , conspicuous absence of weird chunks , flowers , or glitter popping out of it and its nice subtle fragrance were really what drew me to it ... I used it without any other bath additives -LRB- i.e. , other bath bombs , salts , or bubbles -RRB- , and was totally , wonderfully , surprisingly in love with it . I was really shocked at the notable difference it made in my bath water -- soothing oils and a fragrance that did n't overwhelm my senses -LRB- but was definitely stronger than what it was `` dry '' -RRB- , relaxed my muscles , left my skin so soft and silky that I did n't even dry off with a towel
 I AM A NEW LOVER OF LUSH !!! WOW ! What a nice bath product . Worth every penny ! Not only did it 's fragrance linger in my bathroom but all throughout my bedroom too ! It truely stands by what it says , `` ingredents that will halp you sleep '' . Best night of rest ever !!
 Never tried a bath brew , but wondered what they were like ? Look no further ! Bath brews have been used for centuries . The scent is VERY subtle with herbal and flowery notes . The combinations of the herbs and flowers makes for a very relaxing bath . Use with a complimentary scented soap such as Claus Porto 's Tuberose , Honeysuckle , or the Favorito .

 I love this perfume and was fortunate to buy it in a gift set for $ 20 at a second-hand retailer . I love Bijan Original , and was `` charmed '' by the mysterious packaging and color combination on this one . While the scent invokes every possible characteristic of what a `` Wicked '' scent should smell like , it 's not very strong and fades after a couple of hours . I have to layer it with a perfume oil -LRB- White Amber -RRB- and pomegranate/apple-type perfumes to have it radiate . It works VERY WELL w / my white amber perfume oil and it lasts!I will definitely keep this one at the front of my vanity ...
 When first applied this smells like hairspray for about 10 seconds . Then you get the sourness of red berries , the watery notes of lotus and earthy patchouli.Somewhat lighter than what I expected a fragrance called `` Wicked '' to be , but quite pleasant . I 'd recommend to someone looking for a not so intense chypre.Poor lasting power , but it is an eau de toilette .
 One of my favorite scents . It is Bijan 's best to me , very sexy and gets comments all the time . I have been buying this for years and the price now is ridiculously cheap compared to years ago . A steal of a deal .
 The Bijan Line smells wonderful . I have had the chance to smell and purchase almost all scents from Bijan . I 'm Loving it .
 Lucky me , I work in a tanning salon so trying all different kinds of lotion has became a hobby of mine.My boss ordered boxes and boxes of this stuff , he told me all about it , being from Hawaii , and how it is all natural.It is n't like your typical tanning lotions , SO of course I HAD to try it ! Remember this is a BROWNING lotion , all natural , no bronzers.I do like bronzers , although some lotions can turn you orange-y , this gives you BROWN natural looking color.For those of you who like instant gratification , it does just THAT ! As soon as you put it on it browns you so well.I have got one of the best tans I have ever had from this lotion.The only thing I do NOT like about this product is how oily it is.It is a lotion-y oil though , not like baby oil.BUT I 've found it you put on a lotion -LRB- recommend just an accelerator , no bronzers -RRB- it is n't as oily , it just makes your skin super soft.No stick at all ! I mixed mine with Designer Skin 's Phoenician , that I did purchase off of here for about $ 33 . So if you 're tanning with this before you have to be somewhere , like work or running errands I do n't recommend using this before , unless you do n't mind being a little oily.A little bit goes a long way ! It 's spreads on SO nicely.The smell is good , I personally do n't mind it.I have seen on other people 's reviews they did n't like the scent.I like to compare the scent to Bit ' O Honey candy.So I definitely give Maui Babe an A + + and recommend this product to anyone !! Great Tan , Good Texture , Good Scent.Sorry for the long review ! Enjoy ! : -RRB-
 product works well i love it , i 've only had it for a day stayed out in the sun for most of the day and already see results and it does not make me orange like other products i have tried will keep buying this product
 Simply the best tanning lotion I have come across , great value for money and seemless delivery via Amazon . Highly recommended .
 This stuff smells a little weird but that 's probably because I 'm not used to rubbing coffee on my body . Works GREAT as a moisturizer and they claim that the caffeine helps reduce the chance of skin cancer to form which is also amazing ! I would HIGHLY recommend for the type of person who either burns easy or loves to lay in the sun ! But careful stains clothing ... coffee ...
 Maui Babe - Browning Lotion - 4 o -LSB- -LSB- ASIN : B00076XR3O Maui Babe - Browning Lotion - 4 ozz found product all it did what it said it could do . love the product will reorder when i run out . have advised my friends to orderMaui Babe - Browning Lotion - 4 oz , 2 pack
 I found this in a five and dime in Hawaii about 15 hrs ago . The best sun lotion ever . Shared with all my friends . ICa n't believe how well known it 's become . I like to think it 's because of me ! However the price has gone up a bitSince I first bought it . I used to ask my brother to send me more . He lives there . Now it 's so easy to get . On line , by phone.Even some retail outlets . Beautiful tan , without the burn .
 This lotion used to get me so tan ... not sure what is different ... but I am not seeing the same long lasting effects it once had . There could be many reasons for this . It could be my skin , the sun ... who knows !
 When i ordered it , came very quickly , in time for my trip to The Caribbean islands !! Great service !! Will use them again !!
 I do n't have any experience with this company but I can definitely vouch for the original product . I found the 4oz bottle in Target for $ 10 . . works and feels better than any tanning oils and lotions . . you can tell its natural and I LOVE the coffee smell : -RRB-
 I 'm one of those people who have a hard time tanning . But with this stuff its so easy . Plus it smells like coffee which is great since I 'm not a fan of coconut -LRB- which is what all the other tanning oils tend to smell like -RRB- Its a combination of oil and a lotion.I will never use anything else for my tanning needs !!
 I love this product !!! It works and its healthy !!! and it smells so good !!!! It also came so fast !!! Love it !!
 My friend lives in Hawaii and knows i love being tan , she sent me this product and i am hooked , you get a gorgeous color that lasts so long and i dont peel ... I have had people come up to me at the pool , asking where i got this because they have tried it and loved it ... worth the price , it lasts a long time .
 i love maui babe ! I first found out about it when I was in Hawaii and was so happy that i could get it online ! I use it both outside and in tanning beds ... I saw results within a 2 or 3 uses : -RSB-
 Been using this product since I visited Hawaii and found it there in a local shop . It browns quickly and I can stay out in the sun for hours and not burn also . I rarely use anything else .
 This is the best stuff ! It comes out of the bottle brown and takes no time to get a tan . Everyone asks me where I 've been to get so tan .
 This is the best tanning lotion on the market . it gives the best color I have ever seen , and it 's not greasy at all . Good bang for your buck !!
 ***** I found out about Maui Babe during a recent vacation to Hawaii . Initially I thought it was very expensive , but after using it , I changed my mind . A little goes a long way , it smells wonderful , moisturizes great , and this was the first trip that I did n't burn at all -- just got a great tan . I used Maui Babe to moisturize my skin during the day and to help me tan instead of burn , and then one last time after a shower at night , even though I would n't be going into the sun again , because it just feels so good.Maui Babe has to be shaken up to disperse all of the different ingredients . Then when it comes out it immediately starts to sort of `` melt '' or get liquidy -LRB- less solid -RRB- right in your hand . It contains light mineral oil , kukui nut oil , vitamins E , C & A , Kona coffee plant extract , aloe , and potassium iodide . The dominant smell is coffee and nut butter -- really wonderful smell for men or women . All ingredients are Hawaiian and the lotion is made in Wailuku , Maui.The label on the back says that it is the aloe that helps prevent burning , and of course , it soothes the skin after being in the sun , too . The label says that it is `` water resistant '' -LRB- because of the oil , I 'm guessing -RRB- . The label also says that it can be used with all sunscreens and as a `` tan accelerant '' . You have to be careful to really rub in it well if you put on clothes after applying , because Maui Babe is very slightly brown in color when it gets on your skin -- so slightly that it 's really not noticeable -LRB- unlike a stain or self-tanner -RRB- -- but enough so that it will get on your clothes . So just rub it in very well , and you 'll have no problems at all.I love it and I will buy it again and again . Highly recommended . *****
 This is by far the best Suntan lotion I have ever used . I am a red head , and I turn red or if I use tanner I turn orange . With Maui Babe I do get brown . It must be the Kona coffee . I really do n't care what it is that makes it work ... IT JUST WORKS ...
 This is without a doubt THE BEST tanning lotion I 've ever used.You tan FAST and you tan DARK.I can not begin to tell you how well this works.As a matter of fact , I think I 'll reorder while I 'm here ... Great Stuff !!

 This lotion is exactly as promised . It is the best outdoor lotion I have ever used . Amazing results !
 Great tanning lotion , my friend who lives in Hawaii introduced this to me and i wont use anything else , worth the extra cost , you wo n't be disappointed .
 I love this stuff - I just never seem to buy enough when I am in Hawaii . It is great for outdoors and tanning beds !!

 This is a very special product containing coffee . . which turns out to be very good for the skin .
 The best tanning lotion I have ever had , and I know how to get a good tan . This product is the best !!! Goes on smooth , and smells like coffee -LRB- really a good smell -RRB- . Hope you get as tan as I do with this . You wo n't burn .
 this stuff is AWESOME . first of all , it works in a really short amount of time . so be realllly careful as you can burn especially if you dont have an spf on under it . it makes you BROWN and i have never turned brown before , always bright red like a lobster . also since it has coffee in it i swear it gives me a buzz ! like my skin feels awake . i love this stuff and i am a repeat customer ! remember be safe in the sun !
 Great ! No stains , fast tan . Lessons the need for extended stays in the sun . Used it for 4 years , and will continue to do so .
 Love my Maui babe lotion ! But one of the bottles that came exploded in the box and after telling you this I never did receive another bottle . . ??
 Love it ! I used it in Maui and glad I can get it in Indiana . It 's great except , it leaves you feeling really greasy . If you have dry skin , then you will love it . It does n't turn you Orange either !
 This browning lotion was all it was advertised to be . And it has a pleasant odor reminiscent of coffee . I had a sudden urge to have a Danish after applying it .
 Used this on the first day of a week-long vacation at the jersey shore . LOVED IT . I did n't use sunscreen -LRB- stupid , i know -RRB- but i did n't burn and i was nice and brown . I have medium skin tone .
 A friend of mine turned me onto this and it is the best suntan lotion on the market!It really helps you get a darker tan if that is what you 're after .
 I LOOOVVVEEE this amazing lotion . Bought in small surf shop on visit to Cali last year and got hooked . Received this shipment within a few days and just in time for my vacation . Everyone that tried it is now ordering it . The tan is amazing on everyone and it lasts . Try it . . You will be hooked too !
 This tanning lotion is absolutely wonderful . The darkest I have ever been . It does leave you a little greasy -LRB- not bad -RRB- but some so keep this in mind . This lotion is so great its like you can tan without even being in the sun . Your tan will be brown like the ole copperton commercials . Try it you will like it !
 This is simply the best way to get a fast dark tan EVER ! The less time you spend in the sun the less chance of getting skin cancer and a bunch of wrinkles ... so the faster I can `` cop a tan '' the better ! In addition some research indicates that caffeine -LRB- an ingredient of this product -RRB- may help prevent skin cancer . It is a little oily at 1st but it makes you look darker instantly ! After it soaks in your skin is just really soft and silky ... and it does n't have all the chemicals of commercial products .
 This is the best tanning lotion I 've ever used . I have fair , freckled skin and I get a deep , dark tan using Maui Brown Babe . I use a light sunscreen like an 8 under it until a base is established . I have used this to tan in Hawaii and Mexico . It is pretty greasy and smells a little like coffee , but if you want a nice tan in a short time , you 'll get past that .
 I found this product while in maui . I love it ! It makes your skin soft and turns your skin a deep dark brown .
 Folks without question this is the best tanning product out there.One thing to keep in mind is if you have a pool wipe off before entering . Just like other oils , this can leave scum on pool liners but even more so in the filter systems . I clean our own pool and when I remove cartridges , there are definite brown spots that do not wash off . Waterfalls and spas may create chocolate foam . I do not believe it hurts the systems just a little disconcerting . `` MAUI-BABE '' keeps the bugs away ... I kid you not it works .
 This is the best lotion on the market and well worth the price I love it .
 I have never used a suntan product that worked as well and as quickly at this one . I am 100 % pleased and I am recommending it to all my friends .
 Love this stuff - makes my skin nice and brown and soft ! Use to burn but not with this great lotion . Great price as well .

 This suntan lotion is one of the best I have ever used . I used it in Hawaii 5 years ago during a visit and have used it ever since . The items I bought is at an excellent price . I am happy with my lotions and recommened the prices of this seller . Highly recommended . . Thank you again ... Frank
 This stuff is great . I read the reviews of other fair skinned people liking this product , and decided to buy a trial bottle . I waited until it arrived and then until a day when the sun was out and I hd some free time . I put it on and headed upstairs for some tanning on my roof.This stuff works . I do n't know if it is the kukui nut oil that slowly browns on your skin or the ground Kona coffee beans that do it , but something about this formula works . It also tingles on your skin , possibly from the coffee beans as well , so you feel slightly energized.It does have a faint coffee smell and despite being labled a lotion -- it contains some mineral oil -- will feel more like an oil once it warms up in the sun.I liked it so much the first day -LRB- noticable difference in skin tone after just 3 hours -RRB- that I came back and ordered another 2 bottles . I am almost through the second one now and am a good deal darker . So much so , that people that meet me now , do n't think I have fair skin.I do all my tanning in the sun , but if you want to use the tanning beds , I would suggest you use the version of Maui Babe that is designed for that . The regular version leaves too much of a mess to clean up afterwards.I would recommend this product to all skin types , but be sure to lay down a coat of SPF below the Maui Babe , since it does n't contain any . It does have aloe , which helps if you do burn slightly .
 Maui Babe is an essential for any beach trip . It browns the skin like no other product , and it smells great . It 's a little too messy to use in the tanning bed because it 's so oily , but great for a day in the sun !
 Maui Babe is by far the best tanning product that I have ever come across . I actually found it in a tanning salon on Long Island -LSB- where I 'm from -RSB- . It was alittle pricey , but I thought I 'd give it a whirl . I will never use any other tanning product . The only thing is , it wo n't be good for you guys and girls who do n't like an oil based product . The smell of the kona coffee content is n't bad either . It even keeps you from burning -LSB- like it says on the package -RSB- . Just take note-that even though it says it 's a browning LOTION , it does CONTAIN some mineral oil , like I mentioned earlier . Also , do yourself a favor and buy it through AMAZON , you ca n't beat the price . Happy Tanning !
 The best stuff I have ever used . Highly recommend this tanning lotion to anyone who wants a dark tan as if they just left the islands .

 This is one of the few sunscreens that does not contain any of the petro chemical based carcinogens present in just about all commercial sun tan lotions . Not only is it all natural , but it allows you to get a great tan , is waterproof and allows you to put a stronger sunscreen on top of it .
 This lotion has a wonderful rose scent ! Just like a real rose . It 's the best I 've tried so far . I also tried the bar soap . I also loved that to ! If you love rose scent you wo n't be disapointed .
 The lotion is nice , not the cheap kind , and it has a pleasant rose scent , though it does n't linger . It would be nicer if the pump actually worked .
 Woods of Windsor Hand Cream is wonderful !! It keeps my hands soft and looking great !! I would n't use anything else .
 I love the hand cream is very perfumed and definetly I would buy it again . I keep using it every day , I recomend to my friends and is a perfect for presents .
 If you love mixing up your own masks , this is one product that makes home spa time really fun . Not only do you get to walk around with a green mask on your face frightening anyone in sight -LRB- including the cat -RRB- , it is refreshing and tingly.Burt 's Bees has done it again . Not only do they produce products that are healing for the skin , there is also a calming , emotional element that makes you feel loved and nurtured by nature itself.IngredientsFrench green clay , bentonite -LRB- natural clay -RRB- , fragrance , mentha piperita -LRB- peppermint -RRB- leaf , shavegrass herb , calendula officinalis flower , rosemarinus officinalis -LRB- rosemary -RRB- leaf , salvia officinalis -LRB- sage -RRB- leaf.Actually , this product will make you feel more calm . I loved how it tingles and how the powder can also be mixed with my favorite moisture mask . That way I get a moisturizing and tingling experience.I 've rarely seen a product clean pores this well . You can simply pour some of the green powder into your hand and mix in a little water or liquid of your choice as listed in the instructions . ~ The Rebecca Review

 I found this in a five and dime in Hawaii about 15 hrs ago . The best sun lotion ever . Shared with all my friends . ICa n't believe how well known it 's become . I like to think it 's because of me ! However the price has gone up a bitSince I first bought it . I used to ask my brother to send me more . He lives there . Now it 's so easy to get . On line , by phone.Even some retail outlets . Beautiful tan , without the burn .
 This lotion used to get me so tan ... not sure what is different ... but I am not seeing the same long lasting effects it once had . There could be many reasons for this . It could be my skin , the sun ... who knows !
 When i ordered it , came very quickly , in time for my trip to The Caribbean islands !! Great service !! Will use them again !!
 This suntan lotion is one of the best I have ever used . I used it in Hawaii 5 years ago during a visit and have used it ever since . The items I bought is at an excellent price . I am happy with my lotions and recommened the prices of this seller . Highly recommended . . Thank you again ... Frank
 This stuff is great . I read the reviews of other fair skinned people liking this product , and decided to buy a trial bottle . I waited until it arrived and then until a day when the sun was out and I hd some free time . I put it on and headed upstairs for some tanning on my roof.This stuff works . I do n't know if it is the kukui nut oil that slowly browns on your skin or the ground Kona coffee beans that do it , but something about this formula works . It also tingles on your skin , possibly from the coffee beans as well , so you feel slightly energized.It does have a faint coffee smell and despite being labled a lotion -- it contains some mineral oil -- will feel more like an oil once it warms up in the sun.I liked it so much the first day -LRB- noticable difference in skin tone after just 3 hours -RRB- that I came back and ordered another 2 bottles . I am almost through the second one now and am a good deal darker . So much so , that people that meet me now , do n't think I have fair skin.I do all my tanning in the sun , but if you want to use the tanning beds , I would suggest you use the version of Maui Babe that is designed for that . The regular version leaves too much of a mess to clean up afterwards.I would recommend this product to all skin types , but be sure to lay down a coat of SPF below the Maui Babe , since it does n't contain any . It does have aloe , which helps if you do burn slightly .
 Maui Babe is an essential for any beach trip . It browns the skin like no other product , and it smells great . It 's a little too messy to use in the tanning bed because it 's so oily , but great for a day in the sun !
 Maui Babe is by far the best tanning product that I have ever come across . I actually found it in a tanning salon on Long Island -LSB- where I 'm from -RSB- . It was alittle pricey , but I thought I 'd give it a whirl . I will never use any other tanning product . The only thing is , it wo n't be good for you guys and girls who do n't like an oil based product . The smell of the kona coffee content is n't bad either . It even keeps you from burning -LSB- like it says on the package -RSB- . Just take note-that even though it says it 's a browning LOTION , it does CONTAIN some mineral oil , like I mentioned earlier . Also , do yourself a favor and buy it through AMAZON , you ca n't beat the price . Happy Tanning !
 The best stuff I have ever used . Highly recommend this tanning lotion to anyone who wants a dark tan as if they just left the islands .
 ***** I found out about Maui Babe during a recent vacation to Hawaii . Initially I thought it was very expensive , but after using it , I changed my mind . A little goes a long way , it smells wonderful , moisturizes great , and this was the first trip that I did n't burn at all -- just got a great tan . I used Maui Babe to moisturize my skin during the day and to help me tan instead of burn , and then one last time after a shower at night , even though I would n't be going into the sun again , because it just feels so good.Maui Babe has to be shaken up to disperse all of the different ingredients . Then when it comes out it immediately starts to sort of `` melt '' or get liquidy -LRB- less solid -RRB- right in your hand . It contains light mineral oil , kukui nut oil , vitamins E , C & A , Kona coffee plant extract , aloe , and potassium iodide . The dominant smell is coffee and nut butter -- really wonderful smell for men or women . All ingredients are Hawaiian and the lotion is made in Wailuku , Maui.The label on the back says that it is the aloe that helps prevent burning , and of course , it soothes the skin after being in the sun , too . The label says that it is `` water resistant '' -LRB- because of the oil , I 'm guessing -RRB- . The label also says that it can be used with all sunscreens and as a `` tan accelerant '' . You have to be careful to really rub in it well if you put on clothes after applying , because Maui Babe is very slightly brown in color when it gets on your skin -- so slightly that it 's really not noticeable -LRB- unlike a stain or self-tanner -RRB- -- but enough so that it will get on your clothes . So just rub it in very well , and you 'll have no problems at all.I love it and I will buy it again and again . Highly recommended . *****
 This is one of the few sunscreens that does not contain any of the petro chemical based carcinogens present in just about all commercial sun tan lotions . Not only is it all natural , but it allows you to get a great tan , is waterproof and allows you to put a stronger sunscreen on top of it .
 This tanning lotion is absolutely wonderful . The darkest I have ever been . It does leave you a little greasy -LRB- not bad -RRB- but some so keep this in mind . This lotion is so great its like you can tan without even being in the sun . Your tan will be brown like the ole copperton commercials . Try it you will like it !
 This is simply the best way to get a fast dark tan EVER ! The less time you spend in the sun the less chance of getting skin cancer and a bunch of wrinkles ... so the faster I can `` cop a tan '' the better ! In addition some research indicates that caffeine -LRB- an ingredient of this product -RRB- may help prevent skin cancer . It is a little oily at 1st but it makes you look darker instantly ! After it soaks in your skin is just really soft and silky ... and it does n't have all the chemicals of commercial products .
 This is the best tanning lotion I 've ever used . I have fair , freckled skin and I get a deep , dark tan using Maui Brown Babe . I use a light sunscreen like an 8 under it until a base is established . I have used this to tan in Hawaii and Mexico . It is pretty greasy and smells a little like coffee , but if you want a nice tan in a short time , you 'll get past that .
 I found this product while in maui . I love it ! It makes your skin soft and turns your skin a deep dark brown .
 Folks without question this is the best tanning product out there.One thing to keep in mind is if you have a pool wipe off before entering . Just like other oils , this can leave scum on pool liners but even more so in the filter systems . I clean our own pool and when I remove cartridges , there are definite brown spots that do not wash off . Waterfalls and spas may create chocolate foam . I do not believe it hurts the systems just a little disconcerting . `` MAUI-BABE '' keeps the bugs away ... I kid you not it works .
 This is the best lotion on the market and well worth the price I love it .
 I have never used a suntan product that worked as well and as quickly at this one . I am 100 % pleased and I am recommending it to all my friends .
 Love this stuff - makes my skin nice and brown and soft ! Use to burn but not with this great lotion . Great price as well .

 The best tanning lotion I have ever had , and I know how to get a good tan . This product is the best !!! Goes on smooth , and smells like coffee -LRB- really a good smell -RRB- . Hope you get as tan as I do with this . You wo n't burn .
 this stuff is AWESOME . first of all , it works in a really short amount of time . so be realllly careful as you can burn especially if you dont have an spf on under it . it makes you BROWN and i have never turned brown before , always bright red like a lobster . also since it has coffee in it i swear it gives me a buzz ! like my skin feels awake . i love this stuff and i am a repeat customer ! remember be safe in the sun !
 Great ! No stains , fast tan . Lessons the need for extended stays in the sun . Used it for 4 years , and will continue to do so .
 Love my Maui babe lotion ! But one of the bottles that came exploded in the box and after telling you this I never did receive another bottle . . ??
 Love it ! I used it in Maui and glad I can get it in Indiana . It 's great except , it leaves you feeling really greasy . If you have dry skin , then you will love it . It does n't turn you Orange either !
 This browning lotion was all it was advertised to be . And it has a pleasant odor reminiscent of coffee . I had a sudden urge to have a Danish after applying it .
 Used this on the first day of a week-long vacation at the jersey shore . LOVED IT . I did n't use sunscreen -LRB- stupid , i know -RRB- but i did n't burn and i was nice and brown . I have medium skin tone .
 A friend of mine turned me onto this and it is the best suntan lotion on the market!It really helps you get a darker tan if that is what you 're after .
 I LOOOVVVEEE this amazing lotion . Bought in small surf shop on visit to Cali last year and got hooked . Received this shipment within a few days and just in time for my vacation . Everyone that tried it is now ordering it . The tan is amazing on everyone and it lasts . Try it . . You will be hooked too !

 This is a very special product containing coffee . . which turns out to be very good for the skin .
 I love these hair products ! I drink a ton of water & take my vitamins as well as use high end hair care & dry scalp has suddenly become an issue , this shampoo & conditioner helps me with the issue & makes my hair so soft , however I do n't dye or chemically treat my hair in any way but I do know people who do & have used this & love it as well ! The containers are very large so you get a lot for your $ money !
 I love this shampoo . I usually use the cheapest shampoo I can find in the grocery store ... but I wanted to spoil my hair a little bit so I looked for a shampoo that was decently priced but with good reviews . It is very moisturizing and a little amount goes a long way . I recommend : -RRB-
 I love Kerasilk 's shampoo and conditioner . I 'm an African American women and its hard for me to find good products for my hair that wont dry and damage . I recommend this product for everyone but especially for women with course hair . This treatment will leave your hair silky , shining and healthy . Buy Kersilk because it works , I promise !!!
 I have used Kerasilf for years . It is pricey but your hair is so healthy when you use Kerasilk products .
 This is a great product that actually penetrates the hair shaft and forces the outer cuticle to lay flat.I have very dry , extremely thick , coarse hair . My cosmetician recommended Kerasilk to me years ago and I 've been using it ever since.Kudo 's to Kerasilk from this `` hay head '' gal needing to tame the mane .
 I had tried the high end Salon products and paying double for it . I have corse textured hair that I color . And I came across this shampoo and decided to try it . Now I am hooked . I love the shampoo , it 's got great lather and it smells wonderful -LRB- I 'm very into smells -RRB- . And it gently cleans your hair , washes out , and for the price , you ca n't beat it . I 'm sold on it . Used up my first bottle and went to reorder my second bottle . A little goes a long way because it has great lather . It really cleans well and does n't dry out the hair . I 'll stick with some of the high end Salon products for styling but when it comes to shampoo , this has made me a repeat buyer .
 recently i bought the Goldwell Ultra Rich Care Shampoo , only , and it works really well ! The smell is nice , like I just washed my hair in the salon , and it makes my hair really smooth and manageable . My hair used to be very frizzy and so messy , but after using JUST the shampoo , it became really smooth and became straighter . I would definitely buy the conditioner and treatment as well . THIS STUFF IS REALLY GOOD ! i seriously recommend you to buy it . i 'll add another review after buying the conditioner and using the treatment . 5 stars !
 I have coarse , long , curly hair . I usually brush my hair in the shower while conditioner is in it because if I try the same outside of the shower , it 's a disaster . But this conditioner does exactly what it says it will do , the ONLY con is that it is a little heavy and will weigh down finer hair . For hair like mine , it made it shiny , smooth , less frizzy , easier to manage , and just generally healthier . The moment I put it in my hair , I would leave it in for 5-10 minutes while I shaved or did something else , then brush through it without a problem . Rinsing it out , my hair felt like silk . And the benefit is in the big bottles - for people with a LOT of hair like me , these bottles go a long way ! Definitely recommended if you have damaged hair or just want naturally healthier hair .
 This discontinued cologne is my husband 's favourite and I was thrilled to find it for sale on Amazon.com.Product received in good condition and as advertised . Thanks !
 The best tanning lotion I have ever had , and I know how to get a good tan . This product is the best !!! Goes on smooth , and smells like coffee -LRB- really a good smell -RRB- . Hope you get as tan as I do with this . You wo n't burn .

 Lucky me , I work in a tanning salon so trying all different kinds of lotion has became a hobby of mine.My boss ordered boxes and boxes of this stuff , he told me all about it , being from Hawaii , and how it is all natural.It is n't like your typical tanning lotions , SO of course I HAD to try it ! Remember this is a BROWNING lotion , all natural , no bronzers.I do like bronzers , although some lotions can turn you orange-y , this gives you BROWN natural looking color.For those of you who like instant gratification , it does just THAT ! As soon as you put it on it browns you so well.I have got one of the best tans I have ever had from this lotion.The only thing I do NOT like about this product is how oily it is.It is a lotion-y oil though , not like baby oil.BUT I 've found it you put on a lotion -LRB- recommend just an accelerator , no bronzers -RRB- it is n't as oily , it just makes your skin super soft.No stick at all ! I mixed mine with Designer Skin 's Phoenician , that I did purchase off of here for about $ 33 . So if you 're tanning with this before you have to be somewhere , like work or running errands I do n't recommend using this before , unless you do n't mind being a little oily.A little bit goes a long way ! It 's spreads on SO nicely.The smell is good , I personally do n't mind it.I have seen on other people 's reviews they did n't like the scent.I like to compare the scent to Bit ' O Honey candy.So I definitely give Maui Babe an A + + and recommend this product to anyone !! Great Tan , Good Texture , Good Scent.Sorry for the long review ! Enjoy ! : -RRB-
 product works well i love it , i 've only had it for a day stayed out in the sun for most of the day and already see results and it does not make me orange like other products i have tried will keep buying this product
 Simply the best tanning lotion I have come across , great value for money and seemless delivery via Amazon . Highly recommended .
 This stuff smells a little weird but that 's probably because I 'm not used to rubbing coffee on my body . Works GREAT as a moisturizer and they claim that the caffeine helps reduce the chance of skin cancer to form which is also amazing ! I would HIGHLY recommend for the type of person who either burns easy or loves to lay in the sun ! But careful stains clothing ... coffee ...

I like to think it 's because of me ! However the price has gone up a bitSince I first bought it . I used to ask my brother to send me more . He lives there . Now it 's so easy to get . On line , by phone.Even some retail outlets . Beautiful tan , without the burn .
 This lotion used to get me so tan ... not sure what is different ... but I am not seeing the same long lasting effects it once had . There could be many reasons for this . It could be my skin , the sun ... who knows !
 When i ordered it , came very quickly , in time for my trip to The Caribbean islands !! Great service !! Will use them again !!
 ***** I found out about Maui Babe during a recent vacation to Hawaii . Initially I thought it was very expensive , but after using it , I changed my mind . A little goes a long way , it smells wonderful , moisturizes great , and this was the first trip that I did n't burn at all -- just got a great tan . I used Maui Babe to moisturize my skin during the day and to help me tan instead of burn , and then one last time after a shower at night , even though I would n't be going into the sun again , because it just feels so good.Maui Babe has to be shaken up to disperse all of the different ingredients . Then when it comes out it immediately starts to sort of `` melt '' or get liquidy -LRB- less solid -RRB- right in your hand . It contains light mineral oil , kukui nut oil , vitamins E , C & A , Kona coffee plant extract , aloe , and potassium iodide . The dominant smell is coffee and nut butter -- really wonderful smell for men or women . All ingredients are Hawaiian and the lotion is made in Wailuku , Maui.The label on the back says that it is the aloe that helps prevent burning , and of course , it soothes the skin after being in the sun , too . The label says that it is `` water resistant '' -LRB- because of the oil , I 'm guessing -RRB- . The label also says that it can be used with all sunscreens and as a `` tan accelerant '' . You have to be careful to really rub in it well if you put on clothes after applying , because Maui Babe is very slightly brown in color when it gets on your skin -- so slightly that it 's really not noticeable -LRB- unlike a stain or self-tanner -RRB- -- but enough so that it will get on your clothes . So just rub it in very well , and you 'll have no problems at all.I love it and I will buy it again and again . Highly recommended . *****
 This is by far the best Suntan lotion I have ever used . I am a red head , and I turn red or if I use tanner I turn orange . With Maui Babe I do get brown . It must be the Kona coffee . I really do n't care what it is that makes it work ... IT JUST WORKS ...
 This is without a doubt THE BEST tanning lotion I 've ever used.You tan FAST and you tan DARK.I can not begin to tell you how well this works.As a matter of fact , I think I 'll reorder while I 'm here ... Great Stuff !!

 This lotion is exactly as promised . It is the best outdoor lotion I have ever used . Amazing results !
 Great tanning lotion , my friend who lives in Hawaii introduced this to me and i wont use anything else , worth the extra cost , you wo n't be disappointed .
 I love this stuff - I just never seem to buy enough when I am in Hawaii . It is great for outdoors and tanning beds !!
 I do n't have any experience with this company but I can definitely vouch for the original product . I found the 4oz bottle in Target for $ 10 . . works and feels better than any tanning oils and lotions . . you can tell its natural and I LOVE the coffee smell : -RRB-
 I 'm one of those people who have a hard time tanning . But with this stuff its so easy . Plus it smells like coffee which is great since I 'm not a fan of coconut -LRB- which is what all the other tanning oils tend to smell like -RRB- Its a combination of oil and a lotion.I will never use anything else for my tanning needs !!
 I love this product !!! It works and its healthy !!! and it smells so good !!!! It also came so fast !!! Love it !!
 My friend lives in Hawaii and knows i love being tan , she sent me this product and i am hooked , you get a gorgeous color that lasts so long and i dont peel ... I have had people come up to me at the pool , asking where i got this because they have tried it and loved it ... worth the price , it lasts a long time .
 i love maui babe ! I first found out about it when I was in Hawaii and was so happy that i could get it online ! I use it both outside and in tanning beds ... I saw results within a 2 or 3 uses : -RSB-
 Been using this product since I visited Hawaii and found it there in a local shop . It browns quickly and I can stay out in the sun for hours and not burn also . I rarely use anything else .
 This is the best stuff ! It comes out of the bottle brown and takes no time to get a tan . Everyone asks me where I 've been to get so tan .
 This is the best tanning lotion on the market . it gives the best color I have ever seen , and it 's not greasy at all . Good bang for your buck !!
 It makes my hair smooth and my hair looks healthy after using it . It 's a great product giving the price .
 I like this product because I have hair that has low porosity , which means it takes forever to dry -- upwards of 6 hours and my hair is about 3 inches long . This conditioner greatly reduces the drying time -LRB- ~ 2 hours -RRB- without sacrificing the moisture . It does n't coat my hair and is pleasantly scented . The only reason why I did n't give it 5 stars is that it could afford to be just a tad richer .
 i dont know how to describe ... i just feel good even though the smell is not good . . but can prove it didnt add perfume and im a Asian it also suitable to Asian
 This conditioner does n't leave my hair feeling overly plascticized or scented . It 's my second favorite conditioner . My first choice would be the recipe Nature 's Gate used up until about 5 or 6 years ago sold in the shorted but wider bottles . Alas , that is no longer available .
 The best tanning lotion I have ever had , and I know how to get a good tan . This product is the best !!! Goes on smooth , and smells like coffee -LRB- really a good smell -RRB- . Hope you get as tan as I do with this . You wo n't burn .
 this stuff is AWESOME . first of all , it works in a really short amount of time . so be realllly careful as you can burn especially if you dont have an spf on under it . it makes you BROWN and i have never turned brown before , always bright red like a lobster . also since it has coffee in it i swear it gives me a buzz ! like my skin feels awake . i love this stuff and i am a repeat customer ! remember be safe in the sun !
 Great ! No stains , fast tan . Lessons the need for extended stays in the sun . Used it for 4 years , and will continue to do so .
 Love my Maui babe lotion ! But one of the bottles that came exploded in the box and after telling you this I never did receive another bottle . . ??
 Love it ! I used it in Maui and glad I can get it in Indiana . It 's great except , it leaves you feeling really greasy . If you have dry skin , then you will love it . It does n't turn you Orange either !
 This browning lotion was all it was advertised to be . And it has a pleasant odor reminiscent of coffee . I had a sudden urge to have a Danish after applying it .
 Used this on the first day of a week-long vacation at the jersey shore . LOVED IT . I did n't use sunscreen -LRB- stupid , i know -RRB- but i did n't burn and i was nice and brown . I have medium skin tone .
 A friend of mine turned me onto this and it is the best suntan lotion on the market!It really helps you get a darker tan if that is what you 're after .
 I LOOOVVVEEE this amazing lotion . Bought in small surf shop on visit to Cali last year and got hooked . Received this shipment within a few days and just in time for my vacation . Everyone that tried it is now ordering it . The tan is amazing on everyone and it lasts . Try it . . You will be hooked too !

 This is a very special product containing coffee . . which turns out to be very good for the skin .
 This suntan lotion is one of the best I have ever used . I used it in Hawaii 5 years ago during a visit and have used it ever since . The items I bought is at an excellent price . I am happy with my lotions and recommened the prices of this seller . Highly recommended . . Thank you again ... Frank
 This stuff is great . I read the reviews of other fair skinned people liking this product , and decided to buy a trial bottle . I waited until it arrived and then until a day when the sun was out and I hd some free time . I put it on and headed upstairs for some tanning on my roof.This stuff works . I do n't know if it is the kukui nut oil that slowly browns on your skin or the ground Kona coffee beans that do it , but something about this formula works . It also tingles on your skin , possibly from the coffee beans as well , so you feel slightly energized.It does have a faint coffee smell and despite being labled a lotion -- it contains some mineral oil -- will feel more like an oil once it warms up in the sun.I liked it so much the first day -LRB- noticable difference in skin tone after just 3 hours -RRB- that I came back and ordered another 2 bottles . I am almost through the second one now and am a good deal darker . So much so , that people that meet me now , do n't think I have fair skin.I do all my tanning in the sun , but if you want to use the tanning beds , I would suggest you use the version of Maui Babe that is designed for that . The regular version leaves too much of a mess to clean up afterwards.I would recommend this product to all skin types , but be sure to lay down a coat of SPF below the Maui Babe , since it does n't contain any . It does have aloe , which helps if you do burn slightly .
 Maui Babe is an essential for any beach trip . It browns the skin like no other product , and it smells great . It 's a little too messy to use in the tanning bed because it 's so oily , but great for a day in the sun !
 Maui Babe is by far the best tanning product that I have ever come across . I actually found it in a tanning salon on Long Island -LSB- where I 'm from -RSB- . It was alittle pricey , but I thought I 'd give it a whirl . I will never use any other tanning product . The only thing is , it wo n't be good for you guys and girls who do n't like an oil based product . The smell of the kona coffee content is n't bad either . It even keeps you from burning -LSB- like it says on the package -RSB- . Just take note-that even though it says it 's a browning LOTION , it does CONTAIN some mineral oil , like I mentioned earlier . Also , do yourself a favor and buy it through AMAZON , you ca n't beat the price . Happy Tanning !
 The best stuff I have ever used . Highly recommend this tanning lotion to anyone who wants a dark tan as if they just left the islands .

 This is one of the few sunscreens that does not contain any of the petro chemical based carcinogens present in just about all commercial sun tan lotions . Not only is it all natural , but it allows you to get a great tan , is waterproof and allows you to put a stronger sunscreen on top of it .
 This tanning lotion is absolutely wonderful . The darkest I have ever been . It does leave you a little greasy -LRB- not bad -RRB- but some so keep this in mind . This lotion is so great its like you can tan without even being in the sun . Your tan will be brown like the ole copperton commercials . Try it you will like it !
 This is simply the best way to get a fast dark tan EVER ! The less time you spend in the sun the less chance of getting skin cancer and a bunch of wrinkles ... so the faster I can `` cop a tan '' the better ! In addition some research indicates that caffeine -LRB- an ingredient of this product -RRB- may help prevent skin cancer . It is a little oily at 1st but it makes you look darker instantly ! After it soaks in your skin is just really soft and silky ... and it does n't have all the chemicals of commercial products .
 This is the best tanning lotion I 've ever used . I have fair , freckled skin and I get a deep , dark tan using Maui Brown Babe . I use a light sunscreen like an 8 under it until a base is established . I have used this to tan in Hawaii and Mexico . It is pretty greasy and smells a little like coffee , but if you want a nice tan in a short time , you 'll get past that .
 I found this product while in maui . I love it ! It makes your skin soft and turns your skin a deep dark brown .
 Folks without question this is the best tanning product out there.One thing to keep in mind is if you have a pool wipe off before entering . Just like other oils , this can leave scum on pool liners but even more so in the filter systems . I clean our own pool and when I remove cartridges , there are definite brown spots that do not wash off . Waterfalls and spas may create chocolate foam . I do not believe it hurts the systems just a little disconcerting . `` MAUI-BABE '' keeps the bugs away ... I kid you not it works .
 This is the best lotion on the market and well worth the price I love it .
 I have never used a suntan product that worked as well and as quickly at this one . I am 100 % pleased and I am recommending it to all my friends .
 Love this stuff - makes my skin nice and brown and soft ! Use to burn but not with this great lotion . Great price as well .

 Lucky me , I work in a tanning salon so trying all different kinds of lotion has became a hobby of mine.My boss ordered boxes and boxes of this stuff , he told me all about it , being from Hawaii , and how it is all natural.It is n't like your typical tanning lotions , SO of course I HAD to try it ! Remember this is a BROWNING lotion , all natural , no bronzers.I do like bronzers , although some lotions can turn you orange-y , this gives you BROWN natural looking color.For those of you who like instant gratification , it does just THAT ! As soon as you put it on it browns you so well.I have got one of the best tans I have ever had from this lotion.The only thing I do NOT like about this product is how oily it is.It is a lotion-y oil though , not like baby oil.BUT I 've found it you put on a lotion -LRB- recommend just an accelerator , no bronzers -RRB- it is n't as oily , it just makes your skin super soft.No stick at all ! I mixed mine with Designer Skin 's Phoenician , that I did purchase off of here for about $ 33 . So if you 're tanning with this before you have to be somewhere , like work or running errands I do n't recommend using this before , unless you do n't mind being a little oily.A little bit goes a long way ! It 's spreads on SO nicely.The smell is good , I personally do n't mind it.I have seen on other people 's reviews they did n't like the scent.I like to compare the scent to Bit ' O Honey candy.So I definitely give Maui Babe an A + + and recommend this product to anyone !! Great Tan , Good Texture , Good Scent.Sorry for the long review ! Enjoy ! : -RRB-
 product works well i love it , i 've only had it for a day stayed out in the sun for most of the day and already see results and it does not make me orange like other products i have tried will keep buying this product
 Simply the best tanning lotion I have come across , great value for money and seemless delivery via Amazon . Highly recommended .
 This stuff smells a little weird but that 's probably because I 'm not used to rubbing coffee on my body . Works GREAT as a moisturizer and they claim that the caffeine helps reduce the chance of skin cancer to form which is also amazing ! I would HIGHLY recommend for the type of person who either burns easy or loves to lay in the sun ! But careful stains clothing ... coffee ...

 This is the best tanning lotion on the market . it gives the best color I have ever seen , and it 's not greasy at all . Good bang for your buck !!
 You wo n't need to use the entire bar to get a huge amount of bubbles . Amandopondo might be the most bubble-producing bubble bar from Lush . The scent creates serenity and the lack of colour makes it perfect to mix with your favourite bath bomb . I find myself using this bubble bar , Blue Skies , and Ice Hotel more than any others .
 I 've been a Lushie for a while but never tried this bar . Got the chance today and Yay ! I only used about an eighth of the bar and the bubbles would not stop ! The water became quite soft and while there was no color it was a great experience ! I wish I could comment on the scent but as I am sick I could n't smell it!Overall a wonderful bubble bar !
 I do n't mean your typical rose-scented drugstore soap . I mean the scent of a formal rose garden in June , with everything in full bloom and the heirloom roses perfuming the entire garden , and the honeybees going nuts , and closing your eyes and wanting to weep when you stick your nose into an old rose bred for fragrance , not form . That 's the sort of rose scent you get from Amondopondo . I do n't use it often , but every time I * do * use it , I wonder why I * do n't * use it more often .
 I have gone back twice to order soaps , bath bubbles , and bath bombs , from the Lush site . The product is fun , lasting aroma , and high quality
 This book is a must have for any henna artist . Regardless if your a first time novice or a lifer with yrs of experience.Catherine Cartwright-Jones has studied hard and put the time in to get such a large collection of fantastic designs together.Truly amazing book . Highly recommended .
 I am so glad this book is available to everyone . The attention to detail is great.This book is a wonderful addition to any artist 's collection
 This is a fantastic book with great sketches of tradtional and non-traditional patterns . Catherine Cartwright-Jones is the go-to gal for henna info !!!
 I have read quite a few henna books -LRB- both narrative and design books -RRB- . This one is the standard by which I judge all the rest .
 This book is good ... maybe too good ! The very essence of my being ca n't describe the awesomeness of this book . In my years of book reading I have come to the conclusion that this book FREAKIN ' ROCKS !! But really ... it 's got a lot of designs -LRB- actually that 's the only thing it 's got -RRB- . . but the designs rule !! So if you 're lookin for a book of designs BUY THIS ONE AND ONLY !
 Love this book ! Catherine knows her stuff and the patterns along with information is Great . A must for Henna artists .
 I love this powder . It goes on very nice . Makes my complexion look smooth . I noticed that I was complimented on my skin when I first started using this powder . I 'll keep on buying it as long as I can find it .
 I 've used this product and it 's really good specially on chinese skin tone . I took advantage of a trip I made to Miami to buy some refill for me and my nieces but the only problem was the delivery , they delayed the product 1 weekend and i was n't able to take this product with me .
 I 've used this product , having tricked Decleor Keep Control for men -LRB- no longer available -RRB- and , Clairins Anti-Shine gel for men , even Smashbox Antishine . The Shisheido Anti-Shine gels far superior
 Having a very oily forehead/nose/cheek area has always been a problem for me . This product makes you not shine for more than 5 hours . The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is the lack of detailed instructions on its use . Never really having used facial products , the company should invest some ink for men like me . If put on too thick , it ends up caking on your skin .
 Smells good . Does n't leave you feeling clammy like lotion does . It 's a good moisturizer , but beware the grease ! Oh , and do n't leave it in the car - it melts all over . Save it for nighttime .
 I have 2 things nobody ever wants to have1 . Extremely dry hands .2 . Dyshidrosis - a very aggravating form of eczema.Since switching to only pure soap like Ivory & Yardley 's Oatmeal soap.The Dyshidrosis has healed up well.However I was still left with very scaly & hard skin.Using the combination of a foot file & this product on my handshas really made a huge difference.I can actually feel soft , breathing , healthy skin on the palms of my hand.The key in using this product is to use it in steps.Don ' t apply too much too fast.Think of it like washing & waxing your car.The same principle applies here.A good wash , then thin layers buffed well give the best results.There is no water base , so first wash your hands well & let the waterabsorb into your skin a bit & pat dry.Then scoop out a tiny amount & place it into the palm.Work it in really well all over the hands & in-between the fingers.Then just apply a tiny bit more a second time after about 10 min.Your skin will actually absorb the bulk of the oils & be replenished , without that oily feeling.You will feel the protection without it feeling unnatural .
 This is a fantastic product that I use every day at work . I work as an RN in a hospital and am constantly using alcohol based hand cleansers and soap and water washes . My hands were constantly dry and cracked until I started using this product . I keep it in my pocket at work and recommend it to all my coworkers . I do wish there were several scents available , but I like the scent of this formula just fine .
 I just got this yesterday , and used it 3 times over two places so far . Twice on my hands , and one on my feet -LRB- yeah , I know there 's a foot product out there too -RRB- . The bonus of this product is that it lasts a long time and does n't come off as easily as other moisturizers often do . This product is mosly all natural which is also a great bonus for myself since I go for more `` natural '' stuff when I can -LRB- incuding all soaps and stuff too -RRB- . I do n't usually have extremely dry hands , but mostly dry feet and using my feet as an example so far after one application they feel a lot better and walking around the house did n't rub it all off.There are a few negatives , which is why I rated this 4 stars . The first is the smell . The smell is a tad bit powerful somewhat . The second negative is that it can be greasy . What many may not realize is that a little of this product goes a long ways . Therefore , if you buy this , rub a bit off the top , apply it to the hands , and if need be grab some more . The surface is kinda tough , but if you break through it -LRB- push your finger in -RRB- then the softer stuff and easier to manage stuff is inside . I guess it 's the bee 's wax that separates it some perhaps.Overall I recommend trying this product . It 's probably not for everyone , but having tried various moisturizers , this one comes out on top for me .
 You have to love this stuff for the moisturizing as well as the thicker consistency and strong packaging . If you 've ever had lotion spill in your purse or pocket , you 'll understand why this is great .
 I 've used this for many years and love it . It used to be called Farmer 's Friend and if you do much outside work in wet , cold , grease , or dirt this is good stuff . I rub it on whenever I am about to work on bonsai , dig in the garden , work on the car or any other thing that is likely to get my hands and nails very dirty . I make sure I get it under my nails too so that when I wash up later the dirt , oil , etc. comes off easily and my hands are not dried out and chapped - and it 's natural . I Like the masculine smell too . The only negative is the price - a bit steep for as much as I use .
 I work in a resturaunt , so I have to wash my hands dozens of times a day . Plus I work on cars a lot as a hobby . My hands would get extremely dry and cracked , and they would even start bleeding in the winter . Burt 's Bees hand salve is the only stuff I 've found that completely cures my dry , cracked hands .
 This is the best product for extremely dry hands ! I work outside in Colorado where I need my hands and ca n't really wear gloves most of the time . In the winter my hands and face get very dry , and this is the best product to moisturize them . The cold , wind , and dry conditions here are brutal on my hands . Cracked and bleeding knuckles , finger tips , and cuticles . If I use a traditional lotion from the supermarket on my hands , the alcohol makes my hands burn and sting . While the Farmers Friend is soothing and oh so good . The smell is fine also . It has eucalyptus-rosemary smell , which in my opinion , is actually quite enjoyable . If you read the product description , it says that this is their most ` intensive ' treatment . This is more of an ointment that you rub onto your skin and let it slowly soak in . It definitely moisturizes you skin , but in a more deep natural way than traditional lotions . I have been on a search for the most deeply intensive moisturizer ; I found it !
 Now that I have your attention ... I use this not only for my hands , but for my tattoo work , and other cuts , burns , abrasions , etc as they are going through the healing process . The thicker consistency creates a barrier against germs and other environmental `` nasties '' and lets you heal quickly and naturally . The added benefit is the softness of my skin once I am all healed up . Makes me want to keep right on using it -LRB- and I usually do -RRB- !
 I 've been on crutches for the past 9 weeks because I broke my leg and , suffice it to say , crutching around tends to tear up one 's palms . I work predominantly as a Johnny paper pusher , but now have the hands of a longshoreman . When you get tired of the calluses and rough patches of skin , Burt 's Bees hand salve resolves the problem .
 This is really good for the dry hands , but it is a little oily and small enough to carry . I will buy big ones .
 I have hand eczema , and I have been trying everything to control it . I read online that this product has helped people with their eczema , so I decided to try it . I have n't been using it long enough to say whether or not it 'll help the eczema go away -LRB- I 'll update my review in a couple weeks or so -RRB- , but it definitely stops the itching and helps the dryness . The cracks are gone , and the flaking is gone . : -RRB- This product is , as many have said , greasy , but most salves are so I expected that . The greasiness does go away within 20 minutes . Once this stuff sinks in , your hands feel amazing . It 's resistant to washing , and one tin of it seems like it will last forever.To the people having a hard time getting it out of the tin , for this product , you do n't need to `` scoop '' out any . You just rub your fingers around on the surface , and then use your fingers to rub it into your hands , paying special attention to very dry areas . You do n't need a lot , a little goes a long way .
 I have chronic dry hands in the winter months even though I live in Southern California -LRB- mainly the top of my hands where my knuckles are -RRB- . My doctor said part of the reason I have such dry hands is due to the asthma I get in the winter months -LRB- cold dry air -RRB- , go figure . I have tried every product on the market , even a special prescription cream that is made in Israel . None of them really worked . I bought this Burt 's Hand Salve since it was so cheap and people on here give it such good reviews.I must say this product works and smells amazing ! The Burt 's Hand Salve does n't really absorb that well so I put it on my hands before I go to bed . Before I climb into bed I put socks on my hands so the hand salve does n't wipe off my hands while I 'm sleeping.I am very satisfied with this product !
 I wanted to get some of the Dr. Bronners salve , but they were out at my local store , and this was the only completely natural hand moisturizer they had -LRB- seriously - and this was at a natural foods store ! -RRB- . I was looking for something to soften my winter hands , which were cracking along the knuckles . This stuff did the trick ! Shea butter works alright for me , but it does n't seem to really seep into my skin for some reason . This stuff - instant relief . I mean , the smell is totally subjective , but I really enjoy it . It 's a quiet , earthy scent . It 's familiar but I 'm not exactly sure why -- maybe it 's the rosemary I 'm smelling ? Not sure . Anyway . I just rub the little tin along my knuckles and then rubbed the backs of my hands together and that works just fine , getting just enough -LRB- and not too much -RRB- salve on my hands . Good stuff , and cheap . I recommend it .
 I have to constantly wash my hands because I work with food . A combination of this and the usual dryness my skin experiences during winter has left my hands painfully dry and cracked . Thought I 'd give this hand salve a try because I already use and love other Burt 's Bees products . I am SO glad I did . I just put in on before I go to sleep so the greasiness of the product does n't really bother me . When you use it consistently , you see results fast . Definitely would recommend it if you 're fed up with dry skin .
 Yes the title sounds cheesy and I realize it may not work this fast or completely for everyone , but for me it 's been a godsend . I have Dyschromic Eczema on my hands and I have been recovering from a very severe outbreak . If you do n't what that is , it 's an outbreak of small blisters covering your palm and fingers and sometimes the back of the hands -LRB- or feet -RRB- that hurt and are more itchy than poison ivy . I still had a `` controlled '' patch the size of a half dollar on my hand . I tried Burt 's Bees Hand Salve in the mini tin on a lark . In less than 24 hours after 6 applications during normal daily routines -LRB- i.e. washing hands after potty breaks , doing the dishes , etc. -RRB- I do n't have any bumps at all , nearly all discoloration is gone except for a very slight pink-ish area , and I only have slight roughness in that area . I was expecting to wake up with bear paws due to an allergic reaction but this was not the case . I 've tried all the normal products that people with skin issues tried like eucerin , Cetaphil , Goat milk , but I 've either been allergic -LRB- Cetaphil -RRB- or they did n't do enough . Even Gold Bond ultimate restoring with CoQ10 did n't heal my hands to the extent of Burt 's Bees Hand Salve.As I said previously , it may not work as well for everyone , and it may be too rich for many but thank heavens it works for me .
 I really hate to see a great product get slammed over its price . Burt 's Bees comes in a 3oz tin as well as a 0.3 oz tin . They 're priced about the same , one is smaller to fit in your pocket . I have the 3oz tin so the mini was exactly what I was looking for.It 's oily . You skin needs oil . If you put a water-based cream on your skin which contains alcohol the positive effects will be small . That 's great for small problems . But , if you have really dried out skin , you need to give your skin what it needs - oil.Burt 's Bees is a combination of several types of oil plus bee 's wax . This formula is similar to that found in the most expensive hand creams costing upwards of $ 70 and up . It 's greasy and messy . It 's also the only stuff which really takes out the redness and dryness out of my skin and it 's a fraction of the price of the exotic hand creams.If you have badly chapped , cracked , red , dry skin - give this stuff a shot .
 I got this as a gift and found it extremely effective in preventing chapped hands . My mother , whose fingertips often crack when she washes dishes without gloves , also swears by this product . You need to use it liberally and regularly for results .
 This salve , when I started purchasing it , started out at 4.99 , now it is about $ 8 . It does work well , but I find the price now to be a bit high per ounce . For that reason , I had to find an alternative . Bag Balm works just as well , at you get 3 times a much for about the same price ! As much as I love Burt 's Bees items , they are now to expensive for my taste . So if you have the money to blow , go for Burt 's Salve , but if you want the same results but for way cheaper , go with Bag Balm . I am now a Bag Balm girl !
 I really like to rub this stuff in between my fingers - especially between my thumb and index finger - where it seems to get dry really fast . This is good stuff pre - and post-gardening as well . You ca n't go wrong with Burt 's Bees .
 I recently have gotten burts bees Hand Salve and think it is the best . Every Burts Bees produt works extremly well . There are no better anywhere . The hand salve makes rough hands smooth . I would recommend any of there produts to anyone .
 I have such dry hands and feed and skin in general and I have a hard time finding anything that worked to heal my hands , which hurt so badly . I decided to give this a shot as it was different then anything ive tried . Im so pleased with it I want to buy more to give to family members who suffer the same skin issues . I put it on my feet , legs anywhere im dry . I personally dont find it to be that greasy and I find the smell to be sort of refreshing and nice . This is my new must have !!!
 I am usually hesitant to buy soaps of my favorite scents , as they always seem to disappoint me by altering the scent with the nature of the soap . This was a pleasant exception , however -- it imparts a delicate essence of the exact scent of Egyptian Goddess oil to my skin . The soap itself is a soft , buttery bar that leaves my skin feeling well-moisturized . It perfumes the air nicely during my shower too , making mornings a little less painful ! It 's also very nice to use at night after a long day ; it leaves just a gentle scent all over -- not too strong , but definitely noticeable and enjoyed by those close by . Highly recommended . I only wish the bar were larger -- it goes fairly quickly , so be sure to let it dry thoroughly between uses .
 Smells great but it is a little drying and I did purchase a larger size at shop in Cape May Nj for $ 10
 Got as a gift for my mother . She likes it . Nice smell . Just like the perfume oil . Goes quick though .
 Egyptian Goddess is one of my favorite fragrances . It has a beautiful soft scent that is great for layering . Using the soap together with the oil/perfume is not overpowering . Soap feels and smells like a luxury . Definitely a favorite !
 I live in a very dry climate this is the extra boost my skin needs . I have used it for the last 3 years I like it so much .
 this perfume is one of my favorite , i also have the SOLO INTENSE but the clasical SOLO is better.it last a lot , and smell very nice , highly recommend it
 I searched for years -LRB- literally -RRB- before switching from my last `` everyday '' cologne to this one.I 'm not very good at describing the smell of a cologne , so wo n't try here . But this is one that can be worn day , evening or night .
 This seller was simply phenomenal . Quick shipping & Great product . One of the colognes was missing a lid , so I emailed him back and within a week , he had sent me a brand new one !! I was definitley not expecting that , and was VERY pleasantly surprised . Have also referred many of my close friends and family ! Thanks for your great service & KEEP IT UP !! : -RRB-
 I have eczema -LRB- red , tight , shiny , pustule spotted , very sensitive -RRB- only on my face . it gets old explaining to people what is on my face . My dermatologist was giving me the steroid of the month and it never really went away or felt like normal skin . I 've even been tested for allergies and tried acupuncture . Then the allergist suggested this cleanser in combo with Vanicream moisturizer before my skin dries . Its been a miracle . I highly recommend . It 's like Cetaphil in mildness but seems to clean better as I dont have eczema on my forehead .
 For all of us who have sensitivities and allergies to soaps and fragrances , good news . I tried this stuff at our allergists office and WOW my hands did n't itch , dry out or hurt afterwards !! I keep a small bottle in my purse now ! This product is amazing !!
 have tried mary kay , clinique , neutrogenia blah blah blah . had dry skin and after washing always felt stretched and rather itchy . dermatologist says this is the only cleanser any woman should use . no chemical additives and fragrances in it to irritate sensitive facial skin . my reeeeealllly dry eyelid skin even feels great after washing with `` free and clear '' . Add Vani cream , also by pharmaceutical specialties , after washing and whatta face !
 Free and Clear certainly is what it promotes -- it is a great cleanser for anyone who has any sensitivities , be they to harsh chemicals or to overpowering scents . It washes well , there 's no offensive scent and it leaves the skin smooth . I have only used it on my face , so this is what I 'm basing my review on.I did n't give it five stars because I do n't notice any great improvement to my skin . However , it does n't irritate my skin and it does n't leave it feeling tight after washing , so it has been a good cleanser to use .
 Like the shampoo and conditioner made by this company , this is a great soap for the chemically sensitive person . Does the job well without making your skin feel parched and dry .
 After two years of frustration , trying to figure out why my skin broke out in small rashes , I stopped using OTC liquid soaps and started using Free & Clear liquid soap and shampoo . In two days I was rash free and remain after months of use . If you suffer from skin rashes , give this a try . It worked like a miracle for me .
 This is a great soap for sensitive hands . Does not leave your skin extra dry and so keeps the moisture intact .
 I started using Free & Clear cleanser for sensitive skin about a month ago . I like the way it suds up , and the way it rinses off . Leaves my skin feelingsoft and my itching episodes have just about stopped happening . My dermatologist recommended this product and I am so glad she did !
 Our granddaughter has eczema and this is the first cleanser that does n't burn her skin . Great find . Too bad it 's not in stores .
 Free and Clear is a great product that I have been using for over two years . I got tired of washing and ending up smelling like some chemist 's idea of a flower , often in an overpowering manner . I use this soap at the bathroom sink and in the shower -LRB- and I confess as a shampoo -RRB- and it really does the job .
 I 've been using this item for more than a year and I 'm very happy with this SKU . It helps my breakouts . My skin is getting better and better . I used to spend so much money on those Japanese brands now I can only save more money but also get better skin .
 I have very sensitive skin . This product foams and cleanses very nicely without causing me to have red , blotchy reactions to its ingredients . I use it every day to wash my face and it is very gentle and does not dry my skin . Highly recommended for anyone troubled with sensitive skin .
 I had read about this product an decided to try it . I recomend it to anyone with sensitive skin . I will purchase this again .
 I use this for my 6 month old who has eczema . Wonderful product without all the junk in other soaps . Love it !!
 This is the only soap that I could use on my infant -LRB- now a toddler -RRB- without her getting a rash from all the dyes and perfumes they put in infant soaps . I love it !
 My dermatologist recommended I use this cleanser , along with a retinoid and a good moisturizer . It is unscented , has a good lather , and it cleans well , including removing most of my eyeshadow . Does n't do great at removing waterproof eye makeup . I will definately purchase again when my first bottle runs out .
 I have eczema and it 's hard to find something that will cleanse my skin and not be too harsh . It 's so gentle I even used it for my baby 's bath since I could n't find her baby wash ! Perfect cleanser , I will be buying again !
 I use this cleanser with a Clarisonic Pro face brush . It is a very gentle cleanser that does not leave your skin feeling dry and tight . Made in Minnesota .
 I am allergic to most shampoos and cleansers as they contain detergent like chemicals , as in sulfates . Funny that I have no problems with a lot of OTC moisturizers . I am also allergic to Cetaphil cleanser as well -LRB- have been patch tested for everything -RRB- . This is one of the few cleansers so far that I can use with no reaction . Right now I am also using for wash at night is Neutrogena 's Naturals with willowbark . So far so good ... but with onset of menopause who knows what 's next !!
 My sister is allergic to products with any kind of fragrance so I got this at her request because she can use it without a problem .
 This cleanser is one of the best I have ever tried . It is light , foaming , fragance-free , gentle , leaves no residue , and does n't dry out my skin . It is perfect for sensitive skin that tends to be combination or oily . There are so few cleansers targeted for this skin type , so I am very glad to have found this one after trying over 40 cleansers -LRB- ranging from drugstore to luxury-priced ones over $ 50 -RRB- . Definitely the one thing I have kept in my skincare routine all this time . I HIGHLY recommend it .
 Like some of the other reviewers , I do find it a little drying . My skin is very sensitive and does not react kindly to cleansers of any kind . I appreciate that it is fragrance and sulfate free and I have not had any major breakouts since using this cleanser so for those reasons I give it four stars , if it was more moisturizing I would give it 5 stars .
 I am very happy with how this product left my skin and did not cause any reactions/redness . I like the minimal additives and it seemed to do the job ! I used it in pregnancy as recommended by my derm .
 I have alot of skin issues and this product works very well . It has no smell , but cleans very gently . i would recommend this product .
 my skin breaks out at the hint of any excess chemical in a product I use on my skin . combine that with middle age , and now I battle break outs AND dry skin . This soap does well to keep the hives/rashes at bay from allergic reactions to chemicals , however I have to also combine it with Vanicream lotion because this soap does nothing to assist with dry skin .
 So I 've worked for a number of cosmetic / skin care companies over the years , and tried just about everything . I have combination skin that is also sensitive . This is by far the BEST face cleanser I have found . The others either leave my skin too tight feeling , or too moisturized where it still feels like there is cleanser on it - this one is perfect . I 've been using it for a week and my skin has n't looked this good in years !! For those reviewers that say it 's too drying ... how about using a moisturizer afterward ??? After all , cleansers are meant to cleanse , to remove oil , dirt and makeup . If you want a great cleanser , this one does the job perfectly !! I also like to use the cleanser with a wash cloth to get all the dead skin off my face as well . I highly recommend this product !!!
 Wow ! After trying what seemed like endless cleansers for my 12 year old 's facial eczema & keratosis pilaris , it seems the search is finally over . We are also dealing with the occasional pimple , & I am pleased to say that this cleaner is uniquely cleansing yet moisturizing without leaving a residue , like Cetaphil seems to do . It is still too early in the year to tell if this will limit the severity of the eczema -LRB- worsens during the winter -RRB- , but for now this has dramatically improved the texture and condition of a persistent parch of eczema near his mouth , as well as made the persistent keratosis pilaris bumps on his cheeks disappear . Definitely worth the $ $ - I ended up buying the refill bottle after seeing these results in 2 days ! 1/21/13 update
 I recently found out I am allergic to a very common biocide found in many liquid cleansers -LRB- laundry detergent , dish detergent , hand soap , body wash , shampoo , etc -RRB- I ordered this and am VERY happy with it .
 I am very happy with this cleanser . I have to wash my hands 30-40 times/day and this product is the first one that does not dry my skin by the end of the day .
 I have been searching for a lip product that would go on and feel like a gloss , but look like a lipstick for , what seems like , forever . I almost ca n't believe that I found it ! I get so many compliments on my lips now . I am horrible at putting on lipstick , and gloss was never enough color for me . So , this product is perfect for people like me . Yay !
 I found that it looked like they were going to be discontinuing this product at my local store so when I found it here online I decided to stock up . The color is a light pink with a touch of shimmer and in a gloss form . I hope I 'm wrong in that they are not discontinuing but it seems lately that every color or fragrance that I love gets nixed .
 I 've used this for 2 + years now . It was so convinient to be able to find it online & not have to search through racks at the drugstore .
 It seems ridiculous to rate this product as it is no longer available , and if it is , the price is through the roof . It sold for $ 6.50 when it was available and is now being sold at $ 65 . I loved the product , but not at that price . Unfortunately Revlon did not produce a substitute . Pity .
 Used a number of years and can no longer find in the stores . Adds a light color to the lips and nice shine , but does n't stay on very long .
 The seller sent item as described and promptly I would purchse from this seller again , Thank you and I appreicate the promptness .
 I have been using this lipstick for a long time . I love it . My favorite color is the pink lightning .
 If I 'm just running to the grocery store I do n't necessarily feel the need for full makeup and lipstick . This lip glide -LRB- which I thought was discontinued because the local shops do n't sell it anymore -RRB- is a great consistency and the Sheerly Burgundy is the perfect natural color for my corpselike lips . It makes the lips look healthy and gives you a bit of a finished look without having to go with the full color lipstick . Highly recommended . I have used Subscribe & Save because I do n't want to run out of it !
 I agree with what most of the reviewers have said , but want to add that in my opinion the color is not pink at all , it is more a brownish/plum/coppery color .
 Why does everything I love get discontinued ? Well , this is a great lipstick , the color is fabulous and it leaves your lips shiny , but not lip gloss poppin shiny . NOT long wearing , but very easy to apply , just click and go .
 You cant find this lipwtick hardly anywhere . I found it , you shipped it immediately and thanks !
 I get compliments from men and women and It has a light and citrus smell to it . fantastic scent , used for years .
 This is the only beauty product that my husband swears by works . It really works on his oily skin . He loves it !
 Initially it did little . After a while I broke out . Then , after a few weeks of use once a week or so , after the many layers of my cruddy skin had broken down -- I was cured ! Clearer and smoother than ever . Very few deep blackheads now . Its not perfect but it 's worked well .
 This product reduces visible sun spots within two weeks time . Excellent product for people that want to reduce the spots and light wrinkles . I will use this seller again .
 This acid does n't dry up after two weeks in the container and is strong enough to kill skin abberations . It kills worts and skin tags .
 I ordered this product to help with my acne . Wow , zits be gone ! Be careful , it will burn and sting ... but it does a number on pimples . I use it once a week and my acne is , after trying everything over the last 20 yrs , finally going away . Now , I get like one pimple a week ... totally manageable . I will be ordering again .
 Wow am I happy that I bought this ! I was having acne issues along with chapped cheeks and dry itchy skin from the harsh winter winds at my high-altitude -LRB- endlessly winter seeming -RRB- college . I started using this as a mini-peel 2 days a week leaving only until it starts to tingle only slightly . Lathering on tons of moisturizer afterwards is the most rewarding part , your face feels incredibly baby-soft and smooth ! I wo n't ever probably leave on long at all but I definitely notice the effects . The first time I looked in the mirror after a treatment I was literally shocked because my pores were so smooth they were practically invisible ! Not to mention my acne has cleared up entirely and my complexion is again glowing -LRB- think - post salty sunny beach trip shower : -RRB- Not only will I be purchasing this , I 'll probably experiment with their other varieties of peels . &#60; To make application easier , try using a foundation brush to apply the gel , and rinse from brush immediately after application . &#62;
 This product is great . I am a 34 year old hispanic woman with a tn or mediterranean complexion . I never experienced acne until I turned 30 years old and when it came , it really came . I suffer from cystic acne that is terribly painful but not disfiguring , thank God . It has only left dark spots all over my face . Recently , some of the cysts , if left alone , would kind of dry out but leave hard bumps underneath . And other would not dry out no matter what . I had tried everything , saw about 10 different dermatologists but since it is n't disfiguring they would just stick to topical medicines.I tried this as a way to even out my tone , but right before I received the product I got an episode of cysts.I tried the salycilic acid on the forehead , where I did n't have a breakout . I followed the instructions but only left it for one minute . I did n't want to burn my skin . It tingled but did n't burn . It did not frost it just felt tighter , and my pores looked remarkably small and smooth . I was going to wait one week but then , all these pimples starting coming to the surface , and cysts too ! I went back to the review and people said it was normal . I decided to wait.Then , on my chin I had a bad breakout and the sulfur drying cream was drying my skin but not the cyst . So , in desperation I dabbed some of the salycilin acid and left it for 40 seconds . It felt like it burned , it forsted and the next day it was completely dry and scabbed . It did n't leave a hard bump . I must add that the process of scabbing was a lot faster than it would have been normally.I am also using vitamin E oil and tea tree oil . I ca n't say if it will continue to work for me , but it did work this one time .
 I have just begun using this product . The product arrived promptly and as described . I was concerned that it would be harsh and potentially burn my skin ... was delightfully surprised that it is very gentle and my skin tolerates it easily . I think that for me BHA is superior to AHA for my skin-type and I am using this to held reduce blackheads . I have realistic expectations and hope for a little more glow in my skin and slightly cleaner looking/easier to clean pores . Will update in a few weeks . -- Update
 I 'm in my mid 30s and still break out . After using the product for 2 weeks the break outs almost disappeared and my complexion has been so much more clearer . The product is strong and stings my skin so I ca n't keep it on my skin for more than 5 minutes . The Bottom line it works .
 I bought this peel to improve the texture and tone of my skin . After three peels done weekly , I have seen remarkable improvements in the superficial scarring on my cheeks and a definite evening out of the pigmentation of my skin . My acne has almost completely disappeared as a result of these peels as well . I really wish I had tried salicylic acid sooner !
 Not only did I receive this order SUPER quick , I was eager to use it because of ALL of the GREAT reviews AND I have been having flare ups on my forehead and chin for the last few months.I am a 30 year old woman and of COURSE during my pre-mensa My skin gets oilier , but I am SICK of breaking out . I 've used 2 courses of accutane and I STILL get breakouts !? wtf !? It 's RARE for me to get cystic acne but I do get MANY little clogged pores of both blackheads and whiteheads . Although they are small , they are STILL noticeable . They also leave me with tiny brown scars!I tried this product the first time and left it on for one minute . I did n't feel much stinging EXCEPT where the creases are in my nose -LRB- beware for that area -RRB- -- washed it off after one minute and the next day my skin seemed a little better . I decided I would try it AGAIN the VERY next day -- yes against the product directions , because I just did n't feel as if the one minute was thorough enough . This time I left it on for about 4-5 minutes . It began to sting and I had to wash it off because on my cheeks I just could n't take anymore . It stung for about 1 minute after I rinsed it . I used Trader Joe 's coconut oil on spots that felt and looked dry after.The VERY next morning , my skin was NOTICEABLY better ! Even my girlfriend said `` your skin is looking really clear , what have you been doing ? `` There are still a COUPLE of tiny black heads on my forehead but they have decreased drastically , the skin on my cheeks looks a LOT smoother , its pretty fantastic.I will use it again in a few days to see if it clears up the remaining blackheads on my forehead . I feel hopeful and happy because this product works!I 've tried EVERYTHING too , and I was about to pay a lot of $ $ to get a professional facial or see a dermatologist for some kind of help.I say TRY this product at $ 20 a pop -- it 's not a huge loss if it does n't give you the results you seek.So far I am MORE than happy with the outcome .
 I 've been using this product for 2 weeks now , and I definitely notice improvement in my skin . My skin is not breaking out terribly -LRB- there are still pimples , but there are less -RRB- , the texture is smoother , and the large pores on my nose have shrunken !! The first time I used this product , it did sting ! However , I followed the directions and left it on for exactly 60 seconds . FOLLOW DIRECTIONS WHEN USING THIS PRODUCT ... If you leave it on for more than 60 seconds or you do n't fully wash off the peel , your face will become red and irritated . I suggest testing on a small patch of your skin prior to testing your entire face . On the second and third peels , I left it on for 60 seconds longer . Work your way into this product , as it is very powerful.PROS : - Works well-Powerful-Pretty bottle : PCONS : - Does not come with a fan brush-Can irritate skin if directions are n't followed-Dangerous . DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT NEAR YOUR EYES.OVERALL , Yes , this product is absolutely worth the $ $ . I would suggest anyone suffering from acne to at least try it , but do so with caution -LRB- i.e
 I have many crater scars from 11 + years of acne . I 've tried many products on the market for scar removal but always end up with disappointment . I read some really good reviews on this product and decided to give it a try . I figured , it 's $ 16 , why not ?! And my boyfriend has bad break outs occassionally so I figured if it does n't work on me , he can try it out and see if it works for him.I have to say , it REALLY does hurt / burn the first time . I have a high tolerance for pain but when I did this the first time , it definitely bothered me a lot . I was jumping around in the bathroom , fanning my face with my hands ... just wanted to get it over with ! It felt like it 's itching and tingling and burning . It was not a good feeling . But I feel like if it 's hurting so badly , it 's got ta be doing something good to the skin and it 's got ta be working ! From past experience , when I have a growing pimple , and if the product I applied burns , the pimple usually disappears the next day ... For first time users , I 'd recommend rinsing with a shower head in cold water . It 's very hard to rinse it off over the sink . Rinsing with a shower head is quicker , as well as calming down your skin faster so the burning sensation will go away faster too . It 's almost like a rinse off + light facial massage!After a couple uses , I find my skin more firm and vibrant . The scars are visibly lighter and slowly fading away . My boyfriend has severe adult acne break outs and he loves this product too . It does wonders in clearing away break outs . But it does take time.So overall , I think this is money well spent . $ 16 is a worth try . You do have to prepare yourself for some pain ... but you know what they say , `` beauty is pain ! `` UPDATE -LRB- 3/26/12 -RRB-
 I have been suffering from acne since 8th grade , and am now about to graduate high school and made my New Year 's Resolution to get rid of my acne for college . I know it 's something I really ca n't control , but I had a 50 $ gift card to Amazon and was determined to find SOMETHING to help . I 've tried everything . Epiduo , Murad , Proactive , Clean and Clear , Neutrogena , Clearisil , EVERYTHING . My acne has stressed me out more than school work , and I would always try to cover it up with foundation . I wash my face every day and nothing would get rid of or lessen my acne . I have horrible scars because I 'm OCD with picking my white heads -LRB- even though I know it 's bad -RRB- and just red sores all over my face.I 've been using this product for 17 days now , and my am I surprised . The first week , the redness in my face went down and my bumps lessened . Then the second week , my acne was way worse . Mostly due to my period and the fact that the salicylic acid brings out pimples to get rid of them . But now that I 'm in week 3 , I definitely notice a difference in my skin . My face is smoother , my scaring is DEFINITELY smaller , and most of my acne is going away . I still have a few bumps here and there , but I have n't had any new break outs in a couple of days . I got some Ph Prep and cleanser with this and use it before and after I use the product . I also apply some organic lotion stuff to help with dryness . I usually leave it on for a couple of minutes with minimum burn because my skin is pretty used to the acid from years of applying things with it . I do the treatment twice a week at night , and it 's been good so far.I 'm going to continue using this product for the recommended 6 weeks and see what happens then : -RRB- I definitely recommend this product for anyone who has acne , acne scars , and redness and wants results !
 I 've done three peels so far and am happy with the results . It definitely burns when you put it on , so I 've only been able to tolerate it for about 4 minutes . It has shrunk my existing acne dramatically each time I 've used it . The next day I wake up and it 's almost all gone . I 've also noticed that my skin is much less oily and my pores much smaller . I notice that I peel two days later - which is annoying , but what gets the results . I just make sure I use a heavier moisturizer on that day and night , and I exfoliate with a facial sponge and that takes care of it quickly . I am also using Clinique 's acne solution system and started both around the same time , so it may be the combination of the two that 's producing the results . But either way , I 'm very happy with how well my skin is looking these days . Ca n't wait to see the results of another month of use .
 I have used this for about a month now and my breakouts have definitely decreased . They are not completely gone yet and I 'm not sure if they will but my skin is dramatically better than before . I started with a lactic acid peel and that alone did not do much . I went to skin laboratories website and saw that this helps with the other peels so for the past two weeks , I do a combo . This peel first then lactic afterwards , once a week . Then I just use this peel two more times during the week . Now I am peeling like I have a sunburn and I am black . The skin underneath is beautiful and soft . A few things to note
 I have tried everything under the sun from prescription to over the counter and nothing has worked on my acne . I started using this as a last resort to try and combat my acne and acne scars . I have never used a peel before so I did n't really know what yo expect but I gave it a try and I have n't looked back . When you first put it on you will feel an intense itching and/or burning . You may experience white spots on your skin after you wash it off but it is temporary and will vanish after you moisturize . I started seeing results after two weeks and my acne scars are finally starting to disappear . I am biracial and the scars take on a dark brown to red appearance . I am only on level one , but if I am seeing this kind of results I ca n't wait to work my way up.I do have one piece of advice . The directions say to use a brush or cotton ball but that technique did n't work for me . I went and got a medicine dropper and use it to put the solution in the palm of my hands then I spread it with my fingers . I am able to apply the solution faster and spread it more evenly . This method also makes you use less solution so you will have more than the 15 applications that are in each bottle . Just make sure that you wash your hands with soap and water after the solution has been applied to your face . Read all the instructions , and most importantly listen to your face . If it is peeling or irritated allow more days in between uses .
 I bought this for my 14 year old daughter who has suffered from acne for about 4 years now . We had tried prescriptions like Retin-A , Tazorac , etc. . . I have bought her proactive and many over the counter products that just did n't work . The second week of using this her skin was clearing up very well . This is the 4th week and her skin is almost acne free . I have recommended this product to everyone I know that suffers from acne . Its very strong so you may want to start out only using once a week and then gradually work your way to 2 to 3 times a week . I due recommend using a good moisturizer after . Now I 'm gon na try the glyclorid peel to see if that will help with the scars that 's left .
 Great Product . Will clear up your skin like it states . Make sure to use moisturizer because it will leave your skin feeling dry and flaky for about a week . Keep the product on for as long as you can up to the 8 minutes recommend max for prime results . Will purchase again !
 I wish I could give this more stars ! I love this product.I have tried absolutely every skin product known to man -LRB- I am in my 30s and have had problem skin since I was in the 4th grade -RRB- . It is not necessarily a miracle cure , but a HUGE help in fighting the good fight . It has helped with clogged pores , fading scars , etc. . It also seems to speed up getting rid of any acne type cysts.I did NOT see results the first time I used this though . The results got better and better as I used it . Now , you can practically see blackheads begin to melt after I use it . Two things helped me improve my results :1 . exfoliating regularly2 . using a toner with alcohol before the peelThis seemed to help the peel penetrate deeper . This is only my experience and I know products do n't always work for everyone . Silly me purchased another peel form this company and it was like dabbing water on my face . This is definitely the right fit for me .
 One of the reviewers said that it would be used best as a spot treatment and I totally agree . 20 % is really strong . I recommend making a baking soda/water solution before you apply the peel . It Can burn , as in leave white patches that peel like mad for days . It will also make your face blotchy and uneven , if you do too long too quickly.Some skin on my face could take it , the area around my mouth could not . The 3rd or 4th time I have done this peel -LRB- not regularly -RRB- , After 4 minutes I RAN to the sink and as I passed a mirror I was horrified to see a bright red `` goatee , ' after a total face application . I rinsed and rinsed , and put baking soda on it , repeatedly for about 10 minutes , then rinsed again and slathered my face with Olay Definity Night Cream . -LRB- I do n't know why , but I swear this stuff HEALS my acne marks if I pick or they are bright , takes half the time to heal up - nice of Olay to discontinue the line . -RRB- After a couple hours I put on Eucerin redness relief night cream , which is also a miracle worker if you have redness in certain areas of your face . I do not have rosacea , but I do have a lot of redness around my nose and chin.As for what the peel does for the acne , sore bumps under my skin that will begin to raise in a couple days totally disappear , ones that are closer to `` zit '' have the process speeded up and they reach zit that day , gone the following day , and just a little red the 3rd day . After 4 days whatever issues you had are pretty much gone . With diligent moisturizing -LRB- and NO PICKING -RRB- , you will not have any visible sloughing . Enjoy your clear skin !
 Like my title says , I suffer from both eczema and acne . I 've had eczema my entire life , but I did n't develop acne until last year . It hit me REALLY hard , and it was hard for me to fight back . Most treatments helped the acne , but made my eczema worse . And if I used a product for eczema , it would clog up my face and make the acne worse . Proactiv was the best treatment I used , but for a college student , it was expensive to keep up with . I had stopped using anything on my face for such a long time , and it has left dark spots on my cheeks , rough patches on my chin , and pimples on my forehead and along my hairline.After seeing such good reviews for this product , I gave it a try today . All I have to say is that I 'm impressed . There 's no visible change in my skin , but it feels so much more soft and clean than with any other product I 've ever used . Like the pamphlet said , my skin did feel a bit dry after using , but the dry sensation went away on its own without needing a second product . I think a previous reviewer mentioned being Tyra Banks ' complexion -- which is the same skin tone as I am , so I did see some redness on my cheeks , but I 'm 90 % sure it was because of the wash cloth I used -LRB- it was a bit rough , but I did n't have any other clean ones -RRB- . While using the product , my skin did burn and itch while it was on . It was very hard to not scratch it off . so , anyone who reads this
 I just used this peel -LRB- 10 minutes -RRB- ago . I followed the instructions but left it on for almost 3 minutes instead of the recommended 1 -LRB- for initial contact -RRB- . There was very little burning/sensitivity , perhaps because I have thicker skin and used to other products.I 'm in my 30s and get more acne now than I did as a teenager.Oral contraceptive pills worked for me but I do not want to take them anymore for possible negative side effects.I will probably increase the time to the full 8 minutes and frequency as others have to see faster results.I kind of wish I started with a stronger concentration as funds are limited but I think this will be a good start . ** UPDATE **
 I 've suffered from breakouts ever scince I turned 30 + . I 've tried everything from Pro-Active to expensive products like Obagi . They seem to work at first but then the black/white heads come back
 I could ramble on and on about this product but I 'll just keep it short , it works amazing if used correctly . First , do n't use it more than every 4 days or so depending on your skin . I used it a couple days between , and I literally burned my skin . This stuff is strong and is not to be taken lightly . If you follow the directions you should see a significant improvement in your skin within a month . The changes will be noticable everytime you use it though . I suggest using this only at night -LRB- your skin will be a little red afterwards -RRB- and use a good moisturizer afterwards .
 a friend recommended this for me . I have acne scars and though I know they 're not going to go away , I just want something I can do at home to slough off the top layer of the skin . This works great . At first I did n't even notice much peeling , but I realized that it was because I was n't putting very much on . I used q-tips and with a small tip not very much was getting on my skin . So while it felt hot while it was on , it did n't result in any peeling . Then weeks later I used a cotton ball and that did the trick . I kept it on for a little over 3 minutes and it was hot , very hot . My skin peeled a lot 2 days later . The peeling lasted for days afterwards , but I like the result . The little white heads are gone and pores look smaller . I recommend this .
 I had terrible acne that decided to come back when I was 25 . I tried everything
 Why do I here about Proactiv more than this product ? This worked wonders on my face and shoulders as it lightened my skin whhere I had previous scars . It may have burned like crazy after the first uses but it was well worth it . After using it 3 times my skin felt refreshed and it did n't look as acne-ridden as it use to be . It cleaned up a lot the acne on my face including the dark spots and the pimples . Although it takes time this product really worked and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to rid their face of acne or other irritations . A huge warning in advance is if you ca n't take the pain of a strong burning or tingling sensation then this product is not for you .
 After reading all these amazing reviews on this product and having no luck with getting rid of my past acne scars I went ahead and bought this with high hopes . They were unfortunately too high . I 've been using this product now for about a 2 weeks , almost everyday . The first few times I only left it on for maybe 2 minutes at a time . -LRB- Perhaps that is why I am not thrilled with my results thus far -RRB- The past two times I 've left it on for 5 minutes . I took a before and after photo from when I first started to last night and I honestly see no difference . I MAY have some less acne , but I definitely do not see a huge difference . I was really just hoping this would help me with my past scarring and overall appearence of my face . I will continue to use it maybe ... I purchased the pH Balancer from Cellbone to use after the peel , with the Balancer , Cellbone included a free 35 % Gylocolic Lactic Peel - I used this ONCE , MUCH BIGGER DIFFERENCE ! I may still use this , I may not .
 I used this product two days ago and I am really pleased with the results . The peel is effective , easy to apply , and it does n't run when applied properly . The packaging is ideal and the bottle is dark , which is excellent for the preservation of the potency of the contents . I will likely order this product again .
 I 've been using the peel as often as directed for about a year now and my skin is noticeably softer and smoother whenever I use it , however , I see no dramatic long-term improvement . It works well to clear up acne breakouts for a few days , but it has not stopped the breakout cycle . I have battled mild acne for years -- the kind where no matter how well I wash my face and no matter what product I use , I still see a few small pimples every day , and there 's the occasional larger breakout of 10-20 little pimples . The results from this peel are not miraculous -LRB- maybe I could use something stronger ? -RRB- but I have had no adverse effects such as peeling , redness , irritation , etc. , and I can say my skin is a little better than it used to be on a daily basis , though it was never that bad to begin with . For me , the best product to clear acne and soothe my skin is still Queen Helene 's Mint Julep Mask
 so far so good . not as painful as some suggest , wish i got the stronger one . thanks to skin laboratory for this awesome product !!! -LRB- :
 Been using it for 3 weeks , 1-2 times per week . Makes my skin smooth . Not sure about long-term effects yet . If you 're use to spa facial treatments , then the tingling is n't too bad .
 Very good , powerful product . The gel immediately causes areas of blemishing to abate and controls areas of more complex , vexing blemishing . My skin complexion has become increasingly , invariably smoother and even after applying the gel .
 I got this peel because I had never used a peel before and I was looking to curb acne . This is a starter peel , meaning an idiot can apply it , your face wo n't burn off . I was terrified I 'd have peeling , horrible burning , etc. . But , it was n't too bad . Slight burning after a few minutes . The price seems reasonable enough , too . I do n't know if this is appropriate or not ... But I use a fan brush to apply the peel , leave it on for ten minutes and wash it off with really cold water . Of course , before applying , you are n't supposed to use micro-dermabrasion products and you 're supposed to have a very clean , dry face . I bought cellbone technology 's Prep Toner to use before applying the peel.It does dry my skin somewhat . But honestly , it 's really easy to use . It will tighten your skin , no matter your age . It 's helped with acne somewhat as well . I think in combination with good face products , anyone will probably see some good results . It freaked me out a little but because after one use , my face looked like a child 's . I 'll use it until it 's gone , then I 'll probably try the Glycolic or maybe a combo-peel once I feel confident enough to do so.I do n't know if this helps but I am 25 years old , very fair skin , also mild-moderate acne . Maybe it 's the peels or maybe it 's the investment in expensive -LRB- ish -RRB- face products , but I have seen marked improvement.Oh , and do n't pick at your skin after using this .
 This is as good as it gets professional result . Unlike the direction that come with the bottle , which I do not find effective enough , I experimented and it worked really well for me . Here is my own direction
 I love love love this product . I was worried that it was going to work when I got it but I have noticed the change in my face since I have started to use this . I would recommend this to any and everyone who is having some problems with their skin .
 works great on acne , well , helps anyway . never had anything work so quickly/well . Egyptian goddess ' bathed in sour goat milk to `` glow '' . a simple acid `` peel '' . Same idea here .
 I 've been using this peel for four weeks now and I really see a difference . I 've paid $ 250.00 for a professional peel & have seen the same results . My pores are smaller and complexion is clearer . I 've gone from a full coverage make up to tinted coverage and and could n't be more pleased . I 'm 50 `` something '' . No acne , no problems , just want better looking skin . I will finish out this bottle and then go to the 35 . I really recommend this product to whom ever is reading this as well as my friends . It 's about time we as consumers can buy a product such as this at a fair price .
 First off , Im 18 with combination/oily skin that occasionally gets gets inflamed pores . I would call it cystic acne but these pimples are in a small inflamed area . These types of pimples are very hard to treat with benzoyl peroxide and do not respond well to many types of treatments . I have not used this for very long but I decided it would be ok if I left it on my skin for ten minutes and I was acne free for two weeks . It was amazing ! I will continue to use this to treat acne and hopefully with continued use I will see a change in skin texture as well . I am amazed at what AHA and BHA acid peels do for my skin . One negative though , it is extremely painful to use on my skin even when I only leave it on for a minute or two .
 My skin has never been terrible but I do get considerable breakouts every now and then . Once I started taking birth control , my skin went nuts and I break out in places I have never had blemishes on my face . This stuff is seriously the best thing I have ever tried . I still get zits here and there but they are mostly small and dry up quickly.I recommend not investing in one of the over-priced fan brushes advertised for it and pick up either a fan brush or foundation brush by E.L.F. from Target -LRB- or online -RRB- for three bucks.It does burn/itch , but let it stay on for as long as possible -LRB- try to make it to the maximum of 8 minutes -RRB- . My skin is very pale and sensitive so I usually do this at least two hours before I have to be anywhere so that I 'm not glowing red . Make sure to apply a heavy moisturizer right after . I use Burt 's Bees Radiance Night Cream and have n't had any peeling issues or flaky skin .
 I 've used various products to treat my skin that is prone to acne . Since I 've started to use this products my skin looks much better and it does not get oily so fast any more . It did not leave any dry and flaky skin as other products did . When you use it according to the protocol , it does work , at least for me it does . Thank you .
 I ordered this item on the Amazon website to step up my skincare routine . I had never done any facial peels before , and was nervous about the burning sensations that some reviewers had experienced . The first time , I left the product on for only a couple of minutes , as I was feeling a burning sensation mostly around my nose . when I rinsed the product -LRB- with cold water , no neutralizing solution -RRB- , I was amazed at how my skin looked . It simply felt squeaky clean ! I had some peeling around my nose , and on my cheeks a couple of days later , and my T-zone-oily skin was less shiny . I have been using the peel very 5 days or so , and my friends have noticed how clear and bright my face looks . Most of friends now want to try this product . Trust me , it does wonders , especially for the rest of us with oily skin .
 I just got the bottle today and used it straight away.I just washed my face and applied it . Did n't really burn -LRB- but you could feel something -RRB- . Left it on for 2 mins then washed it off with water . I noticed visible results almost immediately ! Pimples kinda shrank too ! Think will use a higher percentage next time .
 I ordered this product after my last attempt of searching a solution for my persistent acne . I 've been suffering from acne since age 14 -LRB- I 'm now 20 -RRB- . I tried everything from Proactiv Solutions to every over-the-counter acne medication available on the market.Warning
 This peel is just perfect . It not only works on the scars but also helps control acne . I 've used it for 4 weeks now -LRB- applying it once a week -RRB- , and have n't had a single new breakout . The peeling is subtle , but none of my blemishes are visible anymore.Although the instructions say not to keep it on for more than 5-7 mins , I keep it on for 2 hours . I 'm not saying everyone should do that . -LRB- I did try keeping it on for 10mins for the first time and nothing happened -RRB- . Maybe it 's because my skin is used to salicylic acid.I have been using the Neutrogena 2 % salicylic products for three years with no great results . And this peel worked wonders in a month . Needless to say , I 've discontinued using them.Also , the processing was pretty fast . Got it in four days flat.All in all , a wonderful product .
 At first i was skeptical of this acid peel , but changed my mind soon after.I took before photos to see the change the peel would have on my face , and its only been about 4 weeks , but i will take pics soon of the after results after 6 weeks.Im 20 , male , white , with slightly oily skin , and acne that sometimes turns horrible on me and makes cysts only on cheeks though . One cyst next to my eye and eyebrow left a bad scar.This stuff does tingle a bit , but very bearable . Used first for 2 mins , and had no effect , upped it to 4 , same result . Used the full 8 mins the next day , started to see improvements . I modified the instructions a bit because my skin is used to exfoliations by 10 % benzoil peroxide which only made pimples smaller and face a bit dry.I used every other day for the full 8 mins every time . But i suggest follow their instructions first before adjusting it . No down time here , and no redness like some people mentioned , and i dont apply moisturizer . The skin feels same before and after application , but results can been seen a few hours after the application as well as increased results over 24-48 hours . The company suggests using a moisturizer , so dont take my word for it that you may not need it , so start with that . I started first using this product with a moisturizer but i think it clogged my pores and cause mild acne.The results i got were : - Pores got smaller noticeably on the nose , but not as much on the cheeks.-Face became much more smoother , the scars got blended in -LRB- not the major ones thought -RRB- - Face is less oily after application as well as for the next 24 hours or so . No moisturizer was needed for me , as the amount of oil on my skin after use of the peel stayed at a perfect level.-Face got lighter -LRB- can be seen in my pictures -RRB- , and red spots from old acne lightened up slightly.-Acne breakout decreased alot . I no longer get acne on my cheeks and forehead . My problem is the nose and chin , mainly the bottom portion of the nose.Final Comment
 Product works great , noticeable immediate improvement , though not drastic . I have been repeating it and have not had harsh results , just the expected peeling . I have large pores on my nose , chin and between eyebrows . After the peel I notice a change in pore depth and size . I am very impressed .
 I started getting acne young , when i was about 10 and i didnt know how to look after my skin then . No cleansing , toning or even moisturizing because i thought that would give me more spots , what a fool i was.The problem with black skin is that it hyperpigments easy and by the time i was 21 i couldnt bare to look at myself in the mirror , i had so many acne scars i couldnt stand it . Dermatologists were no help , the pills and creams are useless if you dont have a good skin care regimen which is something the doctors dont usually tell you.In 2001 called around and was told by everyone on Harley Street that dermabrasion and skin peels were not for black skin tones so i paid 1800for lazer treatment . It worked to some extent , the spots went and my skin looked clearer but if i had known about this product i wouldnt have bothered.The truth is that these skin acids can and are used safely on ebony skin tones and have been for years . I am a caramel complexion -LRB- like Tyra Banks -RRB- , my first peel ever was the Skin laboratoty 70 % lactic acid peel and i experienced no problems at all , just be sure to follow the instructions . My second peel was the salicylic 20 % peel by Skin Laboratory and my skin looks great . My skin is visibly clearer , lighter due to the fact that the hyperpigmentation is fading , i just look great and i 'm so happy . And for the price , its a bargain compared to 200 per month on microdermabrasion or 1800 + for a course of lazer treatments . I would highly recommend both the product and the company . I honestly cant imagine my life without these peels now , i 'm totally smitten .
 problem
 I started having severe adult acne breakouts in 2004 . Since that time , I have tried every conceivable product on the market . When the OTC products had no effect , I consulted a dermatologist . Talk about adding insult to injury , the treatment -LRB- s -RRB- I received through the dermatologist aggravated my situation even further . I felt like a walking nightmare . I became so self-conscious that I found every excuse not to leave the house unless absolutely necessary . I could n't even make direct eye contact with anyone for fear that they were looking at my horribly broken out face caked with makeup and powder to hide the volcanous ruptures underneath . I know , I know , the makeup and powder was only clogging my pores further and exacerbating my situation . Denial is a horrible master.When I saw the Salicylic Acid 20 % Gel Peel on Amazon.com , I was reluctant at first . I had tried numerous products with certain percentages of salicylic acid in it , but I took note that this product was a GEL PEEL with 20 % salicyclic acid . I was familiar with peels and how they were supposed to lift off severe acne scarring and associated discolorations in stages through a peeling process . I did n't know much more than that about the science of peeling , but 20 % of salicyclic acid seemed more like a percentage a dermatologist would prescribe . I ordered this product on a wing and a prayer , and I have never been happier.For anyone out there who is considering having a iron mask forged to hide their adult acne , DO N'T !! Buy this product and use it as directed . DO NOT exceed the amount or timing-this is a chemical peel . You will do damage to yourself by thinking , `` If a little worked so well , a lot more will work even better . '' WRONG . Be patient . I guarantee you the results will be evident almost immediately . As for any stinging or burning sensations , there was very , very little -LRB- almost negligible -RRB- that I experienced -- and I had become used to some products causing me severe reactions with no improvement whatsoever.Not only does this product rid you of your current acne situation , it will help recondition your skin to prevent further breakouts -- it actually firms your skin as well ! REMEMBER
 I 've always heard that you ca n't shrink pore size ... whoever made that statement has NOT tried this product ! I 'm in the last year of my twenties , and over the past year my skin has been at its worst -- acne , old acne scars , congestion , wrinkles , unevenness , and the worst of all ... HUMONGOUS pores . I 've tried so many things ... facials , expensive cleaners and lotions , etc. . I 'm SO HAPPY that I finally discovered the magic of salicylic acid ! I 'm on my third week -LRB- using it 2 times a week -RRB- , and OH MY GOODNESS , my skin looks awesome ! Especially the pores ! They 're dramatically smaller , and I did n't think that was possible . My skin is so much more even and smooth , and the acne scars are beginning to fade . I even got carded ordering a drink for the first time in at least TWO YEARS , so obviously other people are noticing my new youthful looking skin . ; -RRB- It does sting quite a bit , so be prepared ! The first time I could only leave it on about a minute and a half , and now I 'm about to five minutes . The peeling is barely noticeable , and my skin looks so vibrant and healthy after each peel . I 'm so glad I finally found something that works !!
 I reviewed this back in the summer . Loved it then , love it now . I 'm African American with a Medium to Dark Brown complexion . I 've had cystic acne along my jaw line since having a baby -LRB- about four years -RRB- . It does burn the first few times but you tolerate it more and more . It worked within 2-3 months . My patience has built up after using sooo many products and waiting for results . This is it . Within 3 months the scars had faded . The `` Cyscic '' acne was gone AND not coming back . I wanted to give face a break and just purchased the `` lactic '' peel . BIG MISTAKE ! No real results from that in the last 2 months and it caused hyperpigmentation so its back to the Salicylic . If you really have an acne problem give this time be patient it works !
 I bought this and the glycolic/lactic acid combo peel at the same time . The first time I used this , I could only keep it on maybe a minute as it was really uncomfortable , and I do n't have particularly sensitive skin . But subsequent times I kept it on for long er with no problems . I would use this once a week , alternating with this and the gly/lac peel , for about 4 weeks , then the last 2 weeks of my first cycle I would put this one on first , leave it for a couple of minutes , then apply the gly/lac over the salicylic and leave on for another few minutes . I then stopped using for a few weeks , and went back to just using a clay mask once a week to give my skin a break . In that break time though , my skin has stayed clear , with very few blemishes , and the oiliness in my t-zone has been definitely reduced . I think it did help to make my pores appear smaller , if for no other reason that that less oil is being produced . I did n't notice much difference in fine lines , but I do n't have many wrinkles anyway , and I do n't think it penetrated enough to help reduce acne redness , but since I 'm not breaking out anymore that will help overall reduce acne redness . Definitely recommend for problem skin as an alternative to pricy dermatologist 's peels - it 's the same thing !
 I had severe acne before I started using the Salicylic Acid 20 % Gel Peel . Before I used this product , I tried everything ! I had gone to many different dermatologists and have done everything from being on birth control , taking antibiotics -LRB- which killed all the `` good bacteria '' in my body and left me with severe yeast infections -RRB- , and even having a laser peel on my face . I even used Accutane twice , and still I was left with severe cystic acne . I gave up on any kind of help from the medical professionals and started reading up on what alleviates acne . My acne before was so bad that I was breaking out even along my jawline . My acne was very persistent , I felt hopeless . I came across this gel peel and tried it out . At first it peeled and flaked my skin . The first application had a burning sensation on my face . However , I stuck to using the product faithfully and what a difference ! My skin is so clear that I have gotten compliments from people at work . I have been using this product for almost a year . I also use the other acid peels on this website . The amount you get lasts a very long time . My husband also uses the peel for his face and it has done an amazing job on his skin . His skin looked rough before , but now it looks smooth . I have found that I do not have to use the peel as often anymore , but I do still need to use it for maintaining my clear skin . Another great thing about this product is that it evens out my skin tone . I had brown blotches on my face after having the laser treatment and being put on birth control . They have since faded into oblivion ! I ca n't say enough good things about this product . One last thing I have to say is that this product is cheaper and more effective than the $ 500 laser treatment I paid for and all those doctor visits and useless prescriptions I paid for ! It has been a real life saver for me !
 I am a 46 year old male who has had bad acne from my 20 's until present . I tried all of the OTC products as well as several cycles of Accutane over the course of 26 years . A friend of mine at work who also had acne started clearing up a few months ago so I asked him what he had been doing . He told me of this product and his regiment -LRB- do n't all acne sufferers have one -RRB- he suggested that I give it a try as there was nothing to lose other than some money . I started around 6 weeks ago and here is how it went :1 . week one
 I am a black woman , with caramel skin tone -- and I do believe this will be part of my routine skin care regimine !!! I noticed immediate improvement , though not drastic . I have large pores on on my cheeks -- on either side of my nose and my forehead , small blackheads on my nose . I usually use Queen Helen mint julip facial to help with my `` enlarged pores '' and it seemed to be only an immediate fix -- a day later they looked like craters again . However , after this peel I noticed a change in pore depth and size . I woke up thinking `` Oh my goodness are my pores huge again '' -- but today -LRB- 2nd day after peel -RRB- they still are minimal !!! I am very impressed .
 This stuff is not a joke . But I like it . I 'm 39 & have been suffering w/adult acne for way too long and have tried so many products . I believe my problem is probably internal but this peel helped clear me up some regardless . The first time is recommended at only 1 minute & I thought that 'd be no prob since I 've put myself through such torture in the past to get clear skin . OMG it was more than uncomfortable & I could n't wait for a minute to be up . I did n't see or feel any results right away but it did bring some yuckiness to the surface right away ... a bump under my nose -LRB- ouch -RRB- . You should n't apply again in less than 5 days . Three days after I saw results . I was peeling around the edge of my nose & it was kind of gross & I was in public ... in a restaurant -LRB- very classy ! -RRB- & even worse ! ... I had no idea other than my nose felt weird & dry . The second time I could stand it much easier . It really depends on the cleanser you use prior to . The first time , I used a gel -LRB- Neutrogen Grapefruit `` something '' -RRB- that was very drying & the peel just aggravated that dryness . The second time - I 'm not gon na tell you I forgot it was on ! - but it was much less uncomfy & I could leave it on longer . The cleanser I used that time was a Cuticura bar soap -LRB- drugstore.com -RRB- & that 's a lot less drying . The third application was no problem . This does dry up/heal stuff you may have messed with -LRB- like I do -RRB- . My `` polka dots '' are fading & I have hopes that this will take care of some minor sun damage as well . This is not a miracle end-all be-all cure but I 'm glad this stuff exists ... I had kind of given up hope for any topical treatments !
 If I had rated this product two weeks ago , I would of given it a 1 star . This is because after applying this my skin broke out even more . However , I read some reviews and they stated that the reason it broke out was because it was bringing my future breakouts up top . So I did n't give up , I applied this peel twice a week for 3 min . This is my third week and right now all the breakouts are drying and clearing away.It 's true my skin starts to tingle when I apply the salicylic peel , but it 's good because I know it 's working . Overall I am impressed with this product because it helps clear my dead skin and regenerate new skin.P.S
 My struggle with acne is much the same as everyone else 's - persistent acne that refuses to quit despite medication and special washes and creams like Proactiv and skin i.d. -LRB- which by the way do n't help much unless its very mild acne -RRB- . I was skeptical to go so far as Accutane because I already have a history of depression without it being egged on by yet another medication . When I discovered this on Amazon and read the other reviews , I decided to give it a try since so many others seemed to have success with their serious acne and skin issues . I know they recommend the BHA as best for acne , but it seems to dry my skin out so badly my skin overproduces oil and makes it worse . This is the best balance for me , as well as the glycolic acid they make . On first use it can burn quite a bit , but after several uses you do n't notice it so much . And as other people have said , you want to wash it off your face with the coldest water you can find ! I am absolutely astonished that after so many years of battling and trying to hide my acne , it is gone for good , as well as all the scars and pock marks from picking and squeezing to get rid of blemishes anyway I could . If you have any doubts about buying any of the peels to help with your skin issues , squash them and do n't look back ! You 'll love what you see in the mirror !
 I have been fighting blackheads ever since my teens . Even with washing my face twice a day , proper toning and moisturizing , they never seemed to disappear . Beyond the blackheads that plague my t-zone , my skin is in good shape.I researched online for tricks to remove blackheads and was advised to try a salicylic acid mask on my problem areas to clean out the pores . The first time I used it , I followed the directions of keeping it on for only one minute -LRB- and building it a minute at a time each use -RRB- and I used it on my whole face . After rinsing with cold water and moisturizing my face well , my skin was ridiculously soft . The next day my skin looked glowing but there were still blackheads . As I used it every 3 days since then , the appearance of the blackheads on my t-zone has diminished . I know they are there because I analyze my skin too much but overall the quantity and size of them have been reduced . I have been using a pore minimizing toner with it as well to help tighten up my pores too.I am really happy with the results but definitely test this product first to make sure it is safe for your skin and only use it on problem areas at the recommended every 3 days because I was using it over my entire face and noted some spots were getting dry . I figured leave good enough alone . Also it does tingle , a lot . At the point I was using it for 4 minutes , it got unbearable at the 3 minute mark but I sucked it up .
 Normally I do n't write reviews , but this product is totally worth it , first the shipping was super fast , I ordered it on April 29th got it in the mail day before yesterday May 6th , really impressive because I 'm in Toronto Canada.I tried it last night in my face and my back , I have really bad acne scars , I have a hormonal problem and even thought my acne is gone the scars were really bad.It was amazing , it 's just the first time and my face looks way better , I ca n't notice any changes in my back so far , but I 'm hopping for it to clear too.Anyway do n't think it twice , I do n't know why I did n't try this before , I was contemplating getting laser done , but this seams to be an easy fast and inexpensive way to solve my problem .
 My husband bought me this stuff as I am 27 years old and I have been dealing with acne my entire life . I have tried EVERYTHING ! No really , everything over the counter , and everything prescription short of accutane as I refuse to take that horrific drug . -LRB- that is a whole other topic -RRB- ... regardless he purchased this for me in the hopes it would help . I have been using this for 4 weeks now and waited to post my review as I wanted to see if it would really work/help . Here are my recommendations and words of advice for you if you are thinking of purchasing this product :1 . READ THE INSTRUCTIONS FULLY BEFORE APPLYING ! 2 . The directions say it may tingle slightly when applied ... this is an understatement . It burns ! To aid in this while the product is on your face fan your face with some paper or put your hair dryer on cool while the Peel is on your face . This will take the intensity of the burn down . -LRB- slowly increase the time you leave it on your face , do n't leave it on the full 8 minutes the first time as you do n't know how sensitive your skin will be to this stuff -RRB- 3 . Rinse with cool water , not too cold , and NOT hot . Your face may be a bit red -LRB- like a sunburn -RRB- but it does n't last long , I HIGHLY suggest doing this at night before bed .4 . Apply a REALLY GOOD lotion , do n't skimp on cheap facial lotion here . I have and my face felt like sand paper , get some good thick face cream . This peel will suck everything out of your skin and you need to replace some of it.Now this is where I do n't so much like the product , I have been using it for 4 weeks and I have worked my way up to leaving it on for 4.5 minutes . My skin peels every week . My skin is sensitive and I look like a snake for the first 3-4 days after using the product . Even using good lotion I still peel like crazy . I know it is a skin `` peel '' , but I can not wear make up however , my skin is getting softer and smoother so hopefully in time I wo n't have to use it every week . -LRB- On the up side , if you had a HUGE pimple you needed to take care of stat you could dab this stuff on it as a spot treatment and seriously overnight it sucks it dry , a HUGE upside to this stuff . It KILLS active acne in its tracks -RRB- My only two down falls with this product is the burn , and the peeling , you may not peel at all , but know that it may be a possibility .
 This is my second order , and I find the gel works well to encourage peeling , and thus minimizes the appearance of blackheads . However , I also use rubbing alcohol before every application -LRB- which the instructions suggest and my doctor recommended -RRB- . I can use the gel more than once weekly for more than 10 minutes each with no adverse results BUT I do this only after careful patch tests , starting with one minute on the inside of my elbow and working up , minute by minute , on my face . I do not use the product on my forehead or near my eyes . Those who complain that the gel is ineffective might consider applying it after a steam bath and the alcohol swabbing . One caveat
 I been using this product for a few weeks , now . Let me start by saying the first time I tried it , I did n't apply it `` right '' -LRB- LOL -RRB- . I was scared that I was going to damage my face or something ... since it is acid you 're using . Anyway , the first time I applied it , I applied very little and barely rubbed my face with a cotton-pad , so honestly I did n't see much results in those few days . The only thing I experienced was a little bit of stingy ... so after seeing my face did n't burn off or anything like that , I did it again the third day -LRB- applying 2.5 ml , and rubbing my face according to the directions with the cotton pad -RRB- . The bad thing was my face was a little irritated -LRB- since I did it twice the same week -RRB- but that was it . By the fifth day , I saw positive results . So , for the NEGATIVE reviews that I read before trying it ; maybe you did n't apply it the correct way to your face or read the directions thoroughly . Well anyway , I use this product once a week and my face does not get irritated -LRB- unlike the first week -RRB- . I am mixed with black , white , and Austrian , and I have oily skin . I always had pimples since 8th grade , and it got worse after my first pregnancy . I tried every kind of cleanser you can name ... Neutrogena , Biore , ProActive , spa treatments ... spa treatments every month did me good BUT it is a bit pricey . After using the Salicylic Acid -LRB- 20 % -RRB- for 3 weeks now , it cleared my mild pimples off my forehead , and my huge pores had tightened up . Now that it is the third week , most of my huge pores that I got before has either shrunk , or disappeared . The first day I started this product , I had a very large pimple on my cheek ... and by the second week , ` that pimple ' shrunk , the third week -LRB- today -RRB- NOTHING is there -LRB- that pimple is GONE ; not a scar , not a spot , no blemish , NOTHING -RRB- . I also noticed other large pores shrinking into small pores , AND my small pores disappearing . My face is a lot smoother and glowing . If I could put pictures up from before and after , I would : -RRB- The reason I give this product 5 stars is because it is the only product that gave me the best results within a week , AND I had/have no breakouts -LRB- what so ever -RRB- since I started using this product . It will take time and patience for some of you who has the worse break-outs , or bad acne . However , depending on your skin type ... either you will see immediate results or it may take a couple weeks or so to see `` The Happening . '' My advice to a beginner -LRB- like myself -RRB- is to FOLLOW the directions . The first day you try it for the first time , try focusing on that one pimple on your face -LRB- day-by-day for 5 days -RRB- ... take a picture daily if you need too . That is how I was able to notice `` It Works ! '' You will see the changes like I did and by the way , IM LOVIN IT !
 If you plan on going to a spa or dermatology to spend hundreds of dollars for a peel , you are wasting your money . I purchase this 20 % aha peel along with their 35 % peel , shipping was fast , I got it 3 days after I place my order . If you have never done a peel at home , I highly recommend you start with the 20 % and as your skin get use to it then move on to the higher concentration . Better to be safe than sorry . I 've done chemical peels and VIPeel , I spent thousands of dollars , that went down the drain . One VIPeel treatment cost me $ 375 and that was on special , 6 weeks later I did another VIP treatment , I saw no improvement in my skin so I did not do the 3rd treatment as the dermatology recommended . I even spend hundreds on the products she sold me that did not work , but made me break out . With the chemical peel and VIPeel I was embarrassed to go out as my face would peel and it looked disgusting , people would stare at me . During the peel my face use to burn badly , hours after the peel my face was still be red . It took days for the peeling to stop . After all the dead skin fell off my face , I looked refreshing and the fine lines gone , however the brown spots from acne and sun were still there . Even if you have done a few peels please start at a low % aha peel.I used the 20 % peel for the 1st time on Friday night , after about 2 minutes my face started burning . I had set the timer for 4 minutes because I figured I 've done a few professional peels which was much stronger than 20 % , I could tolerate it , I was wrong ... I managed to let it sit for 3 minutes , I could n't bare the burning so I rinsed with cold water , then I used a neutralizer which stopped the burning immediately . I let that sit for 5 minutes then I rinsed with cold water , pat dry , then put on moisturizer . Immediately after putting on the peel I saw my pores shrink so that was the 1st sign of satisfaction with the peel . Saturday when I woke up my skin felt dry but tight . Sunday I had a little flakes , but after I wash and use a toner it was n't noticeable . Today is Monday and my skin is peeling , it is somewhat similar to the peeling that I got from the peels at the spa except not as bad . I ca n't wait to see what the new skin looks like and I 'm looking forward to the 2nd application which I will do Wednesday or Thursday night . After I 'm done with the 20 % aha , I 'll be using the 35 % aha . The instructions says to take a break for 1 month after using the 20 % before using the 35 % , that I 'll be doing . I love this peel and the price is great . Not only will your skin looks great you 'll be saving a lot of money .
 I 've only been using this product for 2 days but on the first day I noticed results the morning after I had used it . My pores were smaller -LRB- not by a lot but still noticeable -RRB- . When I applied the solution to my face I could literally see that it was drawing up the oil in my pores . Literally . I had the burning sensation that the majority of the users here also had but it was n't that bad . My cheeks were a little pink after using it but it went away after 10 minutes . I 've had acne since I was in grade school and this is the only product that I 've tried that actually seemed like it really works . I 'll report back in a few weeks to report my results but I have high hopes that my skin will be much smoother and more appealing .
 I 've been using this peel for a month now , with a total of 4 peels done on my face and back . I have acne and dark marks , olive complexion , and real oily skin especially in the summer months . It has n't helped with the oily skin , but it has diminished the amount of acne , and reduce the pigment on my acne marks . I 've used the glycolic peel of the same brand 3 years ago without any luck . This peel stings a lot when I apply it to my face , but not so much on my back . I have built 2 minutes tolerance for my face and that has helped to reduce my acne . I do use benzoyl peroxide and a prescription tretinoin for my acne and the combination of it all has helped keep my acne to about 1 eruption a week , where before I was getting one or two new pimple a day . I hope I continue to get results .
 I have heard a lot about this acid and decided it was time to try it for myself . I can tell the difference , like some of the reviewers mentioned , it does n't completely get rid of a scar -LRB- nothing does -RRB- but it did what it was supposed to , blend it in a a bit better . Newer scars seem to fade better than older ones . I would buy this again . I did n't quite know what to expect when I bought this . After reading instructions I gave it a shot , it burns somewhat but no worse then putting a liquid bandaid on . After a few days or so I noticed the top layer of my skin was starting to peel . Week and a half of using it every other day and my skin has peeled twice and returned to normal.Keeping scars out of the sun or at least protected from the sun is very important as well .
 After three uses my skin looks so much younger . My once super deep , big blackheads are almost gone . This is a miracle worker . Definitely worth what you pay . It says to leave on for one to eight minutes , but i could only leave it on ten to fifteen seconds . Buy this and you wont regret it . But be careful to follow direct exactly , so you dont damage your skin .
 I have done a couple of peels so far , but my only issue is the scarring that this stuff has done . My suggestion is if you use this product stay indoors for some days , because your face will not look pleasant at all . after two weeks or so your skin and acne does look much better . I guess you have to take the good with the bad here . you must treat your skin afterwards . overall , a decent product for acne prone skin ,
 Great product I have just used it once but can feel the difference my face feels smooth and less oily , I ordered the cellbone pH neutralizer along with it and they actually give a free 15ml sample of the glycolic 35 % peel . The shipping was really fast too !
 I bought this gel peel for a family member with acne . It was easy to apply with a gauze pad and caused minimal discomfort for the 8 minutes it processed . The results were immediate . Dead skin was beginning to shed and excess sebum had been pulled to the surface to be rinsed away . There was some flaking for the next 48 hours . We are very happy with the results after 3 applications .
 I never ever had acne as a teen . Then something happened at age 28 -LRB- adult acne -RRB- and the past 3 years have been horrible for the skin on my face . I have oily skin apparently and after just 1 application of this my skin dried out tremendously . The texture also appeared different right away , I will use this once a week for a month and I have a feeling I will see good results . Beware this peel does burn like fire . I am an experienced peeler and this one hurt from the second I put in on . I lasted 2 minutes in front of an open window with cold air blowing in . Start slow because this stuff is no joke . I did not actually ` peel ' either.Good Luck .
 I am 51 years old , with oily skin , moderate breakouts , mild acne scarring , forehead wrinkles , and slight jawline sagging . I have been using store-bought SA products for decades with no noticeable improvement . This product makes all the difference ! It was much milder than I expected during and after application . First application , I had it on for 8 minutes with minimal to moderate stinging and redness . On the second application I had it on for 10 minutes with minimal stinging . I had no noticable peeling or redness afterward , and a slight improvement in the texture of my skin -LRB- smoother -RRB- . I hope to see smoother , clearer skin after using this regularly over the next several weeks.UPDATE
 I do n't use this all over my face . I did a couple times , I did n't like the result too much . I dab a little bit from a Qtip right onto an emerging pimple and it disappears so fast . I love it .
 Ok ... never tried an at-home salicylic peel but this was pretty good . The directions said to use to before the acid peel -LRB- and Acid/Beta peel -RRB- but I was n't sure about the pH or the sensitivity of my skin to this stuff.Although -- I plan to try a salicylic/glycolic peel back to back I feel as if I may have to use a weaker salicylic . My glycolic peel is strong -LRB- 40-50 % -RRB- and I 'm scared that it may overwhelm my skin.Anyway -- I 've never done a full-face salicylic peel.I peel section of my face but I mainly use the salicylic for spot treatments once a week -LRB- i apply with a q-tip -RRB- . You have to assess your own skin sensitivity to see what you can/can ' t handle but salicylic can be left on the skin as a spot treatment . *** Just do n't try this with Lactic or Glycolic acid . *** But it works well . Thank God for peels . They 're an excellent addition to my skincare regimen . It keeps my acne away . I have to buy more actually . I may try the 30 % next time .
 It works to shrink existing zits and I think it softens the scars as well . I have n't used it long enough to know for sure . But for the price , it 's definitely worth the try . Go easy on the first few applications .
 This was my 1st peel and I was very happy.It hurt a bit for the 1st time but was very tolerable afterwards.This really helped clean my pores and gave my face a nice overall glow.If you are looking for noticable results and a stronger peel I highly recommend the TCA peel by Skin Laboratory . 15 % TCA.The salicylic peel helped me get prepared for a stronger peel.Great value and quality
 After years of sun damage and wrinkles forming on my skin , I never thought I could finally find something to help my complexion . Not only did it clear up my acne , but it made my skin feel soft and new . My wrinkles are much less noticeable and my skin looks a lot healthier . Not many products actually work but I 'm glad to say that this one did . I 'm very happy that I decided to use this product and I recommend it to everyone that wants better skin .
 I did n't purchase it here on Amazon but I have to say this is a great product . It is not for the faint of heart . I have very sensitive skin . I was only able to leave it on for probably less than 30 seconds the first time , the second time putting it on , I could only handle a minute BUT the difference was noticeable the 2nd time . If you can handle the tingling/burning sensation , it really is worth it . I make sure to start with the forehead , then to my chin , upper lip , then my checks as that is the most sensitive for me . There is n't another product like this for such a great price .
 My background
 I love this product !! I have not been able to find anything this strong or at this price anywhere . My face is always even and beautiful now , this is definately my favorite of the peels skin laboratory puts out .
 I had pretty good skin to start with but there were some things I wanted to improve . Not only did this product improve the items I wanted to address but it also had some other benefits . *** The texture of the skin in my tear troughs under my eyes was crepe like and would make the concealer look `` cakey '' . The skin texture has been dramatically improved . The surprise is that my under eye circles almost invisible now . I do n't even need to put on concealer anymore . *** When I smile I would get a bunch of wrinkles under my left eye . There was one deep wrinkle and the other finer wrinkles . Those fine wrinkles are gone and the deep wrinkle is much less noticeable . *** I had orange peel texture on my lower cheeks and around my mouth . Much of this is now gone . The deep texture on my left lower cheek is still there , but significantly improved . *** The skin above my lips looks awesome . My hubby even said `` the skin around your mouth looks great '' . I am now 6 days post peel and my skin is as soft , pink , moist and wrinkle free as a baby 's bottom.I noticed that the first few days , my skin feels a little irritated and sensitive . It is not that bad and is quite normal with any chemical peels out there . But I can definitely notice it as well as a lot of other reviewers on here.The reason is quite simple , you 're removing the outer skin layer so there is more exposure to the thin and sensitive skin underneath.To stop the sensitivity , I usePura D'or Pure & Organic Argan Oil 4 fl . oz.and apply a small amount to it to help form a protecting , moisturizing and healing layer . It works great ! 5 stars ! - Susan
 This peel works great ! I used it on my clients and myself and have seen great results . For those who know what they 're doing and have used active treatments before , this is a great weekly peel to keep major acne outbreaks at bay and smooth out the skin 's surface.If you 're thinking about using this peel and you 've never used anything but hand soap on your skin , I would say put the credit card down and do some research before you buy . The treatments really work , but if you have n't built up your skin 's `` readiness '' with some home treatments , even over-the-counter acne washes with 2 % salicylic , the burning this peel will produce will be too much for you .
 I purchased the salicylic acid about three months ago . If I were to review this product after using it for a month I would definitely give it a bad rating . After using the salicylic acid three times I got a really bad break out . It was probably my fault for leaving it on for about 5 minutes . My skin was all red and there were cystic pimples everywhere on my face . Especially the forehead and around the nose . It took about 3 weeks for these to subside , while I did not use the product . After these three weeks reluctantly I used the peel again , but only left it on for about 2 minutes , every 4 days . Then i increased to about 4 minutes also every 4 days or so . This seems to work perfectly . My skin has never been this clear . I never had a lot of acne , but I have a lot of white heads just under the skin that got infected very easy . This peel will slowly clear your pores and leave your skin more even and acne free . It needs time to work.I think its very important to emphasize that initially your very likely to get a bad break out . By giving your skin time to heal , and a little patience , you can get almost perfect skin . I highly recommend this product , especially to people who have a lot of white heads . Will definitely purchase again.Ps . - Make sure you use a good and light moisturizer after the peels , otherwise your skin will likely get very dry . I am using Cetaphil and it works great .
 While I had the typical set of pimples in high school , once I reached college and in the throes of my 20 's , the acne came full force . I 'm talking huge , pus-filled cysts building up along my face like houses lining up beach-front property . I did n't help the issue by continually popping them . Only by reading books , such as this one : The Acne Cure
 This product has done EVERYTHING it claims . Absolutely less scars , my fine lines are GONE , FIRMER skin , evening out my skin tone . I am in LOVE with this product . YES it is harsh and YES it will make you peel . But it is somewhat controllable . If you want better results than last time -LRB- resulting in more peeling -RRB- you leave it one a little longer . If you peeled too much last time , then leave it on a little shorter -LRB- resulting in less peeling -RRB- . Pretty basic . I use this product for 7 minutes . The peeling -LRB- in my case at least -RRB- happened two days after use , and lasted for two to three days . But i am always able to exfoliate it off easily and conceal it easily . The day after use , your skin feels like a sunburn , a little tight and red . Then the next night you will see flakes . But the flakes are very kind and easy to remove . Then a couple days later when you thought your face was finished shedding , it starts flaking again . And I 'll tell you why
 I have acne brought on by hormonal imbalances . As I 'm closing in on 30 , I figured this was a time to rejoice from those pesky kid problems . Little did I know!I had gotten a professional peel a few years ago . It was a mixture of three acids left on the face for no more than 2 minutes . I loved the results . This peel , the Salicylic 20 % is not as strong as the professional , but I have been getting similar results.I have been blessed with large pores -LRB- thanks mom ! -RRB- and I get the dreaded blackheads on my nose . I also get the classic outbreaks around my chin/mouth area and temples . I try to do a peel once a week , sometimes skipping a couple so that my skin can replenish itself appropriately . I leave mine on between 1-3 minutes . I ca n't take any longer than that . Also , at this concentration , I do n't see the need to leave it on much longer.I 've read reviews were some people were leaving this on for 20 minutes or so . DO NOT do this . The insert clearly states no longer than 8 minutes . -LRB- There is a reason for this ! -RRB- Also , I 've read where some women -LRB- mostly African American -RRB- were having pigmentation issues . If you do independent reading on salicylic acid , it can cause hyperpigmentation . Since A.Americans have more pigment in their skin , this is more likely to happen to them . This is not to dissuade you ! You know your skin better than anyone else . Just be aware . Also , do not use this product more than once a week ... and I would even say no more than twice per month . It is an acid that dissolves skin cells -LRB- think ... wart remover OTC is 18 % salicylic acid -RRB- . If you continuously remove layers you may put yourself at risk for scarring.Those are just my warnings to new users . Use this product wisely . It 's not a cure-all , but it will help . I also purchased the neutralizer . It feels good after having the sting on your face . An acid should always be neutralized!I hope you have found this helpful .
 Followed the instructions , and after gradually increasing the time i left the peel on my face , at the four minute mark , the peel just dissolved all of my blackheads . It was amazing ! I 'm glad I stuck with it , because the first few times , I just got some mild exfoliation from it . Build up to a time that would be effective for you , and it will give results .
 I did n't quite know what to expect when I bought this . After reading instructions I gave it a shot , it burns somewhat but no worse then putting a liquid bandaid on . After three days or so I noticed the top layer of my skin was starting to peel . Week and a half of using it every other day and my skin has peeled twice and returned to normal.I can tell the difference , like one reviewer noted yes it does n't completely get rid of a scar but it did what it was supposed to , blend it in a lot better . Newer scars are completely gone , older one faded just a bit . I would buy this again .
 I have some acne scars and sometimes breakouts . I have used Salicylic Acid peels in the past with great success . After the first two times using this product there is a very big difference in the appearance of my face . I caution everyone because this product should be used EXACTLY as directed , and everyone should try a test spot first . Everyone 's skin is different so a great success for one person may not mean everyone will benefit from this peel . My face is somewhat resistant to Salicylic Acid because of regular extra strength face washes and creams every day for the past 10 years so I do n't turn very red at all when using this mask , and I really do n't feel irritation on my face ; however , I decided the second time that I used the product to do my upper neck -LRB- under my chin -RRB- and that area of skin turned bright red for about a day . After using this product it is important to use some type of non-comedogenic moisturizer with an SPF of 30 . I ca n't stress that enough . My experience with most peels , especially salicylic acid , is that it is VERY easy to get sunburn after use even during the winter months . The moisturizer with SPF 30 is worth using even if you do n't think that it is needed . It is very unpleasant to get sunburn/extra irritation to a recently treated area of your skin.This peel can also be used for reasons other than your face , but you should avoid using it in large quantities , over large areas of skin , or too frequently . In the past I had noticed headaches and upset stomachs when I used too much salicylic acid . If you 're unsure about the peel or if you become overly sensitive to the peel it may be best to talk with a dermatologist , but the most important thing is to follow the instructions EXACTLY . Also , use a face peel brush to apply and not your hands . It is important to have control over where the gel is applied , and letting using your hands will likely lead to skin irritation and drying on your hands . Face peel brushes are pretty cheap and they are fan brushes so it is easy to control the application and get the peel on evenly and fast to avoid an uneven result.Overall I feel this is an AMAZING product that is very cost effective . When I do n't use the peels I use face washes and lotions to prevent breakouts and reduce scars , but the face washes and lotions easily cost me over $ 80 per month . I still have to use moisturizing lotions and other products each month , but when I use this peel I am only spending about $ 10 per month for face wash and lotion , and I have found that this size bottle of peel is good for a few months . I think this is a great buy .
 I love this stuff , I really do . I was looking at my skin this morning and almost cried because I never thought my skin would look so normal . I have had horrible acne since I was 10 and I am now 30 . A few months ago I developed the worst hormonal breakouts along my jawline . I had 20 + cystic zits at a time . I found this online and ordered it because of the reviews , though I must admit some sounded too good to be true . I purchased some witch hazel and cotton balls and always use that first . My first application I only left on for two minutes . Which is fine , please do n't have the warrior mentality about this stuff because I honestly believe that you get better results by gradually easing into it . After rinsing with lots of water I apply Neutrogena Oil Free Moisturizer with SPF 30 . This is a great sunscreen/moisturizer to followup with as it has a little skin tone evening / brightening effect and it smells so nice and fresh . I do not wash my face with any harsh cleansers the day I do the `` peel '' . I did this routine once a week for one month and all of my pimples and deep zits cleared up . Completely . In between treatments , I wash my face ever day with an Oil of Olay ProX using Olay Total Effects Blemish Control Salicylic Acid Acne Cleanser with it . I spend a good two minutes letting it work its way all over my face . I follow up with the Neutrogena Oil Free Moisturizer . Sometimes if my skin gets a little dirty feeling I 'll swab some witch hazel on my face . That 's it . Really low maintenance . Now I do the peel once a month . My skin looks so much better . I know I ca n't promise results because everybody is different but I know that it worked for me and I had tried everything . Since I started using this I have not gotten a single cystic acne flare-up and have probably only had about 5 or so little pimples here and there that came the day after wearing BB cream or powder . So , buy it , its so worth it and I have n't even used half the bottle yet . You ca n't beat that !
 I use this product twice a week and this has done WONDERS for me.I use cotton swabs to dab over my face and let it sit for about 2-4 minutes at MOST and it burns so good.I then use cold water and flush out the chemical peel . I then pat dry and use a noncomedogenic sunblock face lotion if I have to step out.I had bad acne and uneven skin but now it is clear and the pores are a lot smaller . So I look sexy now.Things to remember :1 . Avoid the sun2 . Do not Pick at your skin3 . Use plenty of water4 . DRINK a lot of water5 . When having the chemical on face please do not put on longer than 5 minutes -LRB- start with 1 minute and work your way up to 2-4 minutes per session -RRB- . ** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ** Pros : + Effective + Great value and cheap price + Beautiful skin and poresCons : - None so farValue
 Every time I read reviews saying `` It 's a miracle '' or `` Best product ever '' , I 'm skeptical . Usually because it does n't work for me . Ever . I 'm 30 years old and after going off birth control permanently last year I 've started getting horrible breakouts along my chin and jawline . Like everyone else , i 've tried everything ! Benzoyl Peroxide 2.5 % has worked , sorta , but it makes my skin dry , dull and ugly . I used this peel two nights ago - the burning was intense , duh . Also , I 've read enough about chemical peels to know that you really should rinse with a neutralizer . I filled my sink with cold water and mixed in a couple tablespoons of baking soda and used that to rinse . Thank god I did ! It took the burn away immediately . I was only able to tolerate the salicylic for about 2.5 minutes . Redness afterwards was minimal and went away within about 15 minutes . The next morning my skin looked radiant and smooth . The 3 or 4 chin and jawline pimples were dried up and I did n't feel oily at all - a huge improvement . My skin continued to improve throughout the day - I could almost feel the peel continuing to work . I figured the improvements I saw the first day would be the extent of it 's power . That is , until I woke up this morning -LRB- day 2 -RRB- . Wow . Red marks and scars on my cheeks with significantly lighter , skin looked even MORE radiant and all active blemishes were GONE ! I did n't wear makeup today . That 's a first . I had a little peeling on my chin but it disappeared with some cetaphil moisturizer.I 'm sold . Ca n't wait to use this product again ! For me to take the time out of my ridiculously busy life to leave a review for this product speaks for itself . I do n't leave feedback , ever . But I had to share this with anyone struggling with acne , scarring or uneven skin tones . This stuff works ! I 'm so happy!I will update this review in a month with my progress . I ca n't wait to see the `` new '' me !
 It 's not like real acid in the movies -LRB- good thing for me -RRB- but it does burn like crazy some times . I have rosacea and the really bad kind . I havent had it for long , although I 'm already highly sensitive to almost everything . This stuff , as I said burns and tingles , but when the procedure is done - my skin feels amazing ! It does make it red which is why you should use it at night and not before work.Application
 Even the burn in this is great . Really , it 's not like it burns your face and you ca n't stand it , it 's more like a `` this is kicking the ass of all my pimples '' burn . It 's magic , after just one use you will see it making the giocconda out of a pizza face in a matter of seconds !
 Cleared up my face right away . Pores are so much smaller , face is clean and radiant . I use prescription Retin A as well and this works so much better . Make sure to use lots of moisturizer and try to use something all natural .
 Use this once a week and I guarantee you 'll have smoother skin in less than a month . However , do not give in to the idea that keeping this gel peel on your skin for more than the recommended high of 8 minutes will get better results -- this stuff is potent , so start out keeping it on for one or two minutes at most , then work your way up to the longer treatment . You will experience slight stinging after application and that 's entirely normal . I will be using this product on a weekly basis from now on . Scaley , rough patches on my cheeks have almost entirely disappeared .
 This product is really fantastic . It can be quite uncomfortable at first , but , it really seems to do the trick . I had pretty much the worst breakout of my entire life , and this stopped it in its tracks . I have done this peel three times in about two weeks and I have barely had any breakouts at all , maybe one pimple every five days . Also , the pimples that do show up are very small and almost invisible when I put makeup over it . I do n't know if this will work long term or not , but , for now , it 's pretty fantastic !
 Well this is the 3rd bottle of thisvthat I have purchased.I was skeptical at first , and did have some redness and dry skin the first few times I used it.Now my skin has adjusted to it and im using it about once a week.My skin has never looked better and been so clear.This product does n't seem to have much effect on skin discoloratiom , I plan on purchasing the glyco/lax peel to take care of that.I definately would recommend this if you have mild to moderate acne.this company is great , the peel always arrives earlier than quoted .
 I 've been using this product for about two weeks now , though not on a regular schedule . The first day I got it , I used it for two consecutive days . I try to use it about every three days depending on the dryness of my skin . When I first used it , it burned very badly and I left it on for a minute . Initially , I saw no changes in the clearness of my skin and it actually made my skin very dry at first , then very oily even when using a good moisturizer . There was quite a bit of peeling on my nose after the first couple uses and I would n't recommend wearing makeup after using this unless you want to look cakey and flaky . I typically use it on Fridays and leave it on for the maximum 8 minutes then let my skin recover over the weekend . My skin looks quite a bit clearer with a few minor cystic blemishes here and there . Overall , I would recommend this product . It works better than most other acne products I 've tried . Just be patient and persistent . : -RRB-
 I decided to order this product after spending way too much money on professional chemical peels . The product is exactly what I wanted . I have had some very light peeling and i feel like my skin has improved after a couple weeks of use . Hopefully , it will continue to as time goes on . my only issue with this product is the unclear directions . There are multiple places where the information on application frequency varies .
 If there was such a thing as a `` magic '' acne solution , this would be it . I 'm a 26 y/o male and I 've been having these outbreaks for awhile now . I 've tried Proactive , Natures Cure , everything in the face washing section and nothing has worked until this peel . This product has dramatically decreased breakouts , cleaned and shrunk my pores , and helped my overall skin tone.If you are a beginner , start off with the 20 % solution and buy a skin Neutralized/pH balance . I use cotton balls to apply both the Peel and the Neutralizer.First week
 I love this product . I get cystic acne and this is the only product that works . It not only shortens the length of time I have acne , but keeps me from getting scarring and makes the overall condition of my skin far better . Improves elasticity and tone ! I use it as needed , and I complement it with lactic acid peels for anti-aging . The two work so well I have postponed my trip to the plastic surgeon indefinitely -- for collagen injections !
 My friend were raving abt how their skin become smoother and clearer after using the peel but i was sceptical at first because i understand that Salicylic Acid is not for everyone but i decided to brave it anyway . Am so please with the result . Like the instruction said it would , it stings a little . I washed it off with plenty of cool water aft 1 minute and my skin feels so smooth . I applied moisturizer as adviced . The next morning , i saw that my face peeled a little at the side of my mouth -LRB- probably missed the moisturizer there -RRB- but the white heads dried up really quick . Plus , my skin looks baby smooth ! Will be purchasing another for my mum to try !
 This product comes with clear and detailed instructions on how to use the same safely and efficaciously.I have noticed some reduction in my acne scars since I have begun to use the same . However , I have just begun to use the product . I have had no adverse reaction to the product.It is worth the purchase price .
 I have tried lots of acne products , and this one actually seems to have a positive effect , unlike many others . I have extremely sensitive skin , so I only apply it to spots when needed , probably a couple of times a month . I usually only put it on my skin for 30 seconds to 1 minute as it burns and I 'm not trying to melt my face off . I am not completely acne free all year , but when I use the product it seems to help reduce the lifetime of any acne to a day rather than a week .
 I find that products with Salicylic acid work very well for me.I used this for 6 months weekly and I have never experienced irritations.It smooths and cleans and I seem to have far fewer skin breakouts .
 Does what salicylic acid is supposed to do . I am mad at myself for using glycolic before , because all glycolic acid does is burn the top layer of the skin and thins it out . Salicylic has many benefits described above . Having a 2 % content is not enough , as in some face washes -LRB- Clinic -RRB- . Do n't waste your money on expensive products . I started using regular Dove soap and Cetaphil wash , and salicylic acid twice a week at first , and it 's all that 's need to clear the face . The initial break out was ferocious . I stayed home for two weekends feeling like I got the plague , which made me very depressed . The problems went away and the texture of the sking is still getting better -LRB- pores are smaller -RRB- .
 I really LOVE , LOVE , LOVE this product . It has helped tremendously with new acne outbreaks ! I ca n't wait to get the next strength up . Maybe I was just living in a cave for too long , but I did n't know how effective these peels really are . All the money II 'd spent on past acne products was all just cash down the drain in comparison to this . I wish knew about it before !
 I like it a lot . I 've been using it on my permanent eyebrow make up . I use it once a week . The tattoo is getting lighter but you need to be consistent . I recommend it .
 I have 37 year-old African American skin that is the color of toast or almonds . It is oily and I get small acne on my forehead with larger blemishes on my cheeks and jawline . I 've been using this off and on -LRB- from once a week at the start to once or twice a month now -RRB- since August and I like it . I have some hyperpigmentatin from past cystic acne which this has n't done anything to clear up but I have n't gotten any more large pimples since I started this peel which is awesome . Any pimples that I do get tend to go away faster than they used to . My skin feels so smooth after I rinse . I 'm considering the glycolac for my next purchase to get rid of the old dark marks.Note
 We use this as a spot treatment on acne spots before we go to bed . I have tried it on blackheads , whiteheads , and those deep painful cystic feeling nodules ... it works particularly well for the whitehead and cystic types -LRB- especially the swelling -RRB- . Sometimes it also helps to cover them with a spot bandaid after the gel has been applied . I would n't recommend using it on the same spot more than a few nights in a row otherwise it can dry out the skin too much and cause it to ... well , peel.Unlike other acne products , it does not discolor your sheets !
 I have used many many facial products , but not one as good at this one . I would highly recommend this product . After just one use my acne scars were much lighter , and my skin felt like a babies . I was totally amazed that I got the results that this product promised . I followed the directions exactly , and used witch hazel as my toner as recommended . I do n't think I could say enough good things about this peel . If you are having problems with acne , and acne scars you just have to try this . It really did work for me . I have very fair and sensitive skin , so I was a bit worried about redness , and peeling . I had none after the frist use , and to this day still do n't . Great product .
 I have never used a gel peel of this strength before - so when I first applied it - the burning sensation was a huge surprise . Afterwards , my skin started peeling slightly around the chin . I am pleased to say that after only one use , my acne is starting to fade . I would n't use this product more that once a week since skin needs time for new skin cells . I am very pleased with the results ! It is a very strong gel peel .
 Incredible Results !!! I 'm buying one for each one of my close friends . Cheap , efficient , and just plain wonderful !! I recommend buying a ph skin neutralizer to kill the burn after the peel . The seller ships very fast . This is a must for people who want to diminish their acne , pore size , acne marks and oily skin . I 'll be using it for life and giving it as birthdays and christmas presents for a whiiiile ... Great!Here is the ph skin neutralizer to kill the burn post-peel : Neutralizer skin pH balancer helps balance the pH of your skin for the safe and effective neutralization after peeling .
 Long story short been trying everything under the sun . I did n't change anything to my system -LRB- I wash my face with a Salicylic acid face wash morning and night and follow with face lotion -RRB- . I started this twice a week Mondays / Thursdays . I 've gone for about two weeks and the results have been simply fantastic . I have n't had any zits at all ! Sure , it burns like crazy but I think the results are worth it . I usually go for about five minutes then wash it off . This little bottle also seems to last forever .
 I bought this peel after trying a series of lactic acid peels . The first and most important thing I can express with peels of this nature -LRB- glycolic , salicylic , and lactic -RRB- is that you need to be PATIENT . This is not a miracle overnight cure for hyperpigmentation , acne , enlarged pores , scaring , and superficial wrinkles and lines . It will make these problems MUCH better with time.I have mild acne and some clogged pores and the winter season makes my face flakey red , and more prone to breakouts , especially not being in the sun , pool and tanned all the time . I was looking everwhere for something to work . After a lot of research I started trying the lactic acid peels , which are very moisturizing . I wanted to combat the dry flakey skin first . I tell you what I BROKE OUT LIKE CRAZY . I was so upset , but I kept at it . One peel a week , or sometimes less if I felt I needed it . Soon , my skin started looking a lot better , smoother , and the tone was more even . It also hurt less to put on the peel . So I decided to try this peel . WOW EVEN BETTER . My skin has never looked so good . I use the peel about once every three days , but I only leave in on for 1-2 mins at a time before i rinse . Then I follow up with amlactin -LRB- a lactic acid moisturizer -RRB- with a few drops of hyaluronic acid . If I am having more acne issues I will follow up the salicylic acid peel with Benzoyl peroxide , but nothing more than 3 % or it is too drying . I think someone with the same skin situation as me would really benefit from this product and for the really great price , its worth its weight in gold . I will be a repeat customer for sure .
 I do n't have acne , I have a different skin condition , Keratosis pilaris , so I decided to give this a try , because as many have mentioned , for the price you really have nothing to lose . It has definitely decreased the redness that comes with this , which is awesome because I 'm not particularly fond of looking like I 'm blushing all the time . It is also reducing the bumps on my face which is also fantastic . I have noticed a slight increase in zits -LRB- and I mean slight as in one or two zits every two or three weeks -RRB- , but many reviews say this will subside , and I believe them . Plus , since this dries out skin , the zits are gone in about four days so it certainly does n't bother me . I 've been using this for about a month and definitely would recommend it .
 The item was carefully packed and got here before the scheduled arrival date . Kudos to the seller ! Anyway , I never had problems with acne when I was a teenager ; however , I turned about 25 and bam , I suddenly have blackheads and pimples . The blackheads are most bothersome because they 're exceptionally noticeable on my nose and chin . I have tried every scrub out there to no avail.Then I purchased this peel . I 've never tried one before in my life so it was a novel experience . I will say that the first time I used it , there was significant discomfort . IE , it felt like someone was holding a blow torch to my face . The mask stayed on for only a minute . I got a little bit of redness , a little puffiness , but no peeling . I followed up with an oil free moisturizer . When I woke up in the morning , many of the blackheads had decreased in size or disappeared . Per the instructions , I waited 7 days and went back at it . This time , I was able to leave it on for about 3 minutes . My face is seriously peeling and now , there 's not a blemish on my face . I 've been cleansing , toning , and moisturizing the same as I always do.I would say that this product has been miraculous for me . I know the results are n't permanent ; nothing is . But this is something I 'm willing to add to my weekly skin care regimen because the results have been so dramatic . Even the women I work with have been complimenting me on my skin .
 I 'm 37 and have had acne since age 9 and still do . I have been a smoker for 18 years -LRB- quit 3 months ago-wish me luck -RRB- , so obviously this has taken a toll on my skin . I have been using Retin-A since I was 16 years old . I have dark marks where previous acne has been . I have a few tiny dent-type scars that blend into my smile lines mostly . I also developed `` melasma '' 3 years ago ... SUDDENLY when I was on a Caribbean cruise -LRB- obviously in the sun -RRB- . Even though I had been using VERY high SPF and very water/sweat proof , on my face for many years ... and was wearing it FULL TIME on this trip ... it still appeared and never went away . It is less noticeable when I have n't been in the sun for a very long time -LRB- winter time -RRB- , but even with high SPF it still appears MUCH DARKER as soon as the sun hits my face and does n't go away at all during summer months . I also have had very dark circles under my eyes for many years due to my olive skin complexion . I also have had redness around my nostrils and on my chin for the past 7 years . 7 years ago a derm told me that the red stuff was also sun damage -LRB- I was expecting a rosacia diagnosis -RRB- . I have also had large pores for a long time especially on my nose and chin ... but they all look big to me . I also still have an oily T-zone . Ever since I developed the melasma 3 years ago I have been searching for a cure that I could afford but I never found anything . My wrinkles and acne I have learned to live with ... not happily but as a matter of nature . After researching I knew that the only fixes would be expensive salon or derm procedures . So I gave up and tried to embrace my new marks all over my face ... -LRB- ARE YOU KIDDING ? -RRB- . I have not been able to do this so THANK GOD I RAN INTO THE REVIEWS OF THESE PRODUCTS ON AMAZON !!! I 'm SOOOOO EXCITED !!! I purchased THIS peel , the Lactic 35 % & Glycolic 25 % Combo Gel Peel , the HQ + -LRB- to use in the future - once I have a tolerance to peels -RRB- , and the pH balancer . The balancer is worth the -LSB- ... -RSB- bucks !!! I did buy all but the ph balancer @ -LSB- ... -RSB- because it was a tiny bit cheaper and I like the applicator gauze that they sell which I could n't find on Amazon . It is only -LSB- ... -RSB- bucks for 200 and they are perfect for this use ! More sanitary than using a brush over and over also . They are not very absorbent so you do n't feel like the gauze is sucking up/wasting the product .5 days ago I got the purchase in the mail . I used the Salicylic first because it was a Saturday and I therefore knew I would have a little healing time , if needed . This Salicylic 20 % was stronger than the Lactic 35 % & Glycolic 25 % Combo Peel . Today is Sunday -LRB- a week later -RRB- and I just used the combo peel.So , I put this mask on and could only leave it on for 20 seconds . The feeling I had around my nostrils -LRB- the most sensitive part of my face -RRB- caused me to remove it . I KNOW that the peel was effective even in that short of a dose . Both masks make pores smaller IMMEDIATELY ! Especially the biggest ones so THAT IS AWESOME !!! My skin felt/feels and looks very smooth , clean , brighter and tighter than prior to using -LRB- experience after using both peels -RRB- . I ca n't wait to work my way up to the HQ + since that is the one that is for `` dark marks '' . This Salicylic peel did make my darker areas of my face look a tiny bit brighter -LRB- including the redness , scaring , under eye circles and the melasma -RRB- . This shocked me in a wonderful way , because this peel is n't supposed to improve these things specifically . I had a mild breakout on my chin and forehead after this peel in areas I always have acne -LRB- about 3 days after using the peel -RRB- therefore I 'm assuming that it was acne already underlying my skin that the peel `` brought out '' . I 'm used to this when ever I restart Retin-A so I 'm not worried about it continuing . I had some redness and peeling only on my most sensitive areas of my face about 36-48 hours after using the peel . This only lasted for a day and was very mild . There was one tiny place that a thick piece of skin came off but I did n't know it was there until it peeled off -LRB- happened to the area that `` stung '' most when peel was on -RRB- . Today when I applied the combo peel I applied all over my face without putting it around my nostrils and left the peel on for 3 times longer than I was able to leave it on around my nose . From now on I will apply this way
 I 've used everything to get rid of my adult acne . My skin is combination so I have dry spots and oily spots and frequent breakouts . I 'm also getting fine lines . Every anti aging cream has made me break out and every acne medication has made my wrinkles worse . I thought I was a lost cause ... until i stumbled on this ! Wonderful stuff . I applied the first treatment for 2 minutes , it had started to sting a bit at about the 2 minute mark so I rinsed well with cool water and the stinging stopped . Immediately my pores were tightened , NO redness what so ever . Skin looked slightly firmer after one treatment , and every single one of my blemishes had shrank . The redness on my zits was reduced also . By day two , my skin had broke out slightly again but I reapplied the peel on day 3 for another 2 minutes and the results were even better ! skin is so baby smooth ! acne was `` zapped '' immediately and fine lines were less . Didnt have another post treatment breakout after that . Every single day my skin looks better . I cant even imagine what it will do for me after the recommended 6 treatments for full results !! I 'm so excited about this ! After 2 treatments my old acne scars are even fading , and old blackheads that have been embedded forever suddenly `` popped '' out !! I cant find a single blackhead on my face . amazing ! I 'm recommending to all my friends . My neighbor commented on how great my face looked on day 3 . I told her my secret ! after 3 days I look like I did 3-5 years ago -LRB- wrinkle wise -RRB- i cant wait for the full results :-RRB- finally something for aging skin that has teenage acne ! It is drying , so put on lots of a non clogging cream . I 'm using a vit e cream that has no pore clogging mineral oil in it . seems to work well with the peel .
 My middle-age skin was in need of a wake-up . I had n't had a professional facial in about 4 months , and I really did n't want to drop $ 100 on another , so I tried this . Good choice for immediate results.My main issues -- congested skin , big pores . I saw immediate improvement after only two applications for a minute or so . I was definitely in need of help , and this product helped . It also is helped to heal a cystic pustule . The only time I saw such immediate improvement on one of these was when I resorted to steroidal shots to heal a nagging one.Money well spent in my opinion .
 I 've been using this for a couple of weeks now and I am extremely please with results . I 'm already noticing that my acne scars are fading and my skin appears more clear and toned . Very happy with the purchase . This product is great for beginners , the tingle was still very intense - I could n't imagine starting out with a higher concentration .
 Problem : Slight redmarks/leftover spots from shoulder acneAttempts : Tried tanning indoors and outdoors . It only left me with darker spots and unhealthy burned/tanned skin.AHA cream . Left my shoulders oily and my clothes stained.BP cream . Destroyed several shirts from the bleaching.Nothing . Did nothing lol.Those scar removal patches . It sucks that they are expensive and the results are negligible at best.Solution : Got in this as it is serious for serious results . The first time I put it on 8 minutes . I usually alternate between shoulders in case I get a bad reaction and do n't go sleepless from the irritation on my back . I have been doing it 2x a week per shoulder area . Since the skin on the shoulders is a lot thicker than on the face , I 've left it up to 20 minutes . That 20 minutes burned lol but my marks are fading quicker than ever . I have some raised scarring that is fading also for the first time from these peels . My method is using a Q-Tip and dabbing it over the area and try to cover the `` shoulder pads '' of the shoulders . Just imagine the area football shoulder pads go on . The redness disappears within a few hours and the peeling occurs the next couple of days.My only complaint is that I did n't get the 100mL version ! I will next time!Update 1
 When I first started using the Professional gel peels my skin became dry and flaky , and would flake for days at times . It also brought out the pus deep in my skin , making me breakout more . I do n't think this step in the process can be avoided , with any brand !! BUT ... Better days DO come !! I promise . I feel that the way my skin reacted is a probably a pretty normal skin reaction . Best thing you can do , which will hopefully minimize the `` cleansing '' time your skin will take ... acquaint your skin to their level 1 peels -LRB- salicylic acid , glycolic acid 35 % , etc. -RRB- before moving to level 2 . When I first started using their gel peels I was mixing in a level 2 peel while my skin was still adjusted to a level 1 peel . I feel that alone increased my duration for having `` scaly '' skin and breakouts . Also , I do n't think I could have exfoliated enough !! Exfoliation will be your best friend . : -RRB- Now , I have reached the point where my skin no longer breaks out when I use the different level of peels . I do still notice some flaky skin , but nothing that is noticeable and a nice scrub ca n't take care of . I am in my early-20s and never had a serious problem with my acne until the beginning of college -LRB- when I was 17 -RRB- . My breakouts kept getting worse and worse and nothing seemed to work . I tried the major infomercials cures for acne , went to a dermatologist , researched online , etc. . Nothing seemed to permanently get rid of my acne and leave me with a clean-looking face ! It became even more frustrating when I started using their gel peels , but I was determined to stick it out for 3-months after reading other reviewers with this same scaly problem . Clear days started coming after many frustrating days . My skin has stayed clear -LRB- of course with the occasional breakout/pimple every now and then -RRB- for about a year now . Even though I have had the occasional breakout they have not been as severe as they were , which alone has been life-changing . Just make sure to find a good moisturizer -LRB- or two ... or three ... -RRB- that you feel comfortable using daily ... morning and night , and every time after you use their peel .
 Since I do not study chemistry , I can not understand how this product worked . I got acne suddenly this year may be because I always stay up late and have great pressure -LRB- I have never had acne before -RRB- . The acne is quite serious . The first time I used this peel , I felt my face was burnt . I only let it stay on my face for 30 seconds . Supprisingly , the next two days , the acne became dead . I continued to use it for about 3days . Then used it again the next week . The face did not react as strong as the first time . I let the peel stay on the face for 5 minutes . I continued to use this peel for a month , once/week , the acne was kept in a stable situation , which was not totally removed , but not serious as before . Later , my friends recommanded me Body Shop acne remove mask . Then I stopped using peel for two weeks . But at the begining of the third week , my acne sudenly tended to serious as a month ago . I began to use peel again . And my face reacted as strong as I first time used it . I guess I can not leave it until my life style become healthy .
 I told a friend I was going for a peel and she told me her secret . Buy the peel from the Amazon website and follow the simple directions to a `` T. '' I love the results , I peel once a week and will taper off to once a month soon . My pores are nearly non-visible , my face is so smooth and soft . There is very , very little discomfort if you can even call it that . Rinse very well with cool water and apply the lotion they suggest . I love this product and will continue to use it forever !!! Amazing results !!
 Hi . I bought this product hoping to clear my acne . I am 18 years old and had some acne in my chin area and a little bit in my forehead . Nothing serious but i just wanted to have clear skin . I have used this product twice and have seen lots of improvement . The ane scars dissapeared and the acne breakouts were much less frequent . Recommend this product 110 %
 I am 34 and still have breakouts . I have seen multiple dermatologists . I 've been on oral medications and topical medications . Nothing was working . I was desperate to find something to help me get rid of my acne and I came across this product . I have only used it 4 times and WOW ! What a difference it has made already . My face is clearing up finally . I only wish I had found this sooner . Surprisingly it has not dried out my face however the first time I used it , I did break out , but it cleared up quickly . My only suggestion would be to do the first application when you have no plans to be anywhere just in case you break out like I did . The breakout quickly went away and my skin is looking better every day!UPDATE
 I 'm trying to get my mid life skin looking smooth and even so thought i 'd try this . I 've got oily skin and it is sensitive so I read the directions and started a time line to peel , -LRB- ever so slowly -RRB- back the hands of time . I have sun damage on my chest and so when I apply this stuff I do the chest/neck and face . It does tingle a little bit but I followed the time for each peel and I 'm up to the 4th peel now and my husband and friends remarked how smooth and pretty my skin looks . I 'm going to keep with it and work up to the 8 min . max time allotment . I have a very oily t-zone and I highly recommend that you use a nice potent moisturizer -LRB- natural of course -RRB- to soothe & keep your skin from revolting . I allow at least 3 days between peels , use the highest SPF for the face you can get your hands on , -LRB- I use AVEENO for the face spf 70 -RRB- , be vigilant about wearing a hat . So far it 's been easy , subtle and gratifying .
 This product is amazing . I wasnt expecting much , but the results are unbelievable , i have used it 3 times so far . My skin is so much clearer , smoother , and pores are so much smaller ... totally worth the 18 bucks . The first time i left it on for 5 mins with slight burning on my cheeks . But the consecutive times i first clean my skin of all dirt and oils by swiping it with rubbing alcohol and then apply the peel . It works so much better and I dont leave it on past 3 mins cuz the burn is more intense . I have used so many products to try to control my acne -LRB- moderate -RRB- but nothing until this has come close !!! I actually purchase this along with some emu oil so after the peel i use a tiny amount to keep the skin moisturized -LRB- a little goes a long way -RRB- . Awesome !!!!
 I ordered this product a few weeks ago from amazon . After 3-4 times of use -LRB- second week -RRB- I noticed the results . I had very oily skin and acne issues . this product has dried out all my acne , COMPLETELY with in such a short period ! I notice spots on my face where my skin is peeling ; bringing out new skin . I love it ! I look forward to every use with excitement ! I have never seen results that work so fast in treatments . For the first time in years , my face is clear and I am starting to enjoy not wearing make-up . This makes me Love Amazon !
 I 've used products in the past that would clear up some of my acne but my biggest problem was always the deep scarring and the damaged/irritated skin that my breakouts would leave behind . The reviews on here really encouraged me to give this a try and I am amazed at the results ! I do have to admit that it is uncomfortable to use at first . After I would apply it , my whole face would start rapidly heating up and it is a bit to endure , but the results are well worth it ! I 've used it about once or twice a week for the past three weeks now and my scarring has tremendously gone down and my skin feels extremely smooth . Before using this , I was n't able to leave the house without caking on layers of foundation and now I honestly have no problem going out without any at all ! .
 Love this product , changed my LIFE . i hide when i have breakouts but now i feel alive again when i have clear skin . seriously , anyone with skin issues of any kind would benefit from this stuff . worked better than any acne meds from the dermatologist , and helps more than birth control did too . it really has been the only solution to my acne . i feel so thankful to have found this -LRB- by recommendation from my sis -RRB- . in photoshoots , i have perfect skin and do n't have to wear a bunch of makeup to cover up and make the acne worse . i posted an unretouched pic from my last shoot to show how clear my skin was . i did n't have to cake on makeup , it was so nice
 I have the worlds largest pores , it makes my skin look uneven and makeup doesnt glide on well : - / After using this product i noticed that the pores were actually lifted out from my skin immediately after rinsing off the peel . blemishes were brought out from under my skin that were invisible before the peel and were gone the next day . Seriously worth it !
 At 40 I started getting bad break-outs on my forehead -LRB- around the temples -RRB- . Prescription products didnt control the problem . Peels at dermatologist 's office did . But they were $ $ $ and I had to get them twice a month . This product is working just like those peels . It did take about two weeks of twice-a-week use to totally clear up . Lately , I 've been using it weekly and my skin remains clear .
 I had terrible back acne as a teenager , I no longer have it , but I had/have the dark spots to prove it . They are currently fading with each use -LRB- weekly -RRB- , the really numerous small ones that were n't so dark have already disappeared . Still waiting on the big/dark ones , but I can tell they are getting lighter and lighter . Used it 3x so far . I will be buying again when I run out . Shipping was also very timely . I would recommend this to any person of color who is trying to get rid of dark scars faster .
 Greatly helped my acne prone skin when nothing else worked for years . I highly recommend this product , just try it for 6 weeks . It will make your skin break out firt . Your pores will then smooth out . Miracle I say
 I was a little nervous about using this at home , but I followed the directions to the tee and am so happy with my results . After about 6 weeks of use , I have less acne breakouts and my pores look much smaller . Fine lines around my eyes have lessened , as well as furrow lines seem less deep . My t-zone is more normal and less oily . I am amazed this addressed so many different problem areas on my face . A great overall facial skin problem solver . Love it !
 I am a lovely latina . I have had hyperpigmentation around my mouth . I was embarrassed at times to be seen . I bought many products cover up , concealers , foundation . Nothing worked as well as this product . I have used this product each time my skin improved . I am a work in progress . I see this beautiful skin appearing . It has also erased fine lines , extra plus . I wish I would of found this product a year ago . It would of saved me heart ache and lots of money . This product is worth the money . It was a miracle I had prayed for .
 I bought this item to use as a mild chemical peel , but happily discovered that it works well in controlling new acne breakout .
 I have used this product once a week for about a month now . It has done a good job of reducing the appearance of my acne scars , and has helped increase skin cell turnover . I have n't really seen a huge reduction in acne , however , but am hopeful that it will do that in time .
 Just only 2 days , I just have a feeling of this product . It is good , just a little makes skin dry . I will submit more information of the effect of this product later .
 I never write reviews on wow , this is making my skin clear up and I have had a weird acne thing on my chest -LRB- forgot the term te dermatologist gave -RRB- for years and have been trying to get it off my chest for YEARS and this stuff makes it fade every day and so far it has done more in a week than I have in those years !!! totally see why people rave about this . Here 's hoping it keeps helping me !
 Cellbone Technology is a great product ! I use it often and many of their products ! Just do n't over sue the acids !
 I would recommend this product because after the dry skin went back to normal I noticed the marks got extremely lighter but the process of putting this on your skin Im not too thrilled about but that has nothing to do with the buyer .
 I have moderate acne and I get big scars easily . I 'm a black woman with tan/brown skin . I get really dark spots left from the acne . I just received my bottle Friday and tried it two times . The first time I used a cotton ball and it was very little burning so I left it on for 10 minutes . I did n't really see any results . I tried again the following Tuesday and I had received my brush that I ordered . I used it instead and I felt a major difference . It began burning immediately . I was able to distract myself for 10 minutes . I did n't get red but I didn see the white spots that others spoke about . I used the neutralizer and my skin was so smooth . I also noticed that I only had a shinny nose where my entire face is usually oily . I think if I keep using it twice a week , I will see more results and the bumps will completely clear . I 'm satisfied . I will change my rating to a 5 if I 'm able to use Amby on my dark spots without reoccuring break outs .
 It really zaps blackheads like no other ! On my skin it burns very badly but I do feel it helps with my skin . There is an initial breakout that happens because the product is pushing your acne to the surface . Still , worth a shot .
 I love this stuff . I have been using for a week now , and I have never found a product that works as great . I already see a huge difference . I have been using every other night vs once ever week , and it is just amazing . No lie , I can almost go without makeup . It will make you break out with small little pimples the first few times , but that is just getting the old bad stuff out of your skin . Nothing to bad , or anything to worry about , at least not for me . I will continue to use this stuff . I do n't really think that it stings other than , maybe , the first minute you put it on , but definitely nothing one ca n't take .
 Product works exactly as described . I broke out at first but it did an excellent job getting rid of all my blackheads . I would recommend this to anyone struggling to control and eliminate acne .
 I love this product ! I had a lot of scarring and this helped so much . The first 2 days i can see my face getting ready to peel and the 3-5th day its peeling a lot and its worth it ... I noticed a huge difference even after the 1st use . Thank you Amazon for selling this Its a great product .
 it worked really well . it burns REALLY bad for the first few mins but once you get use to it you 're all good . do not buy if you have sensitive skin . with regular use , the dry skin that it causes will go away . and do n't forget to moisturize !
 I have issues with eczema on my arms and face and after paying LOADS of money to a worthless dermatologist and equally worthless prescriptions , I found this product.I first used it in a few spots on my face -LRB- nose , cheek -RRB- where I was having small mini breakouts . A minute or two with it on , I was shocked to look into the mirror and see all kinds of major GUNK coming out of my pores . It was as if the product hit the `` evacuate '' button and all hands were on deck to help with the purging : PThe next spot was my arm . When I previously went with the dermatologist , it took honestly at least a year to see the SLIGHTEST improvement in my skin with my arms being the toughest spots . 4 minutes with this product on left my arm feeling much smoother . It will be a spot that will need repeat applications for sure but I was very encouraged by all results so far.WARNING : This is a wonderful product but like everything else in life , it 's not idiot proof . Read the directions !!!
 Finally ! I have tried every OTC product I could find and sought help from several dermatologists . Nothing worked well or had lasting results until I tried the peel . This stuff is amazing . Acne and blackheads were greatly diminished with the first use , fine lines were less noticeable , sun spots faded , and skin texture was more smooth and firm . Each use provides noticeable improvement and the gains continue days after the treatment . This product costs little in terms of time , money , and effort . Start with the shortest time recommended and gradually build up so you do n't have chemical burns and look like you just stepped out of an inferno . Follow all directions and begin with the shortest time suggested-this is a powerful product ! Product was packaged well and arrived at my home in just a few days . I would highly recommend this product , but suggest you do a patch test and follow directions to avoid pain and embarrassment . The only drawback is the slight skin bleaching effect . The treated skin was lighter the the skin on my neck after each use . The great results outweigh this one small downside .
 I ordered this along with SkinLaboratories 35 % Lactic Acid Peel and their 35 % Glycolic Acid Peel . I have only used this one and the Glycolic acid peel thus far but let me tell you , do NOT let the percentages deceive as to how much of a wallop these products pack when it comes to the `` tingling sensation '' . I have had problem skin all my life -LRB- I am 21 now and started having acne at 8-so much fun -RRB- and as a result I have used my fair share of prescription grade and drug store grade products . That being said I am on week two of using these items and I am seeing quite a bit of progress . The first week I used this product once a day everyday for about a minute , yes it does burn but as soon as you wash it off you can visibly see where it is doing its magic . Furthermore in order to sooth my skin every night after doing this I would slather it in Jojoba Oil and really rub it in like a gentle massage . Yes , your face will be red after you use it but the redness does fade by the next morning . Your skin will feel tight and it will peel -LRB- literally -RRB- but it will not be painful it is comparable to just speeding up the rate at which dead skin sloughs off . For me the dry patches were my forehead , chin , and around my nose area-interestingly the oiliest parts of my face . Another thing , your skin WILL break out when you use this seems discouraging believe me I know however it takes about two weeks for your skin to purge itself when you start a skin regime that is as intense as this . I also use and ultrasonic cleansing tool on a daily basis and no my skin is not irritated or raw . I do not expect instant results simply because I have prior experience with multiple skin regimes however compared to the result times I have gotten used to -LRB- 2-3 -RRB- months this one is working out rather well . This week I have been using the Glycolic acid peel so I suppose I will leave feedback about that .
 I originally purchased this peel a year ago and I 've reordered it twice since . I leave it on about 2-3 minutes and it does the job without being too uncomfortable . I 've noticed my pores smaller and my skin a little tighter and less dull . At first I used it once a week , but now it 's more like once every 2-3 weeks . It 's no miracle , but it works for me and will continue to be a part of my beauty regimen .
 I have used this product once a week for the past three months . I have had problem skin for years , very oily and frequent break outs . I purchased this product for the scars the acne leaves since I heard it works great for this purpose . While it has n't completely eliminated the scars , it does peel some skin off the scar , and has made them almost invisible . Not quite gone , but barely noticeable anymore.For past six weeks or so I have also been using retinol cream , Retinol Cream -LRB- Vitamin A -RRB- - 2 Oz . + FREE Blemish Roll-On Stick with Tea Tree Oil . I have been applying it every night and lately my skin has not only cleared up but also looks and feels much smoother than it has been for awhile . The combination of these products are working wonders for my skin , and for the low cost , it would be my first recommendation for anyone with skin problems
 I 'm a 33 year old suffering from acne for the last 15 years or so with some minimal ice pick scarring on my cheeks . I 've tried everything from meds , prescribed topical solutions , 100s of face washes , homopathic natural approach etc etc. . Nothing seemed to work for me . Bought this 20 % solution about 2 weeks ago and gave it a try.The 1st time I applied this stuff on my entire face which was a bad idea . I started on my forehead and by the time I got it applied to the rest of my face I was 2 minutes in on my forehead but only 1 minute in on my cheeks which made it difficult to time and to have it work evenly . Alot of `` frosting '' occured on the sensitive parts of my face such as cheek bones just under the eyes , my nose and around my mouth . For 2 days my face was severely red in those areas it looked like I got a black eye or a good beating . My sensitive areas peeled quite a bit and underneath revealed very smooth , perfect lookin skin . My Ice Pick scarring looked slightly less deep after 1 peel too.On a side note my acne actually got worse on my forehead before it got better . I guess that has to do with the toxins coming to the surface ? I suggest applying this peel to your forehead and jaw 1st because those areas can withstand a longer burn , wash off , THEN apply this stuff to your sensitive areas 1 at a time -LRB- below the eyes , nose , around mouth -RRB- or you 'll seriously burn yourself like I did.Also the instructions said to wash off with plenty of water but maybe a PH neutralizer would be better . My face start to burn and frost over and I will dump my entire face into icecold water in the tub and it still continues to burn for 20-30 seconds after . So if you dont have a PH neutralizer I 'd suggest washing this stuff off BEFORE you reach the painful point.Also I 'd like to add in that I never take the time to write reviews but this peel worked so good I had to share it with everyone . Good luck guys !
 I 've used this product for over four months , once a week ; additionally , both my sisters and one of my brothers have used the product a couple of times . 15 uses ? Pshaw . 20 at least ... unless you have an exceptionally large face?The first time you use this product if you can manage 2 minutes you are a super hero . If you manage that much without crying you have exceptional tear ducts and/or pain tolerance . However , every time afterwards is exponentially easier to handle till 8 minutes is not big deal . Persevere!Right from the first use I noticed a radical decrease in pore size -LRB- look in a close up mirror 10 minutes after peel and again in the morning to note change -RRB- , that it was easier to extract goop from my pores and that any cream or treatment worked more effectively proceeding a peel . I happen to have exceptionally large pores pretty much all over my face , asian american , but regular use of this product has made my pores appear less sunken in and smaller . Plus , my skin is tighter and smoother , on my forehead especially.There was definitely some redness and dry skin the first time I used it on myself , but that also diminished with every use . Though that also could have to do with perfecting MY PROCESS :1 . Wash face really well , either with my SkinSonic or just in the shower2 . Tone with Witch Hazel -LRB- tried this with just alcohol a few times and that adds more redness recovery time -RRB- 3 . Apply product with a cotton ball evenly all over face using a q-tip to get around the nose and lips precisely4 . Sit for 8 minutes -LRB- or however long you can stand if you 're on first few uses -RRB- and read something distracting5 . Splash face with really cold water for a full minute6 . Take a pinch of baking soda mixed with water to makes a runny paste and apply all over face -LRB- one can of course buy a neutralizer if one is so inclined , but I highly recommend this step . Yes , it will sting to apply the baking soda ; every times you do it , at the same pain level . However , after a few brief but intense seconds , the pain will fade entirely - which I find it will not do otherwise - and if I do it at night , the next morning , no redness and I 'm good to go for make-up first thing . -RRB- 7 . Splash face again with cold water till stinging subsides . *** 8 . I then follow with a PH balanced , moisturizing , non-tightening facial mask . Alba Deep Sea Facial Mask left on for 5-30 minutes -LRB- it does n't really dry out and is VERY moisturizing mud so you can get away with leaving it on for a long time -RRB- then gently rinsed off .9 . To still dripping wet face rub in oil . I am a huge believe in facial oils for daily use . I use jojoba oil from acne.org , the give you a ton and it lasts forever . It slowly absorbs into the skin no need to rub too much -LRB- is FANTASTIC for oily skin -RRB- so no roughing up tender skin and there is n't a long list of ingredients which could potentially interact poorly with the acid that just ate at my face . **** 10 . I use Acne.org Treatment -LRB- a really gentle 2.5 % benzoyl peroxide cream -RRB- every night as well . I find it helps a lot with keeping my skin clear of acne and new blackheads as well as help keep my make up in place if I put it on the night before and then do n't wash my face in the morning . *** I use step 8 to eliminate dry , flakey skin after a peel , but I have SUPER combination skin that is , at times in the same places , super oily and super dry **** If acne and blackheads are really your deal , I would still suggest the acne.org Treatment to tighten pores ; however , if that also is n't your deal whatever cream or serum deals with you would go great < here > Sheesh , this is long and I am aware my Process -LRB- if reading this out loud make sure to properly emphasize the P -RRB- is convoluted and tailored rather specifically to my skins quirks . However , if you used this product and liked it lots but was then plagued by redness and dry skin consider some variation there in and see if it helps!I 've skipped this product for one two respective occasions and my skin simply did not look as good those weeks . So this is a skin addiction , not a one time use skin cure forever -LRB- what ever is ? -RRB- which might matter to some people.Alright , I 've run out of things to say . It might seem like I have a lot of qualifires , but I do believe this product to be worth every penny . The price and The Process , have nothing on what a Spa would do in terms of both money and time , and the results are on par for me .
 Stats about me :19 year old Caucasian female.Struggled with severe acne during puberty and moderate acne these past few years.Had acne , acne scarring , large pores , oily skin , and two fine lines on my forehead when I bought product.Has never before written a review on Amazon , but was so satisfied with product that I simply HAD to.I ca n't remember how I came across this product on amazon , but once I did , I decided to give it a shot -LRB- 20 bucks is n't that painful to spend on an experiment -RRB- . All I can say is WOW . Immediately after using this product , I noticed that my skin looked fresher and clearer . I gasped when I saw it because I was n't expecting such an immediate change . The next day , the true extent of the effects was seen -LRB- I think skin continued sloughing off throughout the night -RRB- . Many of my pimples had become unclogged and were shrinking , many light acne scars had disappeared completely , the stubborn scars had noticeably faded , and my fine wrinkles became even finer . Talk about fast results!I 've continued using the peel every 5 days -LRB- I 've used it six times now -RRB- and now , my pores do n't even have the chance to get clogged and develop pimples . The only zits that I get nowadays are on the edge of my face -- either my hairline or along my jaw -- because those are the parts of my face that I am not as thorough with when applying the peel . The fine wrinkles on my forehead are virtually undetectable unless if my face gets oily , which only happens if I go without showering for more than 3 days -LRB- my skin dries out easily so I space out my showers -RRB- . The scars are n't even there anymore , and my skin is overall much softer.My skin has gone from being rather unremarkable -- you know , not bad enough to notice , but not good enough to notice either -- to beautiful . I now have the type of skin that is clear more often than it is breaking out ... something I have n't experienced since I was 12 . I also have scars on my arm from self mutilating when I was young and stupid . I read online that chemical peels are used to professionally remove scars and so I decided to try out my salicylic peel on mine . This was the thing that finally pushed me into writing a review . The results were way above my expectations ; all of the fainter scars have faded into being practically nonexistent and the not-so-faint ones have become faint . I can not wait to see what my arm will look like after I use this peel on it more that once . This is coming from a girl who has bought countless scar-removal creams and has never seen much improvement . At 20 dollars , this peel is half as expensive as mederma and has given me the results in 1 use that 3 tubes of mederma have been unable to . I am so happy because I was always asked about my scars and I was very self-conscious , but now I do n't think they are noticeable enough to attract anyone 's attention . For all of you who have scars of your own or who know someone who ca n't get their 's to go away , recommend this product PLEASE . It is simply amazing.I think the reason that so many people on here have had unsatisfying results with this product is because they do not allow the peel to work on their skin long enough . I 've kept it on for the maximum 7 minutes every single time I 've used it , even the first time , and that 's probably why I 've had such great results so quickly.TIPS : It really burns like hell when you first apply it ; but the longer you keep it on , the less it burns . At the end of the 7 minutes , I ca n't even feel it on my face anymore . So ... if you can just get yourself through the first 3 or 4 minutes , you 're good to go for the full 7 ! I 've also found that fanning my face with something heavy-duty , like a plate , takes away the burning sensation and makes it much easier to get through those first few minutes . I do n't know how long I could stand to keep it on if I did n't fan my skin.I go into the shower to rinse it off because I feel like it is safer to stand under a jet of water in order to remove acid from my skin rather than simply splash some onto my face.After you remove the peel , your skin will get super dry . At first , I just used lotion because that was what was recommended , but when I did so my face stayed dry for days -LRB- even when I applied it generously -RRB- . I had some vitamin E oil in a drawer -LRB- a failed scar removal attempt -RRB- that I got from walgreens for probably 7 bucks . I rubbed that onto my skin instead and have found that it keeps my skin much better hydrated than lotion . I think the reason for this is because , well , it 's pure oil -LRB- it feels like olive oil -RRB- , so its like returning the oil to your face that you had stripped away -LRB- but it does n't look oily after it has been absorbed -RRB- . Normally , doing this to your skin would result in waking up with a break out , but since your pores are so clean after the peel , I 've found that they do not get clogged even when I rub oil into them . The vitamin E oil combined with the effects of the peel also leaves your skin feeling like a baby 's butt , which is great.Make sure that you read the directions of the peel and use a toner beforehand to help open up your pores so the peel can dig deeper . Also , I 've noticed that the peel burns A LOT more when your skin is very dry when applying it . Make sure your skin is hydrated before putting on the peel because it hurts much less then.I know this is a long review , but I just had so much to say about this true miracle in a bottle . I love it so much that I 'm even giving bottles away as Christmas presents . I highly recommend that you try it and try all of the tips that I 've provided , because I 've had amazing results using them and I hope you do as well !
 I am a 43 year old Caucasian woman and have had acne my whole life . I would classify my skin as combination sensitive . My acne has never been bad enough to require Accutane or constant dermatology visits , but it is annoyingly persistent and has worsened into my early 40 's . I usually have small pimples every morning , and larger cysts maybe once a week . Visible blackheads on my nose that have never resolved . I have very large pores on my nose and chin and damage from past and ongoing cystic pimples in those areas . I also have had regular but not so often acne on my cheeks , maybe once a month . But the acne in those areas discolors my skin for a longer period of time . I also have 4-5 milia -LRB- tiny white hard pimple things that never go away -RRB- that have formed around my eyes in the last year or so , probably due to the anti-aging gunk I have started trying there . Over the years , I have used antibiotics a couple of times and that really seemed to help with the acne . However , as soon as I stopped , it returned.I have never had a facial or experienced any kind of chemical peel . This was my first time . : -RRB- I have been using this product for about a month , maybe 2x per week . I always wash my face and then use alcohol all over to clear and prep my skin for the acid . I do not use a brush or gauze or anything to apply it , but use my fingers . I pour about 2 pea-sized drops into my left palm and use that to start with . I apply to my forehead , down my nose , and then to my chin , and then do cheeks and the skin around my nose . Sometimes I have to pour a bit more into my hand to get it all done . At the end , I get a Q-tip and apply it very carefully to the milia closer to my eyes . Word of warning
 My Problem
 I have been using this product for about a month now and I must say I have seen positive changes ! I still have persistent acne on my right cheek but once I apply the peel it starts to dissapear fast . This product has shown positive signs clearing the dark spots on my face too . I have spent so much money on many products including proactive but this works far much better ! I hope I continue to see positive results so I can have a spotless and healthy skin once again . I would reccommend this product no doubt . Also , I have dark skin and I sometimes use it more often than advised -LRB- do n't do it because I do -RRB- . Goodluck!March 25th - Still have acne but they have decreased in severity . I Still have dark spots but since using this peel , they have continue to lighten . I am still breaking out and changes right now seems slow so I 'm thinking of buying Lactic acid peel . I 'll give y' all an update later . I would still recommend this product , I just thought by now , I 'd have a flawless face.May 10th - This product did n't work for me in the long term . I 'm going to try the Lactic acid and use this as a pre-peel . Argh ! the search continues ...
 I started having problems with adult onset acne at about age 25 - am now 40 . Have tried everything - oral antibiotics , topical antibiotics , retin-a , etc. etc. . Despite trying numerous dermatologists , I never got what I considered good results - just a three minute visit and a couple of scripts . Decided to try this - at the price , nothing to lose . Man am I pleased . For the first time , acne is resolved -LRB- I have used the peel once a week for about six weeks -RRB- . My scarring is improved and my skin tone is becoming much more even . Even improving my melasma . I would highly recommend this product . Word of caution . Acne will worsen after the first treatment - wait it out - it will improve Dramatically .
 Well , I suppose my title got your attention . What does that mean ? Let me start at the beginning and walk you through this . I developed Rosacea as an adult , about 40 or so , I 'm 58/male . At first it was just some redness that was no big deal . Well one of the side effects is that Rhinophyma can start to develop . That 's what happened to me . It starts slowly , you do n't even realize it is happening . If you have `` normal '' bathroom lighting it actually masks a lot of the first stages . I went to Vegas for a wedding and the bathroom at the hotel had fluorescent lighting . If you want to see something frighting , go look in a mirror and use fluorescent lights . Holy COW ! The skin on my nose looked gray ! I also had one place on my nose that was a stubborn pimple . It was n't red though so I never paid it a lot of attention . I like to think that I 'm not narcissistic , but my nose got to the point that it was starting to call attention to itself . There would be times that I got pimples also , make no mistake about that ! I tried OTC acne products , not much difference , heck I tried so many things I ca n't list them all . Sure I 'd get some peeling but nothing really changed . So , I ordered this and Glycolic Acid and got them the first of August . I wanted to use it for 2 months before I reported back . So here I am . I have not used the Glycolic Acid yet , I 've used 1/2 bottle of the Salicylic.O.k . here is what I did . I have used it almost exclusively on the nose , along with a couple other problem areas . First the results on the nose . Like the title says - I have my nose back ! It is a normal looking nose as smooth as you would expect for someone my age if not smoother . The excess gray -LRB- dead -RRB- skin is 95-99 % gone at this point . It is flesh-colored and has no bumps anymore . I figured the bump was a cyst of some time , deep in the nose . It took a lot of work to get it out , even with this product . When I had finally removed enough layers of dead skin then an amazing amount of fluid came out . I hope I have n't grossed you out too much but if there is anyone out there that has gone through this they understand the frustration . BTW I 've been to dermatologists in the past , ALL of them told me that it would cost thousands of dollars to apparently do what I 've done for under $ 20 . Here is exactly what I did . I used this product every day , sometimes twice a day for two months . Did it sting ? No , not for a LONG time . There was so much dead skin that it did n't make a dent . Does it sting NOW ? Yes , but nothing that I ca n't handle . Mild stinging . I used a cotton swab -LRB- Q-tip type -RRB- to apply it . I waited the ten minutes then used COLD water to remove it . Patted it dry with a towel and then used jojoba oil immediately after . I highly recommend the jojoba oil in conjunction with this . I produce a lot of Sebum btw -LRB- probably had a Sebum cyst . -RRB- You can get the jojoba oil right here on Amazon too . It seems to balance all kinds of skin types.You will get some peeling but I saw a lot less peeling on areas of my face besides my nose . The other areas I mentioned are another problem area that also had an old acne scar that looked like a small punch hole . This area improved so much that one day I went to apply the Salicylic and I was unsure where the area was . THAT was very gratifying . You DO have to keep using it though . Based on my results you ca n't just stop using it . I have gotten to the point where I use it a couple times a week now . I think that I will switch to the Glycolic Acid next since it 's a longer interval on that regime . The Salicylic instructions say that you can use it every day . I 'm also going to use a bit over the rest of my face because it DOES smooth out the flesh very nicely.At any rate , that 's what I did and that 's what I got . My nose back !
 I 'm very happy with the purchase of this product . This is a very responsible company ! Although I 've tried the salicylic acid once , I can see the results and the difference now !!! Thank you very much !
 i just put 5 star for now hoping for some reply ? dont have that bad acne but i realy want to get rid of some scars left om my face , for now im using pro active 3 step and seems working alittle but the scars stays and make my face real dry . is it ok for me to use tis pruduct at the same time with pro active ?
 I 'm 34 years old and I have really sensitive , semi-dry skin . I have some hyperpigmentation from sun damage and monthly blemishes . I have maybe had 2 facials in my life so my skin was not used to such a high concentration of salicylic acid , or any other kind of acid for that matter . I have used the product about 4 times now . The first time I used it I literally felt like the skin was burning off my face . After the fourth use it 's at the point where it still burns but it 's not unbearable and I can last the whole 10 minutes.Although the peel is painful it has definitely been worth it . I was afraid I would have a lot of dry skin on my face which would show through my makeup since I have semi-dry skin already but it honestly was n't that bad . There were probably 3 small dry patches but you could n't see them through my makeup and after the second day I used a dry washcloth and wiped the dry skin off . My skin is very smooth now and the hyperpigmentation is almost gone . Before I would never go out in public without makeup on because I felt like people could see my age in the condition of my skin but now I have no problem going out with a clean face . I have used a number of products of all price ranges in the past to minimize the hyperpigmentation and nothing ever worked . This is the first product I have ever used with success.If you ca n't stand the pain and can only tolerate a minute or two the first couple times you use this product you will still see outstanding results . Also , it says to use lotion after using the peel but I have been putting on toner and that has really been a more effective way of moisturizing my skin immediately after using the peel.I gave this product 4 starts out of 5 due to the pain . As far as effectiveness is concerned it deserves 5 stars but the stinging is really unpleasant .
 Background
 This is one of the best products I have ever purchased . I am over 40 and have been out in the sun a lot through the years . I 've been trying different products to try to counter the effects of aging . I have spent a lot of money and , ironically , this product -LRB- which is by far the least expensive -RRB- has done the most to improve my skin 's appearance.I was hesistant to purchase this but it got such good reviews that I decided to give it a try . I know that some of the reviewers let it burn their face and then let it heal which almost made me not purchase the item . First , I have sensitive skin so I was worried about what it would do to me . Also , I work every day and can not be in hiding for a few days while my face heals . However , when I got the bottle and read the instructions , they specifically say to not leave it on until your face burns . It recommends starting out with leaving it on for one minute and then only doing it once per week , increasing your time up to eight minutes . I did that and increased by one minute per week . I did learn to only wash my face by hand before I apply the peel ; when I use a Clarisonic first , it makes my face too sensitive and I start to burn.When I first started using this , my acne -LRB- which did n't even develop until I turned 35 -RRB- got worse but now I have not had a blemish in months . The real improvements this peel provides do n't show immediately but come after using the product consistently for a few weeks . I have had many people ask what I am doing and I tell everyone about this . It has really improved my skin . I am now ready to increase to the 30 % solution.I really do recommend reading and adhering to the instructions that come with the bottle . I think that is the safest and most effective way to use this product .
 And this is it !! The end of the quest to rid myself of acne !! For years , I suffered from adult onset acne . Huge , cystic pimples that I would try to pop and nothing would come out . I had scarred my face and still the pimples kept coming . Then I got a Mirena IUD , and that makes your acne WORSE !!! I tried antibacterial soap , more moisturizer , less moisturizer , sulphur soap , no soap , every facewash on the shelf . I was starting to get so depressed and embarrassed of my acne . I was going through concealer at a rapid rate . On top of the acne , my skin was red around my nose and my mouth . I had horribly uneven skin tone to boot !! I finally bit the bullet and tried this . The first 2 applications , I did n't see much of a result , but by the third , WOW WOW WOW . People at work started to notice , my sister saw a picture and was amazed . I ca n't stop looking at my face!I only use this once a week and I also started using Jojoba oil as a moisturizer , which you would think is a bad idea for acne prone skin , but it 's another miracle worker.I know you 're probably nervous you 'll damage your face . It 's easy and you just start off slow . I 'll even use this as a spot treatment . I had a pimple on my neck the other day and I just dabbed a bit on and in an hour , the pimple was gone !!
 I have been looking for some kind of miracle to clear up old acne scars on my back and to even out skin tone , reduce pores on my tzone , and clear up a few acne marks on my face and I have FINALLY found it !!!!!!! I bought this stuff with a little bit of trepidation , but after reading many reviews and deciding to give it a go as my last resort before heading to the dermatologist I could n't be any happier ! I decided not to buy the toner or witch hazel , seemed like a waste of money when it clearly states that you can just use water to neutralize the peel and rubbing alcohol to clean the area prior to the peel . I did however splurge and buy 100 % natural Argan oil as a recommendation from another reviewer , and since Argan oil has so many more added benefits for your skin I decided why not take something good and make it better ? and yet again it was a good choice!this is the argan oil I purchased , http://www.amazon.com/Slice-Nature%C2%A9-Virgin-Argan-pressed/dp/B001PEZAHI/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1335537002&sr;=1-1The other reviewer had given a link to a different brand which was quite a bit more pricier and I so I looked around for something a little easier on the pocketbook and still natural oil with high reviews.I did the peel for the first time last night . I started by wiping down the area with rubbing alcohol , then I used an old clean concealer brush -LRB- you can also go to your local craft store and buy a cheap art brush in a size 10 or so or a fan brush . -RRB- Then I added the peel to the areas I wanted to correct -LRB- Note I did not put it on my entire face -RRB- I added it to my T-zone , chin , nose , part of my forehead and part of my cheeks . I then also added the peel to sections on my back that had acne scars and healing acne spots . It was much more tolerable on my back and not too uncomfortable , I left that on for about 6-8 minutes . My face was much more sensitive and I started with a slight itchy tingly feel and progressed to a moderate burn . I tolerated that for about 3-5 minutes . I then used cool water and nothing else and scrubbed my face using only my hands and within 30 seconds I found relief from the burn.After the peel I added the argan oil all over my face and back and rubbed it in real well . My skin felt extremely soft and relaxed after this . This morning the redness from recent acne is almost gone , the acne scars has been slightly minimized , my pores have shrunk drastically , I have no more bumps or uneven skin , the skin tone has evened out , and my skin is baby soft . I feel beautiful :--RRB- -RRB- -RRB- I went to work this morning with minimal make-up and it feels absolutely wonderful , I touch my face in amazement . I feel like a peeled off several years of skin!HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT !!!!!! -LRB- with the use of argan oil -RRB- -LRB- I also added a picture from this morning , the day after of the peel . I did not take a before picture and I regret doing so now , but understand when I took pictures of my face I would ALWAYS photo edit out the blemishes and soften the focus to even my skin tone so I would n't look like a walking dead person before anyone would ever view the picture . I 'm the girl with the long brown hair and bangs -RRB- * UPDATE * I DID go to the dermatologist to help prevent new acne , which I learned I have cystic acne , plus OCD on picking at it . I started taking Minocylcine and that has improved my skin dramatically , along with still using this product as well as tea tree oil I had my acne down to just minimal dark spots . The bumps and larger nastier looking stuff was about gone . I was hoping to soon see a decrease in dark spots , however I became pregnant and had to discontinue my entire regime . Months later the horror of bad back acne started to resurface and began creating new scars , so I do n't know what the progress could have potentially been . Once the baby is born and I can continue back on the medication and gel I will restart and see what happens from there .
 This stuff works fast . I wish I had tried this a long time ago . I am African American and I have been struggling with a hypertrophic on my face for a couple years . After doing massive research , I decide to use a derma-roller , super cop 2x , and salicylic acid peels on the scar . I started out with a 5 % salicylic acid cream , then I moved up to this 20 % peel . Every few day , a layer would peel off , and the scar is almost totally flat now . Using the copper along with it -LRB- peel in the morning , copper 2x at night -RRB- , the scar has become much more like the normal surrounding skin . I decided to leave this review for anyone out there who is struggling with a hypertrophic scar and does n't know what to do . I searched for the last two years and nobody had a real answer for what African Americans can do for this type of scar beside laser treatment , which is very expensive . 2-3 months of derma roller plus copper at night , and a gentle peel every other morning , can literally remodel the scar and allow you to rebuild more normal , healthy skin in place of it . Copper is crucial because it helps prevent the skin from re-forming the type of abnormal scar tissue that is typical in hypertrophic scars .
 I decided to try this salicylic acid gel peel because although I mostly have scarring from old pimples all over my forehead , I also have occasional breakouts of two or three in random places on my face . This stuff seems to be working , and I 've only been using it for a little under 2 weeks . My old scars are lighter , and the pimples that occasionally pop up dry out pretty quickly . Also , my skin does n't feel super tight or dry after I use it as long as I apply a moisturizer . With Murad , no matter how much moisturizer I used , I still felt `` creaky . '' My only complaints are the peeling skin and the sting factor when applied -LRB- although based on other reviews , these were expected -RRB- . Also , please note that as other reviewers have said , you will SEEM to break out more when using this for the first few times . But it is simply `` under-the-skin '' pimples coming to the surface . For over three months I have had a small patch of bumps on the left side of my face that were definitely pimples but never came to a head . After using this peel 3 times -LRB- once every other day -RRB- , I suddenly have white heads on that side ! Sounds gross , but NOW they 'll dry up , pop , and go away , rather than sitting under my skin like glorified goosebumps . :D I could n't be happier.Tips for this product :1 . Test out how often to use this for yourself -LRB- I use it every other day unless my skin gets too peely -RRB- 2 . Moisturize ! Moisturize ! Moisturize ! It would be good to get a face moisturizer with aloe , because it may irritate your skin at first .3 . Have patience . It may look bad at first , but keep going !
 I have never been so pleased with a product in my life . I feel like I 've finally found the secret to amazing skin -LRB- sorry for sounding like an infomercial -RRB- . I am 25 years old and in the past year or so after never really having severe acne all my life , I developed severe cystic adult acne . No matter what I did it would not go away . I ca n't tell you how many thousands of dollars I 've spent on beauty products at your usual beauty store claiming to get rid of adult acne . Tried various medications , everything . THIS STUFF IS ONLY $ 18 and it 's been AMAZING . To get my skin used to it initially -LRB- be warned , I do n't really know the correct usage of this stuff but this is how I did it -RRB- , I applied it every three days starting at a minute and increasing by one minute every three days it was applied , working my way up to eight minutes . I noticed very minimal peeling , but my skin improved drastically , even not being at the eight minute mark . Two days ago , I finally made it up to eight minutes , and my skin is peeling significantly today ! Not enough where someone could really notice , unless they stood directly in front of me . I am excited because I see amazing new skin emerging underneath , and at this point since I only have acne scars left , I am hoping to see them fade over time . I will continue to do eight minute peels once a week and see what happens . As far as the burning goes , it was n't as bad as I had expected based on the other reviews I 'd read here . It feels more hot than anything else . I actually find putting my face in front of a fan more irritating than without . But maybe I 'm just the exception . I will warn you though . . if you get cold sores , do not apply this stuff on the areas you 've gotten cold sores . . you WILL get new ones if you do . I learned the hard way . But I 've since avoided the area and I seem to be doing fine so far!I 've never reviewed anything on Amazon before , but this stuff was just too good not to say something about it . BUY THIS ! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED !
 This is a great peel . It has never burned my skin & I use it as a spot treatment . I dot it on my blemishes & leave it on for 3-7 minutes & then I apply my skin lotion on top of my entire face . It has really made an improvement in my skin . I can honestly say that it clears blemishes fast ! I have tried many , many products to clear my skin & nothing has worked as well as this ! You wo n't be disappointed .
 I am African American with very oil skin and hyperpigmentation left from using Proactive serveral years ago . My scars are primarily on my cheeks & a few on my forehead . After meeting with an esthetician who suggested I spend $ 980 on Obagi & an additional $ 500 on chemical peels , I thought I 'd try this peel first . I also purchased the Glycolic peel which I 've only used a few times and Kiss My Face Pore Shrink which I 've tried and love . I no longer have reoccuring breakouts on my cheeks & forehead . My skin tone has improved significantly . Previously I had raised bumps -LRB- that hurt when inflamed -RRB- on both my cheeks . These bumps would go from inflamed to non-inflamed , but pretty much never healed or went away ; they are gone . I apply a baking soda/water mixture to my face to deactivate the acid . I cleanse with African Black Soap & add a few drops of Jojoba Oil to my face while cleansing w/the black soap . Jojoba oil is a great moisturizer that actually penatrates my skin . After researching I learned my skin is oily b/c it is over compensating for dryness . The Jojoba Oil has balanced my nautral sebum -LRB- oil -RRB- production . In adddition to topical changes , I 've completed a 5 day liquid only cleanse , twice in the last year . I 've implemented Zinc Supplements & Flaxseed -LRB- fresh ground or oil I go back & forth -RRB- which is really good for your skin as well . These things have worked wonders for me . I am pleased with the product .
 This product is absolutely amazing ! I have mild-moderate acne . I always tend to break out in phases . And I hate those dark spots/scars that appear after my acne has disappeared ! Usually it takes many weeks/months for those marks to fade !! I have tried numerous products that are supposed to fade those marks -LRB- such as Acne Free fade gel , Neutrogena , even prescription cream -RRB- , but none have worked as well as this Salicylic acid gel peel !!! I received this item about a week ago , and my marks are almost completely gone . Some of the reviews state it takes a while , and I think it totally depends on the severity of acne and scars . I do not think this will get rid of major scars that cause indentations on the skin , but it definitely works to fade those dark marks . I leave it one for about 5-10 minutes morning and night , and follow up with a thick moisturizer/night cream -- since it makes me dry out a bit . I am almost at the point where I do n't need concealer anymore ! Definitely worth the buy !
 I am a 21 year old female -LRB- using my boyfriends 's Amazon account , of course -RRB- with stress-induced acne and plugged pores on the nose and chin , as well as unevenness under nostrils and acne scarring on either side of my chin . I just got done using this peel , following top commenter Elane 's steps 1 - 8 . I very highly recommend using her steps for the use of this product , as it will greatly help with the pain.Before anything , I washed my face with a bar of witch hazel soap in the shower , then I poured a pot of boiling water into my bathroom sink and steamed my face for five minutes . I then applied a lavender witch hazel toner generously and waited for that to dry . Once the toner had absorbed , I took a cotton ball and quickly applied the salicylic acid -LRB- do n't get too close to the sensitive areas underneath your eyes ! -RRB- and was able to leave it on for the maximum time of 8 minutes by sticking my head in the freezer ... I wish I were kidding . This stuff is intense . Do be sure to rinse with cold water for a minute and then use a baking soda/water paste to VERY GENTLY wash your face.If it were n't for the freezer and baking soda cheats , I 'm not sure how I would have gotten through this treatment . Had I not resorted to sticking my head in the freezer , I would have only lasted about a minute . As I 'm typing this comment , I have on a raw honey/coconut oil mask -LRB- 1/2 teaspoon of each -RRB- which I plan to leave on for 30 minutes . After rinsing off , I plan to apply a mix of my usual moisturizers which include lavender oil , argan oil , and olive oil -LRB- one drop of each -RRB- . I will continue using this treatment , and highly recommend it so far .
 I 've been using this for about 6 months and find it to be ok on melasma and sun spots , but surprisingly good on my rosacea . I was diagnosed with rosacea 8 years ago and used Finacea for several years . I developed melasma about 5 years ago and tried TriLuma cream for a year or so , but it never did much for me . I stopped going to the dermatologist a few years ago and have been trying to treat my skin problems on my own . I bought this product hoping that it would help fade my sun spots and melasma , which is mainly on my forehead and under my eyes . I used to have rosacea outbreaks at least a few times a week , which consisted mainly of redness and flushing . I had persistent redness and splotchiness on my cheeks and one red spot from rosacea on my nose that the dermatologist told me was permanent.The first few times I used this peel I was only able to tolerate it for a minute total . I 'd start on my forehead and do my cheeks last . It burned so badly that my eyes teared up , and after I washed my face , my skin was left very flushed . But by the next day my skin was back to normal . I used this once a week for a few weeks and noticed that my rosacea outbreaks stopped completely . Even using Finacea twice a day I 'd have flare ups occasionally , was very surprised that it stopped entirely with this peel.I used this peel once a week for about six weeks , then cut back and only applied it every few weeks . I started getting rosacea flare ups a month ago and realized that I had n't used this peel for several weeks , so I started up again and the flare ups stopped . I put it on my forehead first , then wait 2-3 minutes to apply to the rest of my face . I can tolerate it for 2-3 minutes now on my cheeks , and have no redness afterward . It has faded the darkness on my forehead and the splotchiness on my cheeks , but very slowly . I did n't notice any fading at all until very recently . I look in the mirror now and often do n't see any of my horrible rosacea splotchiness at all . Maybe a more aggressive dermatologist would have done some sort of treatments to fade my redness , but my doctor was very nonchalant about my skin , told me that I was basically stuck with the redness . I used a green tinted powder to tone down the redness , but thought that I was going to have to live with it the rest of my life . This peel has done more for my rosacea than Finacea , TriLuma cream and all those trips to the dermatologist . My bottle is almost empty and I will definitely buy more.My skin is very sensitive to sunscreen , and it 's important to apply sunscreen after using this peel . Neutragena and Aveeno can burn my skin , so I normally use Vanicream sunscreen after this peel . It can be heavy otherwise , but my skin is dry after the peel and the Vanicream works well for me .
 I am a 44 year old mom and grandmother who still had to deal with acne ... It WAS terrible . I have tried various regimens that worked to some degree but never always or consistently until now . I love using the Salicylic Acid Gel Peel . I use it once a week followed the next day by either aGlycolic Acid 50 % Gel Peel , 100mlorLactic Acid 50 % Gel Peel , 30ml -LRB- Professional -RRB- . After doing this for three weeks I began to notice that I was not breaking out anymore , AT ALL ! I have continued to use this regimen with magnificent results with no acne , much fewer and smaller blackheads , and my skin tone is so smooth and even . I have given up on foundation all together because I love the way my skin looks . I usePhysicians Formula Tinted Moisturizer SPF-15 , Fair to Light 1122 1 fl oz -LRB- 30 ml -RRB- and a translucent face powder and I get compliments on my skin which use to never happen .
 Anyone who has acne should give this a shot . It sounds kinda scary but is n't . My skin was a complete wreck because I tried out the Oil Cleansing Method . I wo n't go into details because you can find out more about it on other sites . I expected some purging but it seemed to bring out 30 years worth of gunk onto my face . Every single pore was clogged and I had huge pimples and marks galore . I even persisted with the cleansing hoping it would clear up but no such luck . I was just one of the unlucky few who could n't get it to work.So in desperation I bought the salicylic acid . I followed the instructions closely , 1 minute for the first time and gradually increasing until 8 minutes every application . I used it every five days . It stings every single time ! It feels as if there are a 100 ants biting the face . I also used a fan to blow my face because other reviewers suggested it and it does seem to help . After the time is up , I wash my face with water and use some baking soda.After 12 applications , while I still have some scattered spots , the improvement is amazing , considering how bad my skin was . Most of the clogging is gone , I do n't feel the little bumps under my skin any more and my skin is much smoother . A lot of the marks have faded as well . So I have hope that my skin will continue improving.The side effects were manageable . I 've used Renova in the past and this acid does n't give me the same sensitive feeling I have on the skin . When I apply other things on my face such as sunblock , my skin does n't sting compared to using the retinoid . There 's usually some mild scabbing and peeling on the third day of using the acid , but the skin comes off cleanly . When using Renova or other retinoids , my skin would have dry , flaking patches which were more unsightly . At the beginning , it was a bit alarming because I had dark brown patches but after the `` burnt '' bits came off , the skin underneath was smooth.Aftercare is also important , every day I put sunblock and after using the acid I put some oil , usually argan or tamanu.I 'm glad I tried this out .
 Bought this peel to see if it would remove or reduce sun spots on my facial cheeks . I have been using the OTC spot remover with some success but it takes continuous use of 30 or more days . I 've only used this item once so the jury is still out . However , at the first try , I felt a burning sensation right after application . I 'd suggest following the guidelines as suggested in the directions
 I have so many great things to say about this product ! I will just give you a few things that I 've learned though . Do not leave this on for very long the first few times you use it , it will burn your skin.Build up to the 8 minute max . Be careful around this skin near your eyes . Use a good moisturizer afterwards.I know that sounds crazy , especially when you 've been use to keeping your skin free of anything like that . I use neutrogena wrinkle repair , it is not greasy and leaves just the right amount of moisturizer without leaving my oily skin feeling greasy . My skin has a whole new look and feel after decades of severe acne . I use it often times when noticing a new pimple or cyst forming , applying a dab with a q-tip .
 This is the first time I bought a salicylc acid and I was n't sure what the effect is going to be look like when I put them.It was really hurt when I put them , in the next day my skin was start feeling a little bit also I had a dry skin so I put some olive oil or vitamin E oil on it . but after 3days I can see that some of my acne scar feed out ^ ^ I will continue this product
 The Salicyclic Acid 20 % Gel Peel , is great for somewhat sensitive skin . With subsequent use any skin problems you may have -LSB- acne , pigmentation , roughness -RSB- totally disappears .
 I would have given this product 5 stars for the formula but I only gave it 4 because this really should be a medical grade product to be applied by a professional . For those with sensitive skin , it will make you feel like your skin is on fire !! Even when you wash it off , the stinging lingers . Be cautions and extremely careful if you choose to use this product .
 The first time I tried this it burned like hell , and I think I have a good tolerance to pain . It definitely takes a few times to build up a tolerance to this product . The first time I tried it I put it all over my face , and the sides of my nose were raw and peeling really bad by the next day . The next time I just did it on the spots where the acne scars were and that seemed to work a lot better for me . After a couple of days I was looking in the mirror and one of the scars literally disappeared in front of me . I saw a dry piece of skin ready to fall off and it peeled right off along with the scar . That was enough for me to keep using this product . It does dry your face out , but that 's the whole point . I have gone through a ton of moisturizer while using this product but it 's totally worth it . Probably not for everyone , but it worked for me and I 'm very happy . I also purchased the skin PH balancer which feels awesome after rinsing off the peel . I 'm Hispanic and have medium to dark skin so I tend to get really dark scars , especially around my mouth , chin , and jaw line . This really minimized that . Sunscreen also does wonders . You have to used it everyday , especially when you 're using a chemical peel . Good luck to all using this product . : -RRB-
 I have really bad sun damage on my chest which was made worse by my dermatologist freezing off rough spots . Where my dermatologist had done her work the skin is completely white and makes my dark spots look worse . Basically my chest looked like I had been in an awful fire . A plastic surgeon gave me laser treatments which worked but each treatment cost $ 300 and would lighten an area about the size of the dime . At that rate I would be spending $ 30,000 on my chest ! I have been using the Salicylic Acid for about 6 weeks now . I clean my chest with alcohol first and then dab it all over my chest . I leave it on for about 10 minutes and then rinse it off with cold water . My chest is still not perfect by it certainly has made a huge difference . The dark spots are definitely lighter and the contrast between the light and dark areas in considerably less noticeable . I plan on ordering more and continuing the therapy . I have high hopes that this product will continue working and that I will be able to wear something other than turtlenecks all winter !
 First , let me say , that I have acne -LRB- pink/red -RRB- marks on my skin from pimples . After using this product , I notice them getting ligher ! which is great . My face -LRB- except for maybe my cheeck-bones -RRB- feels ok with this product on , especially my forehead and neck . It 's a little sensitive on my cheecks and definitely near my eyes.My question is , for the first time yesterday , I applied this under my eyes with a Q-tip on my fine lines and had to remove it immediately -LRB- about or less than a minute -RRB- . My skin under my eyes were slightly pink and my fine lines now look like wrinkles !! My questions are : Will this go away ? my fine lines are prominentand when I use this prduct , should I continue using it under my eyes or no?I get that this product is good for acne scars and pimple prevention , but I was also hoping it was good for fine line removal.Thank You .
 Had a few small round brown spots on my face . One of those things that happens when you get old . I put a small spot of this stuff on each one and it burns . Washed this off after about ten minutes . Tried this three times so far , it looks like it will take a week or two but will work .
 For the first few times it burns alot . But you 'll get use to it.I would not recommend using this on like the day before going out . Because there is alot of skin that comes out . Try use it like 2 days before going out so there isnt as much flaky skin .
 This stuff is potent and works well . I have sensitive acne prone skin and after having a baby , my face exploded in volcanoes . It was so bad that I did not want to go outside . I have used this peel twice now within a week and my face is starting to heal because all of the junk is getting exfoliated off . I use this in conjuntion with other homeopathic products because I tried everything under the sun and nothing has worked . I also take zinc and pantothenic acid pills 2x a day . Because of the peeling , I also use hyaluronic acid with my moisturizer and sunblock . Seems to be working like a charm . Sounds like a lot of stuff , but its still cheaper than paying to see a dermatologist who writes out expensive prescriptions that do not work . Everyone reacts to treatment for their acne differently so I hope this will help some people ! Having volcanoes all over your face is traumatizing so I can empathize with people looking for something that actually works .
 This product is very helpful in both acne and acne scars . Yes , it stings but that should be expected . It is the only thing I 've tried that has helped me clear up so much . I have acne scars from years and years ago , and it 's really helped them fade away . My skin will never be perfect but it is now 100x better than it used to be , all thanks to this product !
 I tried this salicylic acid peel for the first time , and noticed almost immediate results . Although I experienced a bit of irritation for about 1hr afterwards , the next morning my skin looked better than ever and my pores were visibly smaller .
 My skin is clear and acne free . I 'm 30 yr old female who has struggled with mild acne since middle school . I 've tried everything from Retin A , proactiv and every over the counter product at CVS . I started using this product a few weeks ago and can already tell a difference . I use it every other day and leave it on for a few minutes at a time . I have n't experienced any excessive dryness or redness . No more expensive facials or dermatologist appointments for me ! I 'm going to keep buying this stuff !!
 I started using this a month ago . My spots were really looking good and fading away . I think this is better for spot treatment rather than the whole face . But I got a really bad breakout due to stress -LRB- 2nd worst I have ever had , if you click on my profile you can see my pics of it -RRB- and just recently had to buy stronger stuff -LRB- TCA peel -RRB- . I know that I am not an ordinary case though because my skin is really tolerant to peels . So I will be using this in conjuction with the peel until my skin returns to normal . -LRB- I never had breakouts when I was a teen , just started in my 30s -RRB- . But armed with both of these products , a good skin regimen , and eating healthy , I am confident more than I was a year ago that I wo n't have to hide under a inch of makeup pretty soon .
 I really love this product . The company also sent a free sample of another acid peel . The sample had enough for several applications . I sure appreciated that because I was curious about it . But this one has been great . My dark spots got lighter . It cleared my acne and I have n't had much of a need for a while . I got it under control . My cheeks are a little sensitive so I put it on them a last and a few minutes after the rest of my face .
 First , the bottle will last you much longer than you think , so the price is worth it . Also , I am very happy with it controlling my acne . I still get bad acne the couple of days before my period no medications has ever regulated that , but this helps a lot .
 11/03/2011 As of today I have around a week and a half using the product and besides been excited from the prior reviews I am in love with it and the reaction of my face . I 've been using it every other day or leaving 2 days apart and it works ! My scars from years from the acne are lighter and I see my pores in a better shape and in general my face has been behaving like never . I will keep posting as I advance on it .
 It is uncomfortable , but it has worked for me.A few times my eyes have watered from the burning -LRB- obvioulsy I do n't apply to my eyes -RRB- , but it is worth it.The worst part is that I want to itch my face when it is applied . I put it on then try to distract myself by sitting at the computer a few minutes while watching my stopwatch . It helps , but it is still uncomfortable.It also has worked on hyperpigmentation -LRB- red residual mark left by acne -RRB- . Usually those last about a year for me , now they are all gone in about a month or two.I 've stopped using minocycline -LRB- anti-boitic -- part of the tetracycline family and is the most powerful anti-biotic they have -RRB- and only used Prascion -LRB- a sulfur based topically applied wash -RRB- a few times . and my face is clear for the most part . My dermotologist said the next step up is Accutane from that.Right now I 'm using this peel once a week , with spot treatments with a Q-tip . This is also good in spot treatment , I should add.I 'd recomend buying the small bottle to see if it works for you , then moving up to the larger bottle afterward . It took me only one application to see results , but about a month to see good results like the others around here.I started light , then added time and more liquid to each session . I 'd recomend doing the same .
 Just as effective as dermabrasion surgery - but less painful in your pocket - in smoothing out lines and wrinkles and in even-toning your skin . I use it every other day until peeling takes place . Then , I slough off the dead skin to reveal a fresh layer of unblemished and fresh looking baby skin . Followed the process with a high SPF to protect the new me . No regrets !
 Wow , this stuff is great . I had no idea a treatment so simple could be so effective -LRB- for periodic cystic acne on cheeks -RRB- . Skin less oily too . Once a week , and skin is so much better . -LRB- I would n't use more than once a week though -RRB- . Wish I had heard about this years ago .
 I had very oily skin , especially my nose . Before using Salicylic Acid -LRB- SA -RRB- , I was using Neutrogena 's acne gel to reduce acne and make my skin dryer . I 've also tried other brands of acne gel with benzoyl peroxide , but they did n't really work . In addition to acne gel , I 've tried facial cleaning product from Clean and Clear and the Walmart brand benzoyl peroxide cleaning pads.I 've gone to a dermatologist and she told me to clean my face daily and just use the general acne treatment products and I would be fine . Unfortunately , I was n't very good at keeping up with these routines and I even thought about getting an operation to reduce the size of my pores . That did n't happen due to the expanse.Finally , I came across Amazon and found this product and read the reviews . At first I tried to follow the instruction to apply the acid on cosmetic pad and then my skin , wait for a few minutes and wash it off . However , it worked better for me when I just applied it directly on my skin.For the first minute or 2 , after direct application on my nose , I felt a slightly burning sensation and my skin turned a little red . However , after 5 minutes or more the acid is neutralized and I could see immediate improvement on my skin , smoother and the redness was gone . I did n't even have to wash it off.In addition to this product , I washed my face with warm water to open up my pores and then I used Neutrogena 's pore refining toner to reduce the size of my pores and to clear old skin . I applied the gel peel on top of the dried skin toner.Instead of using acne gel , I used Neutrogena 's Rapid Clear Oil-Eliminating Foaming Cleanser to keep my skin dryer . Depending on the condition of my skin , sometimes I would only use the skin toner and not the peeling gel . However , when I saw mild inflammation from acne , I would use both . The oil cleanser should not be used twice , it would really dry up my skin and irritated it.In conclusion , I 've listened to many stories and tried many different products to make my nose not look like Rudolf the Reindeer . For my skin , the key was to reduce the oily condition and the size of my pores . It was the combination of skin oil and dust that clogged up my pores and caused acne . With the help from Neutrogena 's pore refining skin toner , oil-eliminating cleanser , and Skin Laboratory 's gel peel , my skin looked a lot smoother and had a healthy glowing feel .
 Okay so I 've only used this product for two days and I will come back in a month when I feel I can update -LRB- with pictures -RRB- . I have had acne since I was about 8 . It died down a lot now that I 'm in my 20 's but my main problem is every pore on my face is big and clogged . Not only that I have what I call `` chicken skin '' on my chest and inbetween the girls , it is flesh colored raised bumps which I 'm guessing is also clogged pores as well . I waited 48 hours to do my face because I did just get a waxing done but I tried it out on my chest . There were no visible improvements the same day -LRB- obviously -RRB- but the next I noticed the bumps had gone down just a bit in size . Also i had small stinging in certain spots nothing that I really noticed because that skin is way different from my face so I could leave it on the full 8 minutes . In the instructions it says that chemical peels will give you cold sores if you are prone to them , I thought well it 's not on my face so I did n't have to worry , wrong . I woke up the next day and had one in the corner of my mouth -LRB- ouch -RRB- . So BE AWARE that you will get one if you are prone to them or carry the virus -LRB- not the std kind -RRB- . Second day I did my face , I lasted about 5 minutes and it started burning but not too bad so I rinsed , WORST PART . I felt like the water activated it and my whole face burned so bad , but as I have read other reviews it does go away in about a minute so keep splashing water on your face till it does.So far so good . Will update again in 30 days .
 My problem - 30 year old female with tan skin - started breaking out in pimples for first time since I was 14 - dark patches of skin near mouth and cheek due to mineral deficiency and hormonal imbalance - no other creams , masks , etc. . . were helping with either of these thingsWhat happened with the product - left it on until I could n't stand stinging - next day after a 2 hour drive home , looked in mirror and my face looked normal but the dark patches mentioned above were all peeling totally off . - peeled off skin with my fingers , washed my face , and scrubbed more dead skin off . - dark patches are now much lighter , pimples still there but smallerConclusion - worked for me although I have no idea why or how
 Well I deiced to try this peel , and it was absolutely amazing . I applied it to my face for probity 12 minutes -LRB- do n't do that -RRB- and my skin was so soft and my healing acne scars were turning white . Two days later my acne scars were literally peeling off . It did wonders for my acne scars and stunned acne growth for a short time . I moisturized my skin with virgin olive oil and I think that added to the healing and peeling . If you suffer form acne like me let me recommend Green Tea . Overdoes on Green Tea and you will not have anymore acne . Ever since I started drinking green tea no new pimples developed -LRB- Its been a week I only have old deep ones left -RRB- . I stopped drinking the tea for one day and I broke out with three new pimples . Use this every week , use olive oil , and drink green tea and you wo n't have acne if you suffer from oily skin .
 I 'm 24 years old and I have what most people would consider mild to moderate acne . My face really went crazy when I started college . Ever since then , I have n't been able to completely control my acne . I 'm pretty sure I 've tried everything except accutane . It will get better off and on , but it never sticks . Even when my skin is pretty clear -LRB- for me -RRB- I still have a lot of redness/discoloration/acne marks . My skin is weird because it gets really dry , especially during the winter months . It 's odd because my skin is dry and it breaks out.I 've become pretty good at covering my pimples , but Acne products definitely dry my skin out and make it really difficult to use makeup . In the morning it will look nice , but then after lunch the makeup looks dry and disgusting . I just checked my makeup and it looks terrible on my pimples . I 's embarrassing . I want to be able to use makeup to enhance features , not cover them.Anyways , that 's my story . I tried the peel out last night . It burned so bad . I did my best to leave it on for 1 minute . I moisturized afterwards and did n't put on any makeup . When I woke up this morning , one of my pimples had a huge whitehead on it but some of the others were minimized . The skin around my pimples seemed to look a little bit better . As I just said , my skin is dry , but I expected that from this product . My acne is not severe so I will probably wait and try the product again over the weekend.If you have acne , I know exactly how you feel . It 's terrible . I got married last summer and my dermatologist gave me a VERY strong antibiotic to ensure that my face would be clear for my wedding . It was pretty clear , but I could only take it for about a week . I want so very badly to feel comfortable leaving the house with no makeup . None of my friends have acne like I do . They have beautiful skin , like a 20-something should . My skin is also damaged from the sun , because I always felt like the sun temporary cleared it up . It did , but I know it 's bad in the long run.If anyone has any advice , I 'd love to hear it . I 'm going to stick with this for a while . I mean , why not ? What 's one more product ?
 I have had acne since I was 10 years old - I am now 21 and although some may argue it 's a teenager thing I feel like I have had it quite long enough . I am VERY pale and the acne has left scarring which is very traumatizing in itself . I 've tried just about everything for my skin - Skin ID -LRB- ps do n't buy that it 's OTC products you can buy at the store , just do the evaluation and it 'll tell you what to buy :P -RRB- Proactiv , Zeno , every face wash on the market , steaming my face , 10 % benzoyl , even prescription creams and antibiotics . Nothing worked , not even a little . I have pretty oily skin and my acne mostly consists of blackheads all around and small whiteheads around my cheeks/mouth/jaw and occasional large cyst like zits that never pop >:[ I decided to buy this peel in combination with the glyco/lac peel because so many people I know rave about how great the peels are . I did this one first , my skin is pretty tolerant to medications since I 've had acne for so long so my first application I left on for 4-5 minutes , bad choice . It did n't burn bad until I decided to rinse it off and I blasted the cold shower on my face and the combination of the cold shower and my face burning was so intense I could barely breathe . A few minutes later the burning subsided and my skin suddenly did n't feel oily anymore , but not in a bad way . I used neutrogena healthy skin moisturizer and my skin felt great ! I see no differences in acne yet but I also realize it needs to extract the acne before it can eliminate it . Even if it does n't cure my acne completely the oil elimination is so nice I would buy it again . Giving it 4 stars because I have only used it once - will update ! : -RSB- Update - 2 days later-Skin is slightly flaking , applying lotion often . Breaking out slightly but it is probably just the extraction . I also work out so maybe my sweating has something to do with the breakout although I did the peel post workout because it says not to sweat for a few hours after .2 weeks laterWow , this stuff really works ! I bumped it up to using it 6 days a week then a week of the glycolic/lactic and it 's amazing ! It does get a bit sensitive around my nose but other than that I 'd say 80 % of my acne is gone !
 I been using this product weekly and so far so good , I am seeing improvement . Iam using this product with ROC night time repair works great !!
 This product works ! Just be sure to follow the instructions to the letter for safety . I use it for no more than 8 minutes on a small area . The results are the same as paying for an expensive facial . Do n't expect results immediately after you apply it . Expect your skin to peel over the course of a few days .
 i 've bought tons of items on amazon and this is my first review . this gets results quickly ! I started using the item last week , every 3 days or so , and the acne on my skin is gone ! I still have some scars , but I 'm hoping this product will remove them in a couple of days/weeks . this gives you very fast results !
 Have tried everything including antibiotics , lazer treatments , acutane , peels . Finally this product controls my skin by using it initially only twice a week and now once every 2 weeks or when break out starting . I can use this treatment , wash my face , apply make up and go to work . No problems . If using around mouth , I apply thick coat of chapstick to avoid lips ... I use for 8 minutes . I am not sure why my derm did not suggest this after all the years of failed treatment !
 This is an amazing product and did wonders for my skin . I have been using it a little over a month and my skin looks amazing . It is the only product that has done this and I have tried a tone . Not only has it cleared my skin and minimized my huge pores it also cleared up hyper-pigmentation from acne . Its amazing and everyone who has ance should try it .
 I 've been suffering from acne and oily skin for more than 15 years . Like most of you , I 'm just desperate to get clear complexion , spending thousands of dollars over the years , trying different kind of treatments . As you know , these treatments / pills are either harmful to your body if prolong usage , or they are just too expensive to up keep.I am so thankful that I came across this wonderful product . I 've done my 6th peel today and I must say 90 % of my acne are gone , and my oily skin are under controlled ! The embeaded white heads have slowly sufaced and exfoliated too . My acne scars are improving and pores are smaller!This product is definately the best product i 've used . It 's affordable and very effective . Best part is , I do n't even need a expensive cleanser and moisturizer to have healthy skin now . What is the downside ? Probably the stinging and peeling . Other than that , it 's totally worth it !
 I have used three applications so far and i am amazed at the results . Immediately after the first treatment my face got brighter and my pores had gotten less noticeable . So i am excited to see the results after 6 weeks . I would recommend this product , for sure .
 This is the best anti-acne product that I ever buy , it works just in 1 week , the only thing you have to do is use a cream fro hydration .
 This really works ! It takes time to show and also takes time getting used to . I have acne marks that i was trying to get rid of and decided to give this product a try . Becareful cause it does sting uncomfortably but thats just something you have to endure if you want to see result . my skin quickly got used to this , because i would leave it on for up to 10 mins or more and it did n't burn my face . I 'm not sure if this is good or bad ? but the description did say that the solution neutralizes on your face after 8 mins , so that explains why i was able to have it on for so long . It did lighten the scars and in some cases when i had an active zit it would actually instantly dry it up which was great . I am taking a break from this product and will restart . Definitely give it a try !
 I moved to NY from Scotland during the summer months . My skin had a really hard time dealing with the humidity and the pollution - not something I 'd had to deal with before . I 've never had the best skin ; it 's always been oily and I suffer from blackheads and large-ish pores . Arriving in NY my skin became so oily it was disgusting and lots of tiny little spots started forming across my forehead . I now use this once or twice a week for just a few mins at a time and then follow with a benzoyl peroxide cream at night , which I use most nights and a light oil free moisturiser . All these three things combined have really helped the oil control , my skin is nowhere near as greasy , I 've less black heads and my pores are definitely smaller . Buy it !
 I have been using this for 3 weeks and it is working pretty good . I have sensitive skin but have not had any bad reactions to this product besides the normal peeling which is not very bad . I am satisfied with this product and it is a great value . You can use this product without going to a spa and spending $ 100 or more .
 my son 's acne is a real problem . Have tried a popular `` by mail '' acne treatment that includes several steps that did not help a bit . This stuff has , at least , improved his condition and lightened some of the redness left by the acne .
 Ok so I got the product mailed in today , tested it under my chin , inner forearm , and on this ugly white cyst pimple on my forehead . I waited about 3 minutes and washed it off with cold water , then used a wet cotton ball to wipe it off , then used a dry cotton ball , and to my amazement the WHOLE white nasty cyst came off with it !! , and there was n't any left inside the pimple . Im so glad I can use it on the white heads and just wipe it off so easily without having to pop it . I will start using it on other parts of my face in the next few days.Oh BTW I tried Proactive and prescription acne medications , and none of them worked . This is definatly worth a buy .
 After a recent breakout -LRB- of the kind I had not seen since my early teens -RRB- , I was left with little pimples and some dark blemishes . By blemishes , I mean dark awful scars that come from frustrated nights of picking and popping ! Anyway , I was looking for something and anything that would reduce these ` blemishes ' . This stuff works ! The secret is to use a Q-tip to dap on pimples and scars . Do not rub the solution in a circular motion , DAB it on with a tap , tap , tap motion . Rubbing causes a burn and it seemed to make the dark spots darker . Also , I kept the solution only until it started to feel like it was beginning to burn and then I washed it off , and used the neutralizer -LRB- VERY IMPORTANT STEP -RRB- , after I dried my face , I dabbed on a little Tree Tea Oil . Do n't use this product everyday , because it will make your condition worse . Your skin needs a few days between to heal . Miraculously , the pimples dried up almost overnight and the dark spots have begun to shrink , dry up and flake away . I definately reccommend this product ! I did n't give it 5 stars because they need to provide more instructions with how to use the product and if you are n't careful , you can really burn yourself .
 I 've suffered from pretty severe acne problems for about four or five years now , and my face has n't been free of a breakout since before my teens . I also have pretty oily skin , resulting in blackheads and large pores across my `` T zone '' area . I 've been to multiple dermatologists to try and solve my problems but with my insurance the most they 'll give me are antibiotics that only upset my stomach . I was weary of purchasing this , but I knew that salicylic acid was in a lot of drug store acne treatments and the company advertises this as a `` level 1 '' peel , meaning the least irritating . I figured this peel was a good place to start.When I first got it I was using the peel once a week for fear my skin was going to fall off . I was seeing some results in my acne , but nothing to really say it was a great product . I took a break from using it and when my acne was starting to get really bad again I decided to give it another round , but this time using it once every four days . Once I was doing it more often , I was seeing more improvement in my skin . Does that mean using it once a week wo n't give you great results ? No , probably not . I just saw them faster using it more often , and who does n't like that ? Their website states that you can use it as often as every 2-3 days . I 'd say how often you use it really depends on your skin.As for my results , again , they have been great . For literally a year and a half I had this stubborn pimple on my left cheek that just would not go away . After using this for a few weeks I noticed that the pimple had turned into a white head . Needless to say , the stuff that came out of it was disgusting , but it went away ! I also have gotten completely unsolicited comments from my friends and family -LRB- Some of whom I had n't told about the peel -RRB- saying how good my skin has been looking , so I know it is n't all just wishful thinking on my part ! Unfortunately , I dropped the bottle while doing one of my peels , so I ca n't say what consistent results past two months really looks like . I have seen the most improvements in my acne , but not so much with any large pores or scarring.My tips to anyone using this would be ... 1 . Do n't use it right after you get out of the shower . Your skin will be far more sensitive .2 . Purchase a neutralizer with this . A lot of water will do the job to get it off , but strong acids like this will be better neutralized by something specifically designed to do so . -LRB- This has a pH of 2.3 -RRB- 3 . Use a cotton or gauze pad to apply it . I tried using a fan brush as suggested and I found it was n't a very controlled application-not something you want when dealing with acid .4 . Buy an SPF moisturizer . My skin got extremely dry between applications . You 'll be very uncomfortable without some on hand . -LRB- I recommend the Neutrogena brand -RRB- I wo n't be repurchasing this simply because I 'm looking for something stronger for my acne . If you only have slight acne or the occasional breakout this strength should work beautifully . For my skin I 'm going to try the BHA + chemical peel next .
 I 've suffered from adult-onset acne off and on for the past 3 years - which mainly has been along my jawline . I 've tried multiple products , either online or in store with such positive reviews , but never worked for me . After 2 applications of the salicylic peel , I can completely see a difference - my face looks and feels smoother , I have no new acne and the acne scars are fading quite nicely . I read another review that stated to use a baking soda and water paste to neutralize , which works really well ! I would highly recommend this product !!!
 I was n't sure what to expect with this product , but since it was `` professional '' I thought I 'd give it a try ! I left the watery solution on for 1.5 minutes and there was a whitehead forming on my nose and holy shiz . I woke up the next morning and it was gone . Just a small red bump of what it was ! So far so good : -RRB- I also am a long time acne medication user . I have used Accutane whilst in high school and my acne -LRB- not as bad as it was -RRB- is still here and a bother . My skin is reacting very well to this medication . If you have some spare cash then definitely try this : -RRB-
 Ok I used it for the first time last night I cleansed my face I also used which hazel to get access oils off my faceI put the gel on my face it really did n't burn at all it was more of a tingling feeling it did crystalize some but not much in my opinionI left it on for 8 mins then I took off the gel with cold waternow while taking of the gel I did feel a little burn but it was not bad at sllI then put on some moisturizer this morning I also put on some SPF sunblock even though the sun was not shining I was not taking any chances LOLI am not going to put gel on every day I will put on every other day for 8 minswhat I also was thinking about is taking pics on a daily basis to see my progressI will continue to update for changes
 I have been suffering from acne from 8th grade and now I am a senior who suffers fromgreat stress from college and school work . About two months ago , I purchased Salicylic Acid 20 % Gel Peel -LRB- I wanted to start with least strong product -RRB- . I started to using this product by starting from 30sec , 2min , 4min , and 8 min . I had a pretty oily skin , thus i used once every two days . I could feel my face started to produce less oil my face got really dry -RRB- but i still was having 3-4 acne on my face and some scars and red marks.When i was half way through Salicylic Acid , I bought Glycolic 35 gel peel because website says that if used together it will give deeper peel . So what i did was apply Salicylic on my face for 8 minutes and then Glycolic for 8 min -LRB- for me salicylic gives me more pain not glycolic -RRB- . I did this for 5 times , once every 3-4 days depending on my skin condition.After i used all my salicylic acid , my right side of face was acne free but my left side was still having acne problems . Then i started to use glycolic every once every 3-5 days . I am almost half way through glycolic and on my face i have 2 acne forming , acne free on my right face and two acne on my left face.I believe when I use all of glycolic acid , my facial condition will be good . I also bought BHA + for future use like once every week to keep it up -RRB- I think you need patience to see the result . I do not believe there is no panacea for ance but time and your effort . Dont get discouraged by bad reviews on here , just keep using it regularly with daily facial wash i use clinique soap for oily skin -RRB- . Try to regulate the use of the product depending on your skin condition . Wash your face three times or two times a day , use sun screen , and oh i forgot to mention the day after the peel I use -LRB- Acne free 10 percent benzol peroxide lotionThanks for readingHope you will get improving skin condition in two to three months . . not one to two days !!!
 I ca n't recommend more ! I already told a friend to order one for her . You 'll notice the difference just after one use . Great product and very fast shipping !!
 this product is absolutley fab ! its been about three weeks now since ive started using this product and the results are remarkable .
 So , i just purchased this product and arrived yesterday . I NEVER had a chemical peel in my life , so i was really careful with the product . I did n't put the peel on my cheek , i wanted to try the acne prone area
 I love this peel ! I 'm a peel novice , so I 've never used one before . After a horrible breakout in September due to hormonal imbalances -- my entire face was covered , I decided to give this a try . Years of Accutane and prescription medication obviously did nothing , so what 's one more try ? For the first two weeks , I was n't really hopeful . It seemed to be working better as a spot treatment than an overall mask . I was n't peeling , and my acne was n't going anywhere . Also , it never `` burned '' my skin . It just made me itch a lot . Then I decided to up the time I had it on from 3 minutes to 5 , and it worked ! I finally peeled , and with that , my acne subsided . I currently only have 3-5 pimples on my face , all of which I 'm confident will disappear in the next week or so . I ca n't believe that this little bottle is all it took to help my acne . I wasted so much money going to the dermatologist over the last few years . This amazing !
 Arrived on my doorstep in a padded envelope embedded within another envelope . I 've been wanting to use a facial peel for so long to combat sun damage , MANY acne scars , current acne , and general dullness.After reading the instructions , I wiped down with alcohol and used a gauze pad to apply the peel all over my face for a minute . It stung a little but was totally bearable and not bad at all . After a minute , I rinsed with cold water and you could actually see little flakes of skin.Immediately I had glowing skin - it definitely faded some very light scarring on my cheeks . The larger and more defined scars , however are still visible and has n't changed much at all . Throughout the day you can see subtle patches of skin peeling off . So do n't expect a drastic change at once , but I 'm sure with continued and controlled use my scars will look much better.Definitely a buy . I plan on using this once a week . I 'm already super happy with this product . CHYEA !
 This was a great discovery for me . I have oily skin especially in the T-Zone and previous problems with uneven skin tone and enlarged pores.Since getting on a skincare regimen of Philosophy 's Purity made simple and the Microdelivery Exfoliating wash my skin looks better than ever.This Salicylic gel has been a wonderful addition to my routine.I use it every 6-7 days and leave it on approx . 10-20 minutes . Yes , it stings , but if it did n't ... it would not be working . Afterward , I enjoy smooth clearer skin and much less oil production . My pores are noticeably smaller and I now use less foundation because I no longer have problems hiding blemish marks.I 'm on my second bottle and could not be without this product .
 I have been using this product for 2 months now and my skin feels so soft and looks more radiant . I use it twice a week and the first bottle I used got me 15 uses -LRB- 2 months -RRB- I used to suffer from acne and used accutaine for 10 months and my skin was clear and felt great for about 5 months , but after that , I started breaking out again -LRB- to a smaller degree , but my skin was supposed to be clear for good -RRB- . I saw the overwhelmingly positive reviews for this product so decided to try it . After the first use , I noticed that my skin already looked more luminous and felt so soft.I leave it on my face for 5-6 minutes and do n't feel much of a burning sensation , but my skin has probably become resilient from the numerous other products I 've used over the years . For the first couple weeks , as other reviewers have said , the acid brings out impurities from under the surface and will result in some breakouts but BE PATIENT . If you keep using it , it will shorten the life of the pimple and the breakouts will soon stop.This product also evens out my skin tone which had suffered scars from past acne : -RRB-
 I bought this item a while ago . First , I have to tell you about my skin . I am a Caucasian , 20 year old female with very fair and acne prone skin . Furthermore , my acne is hormonal , and I get painful large red cysts . I have been prescribed hormonal birth control to deal with it , Retin - A , have used 10 % benzyol peroxide cream , and EVERY other product out there -LRB- Acne Free , among all the other big brands , some of which provided some temporary relief -RRB- . But basically , I have awful acne that does not go away even with my stringent cleaning and grooming methods.I am fairly used to strong products , but regardless my skin dries up and looks flaky , no matter what . I decided to give thsi product a try and did use it once or twice , but got impatient with it , so it sat in my drawer for like another month . I decided I spent money on it and I was at least going to finish it . The first treatment was 5 minutes and I did it about once a week and then steadily upgraded to multiple times a week.Yes , it burns like hell at first , but I think it 's not unbearable and I kept a fan close by to relieve the stinging.Now , I am using the product every night and leaving a thin layer on overnight . My skin does get flaky still because the product is designed to get rid of that dead surface skin , but HOLY COW . My acne is sooooo much better . My skin is so soft to the touch now , I use far less makeup , and just need to exfoliate in the mornings to get rid of the dead skin . My acne is not all gone , and I have been applying every night for 2 weeks now , but it is almost all gone!I do still have acne spots , but I will definitely look to this company for a gel peel that addresses those needs as well.I highly recommend this product and advise that you take it slow at first and DO NOT GIVE up on it , be consistent and safe . It is NOT going to work for everyone to apply this every night and leave it on , that 's not how it is designed , but it is as close to a miracle product as I have been able to find . My only regret is that I did n't find it sooner , that I accidentally knocked the bottle over and spilled like half of it out , and that I did n't take pictures to document my progress.I will repurchase this when I run out , but it does last a long time and does wonders.YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT !!!
 I have large pores on my cheeks , black heads , old pigmentation scars . After one use I noticed the scars fading . My acne is better and my pores are smaller . The scars literally started peeling the next day ! After the peeling subsided -LRB- 3 days -RRB- my skin looked brighter and felt smoother . I barely needed to wear makeup ! I peeled a few times in September and then took a break and my skin has been beautiful since and has not returned to its prepeel state even after I stopped the peels . It 's now nearing April and I am doing a few more touch up peels to target a few new blemishes . I definitely suggest filling the sink with cold water and baking soda to neutralize the acid . It substantially kills the pain when the peel is over and ensures that the product will stop after the time needed . Use deep moisturizer at night and do n't pick at it ! Let the peel do its job .
 I have used this product several times already and I really notice a difference in the texture of my skin . My breakouts are fewer and Scars are less noticeable . I would highly recommend this product .
 It has really helped to clear up my skin . I started to get `` adult acne '' and it seemed impossible to get off my face . I started to freak out that 's when I ordered and it has really , really helped . Not vain . . just not use to marks being on my face . This helped
 This product will do a great job However , I wish I would have ordered a greater solution like 35 % instead . I have only done one treatment and so far I have had fewer breakouts . The instructions say to wait 7 days before doing another treatment . Im going to do another treatment this week and hopefully I will see more results with my blemishes . I did n't get peeling at all NOR burning and this is why I believe I need a stronger solution . Overall this is a great product !
 Shipment was fast and the peel arrived early -LRB- in perfect condition -RRB- . I 've used the feel for 6 - 7 times already . I noticed my pores are smaller than they used to be . Acne shrunks quickly and old scars diminished . The colour of my skin becomes even which makes it easier for me to apply make up . However , acne problem worsens after the third peel . I thought maybe it 's got to do with the fact I was using a day cream that contains Lactic Acid . So I stopped using it . Yet my acne problem does n't improve at all . I used to have a mild occasional acne problem but now it looks as if I 'm going through puberty again ! So , I do n't know what went wrong . I 'm still going to use this peel though for I 'm hoping my condition will improve eventually .
 I bought this product about 2 weeks to ago and already I see and difference in my over skin appearance . I have suffered from acne since the age of 11 and have done all the usual to help clear up my skin condition with little result . However , after two or three peels using this product I see a difference . My skin is smoother . I have minimal underthe surface pimples . Unfortnately , I am a squeezer so i do have some acne scars especiall around my jaw line . However , I see these are lighter . I am so pleased . I also use the lactic peel .
 I must admit I was sceptical about the product 's claims - but it has definitely helped decrease my acne breakouts and has helped to get rid of some bumpy clogged pores , especially on my forehead . I bought a Groupon recently for a salycilic peel -LRB- right before I bought this product -RRB- . Well , I went to the skin care clinic , and their peel felt and acted _ exactly _ like this product . For $ 20 this is a great deal , now I am excited about trying the glycolic peel too ! Oh and great shipping , it arrived in just a few days .
 I bought this product about a month ago , and have been applying it about 2-3 times a week . I keep it on for about 10 mins . Even till this day , it stings for the first 5 minutes and my skin has not gotten used to the harshness , but I continue to apply it . The results are ... slow ! After the first week i noticed i was breaking out with more than average acne in my cheeks and chin . I was alarmed because I thought it was doing the opposite than it was supposed to but after reading some other user reviews , I noticed it was a common thing . But thats why i gave it 4 starts because the acne it created was not MILD , rather it was extreme and left me scars -LRB- i didnt even poke the acne -RRB- . But , right away i saw my skin getting firmer and clearer . I have a light brown complexion , so i had some discoloration and it has been somewhat cleared . The acne , it was reduced ... i currently have 5 pimples that are in the process of diminishing slowly . Ugh ... But it is better than before . Before I would break out with 8-11 pimples on my face and now they have decreased dramatically . I still have acne scars , which have not decreased AT ALL . I have not seen any difference in my acne scars which are still red/purple . But then again , i have only been using this product for about 4-6 weeks and I can not really determine its effectiveness . The reason I gave it 4 stars is because it has reduced the amount of breakouts I have gotten . Overall , I would buy it again ... not soon though because i have only used 1/8 of my bottle , so I 'm guessing it will lasts me months .
 It seems to me like the most common complaint is that nothing happens with this product . Perhaps these folks need a stronger peel . It is definitely a process to figure out what your sensitivity levels are , but I think it is certainly wise to start on the low end of peel intensity and work up from there . The last thing you want to do is hurt yourself . For me personally , the 20 % peel is perfect . I put it on for a minute and peeled ever so slightly for the next day or so . Three days later , I tried it again . This time I tried five minutes . It took about two days for the skin to start peeling and it flaked noticeably for about four days . It 's not the same type of deep peeling that I got from the peels I was getting from my esthetician . In that case , I did n't really want to leave the house for days . With the 20 % , there was still obvious flaking but I did n't look like I had a skin disease . I definitely prefer more frequent but less intense peels because I do n't like having to drop out of my life while I 'm doing them . I am thinking you could probably get the same results if you stick with it and stay patient . With more intense peels , you can only do them once every three weeks to a month , but with this peel you can do it weekly . According to the instructions , you can work up to several times a week , but if I did that I 'd probably hurt my skin . If you have the extra money and a weekend to stay home and hide out , the benefits of a deeper peel done by a professional is definitely worth the time . You can see pretty dramatic results from just one peel . This is n't that peel , but stick with it and do it weekly and I think you can probably achieve something similar . Just do n't try and leave it on for ten minutes the first time or you might burn yourself.As for the effectiveness , there 's no doubt that peeling your skin yields results over time . I started using this in the midst of a breakout and it has definitely helped clear me up . I starting using peels to control acne , but I do n't mind the fact that it helps with aging skin as well .
 As others have said , this is a great product . The shipping and service is quick , the product is excellent . A great deal from a great company ! Preferred over the Gylcolac 60 -LRB- but both are great -RRB- .
 I 'm in my 30 's & like many others I 've tried just about every product out there for my hormonal acne . This is the only topical treatment that I 've ever found to work . I started out with recommended usage but I 've found it most effective to use it twice a month & leave it on for 30 minutes at a time . It burns for the first 5 min & then subsides after . This product works wonders . I wish I had found it in my 20 's . I use it in conjuction with herbal pills that support liver function & help to clean the blood such as Murad clarifying pills .
 Okay so i have acne holes and dark brown spots from it.Im tan ; hispanic not dark at all and not light just tan = -RRB- well i always wash my face with neutrogena salicylic acidand i have n't really seen any difference . . I 've done chemical peels before and those actually made my skin peelwhich i love to see bc it means it works!i havent notice any peeling though = -LRB- i do see my skin is a light tighter . . i have used it 3 times but ill keep tryingin a month i might try to switch to the gylic or whatever u call itsince my skin prob is n't sensitive
 For some reason I 'm really not sure if it 's working or not . I do n't have what 99 % of the people have . I used it for about two months every week and I did n't have a single peel or anything resembling it . I use it without moisturizers because my skin is pretty oily so after a few hours my skin becomes normal and dry but then gets oily again . Maybe I should use it more than once a week ? Just really surprised I do n't have peeling even though everybody does.Also just a little worried about skin cancer . For how long you can not expose your face to the sun after applying this product ?
 I do n't really use this as a peel . I apply lightly to breakouts . I still got my acne but this really helped to dry them off a little . Not perfect but just O.K.
 i bought this item on skinlabo 's web site . product works really well , i have rarely acne so i ca n't tell too much about this concern but i have large pores and i can say that it really works for large pores -LRB- at least their appearance , so definitely it worth to try it.for customer service , i bought item from Switzerland , and one bottle -LRB- other bottle was lactic acid -RRB- and bottle was broken so i sent email to customer service and wrote them that bottle was broken and they agreed to sent me a new bottle . It 's really nice .
 used on my oldest daughter acne it works very well.I also used it for fine lines works nicely with the glycolic acid would recommend using the both a day apart or so .
 The first week I LOVED the peel . It burned but I used a fan which helped ALOT . My skin was flaking and underneath my new skin looked great . A week later I tried doing it right after a shower and i also put on alot more than i usually put on . My cheek now has a brown patch on it thats very dry . Im hoping it will fade away and its not a chemical burn . I would recommend to use only twice a week and do n't try to put it on for longer just to get faster results.If anyone has experienced the same patches please comment and let me know what happened I am scared!Also it 's cool how your existing pimples just peel off . This is great and hopefully the patch on my cheek will peel and new skin will show !!
 I have a lot of acne scars and discoloration skin . This works really well . It makes my skin clear and even . It does sting when applied , but it 's only temporary . I start to flake days afterwards , but it 's worth it for the nice skin . A little does go a long way .
 Ok I just just this on Monday March 23 , and belive me this product so far what it did it was an burning and stinging sensation , it was horrible I thought my face was in hell , lol . Take your time and see some videos about the salicylic acid peel you would see its complete normalAfter two day as expected I did got breakouts but not that much . I got high expectation on this so I hope it works . let you know in couple of weeks.Sunday april 8 , its about 3 weeks using the product need to tell you my skin feel much smoother than before , it help me with my breakouts still got some of them but not like before , it also help me with some dark spots , so far happy and cant wait to see full results .
 This is a wonderful product . It works great on teenage acne . My son got great results in a very short period of time . I highly recommend this product !
 I got this product last week and have tried it twice . The first time I applied it with a brush and it really stung - was afraid I had done something wrong so I rinsed it off within seconds of applying it . After re-reading the reviews on this site , I tried it again last night . This time I applied it with my fingertips and it did n't sting much at all . I have had some bad breakouts on my chin for the last month or two , a couple of which would NOT go away or get better . I was afraid I was getting some kind of adult onset acne or cysts . However , after I used the peel last night , I noticed this morning that those two spots looked MUCH better - less inflamed and well on their way to healing . Plus the large pores I am plagued with are looking tighter/smaller already . I left the gel on this time for maybe three minutes before rinsing off well and moisturizing . I am very happy with what I 've seen already and would recommend this product to anyone who wants to see a real improvement in problem skin - and we all have problem skin in some way , do n't we ?
 I 'm 36 years old and I still suffer from break-outs . I bought this product after reading the reviews on it and I had high hopes . This product definitely delivered . I 've been a Retin-A user for years and I needed something to give my skin that glow . Well , this worked wonders for my old acne scars , my oily skin and as for break-outs , almost non-existent ! Definitely would buy again !
 I saw results after the first use . No peeling , and where sunscreen . Follow directions carefully as warned ! Moderate to servere acne getting better . ca n't wait to upgrade strength .
 I just got the product today and decided to go ahead and try it out . First of all , the shipping was AMAZING . I ordered it Monday and received it on Tuesday.My skin is not awful . I am not plagued with lots of acne but when I do get a spot its usually followed with a large whitehead . I do have lots of severe blackheads on my nose and chin , which is really why I bought this peel . I also have large pores on my cheeks close to my nose . Im hoping this diminishes the blackheads and pores!Before I started the peel I used a cotton pad and rubbed rubbing alcohol all over my face , which ouch , kind of stung . Then I took another cotton pad and wiped a layer of the peel all over my face . I started with my forehead and worked my way down . It did sting , but I had myself worked up about the stinging so it was n't AS bad as I thought it would be . I lasted a little over a minute and then starting cupping cold water and patting it on my face for probably close to a minute . After I finished with the water I then patted my face dry . I noticed my skin still slightly stinging and tightening for another two minutes or so after I had rinsed with the cold water . After this I applied some Olay moisturizer with SPF 30 . I have not gone outside yet or slept yet , so I will give this a few weeks and update !
 Unbeleivable how I did n't know about this product earlier . I 've only used it for 3 weeks -LRB- I apply once weekly -RRB- and can already notice the difference ! I have brown skin that breaks out monthly and leaves black heads . Even though the blackheads are still visible , they keep dimishing with each peel . I would caution not leaving it on too long ; the longest I 've left it on is 5 mins , was trying to go for longer , max 8 mins and it irritated and left a scar when I inadvertently rubbed off the dead skin from not listening to my skin & not rinsing when it was burning . Overall , I will follow instructions more closely and not try to rush the re-growth . Glad I found it and look forward to additional glow!Salicylic Acid 20 % Gel Peel , 30ml -LRB- Professional -RRB-
 I have had a chemical peel in the derms office and did n't see any results from it and it was very expensive ... I tried this product and I will say have a large fan handy because you face will be burning off . But it is totally worth it . I cleaned my face with soap , then cleaned with alcohol , then used the product . I waited 6 minutes and sat the entire time in front of the fan . Immediately after I did n't see much results but three days later I used my Susan Lucci Dermabrasion system and now my face looks so smooth and almost wrinkle free and I am 46 years old . I highly recommend this product .
 Ok , so far so good . I have very oily , acne prone skin . I 'm Mexican American and have a darker skin tone . Most other acne washes and toners I 've tried have made my skin actually break out more . Here is what I have been doing
 At 29 , acne should be a thing of the past , however it has become worse . I have oily combination , very sensitive , skin and decided to try this peel . I followed the directions and am very pleased by the results after only one use . I will admit , I did spot treat the next couple of days , which caused my T-zone to become dry and start peeling , but it 's a gel `` peel '' so it 's doing what is is supposed to ! I seem to be allergic to the world , but it has been a week and this product has not bothered my skin one bit . Very happy with it so far !
 After researching some at home alternatives for peels , and less expensive options , I decided to try this since it seems more gentle . I followed directions and though it did sting for the 8 minutes you 're supposed to leave it on , I did n't see much peeling after nor did I see any difference in my skin ... I only tried this 3 times , once a week and gave up.But I do use it as a spot treatment and dabon pimples overnight and it seems to dry out pimples so you can flake off the skin faster and it starts to heal . That alone is a great reason to get this . Now I have a giant bottle of this that will last years !
 So the directions on Amazon say to use this two times a week at the beginning , but I do n't know how anyone can do that . I 've used it once a week for three weeks , and it definitely helps my skin , but I would n't recommend using it more than once in a week.While it 's on it stings/burns , but the feeling goes away a minute or two after you rinse it off . I leave it on for 5 minutes at a time . It makes the skin around my mouth flaky for a couple of days but using a good noncomedogenic , fragrance free lotion afterwards helps .
 I have used this peel about 5 or 6 times and use about tiwce a week . So far i can say that this really leaves your skin smooth and REALLY does shrink pores . This is the only thing i have used that has had a major effect on the large pore festival i used to have on my face . It also did fade dark spot just a little bit the only thing it did n't do for me is to prevent new acne from forming . Not sure if that is bcos i am still in the `` it would get worse before it gets better stage '' but i have seen more breakouts lately with the use of this peel . I also alternate with TCA 10 % peel so not sure if that could be it as well . Anyway overall this is a good product . And i do hope to see some improvement with preventing new acne or might have try a higher strength . I am also africam american and will recommend this for dark skin .
 I got this for my son age 13 . Tried everything else on market including expensive brands to no success . This made a noticible difference after only a few days . And noticible lifting the severe scars after a month or so . Now he only uses it for spot treatment .
 I have somewhat sensitive skin anyway , so I was n't surprised that this burned rather ferociously the first time I used it . I 'm not very bright , so against the instructions , I used it again the next night . If I thought the first time was bad , I then became acquainted with what I 'm sure is similar to the sensation of 50 bees stinging your face over and over . It was brutal . I had to cold water it after a couple of minutes . I 've since used it several times -LRB- every 2-3 days -RRB- over the last couple of weeks and it works . It peeled my skin , and as another reviewer mentioned , it made my skin a bit worse before it started to improve . The pores on my nose have all but disappeared . The sensation is still slightly uncomfortable but it 's obvious that the longer you use it , the less it stings . Currently it feels like I spread a thin layer of Icy Hot on my face . I also notice that when I sit and think about it , it 's worse , so I recommend doing something to take your mind off of it . Apply and play a few games of BubblePopp on Facebook or something less lame . Overall highly recommended and worth it . Also - you ca n't beat this price !
 My experience with this peel has been consistent with many of the other customer reviews . It will take your skin time to adjust . Your skin will be sensitive and red immediately after use and will then become flaky -LRB- using a moisturizer helps greatly but will not prevent this -RRB- . After this passes your skin will look and feel significantly better in every way for a few days until you use it again and the process repeats itself . When I first started using this product , the amount of time after use before my skin would look better was around 2 days . There is little you can do during this time to hide these temporarily negative results . I was fairly disappointed . However , encouraged by the positive reviews , I stuck with it and the amount of time these negative results lasted has gone down considerably -LRB- less than a day and during that time it 's less noticeable now -RRB- . I have also found that if you have acne under your skin that has yet to come to the surface using this will bring them to the surface . So the next day after you use it you may see some whiteheads that were n't there before . Do n't be alarmed or discouraged , in the long run this is for the best . It is a temporary setback that will be gone once and for all if you continue to use the peel.There are two other points I 'd like to bring to attention . -LRB- 1 -RRB- The instructions recommend using it 2-3 times weekly . For me this is much too frequent and I do n't feel that there is much benefit to using it this often . Using it every 5-7 days -LRB- I use it every Sunday -RRB- is sufficient for great long term results . -LRB- 2 -RRB- The price is a steal for what you are getting . I have been on the same bottle for 4 months . From the looks of it I wo n't have to buy another bottle for another month or so . So for me it has been much cheaper and much more effective than anything else that I could have used during that time.I have struggled with bad skin for several years . It is dries out easily and is naturally oily . I have tried many other products including Proactive . Nothing else comes close to this . After much searching , I have finally found the solution and instead of being embarrassed by the way my skin looks , I often receive complements . I hope you have the same experience .
 I average at home peels bi-monthly with peel types ranging from lactic acid -LRB- 40 % -RRB- , glycolic -LRB- 10 % -RRB- , and now this salicyclic acid peel . I 've had one TCA peel done professionally a couple years ago and that was the deepest peel I 've ever had -LRB- and did that thing hurt like none other -RRB- . The problem I 'm trying to solve with this peel is scarring on the sides of my face and these bumps on my right jawline that I think are dormant cystic acne lesions . They are usually not inflamed but they are bumpy , as if there 's something underneath each one . Once in a while they will get inflamed and swell up as active cysts . I 've never had any good advice for this problem , not from derms nor various estheticians . I hope to use this peel to wear down the bumps and purge the cysts.With that background , this salicyclic peel is rather mild for me . I 've done this about three times . There 's a bit of stinging but it 's about the same as the lactic acid peel . It 's not unbearable at all for me . My routine starts with a double-cleanse ; the first one to get rid of my make up , and the second to clean as if from scratch . I 've used my Clarisonic on one occasion . I did not notice any difference with the peel in that instance . I first apply to the thicker areas of my face that coincidentally need the extra peeling -- sides of face , jawline -- then I do the T-zone starting with the forehead them the nose area . The skin around my nose is much thinner and that 's where I notice the tingling the most . I leave it on for about 5 minutes , then I add more to the jawline area where I have cystic acne and some bumpy scarring . I leave it on for another 5 minutes or so and then I neutralize with a baking soda and water solution and wash with water . I do n't find that I need to use a cleanser afterward , but I do moisturize . I do not get any sort of frosting whatsoever but my skin does get red so it only looks marginally better immediately after the peel . The next morning , my skin looks much smoother and even . It 's most noticeable in my forehead where the skin there is smoother and has minimal spots to begin with.The bumps do feel a bit flatter after the third peel . I 'm hopeful that they 'll continue to get flatter or come to head with continued treatment .
 I used to work at a spa and they would use this and charge you $ 65 per peel !! I buy this at home and my husband who is acne prone loves the immediate results . It wo n't cure your acne completely but it helps to control breakouts ! I have pretty good skim skin and i use this once in awhile for a deep cleanse and my skin comes out nice and clean . Happy with the product , shipping time and price !!! : -RRB-
 I just received this product yesterday , and I immediately did the patch test . Much to my relief , the product did not burn like I expected it to . This morning the area was n't in the least bit red or dry , so I decided it was okay to use on my face . When applying , it feels warm immediately . For me , it tingled about 30 seconds in , and then by a minute it was a warm stinging . Unpleasant , but nowhere near intolerable . I left it on for three minutes and it did n't sting any worse than the one minute mark . However , when I went to rinse , the second my skin made contact with water it burned a surprising amount . Luckily , I read around a lot before purchasing , so I had a mixture of baking soda and water ready . I splashed that over my face and the burn stopped immediately , along with the initial sting . -LRB- You can purchase the neutralizer it suggests , but why spend the 20 bucks -LRB- S&H ;-RRB- when baking soda works just as well ? -RRB- I rinsed for a minute or two , making sure to be 100 % thorough , then followed the directions by patting dry with a cotton pad and applying Cetaphil . Now I 've applied the moisturizer about three times in the six or so hours since using , but my face is n't flaky or red whatsoever . If anything , it already looks better ! I 'm excited to see the long term effects of this product and as of right now , I highly recommend it.UPDATE 1/18/13
 This stuff works so well on my skin . I am african american and I get dark spots very easily . This peel is very much professional grade and burns like ... . well you know . I 've had a chemical peel at a spa and this peel burned much ... MUCH more than those but it is also more powerful.When I use it I do see immediate results but it is WORKING , believe me . The next day I get dark spots that are as big as a quarter and it resembles a chemical burn but then it begins to peel . I help my skin heal by using hydrocortisone cream 2-3 times a day and this helps the skin peel itself to reveal your new , baby-soft skin underneath . Be sure to do it well in advance of a big day .
 I read some reviews before I bought this product and the majority of people like it so I gave it a try . I am 28 years old and have battled acne for the past 10 years . I 've tried many many products - over the counter and prescription . I used Proactive for years and then that stopped working : -LRB- I have been using the peel about every 5 days or so for over a month . My blackheads are still there but I have noticed that my skin is smoother and is less likely to break out ! -LRB- After I do a peel I do n't break out after , my skin does the opposite thankfully ! -RRB- Like another reviewer said , its a process . This is n't going to solve all of your problems in one application.This product is NOT for everyone . I do NOT have sensitive skin . This product does NOT make me bruise , incredibly red or make my skin turn brown like other reviews . If you know you have sensitive skin I would say this is n't for you . I had no problem applying it to my entire face right from the start . You should gradually ease into the product by slowly increasing the amount of time you leave it on every peel you do . Yes it burns badly but you have to do something to distract you while its on lol . My face still burns after I rinse it off , apply a ph balancer , rinse that off and apply a cream ... beauty is pain!I 'm glad I read other reviews because I created my own ph balancer for after I rinse the peel . Like other reviewers I created a baking soda paste -LRB- just add water -RRB- and I apply that to my skin after I rinse the peel off . It is gritty so you ca n't rub it in , it 'll irritate your skin . I just apply it with my fingers and let it sit for a couple of minutes then rinse it off . It helps with the burning ! I actually mixed the baking soda and water and put it in a small plastic container and keep it in my fridge so I do n't have to make the paste for every peel . It keeps in the fridge just fine and its nice and cold on my face after the peel!I like the product and will continute to use it ! It has n't eliminated scars or blackheads yet but I 'm hoping . My goal is to have clear skin so I do n't have to wear makeup . . maybe thats a lofty goal . Even if it does n't , its still a great product for people prone to get blemishes . I 'm mad I did n't find it sooner !
 Length :
 This is an entry level gel peel and I recomend it if its your first time undergoing a glycolic acid treatment . You will see results after 2 or 3 applications . If you take the price of this bottle into consideration , it is a miracle cream . It really works !
 This product is nothing short of amazing . I am a 25 year old female , and throughout the last 3 years I have had major on and off problems with acne . I do n't know why , and it has severely bothered me seeing as before the age of 22 my skin was almost always perfectly clear . It was something I was regularly complimented on . SO these mini-breakouts I 've been getting , mainly appear on my forehead , in clusters of very small little zits . Nothing would make them clear up . If they did , new ones took their place . I wash my face every morning and night , I mosturize , I tried many different exfoliants ... Even my visits to dermotoligists , and taking prescription Retin-A did not clear my skin . Nothing . Has . Ever . Worked . Then , somehow I stumbled upon this product . It has changed my life . :-RRB- My skin is back to how it once was , pre-mid-twenties . I am simply amazed . Now , I can walk out of the house and I do n't even need a speck of makeup . As of right now , using the product only SIX times -LRB- once every 5 days -RRB- there is not a single zit , red mark , bump , or pimple ANYWHERE on my face ! : DOf course , as other reviews say , the product does slightly burn . But DUH . you 're putting an ACID peel on your face . I also have only experienced minimal flaking . I just be sure to moisturize after using ... as the directions state.BUY THIS !
 I 've used this product 6 times now , and I 've seen significant improvement of my overall complexion . My skin is smoother and clearer.Like other reviewers have said , at first blemishes seemed to emerge immediately after doing a peel , but then also went away faster than usual . Now after several applications I have fewer blemishes than ever.Pros - Fewer blackheads , pores appear smaller -LRB- actually just cleaner :-RRB- , skin is smoother , fewer blemishes after several uses.Cons - Burned during the first few applications , can be drying -LRB- must moisturize ! -RRB- I will keep using this stuff , and definitely reorder again .
 I bought this product back in August of 2010 and used a few times . I started having fairly bad acne and needed something to help it out . I bought this along with Dudu Osun black soap . I used the peel a couple days a week for about a month then just once a month . I have n't needed to use it for the last 2 months . Since then I gave it to my friend , who has the worst acne I have ever witnessed -LRB- cystic , infected , blackheads , you name it -RRB- , in hopes it will do a little something for him . -LRB- I 'll see how it works for him and update in a couple months -RRB- I do n't know if it was the reduction in stress in my life , getting more adequate sleep , not being a teenager anymore , eating more fruit , or just the soap and always using clean cloths to wash , but I only get spot breakouts that are small and go away quickly , which I can live with . My skin seems to always be improving with just using the soap , literally only the soap . I do n't moisturize , use the salicylic peel , face masks , nose strips , or any acne wash or cream at all anymore . Just the soap everyday in the shower . I do think the salicylic acid helped give my skin a jump-start though .
 I saw results right away with this product , its amazing . my skin looks awesome , the only bad thing is they sent me an old batch expires in 4 months .
 I bought this stuff for my sons molluscum contagiosum . What typically takes 12-18 months to get rid of , is nearly gone after only 3 days ! I ca n't say enough good stuff about it . Simply apply it with a Q-tip 2-5 times a day to the molluscum areas & they miraculously begin to dry up & go away . This is our second bout w / this molluscum stuff as my kids are both on the swim team & my daughter got it last year . Unfortunately , I could n't use this stuff as the molluscum was on her eyelid . I used an herbal product that worked , but was quite expensive and took about 6 months to see results . I highly recommend this stuff !
 This stuff is amazing . I am 32 and have had consistent mild acne since I was 11 - nothing could control it ! Laser treatments , antibiotics , proactiv - you name it I tried it . I was hesitatant to try something else since nothing ever worked - but for less than $ 20 it was worth a shot . I added this to my regime of items that had seemed to help a little in the past and saw some results after every treatment . It was not immediate but my face got a little better after each treatment - Then after the first complete round of treatment -LRB- 6 weeks -RRB- the results were amazing . My face is 99 % clear and I can get rid of/prevent more acne with the solution if I feel a problem area starting . For the first time I am in control of my face - my skin tone looks much better too . It is amazing and the price is even more amazing.So no pain no gain right - so it stings/burns like crazy annd I had to slowly increase the time to the full amount - -LRB- careful around the nose and mouth -RRB- stand with your face in front of a fan that helps , wash really well with water and then immediately use moisturizer and the burn goes away . After the first few treatments I felt a little sensitive to the sun so I tried to stay in the shade the day following but that went away with use . My skin tolerates spot treatments as needed but be careful and make sure your skin can tolerate the extra treatments . I wish I had found this years ago I will never go without it again .
 I 've had acne since age of 13 . Now 44 . Recently it has become worse . First time using this product my acne became worse then improved . I use this on Monday and use the TCA peel on Wednesday . My acne has improved alot , my skin is getting better every week I use this . I have been using the TCA peel 4 months before . TCA peel seems to work better with the Salicylic acid peel . I wished that I have known this along time ago .
 I have had problem skin forever . In 2006 , I went all out and spent money on a plastic surgeon to remove some scars and then underwent expensive acne treatments in his office . That only lasted as long as I kept going to his office for the treatments . Once I quit going within weeks my skin looked terrible again and the scar came back just a bit . So since then I 've had terrible skin . I was willing to spend so much money on it and I just tried to deal with my skin condition using over the counter products UNTIL I discovered this Salicylic Acid Peel . It 's been 3 weeks since I bought it . And wow , what an improvement in my skin . The scar area is about to fall off right now . My pores are significantly smaller . My oily skin is n't oily anymore . The overall condition of my skin is such an improvement . Just in the nick of time too because I have an important event coming up and I will look great in my new skin . This stuff works . Try it out and see your skin condition clear up and improve overall . I have one wrinkle in between my forehead which I have n't had luck getting rid of but I 'll continue to apply this and see if it improves . I 'll keep you posted . Best product I 've found on amazon.com .
 This product is AMAZING for women of color !!!! I recently ordered this product and after the first use my skin was glowing and cleared the acne within 24 hrs . I followed up with the Neutralizer PH Balancer and a 70 % Sunblock to further protect my skin . I have no more over 40 year old acne and everyone notices the difference . Because of the high concentration of Salicylic Acid , you can feel it working immediately , and see the dead skin removal as you apply with a cotton ball . I only left it on for 2 minutes , even though the instructions say 1 - 8 minutes . I am ordering more !!!!
 I first got a glycolic acid and started to use it and it worked pretty well , my skin was much more even and healthier.Definatelly saw an improvement and my forehead wrinkle is less visible/at least a day after the peeling / . Then I needed another bottle and realized that the salicylic acid is more specialized for acne so I ordered Salicylic Acid 20 % . Every time I use it my skin looks so nice , even , and what is the most important , I do n't break out that much ... I used to break out every day and now it is maybe once a week , but it is getting better ... I have/had bumpy skin but with each peel I can see a lot of progress and it looks like my skin is smoother and less bumpy . Well , I love this product and it definatelly help me have a better skin . I am not saying it made my acne vanished , but it helped me way more that any other product that I have tried before.Ps . Build up your tolerance slowly .
 I have used the peel twice and my skin is amazing ! I always have blackheads on my nose and a couple of whiteheads on my cheeks . Biore would temporarily get rid of the blackheads on my nose , but nothing ever got rid of my whiteheads . I 've tried all types of inexpensive to expensive facials , creams , and gels . I can only stand leaving the peel on for about 30 secs to a minute . Afterwards , I wash it off with a ton of cold water . I use moisturizer and that 's it ! Right away I could see the difference . My blackheads got a lot smaller , and my whiteheads were n't as bumpy . I 'm hoping after a few more treatments , they 'll be all gone . I also drink lots of water , cause I remember my esthetician telling me to do that after facial treatments .
 This peel is really amazing . Prior to using the peel , my skin was so damaged with blemishes and painful zits , to the point where makeup no longer covered them , and my skin was so patchy it was embarrassing . Nothing was working for my acne . Finally , I tried this peel and it has changed the way I feel about my face . It diminished the size of my pores , completely gained my natural skin tone back , and almost completely got rid of the zits only after 4 weeks of use.The first time I used it , I followed the instructions carefully . Leaving it on only 1 minute . There was a stinging sensation but nothing too painful or unbearable . After rinsing it off with cold water I dabbed the Neutralizer skin pH balancer by Cellbone and rinsed that off ... then pat dry face . I immediately saw a huge difference in the size of my pores . They were completely closed!Continued the treatment every two days and about 2 weeks later noticed that my skin tone was no longer red from all the acne , my face did n't hurt due to acne , and my acne was completely gone ! Now , due to my high stress levels I got two measly little pimples but they do n't hurt or look as massive as they used to . I am very excited to have found this peel . I 'm on my 5th week and will stop shortly after next week . I recommended it to my friend and she 's in love with it also.You should definitely try this product ! you 've got acne to loose ! : -RRB-
 I have been using this peel several times a week for 3 weeks . It has drastically improved my skin tone and texture . I was hoping to reduce some of my acne scarring , and this has definitely helped . I ca n't wait to see how my skin looks in another month ! It does burn a bit , and it is imperative to moisturize after . I hope it helps your skin , too ! : -RRB-
 THANK YOU , THANK YOU , THANK YOU ! I have paid hundreds of dollars for peels at local spas and I was tired of it . I needed a product that would deliver the same results without the outrageous price . I found it thanks to this peel ! I get the same , if not better , results from this product ! Just make sure to follow the instructions step-by-step and you will be good to go . I use it once a week and it has saved me time , money , and hours trying to cover up blemishes . I have zero blemishes thanks to this product . I will definitely be re-ordering !
 Other than accutane -LRB- which only worked for the months I was on it -RRB- , this product is the ONLY thing in over 25 years that has worked ! Highly recommended . Worth it 's weight in gold .
 I have suffered from frequent break-outs for 20 years now . I have tried trips to the dermatologist , spa treatments , OTC products all with limited success . I have been using this peel for almost 2 weeks now and have seen a significant improvement . My acne has cleared up and my pores appear much smaller . My old acne scars have diminished as well.Now , the first time I put this on , there was a definite burning pain . I only managed to have it on for about a minute before rinsing it off and applying some lotion . That alleviated the pain almost immediately . I am now able to leave it on for several minutes and am seeing more noticable improvement .
 I have adult acne and I was using this product as directed once every week , but it was n't doing much so I decided to start using it as a spot treatment and it 's working much better that way . I do n't have cystic acne anymore , I just seem to get the hormonal acne around my chin and jaw line . I just put a dot on every pimple I have after I wash my face . Then I wash it off after 5 minutes and then put on an oil free moisturizer . It 's been working ok , dries out my pimples but they 're still pretty red . I get scaring from my pimples -LRB- hyperpigmentation -RRB- and I 've been using the glycolic acid 35 % on the dark spots as a spot treatment as well . They 're both definitely better than just using face wash and 2.5 % SA or BP spot treatments that you can get at the store so I 'm happy with it .
 YES it works but it burns like satan was in it . After 2 weeks my skin got scaly so 1 day I steamed some water and let my face just sit near the steam & suddenly the dead skin started peeling off and there was new smooth pretty skin . I am ordering some more when I use this.IT WAS WELL WORTH THE MONEY !
 # 1 -RRB- so this salicylic peel is not like a tca peel where your skin peels and there is a downtime , correct ? it just gets rid of oil and just makes your skin a bit red but no peeling?because i need something that i could use as daily maintenance or use several times a week to reduce oil and prevent new acne from forming but where there is no downtime as i need to work . i 've had tca peels where my skin would peel for a week . i would get that once every couple of weeks . # 2 -RRB- can i use this with retin-A ? it would be great where i could use a product that would reduce the oil and i can apply retin-A over it . any suggestions would be much appreciated .
 I have inherited oily , acne prone skin from both my parents . I had my first breakout at the age of ten and it progressed regularly until my mid-twenties . I now have about one breakout a month and the majority of my face now has very large , clogged pores . Over the years I have tried several name brand and not-so-name-brand over the counter treatments . I visited 4 dermatologists and have tried antibiotics , prescription topical ointments and birth control . None positively impacted my skin and , in fact , the ointments irritated my skin . I chose to try this product because it 's a stronger concentration than the 2 % solutions at the drugstore and I know salicylic acid is lipophilic . I needed to get rid of the built up oil and dead skin cells to help get rid of the gunk in my skin.I received this product last week and have used it twice . I followed the directions that were enclosed in the packaging and also researched the procedure by reviewing information and videos produced by board certified dermatologists . Both times I cleansed my skin with a gentle cleanser , patted my face dry and used an alcohol prep on my face to remove any excess surface oil on the skin . I measured about 1.5 mL of solution and administered the product using 4x4 gauze and gloves , starting with the forehead and working my way down my face . When I was ready to remove the peel I rinsed my face with copious amounts of cool water and then patted my face dry with a clean towel . Afterward I used a moisturizer with SPF 50 . The first peel stayed on for 1 minute and I only noticed slight tingling on part of my forehead . The second peel stayed on for 2 minutes and I noticed considerable stinging in the exact locations where my pores were largest and most clogged - nose , cheeks , chin and part of my forehead . My skin in these areas was a light shade of pink after rinsing.Today is the day after my second peel . My super large , clogged pores appear smaller with less gunk and the small pimples I had last night are now gone . I do n't even see redness in the areas where they were . My skin is no longer the light shade of pink it was when I finished the peel and my skin texture is softer that it was . I have never seen results with a product this quickly . I am VERY SATISFIED with my results and will continue to use this product . It 's such a relief to have finally found a product that can really penetrate pores and deliver a great result .
 Best price I found , super fast delivery . Great product , my breakouts have really diminished and i 'm only on my second application , comes with full instructions and works greeeeat ! will definitely continue to buy more of this supplier 's products .
 I used a wide-tip paint brush , poured a little of this acid in a glass container , and painted it on . The first time I left it for 15 minutes , the second and third times I left it on for about 30 . I should have bought the 30 % because it does n't burn how other people have reported , but it does make my complexion clear for a while . Makes me look younger for sure . . I love this product and will continue the application , but with the stronger dose next time . But for people with delicate skin this is probably very good .
 I have had bad acne since I was in elementary school , a decade and a half later I finally cleared most of it up with proactive . That would have been fine if it were n't for my obsession with picking every pimple that I have ever had . To date I have probably wasted around $ 15,000 on peels , laser treatments , creams , and derm abrasions , only to have the acne flare back up and have scars return.I bought this product a few weeks ago and was extremely hopeful yet very apprehensive . If $ 15,000 ca n't help the scars what will an $ 18 bottle of acid do ? Magic , that 's what it will do ! I have done 2 peels so far and have seen a large reduction in the red scars , and the deep pock marks have a less cavernous appearance . I continued to use proactive and only had a small amount of actual peeling . On the other hand , my skin is very tough.So far I love it ! It is gratifying to watch the scars fade with each peel , even more exciting knowing that that same peel would cost me upwards of $ 150 if I were to go to a dermatologist .
 I am so surprised by what a great product this is . I take meticulous care of my skin , use a good moisturizer daily , get regular facials , and even a few med spa chemical peels this year . The spa chemical peels were HARSH and actually terrible for my skin . it burned and flaked for days , and after ? Just about zero difference.I came across this peel in a search for a new skincare product . My skin is oily in the summer , dry in the winter , and has some uneven redness that I usually cover with foundation . I 've been using this for just a few weeks now and I see a great difference already . It 's not a miracle product but it definitely seems to work . Just be sure to read the instructions carefully !! You can only use this product at MOST every 5 days , I would recommend once per week . Your face should NOT be wet with the product - it almost goes on more like a toner , with a cotton pad wiped across the skin . You have to be very careful to keep it away from eyes , nostrils and mouth . And the product should n't be left on for more than 8-10 minutes , MUCH less at first . You have to build up gradually with a product like this . Start small , rinse off well with lots of cool water , and moisturize immediately . Avoid any scrubbing within 24 hours of using this - I tend to exfoliate my face like crazy , either with a face scrub or with a washcloth , but the peel exfoliates your skin so any more will result in irritation . I learned that the hard way!Really worth trying . I 've tried all sorts of skincare products from just about every brand out there
 I never had much acne growing up , but it would seem that each little pimple left a mark on my face . Most of the people I know kept telling me that the scars were `` barely '' noticeable . Still , noticeable enough for me . So I went through a laser treatment and I noticed an improvement of 30 % to 50 % . I was n't impressed
 I was nervous when I first applied this peel , I thought I was going to burn my face off . My skin is also really sensitive , it gets irritated very easily . However , I did not end up burning my skin at all , and I did not have any other adverse reaction -LRB- skin peeling/flaking , irritation , etc -RRB- . Although , I did take it slow -LRB- I left the peel on for less than a minute for my first use -RRB- . I have gradually been increasing the time I leave the peel on for , you do build up a tolerance to it . My face does not stay red -LRB- for long -RRB- after use , I just apply Cetaphil spf moisturizer following immediately after.Basically this is my regiment : -LRB- I apply it after I shower in the morning -RRB- - Wash my face with green tea cleanser -LRB- it 's best to use a cleanser with out moisturizer or anything that will leave a residue on your face , it affects the efficacy of the peel -RRB- . - I apply witch hazel toner to my face with a round cotton pad . The toner helps remove any excess oils on your face -LRB- I read that oils on your face can also prevent the peel from working as well -RRB- . It can make the peel sting a bit more if your face is really dry , so use discretion when choosing to apply a toner . My face gets really dry , but I want to get the maximum benefit from the peel so I use the witch hazel.-I also apply vaseline -LRB- I use the kind that has cocoa butter mixed in , it smells so good ! -RRB- around my eyes and on my lips . I us it as a precaution , I 'm clumsy so there is always a chance I could accidently get the peel in my eye or on my lips . Lol ! - Once the witch hazel has fully dried , I begin applying the peel . I just use a round cotton pad -LRB- not the same one I apply the toner with , I get a new one out -RRB- . You can get the cotton rounds at walgreens or any drug store , usually in the beauty section.-After I apply the peel to my entire face -LRB- It usually only takes me a few seconds to apply all over -RRB- I set a timer . Once the timer goes off I rinse my face with tons of cold water . When I dry my face I do so gently , and I dab the towel on my face I do not rub.So for my first time I set the timer for one minute after I applied the peel . But I ended up rinsing the peel off before the minute was up , just because I felt the peel beginning to tingle and I was so scared that I was burning my face off ! I began rinsing my face off with lots of cold water . I dried my face , then immediately -LRB- gently -RRB- applied my moisturizer . My face remained a little red for a few minutes but was n't bad . And to my suprise everything went well ! My face did n't burn off , my face did n't remain red for long , I had no peeling ! I have become more comfortable using this peel and also leaving it on for longer periods -LRB- I left it on for about 2 minutes and had no adverse reactions -RRB- I noticed right away that my skin felt a little tighter . Now after I use the peel my face looks much better , it has this kind of renewed fresh look to it . I do n't know exactly how to describe it . I did n't realize how awful and worn out my skin had started to look ! I needed to get all that old damaged skin off . My skin seems to have gotten a little lighter , I think the sun damage has begun to fade a bit.My acne has not diminished entirely , but I would say it has gotten better . My acne scars seem to have become more smooth , my face does n't looks as ruddy . I was n't expecting a miracle to begin with . My face was/is pretty bad . I 'm 26 and I have adult acne , and I 'm beginning to develop fine lines and wrinkles . My face had begun to develop that tired damaged look . I know it will take quite awhile for my skin to look as great as I want it too -LRB- need to see a dermatologist someday ! -RRB- , but this peel seems to be helping it look better for now . Overall I am pleased with this peel ! It will take awhile to get the full benefit from the peel . I 've only been using it for about a month , but I see slight improvement .
 I 've used this product for about 6 weeks , once a week , and without the slightest exaggeration , this product has CHANGED my skin.I 'm 17 years old and have very sensitive skin . When I was younger I suffered from SEVERE sun damage in Florida that has plagued my skin ever since . My biggest complaints about my skin -LRB- before this product -RRB- were
 I 've struggled with acne prone skin since I was 10 years old ... Now I 'm 26 and STILL have problems , mainly with clogged pores and what seems like too much oil production . After trying any and every product I could get my hands on , I decided to try a peel . I have very sensitive skin , so I was a little weary at first , but the 20 % solution has worked great for me so far ! The first time I used it I could only leave it on for about 30 seconds . -LRB- The stinging was a little more than I had expected . -RRB- But even after leaving it on for such a short time I have had great results ! My face is not nearly as oily as it was before . I used to get really shiny about an hour after applying my makeup , but now my face looks great throughout the day . And the number of pimples has also dramatically decreased . I would strongly suggest using this product .
 I have struggled with acne for several years and tried just about everything . This product gets it under control . After I use it , any blemishes that I have heal much quicker and leave less scarring . I have n't noticed a whole lot of difference in my pore size/black heads , but I have been using this peel for several months now and I am excited to move up to the 30 % . As soon as I 'm done using it , my skin it much softer and there is usually minimal visible peeling . Definitely worth a try if you suffer from acne . I only wish that there were a natural alternative that produced these results .
 I have had so many problems with my skin . I have very fair and sensitive skin and seem to have hormonal acne that started in my 30 's . I have used this only four times and all the bumps , blackheads , and problem areas are gone . I only have the red marks left behind now , which I hope will go away soon . I simply brush on , leave on for 2 or 3 min . And wash off.Update
 I 've been using the Salicylic Acid peel for a month now and I really like it . I came off of accutane last year and still have some lingering scars and dark spots . I 'm also starting to see my first fine lines and wrinkles . Even though my face is completely clear of blemishes , I still have to wear makeup because I just do n't have pretty skin . I was about to get a medium depth TCA peel from my dermatologist , but I just could n't bring myself to take a week off of work to recover ! So I started browsing the internet . This peel got such fabulous reviews -LRB- and was such a low price -RRB- that I decided to give it a shot.I was so terrified of burning my skin off , that I literally put it on for 10 seconds the first time ! That obviously did nothing , so each time , I bumped it up to a minute , then two , and so on . No matter how long you leave it on , immediately , your skin feels softer and more smooth and it just appears tighter . I do n't think it 's anything anyone else would notice , but my satisfaction is enough for me!I did n't start seeing real results until I kept the peel on my skin for at least 5 minutes . That time , I got noticeable peeling over the next couple of days-it reminded me of what I call `` accutane skin '' . If you 've ever taken the drug , you know what I mean - dry , a little itchy , flaky and a little pink . Several days later , you start to see new , softer skin appear . Since I 've been using this peel , I have n't even had to use concealer , as my skin tone is significantly evening out.I will absolutely continue to use this product !
 This stuff is really good for reducing the size of huge acne . I have had very fast results.I do get some minor visible peeling . In addition , this stuff can be very painful.I probably would buy it again .
 Used it twice and my skin look so much smoother and clear . I 'm so excited to see what the results would be with along term use .
 I got this last week and have used it twice already , it burns a fair bit but leaves my skin feeling and looking amazing!I have been using this for a few weeks now and LOVE it ! It does make my skin peel and burns a little bit while applied to my face , but that is to be expected with a `` peel '' . I have been seeing great results . I have also started to use this on my chest and it has been working great there too.This product is NOT too harsh at all and does n't burn my face -LRB- leaving it red for days -RRB- like other products have . I also have n't seen negative reactions to being in the sun . I would recommend this to everyone as a starter and if you feel you need something stronger move to a different strength then.The directions that come with it are less than desirable and look rather unprofessional .
 I have had breakouts for most of my adult life . I am 41 years old and wondering when all this was going to stop ! I bought this thinking that it will help to get rid of the zits finally . Well , I was not let down . Number one , it does burn pretty good . I have a high pain tolerance -LRB- four kids ... natural childbirth -RRB- but it does burn . Remember to keep fanning yourself once it 's on . Also , once you rinse off with very cold water , it will continue to burn for a few more minutes . I use Nivea Soft moisturizing cream afterwards because it has the vitamin E and jojoba oil . I felt that my skin was tighter and pores were smaller . In the two weeks I have been using it , there has been no new pimples . Your face will peel but its like really dry skin . Not very noticeable , I went to work the next day with no issues . -LRB- The Nivea can be put on under foundation too to help with the flakiness/dryness -RRB- I actually look forward to the burn , knowing that it is transforming my face . I use a brush to put it on as a cottonball soaked up to much into itself and did n't feel like I was getting an adequate amount on my face . I will continue to use this and hope to see even more results .
 id been on a skin product buying binge . I began breaking out in acne since i was about 16 , -LRB- im now 20 -RRB- . Nothing worked . Even if a product took away many of the actual pimples i was still left with very bumpy skin . I used this product for the first time last night , and im not going to lie , it burned like hell . i could only keep it on for about 2 of the recommended 8 minutes . it was burning so badly i found myself running around my house trying to cool my face down lol . i washed it off with water , and it was still burning so i applied a pH balanced toner which took all the burn away . I noticed results right away . It burned away all existing pimples and i woke up the next morning with people commenting on how great my skin looked . For me , its a miracle cure . just make sure you remove the mask the second your face turns red and frosting begins . great product !!
 I like this stuff a lot . It 's strong enough to do the job , but not so strong that it leaves me in pain or with rashes . I 've used it on my face , thus far have not exceeded 1 minute , once a week due to the intense `` tingle '' , & it works for minimizing pores & getting the top layer of dead skin off the surface -LRB- a nice , smooth feeling & appearing result -RRB- . Also , I 've used it on my family 's keratosis pilaris -LRB- those hundreds of tiny bumps on the backs of our arms -RRB- & it has produced some results there as well -LRB- they seem to be clearing up -RRB- . No tingle is felt on our arms , I 've only felt the tingle on my face . * Note
 My chin tends to get clogged pores resulting in either blackheads or large , painful zits and this is the only remedy I 've tried that actually keeps the pores clear and even shrinks them . I use it about 2x a week rubbing it on the area with a clean q-tip . I leave it on for only about 45 seconds , until it starts to burn , then wash it off with water . There is no redness and it has cleared up the area so well . I highly recommend it .
 I bought this peel for my son who has moderate acne and also for myself because I have bothersome blackheads I ca n't seem to get rid of no matter what . I did the peel a couple of days ago and I can already tell a difference . I do n't believe I put enough solution on my face though or on my son 's face for fear that I would over do it so I believe next time we do this I will be sure to put plenty on . It does burn quite a bit but I believe it 's worth it for the end result . My face is just starting to peel and I 'm excited to see how it will be after a few more treatments , especially for my son .
 If you suffer from acne -LRB- like I do :-LRB- -RRB- you will love this product . The company who makes it is , imho , the best . I had tried one from another company -LRB- my review of it is on here somewhere -RRB- but this particular company is 100 % . Beware , though , if you 're not used to using this , it 's seriously powerful stuff . You 'll feel tingles and slight burning , so read the directions first . It 's the best product I 've ever used .
 I love this product ! I am 35 year old Hispanic female . I have been dealing with cystic acne for the past few years ! Within the last 6 months , my acne had gotten really bad . My jaw line and neck was filled with painful cystic acne . I was on a bunch of topicals as well as oral antiobiotics . Nothing seemed to help . A friend mentioned this product and I decided to try it out.After the first application , I noticed a dramatic change . The cysts began to shrink and within a couple of days from the 1st use , the pain was gone and the cyst were gone . I have used this peel 3 times already . The first time , I left it on for 3 minutes and rinsed it off with cool water . The peeling began the next day.If you have cystic acne , give this a try ! It is not hard to use.Wash your face with a gentle cleanser , do not exfoliate . Pat dry . Apply the peel starting at the fore head . Down to the neck line . Because I was new to the `` peel '' world , I let it sit for 3 minutes and it was a bit uncomfortable . Fan your face and it will help . Rinse with cool -LRB- not luke warm -RRB- COOL water . Pat dry with paper towels . Let face completely air dry and then apply moisturizer . YOU DONT HAVE ANYTHING TO LOSE !!!! I am now going to start to alternate between glycolic and salicylic peels !!!!
 I ordered this product and I just had to get it . I went to Dermatology Consultants here in Atlanta and they charged me about 100 bucks for a peel and eventually they charged me less because the ladies there loved me . Two of them were really cute . Anyway this product is working . I probably threw away about 400 dollars getting beta peels and chemical peels . Then i wondered if I could get those kind of results for less and bam , I found this product by Skin Laboratory . I did n't even know you could use it twice a week and I will start doing so . For all of those that are skeptical ... DO N'T BE . give this product a shot because you will no be disappointed . And for those wondering if it works on African American , well it does cause I 'm am . My skin complexion is lighter than milk chocolate . Anyway hope this review helped . And do n't be shy , go ahead and order this product because you ca n't afford not to be good looking .
 I 've suffered from mild to moderate acne since my teens . I am 40 now and I finally see a light at the end of the tunnel . Like many of you , I 've spent so much time , emotion , energy and money looking for something ... anything ... that would help.I wash my face three times a day with salicylic acid acne cleanser and I 've been using this product for four minutes once a week . Then I use an AHA cream around my eyes for my fine lines . Blackheads gone , pores smaller and no pimples . My skin is much less oily . It is also causing my dark patches from previous pimples to fade.My partner was so impressed that he asked me to give him a peel!I am really impressed . I noticed the difference my very first time . If you are considering one of those acne programs like Proactive or Murad , please try this first . My skin has never looked better .
 Although this product scared me at first and can be quite drying , it still deserves all 5 stars . After my first time using it I noticed a much improved appearance -LRB- red acne marks faded , bumps diminished , etc. -RRB- . My skin has quickly and drastically improved - existing bumps reduced , no new bumps to speak of , oiliness solved , etc. . I even had a couple of pimples seem to , well ... fall off . I already feel much more confident . I am so glad I found this stuff !!
 I am so happy I bought this . I saw improvements right away in how much smoother my skin looks . I 've worked my way up to the full eight minutes , and the burning is n't to terrible.I highly suggest instead of buying a PH stabilizer , use baking soda . Baking Soda is a natural acid neutralizer . Way back in the day it was drank to help with heartburn -LRB- it tastes nasty by the way , but better than tums -RRB- . I make a paste out of it , and slash it on my face . For the first second it will burn like fire while its neutralizing , however after that all the burning will be gone.For moisturizer I use thick coco butter . Then during the rest of the week I combine the butter with Retinol cream . I wait a day after the treatment to put anything harsh on my face . Let me tell you your skin will itch after every treatment . It 's not a bad itch , it 's mild and wont last past the first day . All of this might vary for you . My skin is not sensitive at all due to years of worthless Acne treatments . I suggest giving this a try . Good luck to you !
 U can feel it work it burns.works pretty well.using it as spot treatment instead of a mask seems more pratical and works better for me .
 If you are like me , you have struggled with acne from the time you were a tween and well into your 20s . I have had acne since I was about 13 and have tried literally everything under the sun . I mean EVERYTHING . As a teen I went to our family physician and was given topicals . I have also tried every brand of acne abrasive soap , gentle soap , scrub , toners , lifters , tighteners , clay masks , rubbery peel masks , over the counter pills ... ect . I even tried doing nothing to my skin for an entire summer . No makeup , no special soap , just bare natural . You get the idea . I tried everything . Nothing worked!I had all of given up at ever having clear skin at the ripe ol' age of 25 . On a whim I decided to give it one more go . I hopped on Amazon and started looking for products that focused on evening skin tone rather than getting rid of acne -LRB- I was more or less convinced that I will simply never get rid of my acne -RRB- . In my search I stumbled across acid peels . I was very skeptical about using something so drastic and abrasive , but the customer reviews were raving about the product , so I decided to do a bit of research.The product is a bit pricy for purchasing on a whim , but I was desperate . Besides , I have spent 100s of dollars over the years on products that did n't work , so what is another $ 18 ? Right?I am very glad that I took that fateful chance . Using this product is still a love/hate relationship , but for the most part it is love . My skin is much more even toned since using it and it looks much more fresh and youthful . It is also the ONLY thing that will clear up my face with record speed.Now for the hate part - When using this product be mindful that your skin is going to look horrible for about a week after using it . I mean horrible ! It dries everything out and you will have very dry , flaky , gross skin that will make you want to hide in your house for 5 days.To combat the effects , I have a few pointers . Lotion , firming masks , rubbery peel masks , hot showers followed by rubbing the dead skin on your face , immediately followed by lotion . Oh , and liquid make up . Powders will just magnify the dry skin.Trust me , once all of the dead skin is gone , you 'll love how fresh and beautiful your skin looks . It is worth the effort .
 This product is really great.But BE CAREFULI have been consistently using once a week for about two months now and I still do n't use it past a minute and 30 seconds.Rinse with A LOT OF WATERMy skin definitely looks way brighter and clearer with this though : -RRB-
 I had finally resigned myself to Acutane - this was my last attempt before going to the dermatologist to get started and it works GREAT . Absolutely incredible , and my acne problems were fairly severe . Almost completely gone in 2 weeks .
 This product does what it says it would . Definitely would recommend this product to friends . Took about 2 weeks for my skin to clear up completely
 This product works exactly how it says it will ! If you have serious skin problems then you should not play with this stuff at home . If you just want to do some light peels or use it for spot acne treatment ... then this is your product . Note that it is a chemical and it can burn your skin if you are not careful or do not do your research before you use this product . I have had not issues with it but I can see where people could go wrong !
 This is an effective product . If you know your skin 's trends , you should apply this following the directions on the insert before you usually have breakouts as well as any time you have a breakout because this treats mine . First bottle is almost done and lasted a few months ; WILL order a second soon . Only downside is this sucker STINGS ! So have something to do to distract yourself for a few minutes . It also stings pretty bad whenever I wash it off with water ; I do n't stop rinsing until all the stinging goes away . For some reason , the first few times I used this product it did n't sting as bad , but maybe that 's because when you have a breakout it stings more or maybe even with your skin during different seasons ... DOES work as advertised though ! Would recommend because let 's face it , if you 're interested in a product like this , you will do anything to get rid of acne , including taking on some facial stinging ; -RRB-
 Seems to be helping and I love the fact that it is n't white colored -LRB- like the kind you buy in the local drugstore ! -RRB-
 I ordered this item through knottyboy.com , and could n't be happier ! Dreadlocks really need to be kept clean and especially free of residue from soaps and hair care products , and this bar shampoo is made of all natural ingredients that clean dreads well and wash out easily . Plus , it smells fantastic - peppermint essential oils instead of synthetic perfumes . You wo n't regret buying it , and keep in mind that knottyboy also makes liquid shampoo that is similarly all-natural and residue-free !
 This is the best make-up with sunscreen I 've ever used . I 've tried many , but this one provides the best protection from the sun .
 Excelente , mercadoria no prazo , em perfeito estado , o vendedor muito atencioso , forma de pagamento correta . Sem problemas com a mercadoria ou com o vendedor .
 I have been using this product for about 3 years . As a skin cancer survivor I want the highest SPF I can find . Plus I like the coverage - looks good and feels light .
 This is a very good product to protect our skin from the sun ! It was recommended by my doctor , I recomend !
 The only issue is that it does n't moisturize and ends up feeling dry to the touch . Too bad it 's not one of those anti-aging foundations .
 Shiseido Sun Protection Liquid Foundation SPF 42 is wonderful ! Light , fragrance free and buildable for more coverage . It looks natural and lasts all day . I appreciate the high SPF included since I have lupus and must wear sunscreen .
 this is a first time that i use this product . . It was great for my skin and make me feel like I have a good skin ...
 I found that it looked like they were going to be discontinuing this product at my local store so when I found it here online I decided to stock up . The color is a light pink with a touch of shimmer and in a gloss form . I hope I 'm wrong in that they are not discontinuing but it seems lately that every color or fragrance that I love gets nixed .
 I 've used this for 2 + years now . It was so convinient to be able to find it online & not have to search through racks at the drugstore .
 Used a number of years and can no longer find in the stores . Adds a light color to the lips and nice shine , but does n't stay on very long .
 The seller sent item as described and promptly I would purchse from this seller again , Thank you and I appreicate the promptness .
 I have been using this lipstick for a long time . I love it . My favorite color is the pink lightning .
 If I 'm just running to the grocery store I do n't necessarily feel the need for full makeup and lipstick . This lip glide -LRB- which I thought was discontinued because the local shops do n't sell it anymore -RRB- is a great consistency and the Sheerly Burgundy is the perfect natural color for my corpselike lips . It makes the lips look healthy and gives you a bit of a finished look without having to go with the full color lipstick . Highly recommended . I have used Subscribe & Save because I do n't want to run out of it !
 I agree with what most of the reviewers have said , but want to add that in my opinion the color is not pink at all , it is more a brownish/plum/coppery color .
 Why does everything I love get discontinued ? Well , this is a great lipstick , the color is fabulous and it leaves your lips shiny , but not lip gloss poppin shiny . NOT long wearing , but very easy to apply , just click and go .
 You cant find this lipwtick hardly anywhere . I found it , you shipped it immediately and thanks !
 I have been searching for a lip product that would go on and feel like a gloss , but look like a lipstick for , what seems like , forever . I almost ca n't believe that I found it ! I get so many compliments on my lips now . I am horrible at putting on lipstick , and gloss was never enough color for me . So , this product is perfect for people like me . Yay !
 This product actually works . No more itchy , flaky scalp . I 've only used the shampoo but if the other products work as well , I would be very impressed . Thanks for producing a product that actually lives up to it 's advertisement .
 This shampoo is fantastic . I have struggled with sebhorric dermatitis for years and whatever worked would only work for a short period of time and then I would have to find something new . Numerous visits to the dermatologist with the same results . To make matters worse as I got older and needed to dye my hair all the dandruff shampoos stripped the color . Dermazinc cleared my scalp completely , I have been using it for a year and it still works great ! My hairdresser took the name of it to recommend to other clients as she could n't believe the difference and it does n't effect my hair color at all . Could n't be happier with the product .
 Ive been using this along with the Dermazinc Face cream and it works like nothing else . Had a hard time controlling my dermatitis , so i decided to give this stuff a shot . Works great . May take a few days to acclimate to -LRB- with face cream and shampoo , had minor raise is itchiness , but after a few days , it went away and my face cleared up and stayed clear along with my scalp . I attributed the itchyness to my skin finally healing . I even use the shampoo on my facial hair and it works great there also . So if ya have tried everything else out there , try this . It works !!
 I tried others but this worked for me the best but everyone is different so just try it for a month .
 Ordered this for my Dad , it 's actually cheaper to buy through Amazon than through the manufacturing company in Maine . What 's up with that ? This stuff works great if you have severe dandruff . Dad 's been using it for years .
 If you want lashes that stay curled , this is the one to use . BUT it will glop up if you use too much . I use this as a base layer and then Kiss Me mascara as the second coat .
 Believe me ... I 've tried out many mascara 's before finding this one . In my opinion it beats out Dior.The product itself is excellent quality ... goes on smoothly and does n't budge after it 's on . I 've slept with it on as well -LRB- am sure to get in trouble over that ! -RRB- Since I live in the southwest , I 'd have racoon eyes if I did n't use waterproof mascara and eyeliner and this is absolutely the best.The brush is a bit unusual if you are expecting one of those big , fluffy ones . It 's skinny and does take some getting used to but it also makes it easier to get at all the lashes.You will need a good eye makeup remover though ... it does not come off easily because of it 's staying power . I find that Neutrogena 's eye makeup remover does a great job on this mascara
 This was the best eyelash mascara I have ever purchased , made my eyelashes long without curling them and the mascara never smeared , it took baby oil to get off but was great when on .
 I was never a fan of using mascara because they never did anything to my lashes . My lashes stick straight down , very short and sparse , but this mascara hold my lashes curled all day ! It can be a bit clumpy if you use too much , try using mascara that helps separate your lashes , then on top , use this mascara and you 'll get perfect lashes ! : -RRB-
 The product is what I wanted and expected but the marketplace vendor did nothing to get the order to me in a reasonable amount of time . Next time , I will buy it from another source .
 This is the best make-up with sunscreen I 've ever used . I 've tried many , but this one provides the best protection from the sun .

 Worked great for my seborrheic dermatitis . I was having a rough time with spots on my eyes and forehead . After I switched to this cream + cetaphil cleaner twice a day , I got all cleared . It took a few week and was stinging in the beginning , but now it 's great . + it 's OTC , so it feels safer than ketoconazole -LRB- which stopped working for me anyway -RRB- . I strongly recommend the product .
 I worry about skin atrophy with the use of steroids to control sehorbic dermatitis . Im not sure of the effects of this according to data , but I not only do not have any more problems , my skin is back to the way it was before over 15 years ago . Best thing that I have found anywhere .
 This is probably one of 50 or more creams I bought for my condition . I have perioral dermatitis and was given antibiotics . After three weeks antibiotics did nothing . I already am on a gluten and dairy free diet , which by the way is root cause of this problem . They say it is from fluoride or chloride , but realistically it is from allergens . If you have any dermatitis change your diet . Then use this , and watch your dermatitis disappear . I ca n't say enough about this product . I will recommend this to perfect strangers w dermatitis . We have all been lied to about food . My father died of cancer from gluten allergy . Cancer is a big secret that the medical association wants to hide . Look down at your plate and really look at what you eat . You are being poisoned by big corporations . Sorry about rant , but I feel like I have to tell everyone.Thanks fo reading , even though I went off topic .
 I suffer from Seborrhoeic dermatitis on my forehead . I 've visited quite a few dermatologist and tried many prescription creams and well as over the counter creams and nothing worked . I purchased this cream over 3 weeks ago and I ca n't begin to explain how much better my skin feels and looks . The cream does exactly what it says , it stopped my itching , stopped my flaking , and stopped my inflammation . It reduced my breakouts and overall my skin looks 80 % better . I know there is no cure for SD , but this cream does a wonderful job of keeping all the pesky symptoms of SD at bay and I can function without worrying about the condition of my skin ... love , love , love .
 This is the best product I have found for the psoriasis on my scalp and nearly makes the psoriasis on my elbows disappear . But as with all psoriasis products , I have to keep purchasing it because it never goes away .
 I have had minor eczema on my hand for years . I have used prescription medications which would help but they seemed to all be oil-based and I did n't like the feel or getting oily residue on clothes , etc. . I was given DermaZinc as a sample at a medical conference . I LOVE it ! It is not oily , but like a nice lotion . BEST of all , it completely resolved all signs of eczema after using for a few weeks . Now I us it occasionally when the area starts to look dry , probably every few weeks . I highly recommend it !
 After trying what felt like 100 's of different product to help with the psorasis on my legs , intense itching , dry skin , sores , etc. this cream has been a miracle for me . Used several prescriptions which did not help and cost hundreds of $ $ $ $ Found this online and gave it a try and ca n't say enough about how great it works . Use it after every shower and can put sunscreen over it . It has taken about 2 months to produce results but it works . I am a happy customer . 1 jar lasts about 1 month if you use it everyday and is very affordable .
 I 've had a rash on my face for more that 20 years . This product worked better to cure it than any of the others that I tried .
 It works wonders for seborrheic dermatitis . I use small amount in my face every day and do n't have to worry about seborrheic dermatitis .
 I was not sure if it would work but it does . I use it on my face and my scalp .
 Given as a gift to work on a skin condition . She has n't told me how well it works but have faith in this product .
 When you use this cream along with the DermaZinc soap you will see results almost instantly . The cream has worked wonders on my friend 's face . It 's totally worth trying out !
 Hey fellas , I do n't really know how often I should use this cream . I got flaky eyebrows and they tend to get red.HELP ... thanks
 I 've been using the DermaZinc cream for three years now and it has made my life significantly less stressful . Brilliant researchers at Dermalogix somehow concocted a formula that effectively removes all my facial irritation and blemishes . Kudos to them ! I apply it every morning after showering and let it sink in for a while before heading out . It 's the only thing that works for my annoying face .
 I 've had a terrible problem with spontaneous cuts and irritated skin on my hands for years . Post-partum I also go psoriasis on the back of my neck . An MD prescribed this cream for both of the problems . It definitely helps put the fire out and stops the intense itching and is better than a steroid for your health . However , the real problem is an allergy , food or environmental , or deficiency of some kind - usually to healthy oils and omega 3 fatty acids . Throw out all of your vegetable oil -LRB- canola , soy and cottonseed -RRB- and switch to coconut , grapeseed , olive oils and butter . -LRB- see Dr. Mercola for more info -RRB- Barlean 's is a great brand for cod liver oil , fish oil , and flax seed oil which help a lot of skin problems . At this point I 'm thinking I 'm allergic to soaps and cleaners and any regular products my skin comes into contact with . My dentist had a similar skin problem for 20 years and got rid of it by switching to natural products - BioKleen for all cleaning and laundry and natural soaps and shampoos that are essential oil based - try Dr. Bronner 's or Young Living .
 I have seborrheic dermatitis and this works great for me and no fragrance to burn my skin . Dandruff shampoos often contain this active ingredient this has but the fragrances are very strong .
 I finally found this stuff after searching -- literally for more than a year -- for something that would take care of my flaking , yet oily skin . I thought I MIGHT have seborrheic dermatitis , but was never sure . I tried dandruff shampoo . Tried a multitude of exfoliators and enzymes . All I really needed was this . In a matter of a sheer TWO days of twice daily use my flaking totally disappeared . Have been using it for two weeks and have not had a problem with flaking skin since I started using it . It 's a basic moisturizer plus .25 % zinc pyrithione . I was told the reason this works and dandruff shampoo does n't is because you leave this on your skin , but obviously have to rinse off shampoo . Besides , dandruff shampoo on your face is a little harsh over time . It 's a little heavy going on , but it works . It totally disappears on the skin once it absorbs . It might be a little heavy for acne-prone skin but it 's still worth trying . This stuff does contain some heavier moisturizers -- and It DOES contain a small amount of lanolin . I only ever use a tiny amount -LRB- less than a pea size for my whole face -RRB- . I use this around my nose , upper lip , chin , under eye area and above my eyebrows . Wish I had heard about this two years ago . Godsend
 I use this product and it is great ! I use it for my seborrheic dermatitis on my face-and if I use dermazince I just do n't get it . In the beginning you do have to use it 1-2 times a day to resolve it-but then 3-4 times a week keeps it at bay . It is a miracle .
 I 've been using this since January 2010 and it has been great for me . Nothing else worked on my dermatitis . I use it a few times per week and my face has remained clear for over a year.Update
 So everyone always says they have tried every product until they find the one that works . Well it feels like that seriously . For the past 5 years I 've had an oily face that was prone to explosions of SD . It was embarrassing to say the least . I 've used loads of different moisturizers , creams , shampoos , treatments . Washing my face and hair with H&S ; was the most effective way to keep the explosions at bay , but I would still have an oily face with a reddish complexion . well this is the best treatment I have used to date.I 'm sure it 's not a cure but there is no cure . I apply this to my face at night after my shower . The next morning I splash my face with some cold water just to get the night off and that is it . My skin is not oily at all . my complexion back to the way it was before this whole mess started and no explosions to speak of yet . All I can say is I wish I would have tried this product 5 years ago . So give it a try . It 's really not that expensive and it will last a long time .
 My husband started suffering from red and frequently flaking skin while in college and finally went to a dermatologist once he had graduated , got a job , and had health insurance . He was diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitis and got an Rx for the typical creams . It worked fine , it was greasy and left his skin greasy as well , but it did clear up the flaking though not all the redness . Flash forward a few years and I saw this product and read the reviews . I figured it was worth a try . He started using it a few months ago and we 're both amazed at the results . No more flaking , his skin is even in tone and he has no more redness at all , it smells much better than the Rx cream , and absorbs into his skin very nicely without that greasy feeling . We hope they make this product forever ! Highly recommend this for seborrheic dermatitis .
 I 'm 21 years old now . And throughout my teen life till now , my skin dries up real quick and I get super itchy . I get acne on my body real bad , and I 've used tons of creams to soothe my itchiness because I would scratch my acne and I would bleed and get spots . But now Since I bought this product , it really works and helps my itchiness . I stopped itching after using this product . It works better than any kind of cream you would buy at the store . I really recommend this product , if your body itches a lot . This product will stop your itchy problems away ! HAHA ! :-RRB- Good luck !
 I am a candida sufferer and have had this problem for half a century.More recently I 've been able to control and reduce it through a variety ofmeans . The downside was some of it migrated to my hands . I was advised of manythings and had limited success on my skin / hand eruptions untill I tried derma-Zink . It worked like majic and cured my hands in one or two days . And it has n'tcome back . Truly amazing ! Did not help on feet however .
 I could not find anything at the store for for facial seb . dermatitis . It is great for flaky skin around nose , cheeks , eyebrows , etc. . I tried all kinds of lotion but to no avail nothing helped . When my face got wet , as soon as it dried it would get flaky . Very frustrating . This worked by the second day of using it . I do n't even use t daily and it has worked . In the past , ketoconazole seemed to help a little in the past , but never really cleared it up totally . This has worked perfectly !
 Hey guys . I must say ... this stuff worked for me . Really have worsening dermatitis -LRB- dandruff on my face ... according to my Dr -RRB- on my face , head , beard , scalp ... was getting mortifyingly embarassing . I use this stuff a couple times a week when i get out of the shower on my face , head , neck , beard . I even use it as a hair gel and leave it in my hair/scalp all day ... NO MORE FLAKING/REDNESS/SORES !! Didnt have much hope , as scrips and over the counter products didnt work for me . It has 98 % cleared everything up ! Hope it lasts ! Yes , i can see it stinging and reddening some peoples skin temporarily -LRB- although it didnt mine -RRB- . And im very sorry to those who didnt find relief with this product -LRB- try it in a small area , at first -RRB- . But i must say ... even though it is a bit pricey at $ 19 for a 4oz jar , its is soooooo worth it to me . I dont have to go to work looking like i have herpes or somthing !! I also rotate two DHS shampoos -LRB- zinc and tar -RRB- , as well as use dead sea mineral sulfer soap occasionally . You got ta keep this auto-immune flare ups on their toes and rotate your ammo !! That said , this product worked alone , without additional products . But i know my skin ... it is sneaky !! ... so i rotate other products with it to keep my skin guessing . Good luck , and much sympathy/empathy to those who continue to struggle to find help !!
 The packaging of the cream is really flimsy . The jar popped out from the inner layer after the first time I used it , making it really hard to open and close.However , cream inside works pretty well.On contact , it makes my skin really red , which goes away after a couple of hours , but it clears up the other symptoms.I would recommend it for those people who ca n't find ZNP bars and want a cream substitute . I like it better than the Noble Formula soap that I also purchased .
 I bought this cream for my husband and it has n't gotten an outbreak ever since.We are very happy with the results it 's been over a month and his skin is clear .
 Good stuff , works awesome wth DermaZinc soap as well . The Soap to take the flakes off , the cream to keep them off . The cream soaks into your skin , works very well . I recommend to anyone !
 suffered with psoriasis for years mainly plaque psoriasis of elbows i have found derma zinc to be as good if not better than most presciption drugs as a physician i have tried them all may benefit from addition of clobetasol initially but once under control the derma zinc is good for maintenance
 I have psoriasis and this has kept it under control for 2 years without needed Rx medications . I used the Rx to get it under control and I have been able to maintain control with this product . I did have a burning reaction when I applied it to an open area , but otherwise no other problem -LRB- and I have sensitive skin -RRB- .
 I have had the luxury of taking 3 baths with this product . It turns the water an ocean blue while the aroma has completely made all the stress from my day go away . I 'm not sure if it made me that much more tired since I 'm always sleepy after a long bath but I can definitely see it being effective if stress is something that keeps you from falling asleep .
 My husband swears by The Body Shop 's line of hemp products to help keep his super super super dry skin under control . This Hemp Body Butter is n't always part of his daily routine , but particularly during the winter months it often is . Like many body butters , this one contains both cocoa and shea butters -LRB- which is all Fair Trade -RRB- . It also has Babassu oil , which I ca n't claim to know much about , but is supposed to be a good , light , non-pore-clogging moisturizer . The hemp seed oil in this product is what really sets it apart . Like another reviewer noted , the hemp seed oil is really good for helping skin repair itself -LRB- either for disease-based problems like psoriasis or environmentally caused damage , like from dry air -RRB- and absorb moisture more effectively thanks to its incredibly high concentration of fatty acids.The only drawback about this product is a subjective one
 This was a Christmas present for my son-in-law , and I 'm hoping it soothes his psoriasis . He 's very fond of hemp in other forms ...
 This cream works wonders on my son 's psoriasis . The consistency is great , and a little goes a long way . The only drawbacks is the price is a little high , and the smell is not that great . . lol . . smells a little like stale beer . lol But the price is worth it to help my son 's skin .
 I love the BodyShop hemp body butter . It is awesome for very dry skin . I bought it because I was frequently in swimming pools as a swimming instructor and my skin was so dry and tight and almost painful because of the chlorine . No moisturizer i tried worked ... until i found the hemp body butter . It does n't have a very pleasant odour , however if you put it on right before bed , your skin is so nourished when you wake up . Just shower and go and your skin will still be perfect . Its also great for your hands and feet -LRB- I use cotton gloves or socks after I put it on -RRB- . If you have extremely dry skin due to chlorine , changing weather or for any other reason , I highly recomend this product ! plus the body shop uses quality , fairly-traded ingredients .
 This smells wonderful , very herbally , and hydrates dry skin well . It also comes in a pretty big container , so it is not a bad deal . Will buy again .
 A perfect match for my skin tone . I do not need a base , I just apply and it is not dry nor is it shiny . I am extremely happy .
 I used this makeup previously and I love it . It is one of the few that actually matches my complexion . The stores in my area sold it at a lower price ; however , none of these stores carry `` Rich Tan - No. 11 '' any longer . It 's nice to know I can get it thru Amazon .
 Originally , My dad had one of these and I would always steal it . Finally , he drove me to Sally 's Beauty Supplies and I paid $ 50 for my own . Let me tell you , it was one of the best investments I have ever made . He got his years before I did and his still works like new . Previously , I had bought a few different trimmers at marshalls and wal mart , the Peanut dwarfs the competition . The blades have not noticeably dulled and the power is still the same . I have even shaved my entire head with 3-4 inches of hair with this thing . It is truly a bite-sized beast.It comes with lubricating oil , a cleaning brush , and 4 different sized brush guards for different precision styling . I only use this for my face and for trimming my chest . The blade by itself will almost shave your face and you will barely have any noticeable hairs showing . So , if you needed a quick shave but didnt have the time , these are absolutely perfect . Also , these clippers do not require countless passes over the same area , they cut EXTREMELY well . They are also very easy to meanuever and are able to make those precise cuts in tough to reach spots that larger sized clippers can not . And yeah , it will heat up , but only under very , very heavy use . If it is really an issue -LRB- its not for me -RRB- , then simply give the blade a quick dip in water , dry it , and your good to go.When you purchase this Peanut , you will never even think about another pair of grooming clippers . Personally , I will have one of these for my entire life , they are simpy the best . I highly recommend paying the extra money for this great product . Do not be fooled by the size or the name , it is a lawnmower of a trimmer .
 trimmer works great and does well to donate to a great cause . Shopped fast , absolutely no probs
 I found this product to work great . Small and convenient to use . Shipping and handling was extremely quick and effecient .
 my wifes in cosmetology school and hse was needing a small peanut for school and this worked great for what she was needing it for
 I like how its so small and not real noisy . I would recommend this to anyone who needs a trimmer for your puppies . I like the pink color too . If you are looking at buying a trimmer , buy this one ... you wo n't be disappointed at all .
 My hairdresser uses these clippers and I had to have them . I was even more excited when I saw that they came in pink . They are great for touch-up 's and cut very close . My only complaint is that it is kind of loud . The cord is pretty long , too , which helps .
 The machine is very cute and is perfect for my daughters hand . Is very precise and lightweight . And it 's pink !
 Very nice clipper . Great price -LRB- I checked a lot of websites and beauty supply stores -RRB- very sharp and comes with accessories too ! Love it !
 This has got to be the best Antibacterial hand soap I have ever used . It works well as a soap . I think the thing I like best is the Scent . It has a clean , crisp , sent and smells like a hospital .
 I have been wearing this perfume for years ! It smells like soft powder and , so far , even people with allergies to perfume are n't allergic to this one ! I always get compliments on it . I was heartbroken when it became so scarce . Now I ca n't find any of the other items in the line . I have the powder , shower gel , lotion , and a travel set . Wish it would become popular again so it would be available more !
 I never in a million years would have spent this much money on any fragrance BUT the first time I ever smelt this was on a sample paper with the fragrance on it . I walked around the house with the paper on my nose and my family told me to just go ahead and buy it , so I did . I absolutly love this fragrance . The first time I bought it , it was 100 dollars now I just paid 164 dollars for it but I still love it , well worth it .
 I got ta say that I 've spent thousands on beauty/skin care products . Fancy moisturizers , blah blah . I LOVE THIS STUFF . It is now the only moisturizer I use . I have sensitive skin that breaks out easily AND gets dry/flaky easily . This stuff does n't break me out , can be applied in seconds , dries in a minute or two - I just love it . If you 've read that glycerin can be bad for your skin , do some more research . Vegetable glycerin is very good for your skin - and hair . It can even be used as a leave-in conditioner . The smell is heavenly . I 've purchased 3 or 4 cases just so I wo n't run out . Ca n't recommend highly enough !
 Product is exactly what it says it is . Perfect condition . A lovely scent . Really smells like actual roses and not processed chemicals .
 Use it everyday after washing your face . This is an old fashioned beauty trick-that really works ! So much cheaper than the fancy brands and much more efective
 Great item . Packaging not so much . The cap was not securely closed/taped causing leakage and product loss . Other than issues with packaging , the product performed as it should .
 This smells so great and fresh . I still have a small bottle of this from about 5 yrs ago and it does n't have much scent left . I use this to pray on my face for a nice pick me up . Smells nice in the hair as well !
 Now part of my nightly ritual . I spray it on my face and I 'm done ! The next morning no dry skin and nothing to scrub off .
 Lovely scent in a generous size for a wonderful price makes this superior smelling product a must have for the lover of all things lavender .
 i love this , i carry it in my purse and spray to keep moisterized and anytime i need a wake me up , its better than going for the candy dish in the afternoon , very refreshing and smells good , has n't gone rancid and ive had the same bottle for a while now , i even spray the boys in my office : -RRB-
 smells great and goes on clean . I use it as a toner and also in my homemade vitamin c serum . Love the way it smells and it is easily absorbed . Would order again , just love the smell of it .
 For starters , these are pure ingredients . Nothing artificial . It 's a great finish to your makeup . Spray lightly , and your ` face ' will stay looking good all day . After you 've finished your nightly facial cleansing routine , spray . Spray anytime you or your skin needs a pick-me-up . If you do n't have time to do your hair , spray it and your style will refresh and your hair will smell wonderful.If you 're interested in learning more about this and other Heritage products , check out the ARE on Route 60 in Virginia Beach , VA. .

 Bobbi Brown Creamy ConcealerI am very pleased with this concealer . It goes on so smooth does not crease under the eye and covers what you want concealed . I would highly recommend to anyone . Sandy
 I have used this Arden product for several years.Great eye shadow and lip colors as well as pressed powder . I was pleased to see that Amazon now had this product .
 I 'm so happy to have this product again ! It was really hard to come by for a long time due to distribution issues . I have bad allergies , and a warm bath with this lovely `` natural '' product really does help my sinuses!It 's also wonderful for a head cold ! The smell is very concentrated so you do n't need much at all . It 's nice to be able to get this product again ! No wonder it 's been around for so long !
 This is one of my favorite sents ! It 's not to sweet and can be worn anytime of the day ! : -RRB-
 I ca n't live without this product , especially in the summer . I play tennis , so I want a foundation that wo n't run off my face . It goes on smoothly , gives great coverage and somehow manages to appear `` sheer . '' Added benefit
 This stick is so creamy , glides easily on the skin , and it does n't look cakey at all . I make few strokes and then blend with my finger . I wear ochre and it 's more for yellow undertones . Even though the stick is tiny I need the smallest amount of any foundation I 've ever tried . It looks oily and shiny , I use a bit of powder on my T-zone . Got ta love SPF30 too ! I wear it sometimes when I go to swim to protect face -LRB- it 's water resistant -RRB- and to cover imperfections and it looks great , very natural .
 Unable to buy this in the UK , I searched the web and found it in the US . It has been my best skin care product for years with a massive 35 protection factor . I am fair and travel to a lot of hot places . I have not allowed the sun on my face for 30 years -LRB- winter or summer -RRB- but at the same time I like my makeup . This is a tinted sunscreen which doubles as a foundation/sunscreen . It works and shows and I am always being taken for at least 15 years younger than I actually am . Love it .
 Thanks to this stick . Goes on much easier than comparable brands that you 'll find at surf shops , but more importantly , it really keeps the sun off of you . The peace of mind of getting to surf for as long as I like without worrying about getting burnt is worth every penny . Works even better if you apply a liberal base layer of normal sunscreen first , and put the Shisheido on top . Love it .
 I ve used this product for years and it s always been of excellent quality . I recommend it to everyone , as makeup and as protection , it works both ways .
 I am a Caucasian male who lives in the desert . Because of my continual exposure to sun , I have skin damage on the ridge of my nose . I was looking for a tinted sunscreen product that I could dab on this area that would both protect it from the sun and cover up the redness . This product is perfect for my needs , covers up without looking like makeup , and is helping to repair the damage . FYI `` beige '' is the appropriate color you want to order if you are Caucasian .
 This stuff really works . My skin tans , but I get freckles . I put this stuff on and am not much worse for wear after a long session at Rincon .
 I read on surfers 's forums that this Shiseido sun stick works great . It works very well and matched my super fair skin pretty well - my husband 's slightly less fair skin , not so much . However , it seems to keep us from burning . It does rub off easily so you have to be careful to not touch your face much . I wish it was just a little more difficult to get off . I had to reapply many times . It did not work well for snorkeling . With the mask going on and off , the sun protection just rubbed right off . I got burned that day .
 3 months ago my esthetician recommended Sothys Immuniscience Fluid , and my skin just loves it . When I look in the mirror I see skin that glows . My foundation glides on and stays fresh all day . It 's a bit more expensive than the average moisturizer but worth it at twice the price . I 'd tried everything out there but I will never bother with anything else . Just the smallest dollop morning and evening keeps my skin soft and smooth . Besides , I like having better skin at 42 than I did at 35 !
 This is the best scent ever . I could n't believe it when I 've found this fragrance for under $ 100 . I 've tried it at SAKS but the price was ownership-prohibitive and I could n't justify it . And here it is , I own it now : - -RRB- The bottle is small , only 1oz , but the scent is heavenly . Like you are walking through some Victorian garden . So fresh and floral . Not one of those grandma flowery scents , but really fresh , girly one . And at the same time high end . Ahhh ... will go spray some more .

 Blue Lizard certainly blocks all sun rays . My dermatologist recommended it and I have bought this for every member of my family . If you are prone to pre cancerous skin lesions , this is an essential for every trip to the beach or pool .
 This quick dry nail top coat is amazing . I can not do my nails without it . I am usually in a hurry or almost ready to go to bed when it 's time to do my nails . This product somehow dries your nails very quickly so that you do n't have to worry about that quick bump or end up with `` bedsheet '' finish in the AM . I really could n't believer how it lived up to its ' promise . I even purchased a small travel size to take with me when I travel ! You will not be disappointed .
 A perfect match for my skin tone . I do not need a base , I just apply and it is not dry nor is it shiny . I am extremely happy .

 This SHAMPOO IS SO GREAT ! IT LEAVES THE HAIR SO SOFT SILKY AND LEAVES THE HAIR WITH A GREAT SLIP . IF USING A REGIME USE THIS FIRST THEN FOLLOW UP WITH A MOISTURING CONDITIONING SHAMPOO !
 This is the first Shiseido product I 've ever tried . May I say , it 's simply amazing ! It smells so good , and the gel leaves my skin really soft . It also has this cooling effect , which feels unbelievably nice in the hot summer weather . I 've only used this product during the humid summer months . Do n't know if it 's sufficient for the dry winter days though .
 I 'm using this lotion for 2 weeks now and can tell my skin is much smoothier . At first it 's cooling sensation was a little ackward but I got used to it . Have n't seen cellulite reduce effect yet .
 I do n't need this anymore but it was a lifesaver when I was in hot , humid weather and going through hot flashes . It goes on easily to control the shine without clogging pores or making skin feel too dry in any way . Topped with a dusting of powder or not you 're good to go all day despite the weather or your hormones .
 I can get tan on other areas of my body but my chest area always burns unless I put on some heavy-duty lotion . Shiseido 's , unlike other highly protective sunscreens , does go on smoothly and absorbs with no heaviness . It 's a pleasure to use . And it protects from UVA and UVB rays . It 's the first pleasant lotion I 've used where I did n't burn a bit . And it 's water resistant and sweat-proof too .
 I have fair skin and always use sunscreen . I bought this because I like the Shiseido makeup . I also bought the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Liguid 55 at the same time . The Shiseido is a little greasy . It does n't absorb as fast as I 'd like it too . I like the Neutrogena better is absorbs quickly and does n't feel sticky . This sunscreen does the job , definately keeps your skin safe from the sun but it is a little greasy .
 I 've been using it for a year and like it . It 's smooth and well absorbed .
 Good afternoon I would inform them that the item was received in perfect conditions , and they estimated the time , so I give the maximum score . thanks
 It was very convenient to reorder Dior lipstick through Amazon.com ; I could not find the lipstick in any of the department stores here.Glenna
 I gave this as one of the gifts for my daughter . I could not afford a big bottle , but she loved it because it is her favorite and it is small enough to carry in her purse . The presentation is beautiful , fitting for the quality of the product . Oh yeah , and the best part is it came with a sampler vile and I kept it for my self . : - -RRB-

 Bristles are stiff , as they should be for getting under the nails . Well made , have had mine for 3 years now -- and no shedding . Compact enough to stay where you put it and , by the way , its natural bristles are superior for your skin than any nylon .
 I bought this product R130 dark Copper , I am a red head and because of the multicolor in the piece it blended beautifully . I get complements all the time now.As far as the above comment about the piece being to large for her head . I had the same problem but that can quickly be resolved . A customer just has to shorten it by safety pinning or sewing the wefts together . This shortens the length of the piece.As far as the reviews on this product about drying out on other seller reviews . Our hair naturally oils or lubricates itself . This product and all other hair extensions need to be oiled with a oil sheen .
 The R130 Dark Copper was the closest I could figure to what my hair color actually is . When I received it , the extension is actually a few shades darker but it 's the same hue and so it blends in very nicely . My only problem is that my hair is about two or three inches too long for this to look natural . I had hoped it would just add some extra body to my hair and not look so unnatural but it appears that I 'm going to have to cut my hair before using this out in public . Not a big deal as three inches is virtually nothing when you have hair as long as mine but it does mean that I 'll have to keep getting my hair cut much more often than I normally do -LRB- I am lazy like that -RRB- . I am waiting until after my haircut and after using this a few times , to see if buying the straight version might be something I 'd like as well . I have really thick hair as it is but I figure you can never ever have too much hair !
 I am an inpatient person , so waiting for my hair to grow back is maddening . I had heard a lot of good things about the JS extensions and for the price decided to give it a try . They look amazing and I was able to easily dye my hair to match perfectly . My only warning is that if you chose to use heat tools , definitely do as directed . Also , once you use heat tools , you wo n't be able to get back the original curl . It can be re-curled , but it wo n't be the same . But I 'm still really happy with them . Everyone thinks it 's my real hair .
 Alright , so here 's the deal . I am terrible with hair . I ca n't do anything right with hair . Instead of putting these in the way I 'm suppose to I just slap it on top and through on a hat . Nobody can tell the difference . It looks great and I 've certainly gotten my money 's worth . It 's finally starting to get frizzy , but no doubt it 's from my own doing . Thank you .
 I have bought this same product now for over a year and absolutely love it . I just came from a women 's meeting and they could n't believe it was n't my own hair . I brought the piece to my hairdresser and she matched my haircolor to it . I just ran into someone I have n't seen in years and that was the first thing she said ... Your hair looks great.I also got the pony tail product . I was using another brand , but wanted to try this one since it is the same exact color I have chocolate copper . That way I do n't always have to wear the full hair . What I did so I do n't have to cut my hair to blend is to take my hair and pull it back with a pretty clip in the back . It looks lovely . I would like to wear it down like in the pic , but my hair tends to frizz and the hairdo piece is not frizzy . I use the hair u product as a leave in conditioner.I am trying to grow my hair long , but it will likely be another year or more before it even comes close to looking as good as this ! For the price , it ca n't be beat !!
 My hair is thin and I have always dreamed of long beautiful hair ! I actually got this to wear with my mermaid halloween costume and it blends right into my hair perfectly -LRB- I had my hair highlighted to match the extension -RRB- ... . If you did n't know that I did n't have long beautiful hair , you would n't know I was wearing Jessica 's extensions !!! The piece is very easy to put on and I ca n't wait to find a reason to wear it again . I actually ordered the 15 &#34; one to wear for special occasions . It is a more believable length for me to wear than the 23 &#34; . It is a very good design and I found it to be easy to wear and a lot of fun .
 Just wore the piece last night looked fabulous !! Soo natural !! I 'm definitely happy with my investment !! Love the piece !!! Thanks
 One of my favorite scents and can be very difficult to find in stores - at least in my market . Amazon comes to the rescue again !
 This product does exactly what it says it does . But to my surprise it does even a little more . I thought it would just paint the scalp but the colored powder actually attaches to the hair strands making them appear thicker . Very cheap . and effective .
 I was amazed at how well this covered my thinning hair . I wish it was a powder spray instead though because this makes the hair stiff .
 Works better than I expected , was able to cover the `` pink scalp '' areas in front and top with NO mess or problem
 I USED THIS ON MY WIG BECAUSE MY HAIR COLOR HAS CHANGED - THANK YOU TO THE BUYER AS THIS WAS A QUICK SHIPMENT - I AM SORRY TO SAY THIS BUT I HAVE WRITTEN 3 TIMES TO SAY THANK YOU AND AMAZON MUST BE HAVING PROBLEMS - HOWEVER TO OTHER PEOPLE WANT TO USE THIS PRODUCT IT IS GOOD . THANK YOU SELLER A + + + + + + + - SORRY I HAD TO REWRITE THIS FOR THE 3RD TIME - P , S , THE SHIPMETN WAS FAST
 Arrived on time . No problems with anyting . So glad I was able to find it because I was not able to purchase it anywhere else .
 Both Aqua Quorum and Polo Sport were colognes released in 1994 and smell extremely similar . Does not smell like Cool Water or Aqua Di Gio like another reviewer mentioned . Anyhow , Aqua Quorum smells fresh and clean but without smelling synthetic or like laundry detergent . Natural and invigorating with an almost carbonated feel , give this stuff a try . Especially good for office wear or in the summer . Around $ 15 shipped , unbeatable deal .
 My husband love the scent ... and I enjoy it too ! We 've been great fans of Aqua Quorum for more than 10 years .
 Aqua Quorom is a very nice cologne . However , anyone whose been around fragrances will immediately recognize this cologne as Cool Water 's long lost twin . It is amazingly reminiscent of Cool Water , and Acqua Di Gio also . That is not to say it is a bad smell . Its dry down is very nice ; clean and fresh is what you 're left with . Aqua Q is very nice for invoking rememberances of summer all year long . This little known fragrance , along with others from the House of Puig , can be had for a great price . In this economy , that is not to be taken lightly .
 Miyake 's Body Lotion has the same intriguing scent as his perfume , and serves as a nice prelude to wearing the fragrance.Imagination and innovation are hallmarks of designer Issye Miyake . Born in Hiroshima where he was a student of graphic design -LRB- think his `` Pleats Please '' line -RRB- , he later moved to Paris where he worked for Guy Laroche and Hubert de Givenchy.In the late 1960s he moved to New York and the salon of Geoffrey Beene . Just a short jump from there to opening his own studio two years later . The rest is couture history and today his clothing is worn by the very fashionable.Miyake brought the same exuberance to the creation of his fragrance that he brought to his designs . While it is a floral essence , it is enhanced with a variety of flower scents
 I have been using this product for over 15 years ! This was prior to the internet and I remember staying up to the middle of the night to call Australia to order this item !!! This is by far the silkiest finish for your make-up . The base is rice powder . I especially like taking a gentle amount on the tip of my index finger and gently placing it on the under-eye region . This helps diminish fine lines as well as brightens dark circles . Every person that I have introduced to this product raves about it . The company has other skin care and make-up lines but the powder is a must have . This also comes in a lavender scent . This product has anti-inflammatory effects . Go out and buy some today - you will toss all other powders away .
 This powder smells wonderful . The container is a bit small for the price -LRB- which I deducted a star for -RRB- but a little seems to go along way . I have pretty oily skin and it does seem to help delay the mid-day slick . It is completely colorless when applied so I do n't look orange later in the day and I do n't look cakey if I reaply . It face feels smooth instead of chalky . I do n't see myself moving on to another powder before this one is gone . When used over the Jurlique Day Care Face Oil you get a soft matte , luminous result . It 's definitely woth a try .
 What can smell more fresh and appealing than that sweet scent in the air after the rain ? Love captured that very feeling in this wonderful scent that was so popular many years ago . And , like many of the super fragrances created by this company , it is appealing to women of any age .
 I remember when Love came out with Rain , Wind and Fire fragrance sticks in the ' 70 's . Rain was the best of the bunchw with a light , almost cucumber scent . How nice to find a gift set for my high school girl friends ! This along with Love 's Lemon scent just takes me back to childhood . I love it . Great gift for a tween girl as well , that 's how light it is !
 I wish they would re-introduce the Rain . Every guy I met loved it ! I was disappointed when they discontinued the best of the three fragrances .
 A clean , fresh scent that lasts for hours . Until now , I have only been able to find the spray so this 2-pc . set is awesome .
 This is a heavy floral scent that I happen to love . It smells like bergamot , with a little rose scent . Very European , classy , and fine .
 I 've only been using this for 3 days or so ... but already my skin has been transformed ! You can actually FEEL it working almost the second you put it on your skin ! When you wake up in the morning having had it on all night your skin is nearly flawless and the softest I 've ever felt!I 'm so impressed with Therapy Systems in EVERY way !! Doniellevery acne prone combination skin -LRB- 26 years old and STILL breaking out , TS is the ONLY non-prescription that has worked for me ! -RRB-
 This stuff is awesome -- really produces a dramatic difference in the quality of my skin . I literally glow -LRB- in the best way -RRB- using this . It helps to exfoliate your skin and reveals the nicer skin underneath . I love this stuff . But I took one star away because in some bottles , after a while this loses its `` creaminess '' and becomes almost liquified . But it still works even in liquid form . It 's definitely the best product I 've used in that it makes such a difference in how my skin looks .
 While vacationing with friends , I noticed a woman walking around the house with one of the tubes of whitening solution . I asked what she was doing and she laughed and said just whitening my teeth . I asked about it and she told me she used this product . She is a smoker , coffee drinker and enjoyes red wine . Her teeth looked GREAT !! As soon as I arrived home - I placed MY order and have not been disappointed !! I do n't like the strips at all , they make my gums sensitive . This does not bother gums at all - you are applying with a little round sponge - to your teeth only !
 this is the second bar of soap I 've ordered from this company `` Pre de Provence '' -LRB- the first was the sage scent -RRB- . once again , impressed with this soap which lightly exfoliates the skin , leaving a nice scent behind.very large bar of soap , will last a long time in your shower.try their other soaps as well , they have many different type of scents . * highly recommended *
 I love the smell of this product . It perfumes my bathroom very softly and pleasently .
 I ordered several different brands of the same type of soap -LRB- Almond or Honey Almond -RRB- and Pre de Provence was by far the best for the price . The bars are at least twice as large as other brands for the same price or less . The soap -LRB- triple milled -RRB- is very hard and long lasting . It feels very nice and does n't leave any residue . Smells great too !
 Love the smell of this product and I feel so clean after using it . I purchased a bunch more of this brand , but different scents ... ca n't wait to try them
 This is a great product , high quality soap . the bar is so big ! So far i have had it for 3 weeks used everyday and still is bigger than the usual bar soaps i use . next up-sage !
 My sister turned me on to this soap . I used the bar she gave me and IT WORKED . I tested it for two weeks on one arm and then asked a friend to tell me if she could see a difference in the skin on my two arms . She picked the Pre de Provence arm immediately . Now I iuse it on both arms and my neck area . Would recommend it highly .
 I love the way it smells . It lasts a LONG time , which makes it worth the money IMO . It makes my bathroom even smell good !
 This Belson nail dryer works pretty well for 60-70 $ . It gets the job done & & helps me out a lot because I am so impatient waiting for nails to just naturally dry . I also used the nail dry spray product with the dryer to help speed up the process even quicker . I love the UV light option as well . It feels like you 're at a salon !
 The Profiles Spa Nail dryer works just as described . My only complaint would be that -LRB- unlike the salon dryers I 'm used to -RRB- you have to reset it every three minutes . There 's no way to set it for a longer cycle . Other than that -LRB- if you cycle it for about fifteen minutes -- 5 cycles -RRB- it works just fine .
 This unit replaces the Belson Profiles Spa Single Hand Nail Dryer P1013 . I am not the user . My girlfriend and her sister use it . With this unit , they can do both hands/feet at the same time . They are completely happy with it . It is used several times a week by both . They use it for touch-ups and top coating . The unit can be raised or lowered depending on the height needed for hands or feet . Read the directions . One of the indicater lights only comes on when unit is lowered or raised . I have forgotten , since I do n't use it .
 I have used this twice since I bought it . It works well , helps dry nails faster than nothing . The only potential concern I have is that the fan motor has a buzz and sounds really cheap . I hope they will honor the warranty if the fan motor breaks .
 Great nail dryer for the price . Have had several kinds over the years and this one ranks as one of the best .
 Bought this color luxorious pink a couple of years ago . So hard to find a shade you love and was thrilled to find it at Amazon . Great price and fast delivery . Thanks
 jAs an aesthetician , this is a godsend when short on finances to open my own account withdecleor . The balm essential is a basic must have for skincare , and the price is phenominal . Thankyou dudur for this lovely product . Annie
 It 's hard to describe a perfume in a review , so I 'll just say how I feel about it . A woman at my workplace always smells really good , so I asked what it was she had on . She told me it was Cabotine , which I had never heard of . To me , it smells exactly like Ferentina , which is made by Caesars Palace -LRB- Las Vegas -RRB- . It seems to have pretty good staying power and is n't too overpowering or sweet . If it helps , some of my other favorite scents are L'air du Temps , Eternity , Gingembre -LRB- by Yves Chantre -RRB- , Ysatis , Amarige and Pure Grace . Maybe if you like them , you 'll like this .
 Cabotine de Gres is one of the most hauntingly beautiful fragrances in the world . It is an exotic , complex floral that will last the entire day , even when applied sparingly . Depending upon the chemistry of the wearer of course ; the Eau de Toilette will last nearly as long as the Eau de Parfum . The Eau de Toilette has the added benefit of being a little lighter for summer ; in the winter I layer the two since the Eau de Parfum is slightly more complex.At one time , Cabotine de Gres was very difficult to find ; friends and family brought it back from France for me . It is not well known , nor is it easily recognized because it is so unusual . If you are looking for an extraordinary signature fragrance , try Cabotine de Gres.Debs ...
 It reminds me a l'aire du temps . This is great for daily wear , however avoid the lotion , it does not translate well as cream . has a strange after scent ...
 I got a sample of Cabotine when I was on a cruise and we stopped in Martinique . I bought a different French perfume , but was sorry that I did n't smell the Cabotine before I left the shoppe . I am always complimented on the scent . It has been described as fresh & clean . Be sure to get the stronger ` eau de parfum ' rather than the weaker ` eau de toilette ' . This is the only scent I use .
 I started wearing this about two years ago . Let me start by saying that I HATE most floral perfumes . Some floral perfumes even leave me feeling woozy and nauseus . I usually wear scents that are warm , spicy , and sexy . Light and floral is usually not something I find interesting.This perfume is completely different . According to one website , it is `` A distinctive blend of rare gingerlily with citrus , rich florals , sandalwood , musk and blackcurrant '' . All I know is that I have never smelled someone else wearing it and it is an absolutely lovely scent . Every time I wear it someone asks me about the cologne I 'm wearing . Hubby is also a fan.The scent is classic but not the type of classic that makes you smell like your grandmother 's dressing table .
 We are having our bathroom remodeled , so our shower is inoperable . So the Cabotine Gres spray for ladies has been a valued addition to our household . Thank you for making such a fine product available .
 This is a very good fragrance . It smells good and it stays on a long time . This fragrance was made in France . It does n't take much to smell it . All you need is a little bit .
 Not an over powering parfume but does the trick when it comes to Motivating the senses .
 I 've always seemed to have problemed skin and 10 years ago I started using Aveda 's All Sensitive Cleanser . Not only did this product stop my monthly breakouts but it also brought tone and a healthy glow back to my face . I absolutely love it ! It 's easy to use and always leaves my skin feeling fresh . I tend to be oily around my nose and tight/dry on my cheeks ... not anymore , All Sensitive has brought moisture and tone back to my often inbalanced skin .
 Love this stick foundation ... applies with a sponge easily . You do n't have to worry when traveling about a bottle opening up in your cosmetic case . Very good coverage ... have been using this product for nearly 8 years , mostly on my eyelids as a base ... I prefer mineral makeup for the rest of my face . I40 natural fair ivory is a perfect match for my skin tone .
 The product that I ordered came intact . It surprised me how quickly it was shipped out and arrived within days . I 'm very impressed especially being a first time customer I was alittle skeptical . Everything was just what I ordered and I could n't be anymore pleased . I love Shiseido products but this particular powder is hard to find because it 's been discontinued . I absolutely love it and I needed to find it which I did . I will be ordering again to save some in my makeup stash ! : - -RRB-
 I must admit I do not have a ton of experience with lipsticks , but regardless of this I really liked this shade . I also feel like the formula is of really good quality , too , but I recommend exfoliating your lips first if you get chapped like me , because this certainly helped it last longer for me . I would most certainly suggest it to other alternative-y people , especially with a little black eyeliner used as a lipliner to darken it a bit -LRB- this also helping it to last longer -RRB- , but I think this would also look absolutely gorgeous on women of color and of olive-toned skin , as well as maybe a lighter woman that just has awesomely bold taste . Overall I am extremely pleased considering that I bought this at Jewel Osco on sale for a few dollars off lol ! Oops - and guys could probably pull this off if they wanted to , too !! Lol !
 Pink in the afternoon is a great colour . its more of a brown/nude pink . I think its a very natural lip colour.I am writing this review to let people know how pleased i am with the quickness of my order process.Beauty Savings had my order processed , shipped and in my mail box in a 4 day time span.I ordered Thursday at 12 midnight and I had Pink in the Afternoon this Afternoon!Thank You Beauty Savings !
 I was a little skeptical when I ordered it because the picture of the red lipstick did not look as bright as I wanted but I am so happy I decided to get it anyway because it is exactly what I wanted .
 Revlon discontinued a lipstick I liked/lovely color and sheen ... the seller sent the lipsticks quickly and in fine order and I was happy to have my favorite color for a while longer . HAPPY I THOUGHT TO LOOK ON AMAZON . Thank you .
 Revelon Super Lustrous Lipstick Creme Lipstick is as in thename very lustrous . This lipstick will keep lips moustourized all day long . There is no need to add extra moisturized to your lips when usingthis Lipstick.The Color is very beautiful and last all day . All in all I would say this is a good value for your money . I have used this lipstick for many years and I have never been disappointed by its performance .
 This color is amazing and can be made up or down with the addition of gloss or lipliner underneath . Great everyday or evening color .
 Beautiful lipstick ! Creamy , smooth formula that goes on nicely . It did not dry out my lips . I love Revlon lipstick !
 The color is red with a little orange , but not too red or orange , so cute and beautiful . love the color !
 Product arrived in a timely manner and it was in one piece . Correct color and size were sent . Great price for 2 tubes , cheaper than buying in a retail location .
 I have n't been able to find this color -LRB- 453 Pinkerbelle -RRB- by Revlon in area stores lately , so I went looking on the internet . It 's my favorite ; I 'm so glad it 's still available !
 I wish the color was a bit deeper , but it is very moisturizing.I would recommend to others . I will order more later .
 I bought it for my mother in law , the color is great but not for dark skin . Not my choice
 I have been wearing Revlon lipstick for 25 years . talk about loyal , but when you find something that works you stick with it . The color stays on for a while .
 LOVE THIS LIPSTICK ! ITS EASY TO APPLY , AND STAYS ON THE LIPS FOR 3/4 HOURS WITH DRINKING WATER . THE MOST NATURAL AND PRETTY NUDE LIPSTICK FOR ME !
 I was very pleased with my product . Thank You ! It was the exact color I was looking for . Love it !
 I was looking for an orangy lipstick since ages , then I found this one on Amazon and I bought it after reading reviews on makeupalley.com , since I was not able to physically see the product . I didnt know what to expect.I am very happy with my purchase . Perfect color and excellent texture . The product was also in mint condition and arrived on time .
 Do you like Lipstick ? But , do you find that your lipstick makes your lips dry , chapped , or crave Doritos ? Well , Revlon Superlustrous is for you ! It almost has a balm feel , and is highly pigmented -LRB- it only takes one `` coat '' -RRB- . I like this color because it kind of has that Minaj-esque pop of pink but very much subdued and casual Friday appropriate .
 This lipstick is such a brilliant red . It is great for many skin tones . Con of this product is that it smells like crayons ... my simple fix for this is just put a flavored chapstick over the color . overall good product
 I love this color -LRB- Mink # 671 -RRB- if you have a deep complexion or are very tan and want that natural -LRB- little or no makeup -RRB- look then you may really like this color . I had it for a while and never used it . I pulled it out about 3 weeks ago and fell in love . did n't realize it was a discontinued color , but luckily I found it on Amazon and purchased another tube because I do n't want to run out !
 This applies really creamy and the color is absolutely beautiful but I do find that it can be a bit drying on my lips . I always make sure to apply a lip balm first , and then this , otherwise I find that within an hour or two my lips are way too dry . I also tend to put a gloss over it just because it 's pretty opaque and that can look kind of aging on someone my age , but the color is worth it .
 I bought this Revlon `` Kiss Me Coral '' lipstick about a month ago for the first time . Although it is labelled as Coral , it is actually more like it looks in the picture -- a slightly orange-y red . I was nervous about that when I purchased it , but it turns out it actually is very flattering with my skin -- I have very light , fairly neutral skin -LRB- I do get red cheeks , but with foundation it evens out -RRB- . It works well whether it 's applied and blotted just a little bit -LRB- for a nighttime look usually -RRB- or for a daytime look , if it 's blotted a lot it looks like more of a stain.I also think it looks very pretty when I use it as a cream blush -LRB- very lightly applied of course -RRB- . It 's a `` creme '' lipstick , so it 's not sparkly and it 's also not matte -- very creamy and smooth . It lasts rather long as a lipstick actually , and for me I need minimal applications throughout the day.When I originally bought this , I was looking actually for a lighter more true `` coral '' color -LRB- I was thinking more pink -RRB- but I guess I 'm just attracted to bright reds ! I am glad I went with my instincts and chose this .
 Received my order promptly and correctly . Could not ask for more . I would use this company again . Just wish they had had more in stock .
 I could n't find this lipstick -LRB- Almost Nude # 117 -RRB- in any store ! I borrowed it from a friend one night when we were out clubbing and I fell in love ! Went to every drug store to purchase one myself but could n't find it . So glad I found it on here . Exactly what I was looking for . Super Fast shipping and I received it within the week . Amazing .
 The lipstick has a shade more purple to the color then the soft pink/coral in the picture , but still looks great !
 Natural , smooth and excellent - great price - fast shipper would highly recomment this item - Lasting color Super great
 The color is a deep and rich red , and the texture , upon application , is smooth and creamy . I would definitely try this product in other colors .
 This is a very interesting fall color that goes on supple and feels like silk on the lips . I like that it has just enough moisture so it does n't dry out your lips . The only thing I advise you to do is exfoliate your lips with a little brown sugar and olive oil before applying to avoid any cake build up . I ca n't stress how relaxed and vamp this color is I just love revlon .
 Bought the product for my best friend as a Christmas gift and she loves it , I wasvery happy that I was able to find it
 so grateful to be able to find a place to purchase this particular color , I can no longer find at store or Revlon direct .
 This is the only color Lipstick I wear , very hard to find . I will keep looking and keep buying it .
 I ca n't find this color in stores anymore so I was happy to find it here . It such a lovely , neutral berry with just a hint of glimmer . Not frosty at all , but just enough to give the color some depth . Is like my own lip color , but better !
 This is a very rich & deep color ... You may want to use it as a gradient color . Either way , it 's nice . It reminds me of the 70 's & 80 's when women wore those dark colors on their lips :--RRB- ... So retro !!!!
 The color is a pink color but blends well after a few minutes , it is not baby doll pink has a rose hue with it . This tones down the pink matches my natural lip color very well . This color is also great to mix with gloss . Very moisturizing to the lips as well .
 I found this lipstick mentioned on Remodelista . It was a true red , a hard color to find . I was delighted to find it on Amazon and bought it right away . The color will always be in my lipstick collection . My pal from babyhood who now lives in Wisconsin bought it , too .
 I combed the net for ages before Amazon came through and I was able to order this fabulous lipstick because it is n't available in England anymore . I 've been a fan of Revlon and their lipsticks for ages - they feel good on your lips and the last - what more can you ask . This shade is everything I want in a lip colour .
 I love this Revlon lipstick . It stays on a long time and it feels so good on the lips . Best lipstick I have found .
 I love this brand and this is a great lipstick . I bought it in another color as well . Purchased this color for my neice and the price is right . These are great lipsticks for layering and they feel like you 're just wearing a lip balm . Love it !
 This is my favourite lipstick from the Super Lustrous line.It is bright , but not too bright . The color is not really coral but , rather , an orange-red . I do have to use a lip balm along with this lipstick , but that is the case with other lipsticks , too , as otherwise my lips tend to feel dry - so that 's not a problem . It lasts longer than my Rimmel lipstick -LRB- which I also like -RRB- . On the whole , it is a lovely lipstick and I much prefer it to the Fire & Ice -LRB- which I find to be way too bright -RRB- . The only -LRB- minor -RRB- negatives are : * There is no visible expiry date - I would like to see makeup companies print that on each item -LRB- Revlon actually does it with its mineral makeup , which is great -RRB- . Unfortunately , most lipsticks do n't have that . * This particular color has a different ` shipping weight ' than most other colors within the same line . Not an issue for USA customers , but can add to the cost for international customers -LRB- as we pay an additional shipping rate for each item - determined by the ` shipping weight ' -RRB- - a pity .
 I love this lipstick color , it is just perfect for me ... . and it is creamy , feels good on my dry lips .
 In the tube the Siren shade looks very orange , but once applied it is more of a nice orange-ish coral . It 's very flattering for pale skin .
 I bought this lipstick when I spent a few days on holidays in Canada last year . I ca n't find it in France -LRB- this color is not for us I suppose -RRB- . Fortunately , I found My lypstick on this website , and less expensive than the ones -LRB- from the same brand -RRB- sold in France ! : - -RRB- Within 8 days , I ordered and received my product . It was perfectly packed . It could n't be better ! I 'm very happy with this order and with the supplier . Many thanks xxxx
 i was really skeptical at first but if you want old school hollywood glamour , i say go for it !!! Gutsy n sexy color !
 I love this lipstick . I found it about 6 years ago and I find that it goes with everything in my casual wardrobe . It also works well for photos and , since I am an actor and acting teacher , I recommend it for headshots . In my experience , the amount of pearl in the lipstick does not create feathering -LRB- I 'm 50 , so this a big deal for me -RRB- or look too young . Just great .
 For those of you who loved this color and then it was discontinued , it was great to be able to get it again at Amazon . It was n't great to pay the higher price , but it was still cheaper then the department store brands and just as good . Amazon made a mistake initially and sent 1 instead of 2 . They rectified the error immediately with VERY minimal hassle .
 I purchased this lipstick from a local retail store last summer . When I needed a new tube I could no longer find it in the store . I found it on Amazon.com and ordered three tubes.This color is so WOW that two of my friends commented when they saw it on me and wanted the name , etc. . One friend I gave a tube and the other ordered the product from Amazon.com.I think it is a great shade for summer .
 Even though it says &#34; red &#34; it 's actually a peach tone , kind of frosted , but not shiny . It goes on smooth , lasts quite a while . I 've used it for years , the price is great ! I love it !
 I got the lipstick and I really like it because it is a nice dark color and I can use it to match anything .
 I have a few Revlon Super Lustrous lipstick colors and I absolutely love them ! My favorite color is Va Va Violet ! It is a dark dark purple and it looks amazing on . It really makes your teeth look white and your eyes pop ! It goes on smooth and does n't feather on your lips . I have the mauve pearl and the silver city pink and they are amazing . Just shiny enough to make a statement but not too shiny to look silly at work . They do n't have a weird taste or smell or anything . I have loved everyone I have bought . Absolutely recommend all Revlon Super Lustrous lipcolors .
 Mom was amazed that Amazon carries her all-time favorite Revlon color after all these years . I think it 's the perfect pale shimmer pink whether you 're in your teens or 80 .
 Very pleased with this lipstick . Very creamy , and goes on smoothly . Does n't darken up after applied , stays true to color . Would purchase again .
 Like almost all Revlon products , excellent quality , nice colour even for the older ladies amongst us - I am 53 and it still looks good on me !
 I have used this color for many years.Revlon Super Lustrous Cream Lipstick , Wine with Everything # 525 - 0.2 Oz , 1 Ea It wears very well . I dab it on lightly , then pat it with my finger -- it looks like a natural stain on the lips . I had a hard time finding this exact color and searched for quite a while before I found it on Amazon -- Amazon truly has everything , and it was inexpensive , to boot ! This is a real keeper .
 I have never worn lipstick , until now!I got the Lustrous Pearl Lipstick in Blushed # 420 -LRB- listed as just Blushed in the drop down menu -RRB- as a sampler from my job . I LOVE it.It glides on smoothly . It 's not sticky like some lipsticks can be -LRB- which is why I never really wear them -RRB- . It 's full of moisturizing goodness . My lips feel awesome :-RRB- I love that it 's not too dramatic from my normal lip color so I do n't feel self conscious!It gives my lips the appearance of being fuller and sexier . I 'm glad it was a freebie from my job , but honestly I 'd fork over the $ 5.00 and buy it as soon as I ran out ! LOL
 My item arrived incredibly fast . It was exactly what I had been searching high and low for . I am as happy as can be !! I would definitely purchase from this seller again !! Thanks a million !
 My wife could no longer find this , her favorite lipstick , at the local stores . Amazon came through AGAIN ... and with a great price ...
 I sent this 2 pack of lipstick to my Mom for her birthday but she only received one . I can not find any way to contact seller . Anyone have any suggestions ?
 product came fast with bonus gift , and a full explanation of the shipping charges.My wife was very satisfied witheverything .
 Love this lipstick ... Nice color , not too pink . -LRB- I 'm over 50 . . well over -RRB- Keep one in my purse , and one at home . . I 'd recommend this product . .
 could not find this product anywhere until these people e-mailed me that they had 2 . i am very pleased with their service .
 I bought this product because I saw a recommendation for the color somewhere and I could n't find it in the stores where I looked . It is a nice creamy texture with great staying power and the color is lovely -- a nice red on the pink side .
 This lipstick had been discontinued and I have checked just about every drug store in town . When I see it on Amazon I was delighted to see I could still buy one . Thank you .
 I love this lipstick and am so happy to have found someone who carries my color . Thank you so much !
 I love this shade of lipstick , so of course , Revlon has discontinued it . I was so happy to see it on Amazon , I bought 3 tubes . I received them in perfect condition very quickly . Thanks for the super service .
 I love Revlon lip stick in the black tube . It stays on and does not bleed . I like the Spiced Brandy color because it adds color to my otherwise invisible lips . I have tried numerous different brands of lip stick and have found Revlon to be the most reliable for staying on and not bleeding .
 I PURCHASED THE LIPSTICK IN MAUVY NIGHT . IT GLIDES ON SO SMOOTH , AND MY LIPS FEEL SO SOFT . I GAVE IT FOUR STARS BECAUSE IT COULD BE MORE PIGMENTED , BUT NOT THAT BIG A DEAL BECAUSE THE FINISHED LOOK LOOKS SO GOOD!i THINK I HAD TO PUT A FEW LAYERS ON BECAUSE MY LIPS ARE MORE PIGMENTED , I HAVE OLIVE SKIN/ROSEY LIPS , SO MAYBE THATS WHY .
 Arrived in good time , great condition . Color is very bright , not for the timid ! It does have a slight orange tint , which goes well with my complexion .
 I was so pleasantly surprised how beautiful this color is - the picture color does n't do it justice . It makes my face light up ! I am especially glad it 's not dark - I like lighter shades that make you skin look creamier -LRB- I have brown hair and light skin -RRB- . Also , has nice moisture and spreads so nicely . I highly recommend . Shipped on time and packaged well for shipping .
 Very satisfied . The products arrived very promptly . Everything was as expected . I felt that the prices were good and it was convenient to be able to avoid the crowds during the Holidays .
 I keep a tube of this in my purse , pocket , and make-up bag . This color goes with almost everything and I wear it almost daily ! Good moisturizing properties , too !
 I can say that this lipstick leaves them soft . Also this colour looks great on every skin colour . Try it .
 A great neutral color my my skin tone . It goes on so well . . makes my lips soft too . Looks great alone or if you want to use under lip gloss .
 I like this lipstick a lot but just know that the color on the lipstick container looks peachy and this is not peachy at all . It is more of a nude color with a little glossy look . You can wear it over another color or plain if you are going for a natural look . It really works well as a nude lipstick .
 This lipstick is my very first Revlon lipstick and I 'd have to say ... I 'm IN LOVE ! This color is my everyday color for my lips and its soooo creamy ! A must have and staple product .
 I love Revlon lipsticks they are great quality and are very affordable . Primrose is a gorgeous color it is a beautiful pink for every day .
 Love this stick foundation ... applies with a sponge easily . You do n't have to worry when traveling about a bottle opening up in your cosmetic case . Very good coverage ... have been using this product for nearly 8 years , mostly on my eyelids as a base ... I prefer mineral makeup for the rest of my face . I40 natural fair ivory is a perfect match for my skin tone .
 The Product arrived promptly and is just what I was hoping for !! I am quite sure I will be ordering again in ther future ! Thanks : -RRB-
 This wax is much better quality than what they send with the bath . Leaves moisture in your hands instead of just feeling sticky after you dip . Nice smell also
 The Paraffin wax arrived quickly and in top condition . It makes your hands so soft in such a relaxing way .
 In my view , this is a good product . Lightly scented , melts quickly , and applies to hands well . Very satisfied .
 After trying other fragrances I enjoy the Peach Smell in this product . It is not as heavy a smell as I thought it might be . Very nice !
 Love this peach scent ! Mild and not overwhelming and works even with some allergic clients . Bead form melts fast and the texture is creamy and soothing . Will be one of my top picks for paraffin use !
 This is a professional grade parafin . It comes off your hands easily and has a pleasant scent .
 This is very soothing for people with arthritis or any kind of injury and makes your hand feel wonderful .
 I purchased the Therabath spa and ordered the peach wax for it which I love . I use it every day to help with my arthritis in my hands and it is so soothing and helps with the pain . Not only that but it leaves your hands smooth . I love this product and would highly recommend it for others .
 This product was easy to get melted , pelletized works great , and the scent is pleasant without being overwhelming . For arthritis it is very nice with the bonus of moister hands in winter .
 Melted nicely , peels off easily . I use it in the revlon bath so was n't sure about melting temps . Wish they had orange !!
 Second time I 've refilled my paraffin with the peach scent and I could n't be happier ! Will buy from again . Great price , subtle scent , great quality and does the job
 Nice soothing smelling wax for your paraffin home machine . Makes chapped hands feel extra smooth . Also good for hand arthritis
 this paraffin wax was a great quality and smelled heavenly . clients loved it and i loved it as well . : -RRB-
 Pleasant scent that 's not strong . Melted nicely . If you want to sprinkle it easily into your warmer with even coverage , I would suggest crumbling it in the package before opening it . The first bag I opened and I dumped right in . When I went to brake the clumps apart , the force sent the little particles flying all over my floor . With the secong bag I clumbled it before opening . I was able to pour it in and there was no mess . It really seemed to help both my husband 's and my hands and feet feel hydrated and smooth . Great product !
 I am very happy with the paraffin wax refill packs . The wax comes in tiny beads so you can break it apart easily and it melts quickly . And who does n't like peach fragrance ?
 When I bought this Shiseido The Makeup Fine Eyeliner I had two things in mind
 If you want the perfect eye liner every time , buy this ! You get the gorgeous little lick of eyeliner , or you can easily go wider for a more dramatic effect . It is foolproof and it never fades or creases or cracks . I ca n't say enough good things about it . . it is worth every penny !
 Bal a Versailles is a beautiful , mysterious and classy fragrance that 's an intoxicating combination of incense , musk , powder and warm spices . It 's a little strong at first , then after ten minutes or so becomes lovely and soft and very memorable . The parfum seems to last a long time too . Definitely one of my favorites and will buy again .
 I love the powder scent at the end but the company should redo the packing . The box makes from cheap material , the picture came off the bottle . I was dissappointed because I got this .25 oz perfume from France . -LRB- probably package in USA -RRB- . It cost me 98 Euro , twice as much . I thought it would be better but the box and the bottle just did not worth the price .
 This is a great price on the Bal a Versailles Parfum -LRB- it retails for about $ 300 per ounce -RRB- . Visit the jeandesprez.com website for some great offers and info . Jean Desprez is coming out with a new fragrance in early 2011 .
 A sophisticated evening perfume with a intriguing combination of spices , incense , musk and a hint of powder . It 's classy , sexy and memorable . I get lots of compliments on it . Will buy again !
 what a great price for a great parfum thats right its a parfum and not a cheap edt or edp . this is the real deal and its fantastic . what a great buy .
 I love this perfume not much more to say ! It 's soft , elegant and a classic . I have allergies to many perfumes and sprays , this is wonderful and does n't bother me at all . I love it !
 Like many people , I was curious to try this expensive fragrance because I heard it was MJ 's fave . Truthfully , I was never quite confident in that claim , until recently , when Julien 's Auctions sold a personal bottle of Mike 's that he also signed . It went for over a grand . That 's good enough to convince me Michael loved this perfume.We got our first bottle about a year ago , and have to say , we honestly think we 'd love it even if we did n't know it was Michael 's fave . It 's very soothing and subtle , yet bold and distinct . Sometimes , we smell it wafting back hours later all on its own . It really is something special , just like MJ . It 's no wonder he loved this . Whenever someone smells it on us , the tension on their face invariably melts , and they ask what that beautiful scent is . So it effects others too , not just the mood of the one wearing it . It totally changes the ambiance and mood of any situation or emotion . It 's utterly sublime . I think we 're addicted . We 've given up all our other fragrances , and now wear just BAV . We used to be huge fans of White Sage essential oil , which is actually more expensive per ounce than this BAV . White Sage is VERY spiritually intoxicating and soothing , but BAV has even topped that for us . Honestly , we really love this stuff.Be careful of the reviews that say this smells terrible . I bet they got the cheaper cologne , NOT this full potency Parfum . The cologne is ok , but if you 've never tried the actual Parfum , then you have n't truly experienced BAV . This stuff is over three hundred bucks at the mall . We always get ours here for a fraction of that . And it 's definitely the real deal . Make no mistake.Bottom Line -- I ca n't see myself going a single day without a dab of BAV . We truly L.O.V.E. it that much ... and MJ too !
 I buy nothing but KMS for styling my hair . My girlfriend and mom always steal this stuff from me so I would assume women like it as well . I have thick hair that 's hard to style but this stuff makes it easy , the texture is perfect .
 LAYERING THE LOTION BY USING THE `` MIRACLE '' EAU DE PARFUM EXTENDS THE PLEASANT FRAGRANCE THAT LASTS ALL DAY LONG . PEOPLE HAVE STOPPED TO ASK WHAT WONDERFUL FRAGRANCE I WAS WEARING .
 I love the product , but the image is quite different . However , the quality is exactly the same as lancome you buy at Macy .
 I ca n't rave enough about this Lancome Body Lotion , and I can say that it rivals the Miracle Perfume in that it can be worn alone . If ever there was a perfume substitute , this is it ladies ! The fact that it soaks in without any oily residue is also a big plus . It goes on silky smooth and leaves a fresh Miracle scent . What more could you want ? I just love it ! Not many lotions can say that .
 I have used this fragrance for several years now and I love it . The body wash , lotion and the perfume ! Wonderful !
 it smells good and it is n't thick.i love it.wiscosin
 This is a pretty good product . Seems to work as advertised . It does take a little getting used to as the texture is much thinner than typical products like Lubriderm .
 My 80 year old Mother has ben using this product for YEARS . You can not find it in stores here anywhere . So glad I found it for her on Amazon . My problem is is keeps going up in price ! I know its because you cant find it , but geez , almost 30 dollars for two cans !! My poor Mother would be lost without this product , so I must keep paying this inflated price .
 ADORN IS BY FAR THE BEST HAIRSPRAY ON THE MARKET . IT HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY HARDER TO FIND IN RETAIL STORES . IT 'S GREAT TO HAVE A SOURCE LIKE AMAZON TO FIND PRODUCTS LIKE THIS .
 If you use hair spray , then this Adorn product is for you . I like it because it is extra hold without giving up the natural look -LRB- in other words , your hair does not look plastered down -RRB- . It is unscented so you do n't suffocate from the smell -LRB- unlike other unscented sprays -RRB- . The best part is that it is so ecomonical especially compared to high-priced designer sprays that accomplish the same purpose .
 This item is difficult to find in the local stores . It 's the only hairspray my Mother uses . Delivery was quick .
 Almay Clear Complexion Powder Makeup , Neutral 220 , .3 oz -LRB- 8.4 g -RRB- -LRB- Pack of 2 -RRB- Great coverage ! It is nice having it delivered to our home and not having to go to town and buy it .
 I love this soap , I use it on my face and body . Now my face and body is smooth and soft to the touch
 this is a product I use often and have come to depend on it to help me with my grooming .
 I bought this kit to use with the therabath hot wax therapy . The plastic sleeves are great . Like another user , I do the treatment just before I go to bed and sleep with the moisture and wax on my hands encased in the plastic sleeves all night . I like the disinfectant spray and the moisture lotion as well . The mits are ok , but they do not hold heat . I also wrap my hands in a towel ; that seems to keep the heat in longer .
 This is the best thing I 've found to heal my winter dry skin . When I have a severe dry skin break-out , I keep the treatment on overnight . By morning , my cracked skin is soothed and well on the way to being healed.Of course you 'll need parafin bath to use this product . I recommend the professional model which is big enough to use for your feet & elbows as well as your hands .
 This is the only sunscreen that does n't affect my sensitive skin and make me itch .
 Nice , non-sticky moisturizer . Ca n't be without it in this dry Arizona desert . My husband and I have used it for years .
 do stitching and this leaves no stains on my creations and leaves my hands soft and helps prevents chaffing in the cold weather
 This is the best hand lotion I have found . It does n't have any perfumy smell . The lotion quickly absorbs into the skin and does n't leave an oily residue .
 Works better than I thought it would . Smells nice , too . Does n't leave a film feeling on your skin . It seems like it help retain moisture by making a barrier more than it really adds/replenishes moisture into your skin . I use a tiny bit of olive oil on my skin before applying it and then it is perfect .
 SINCE IT IS SO DRY HERE IN COLORADO , THIS CREAM IS THE &#34; ONLY &#34; PRODUCT THAT WORKS TO KEEP MY SKIN MOISTURIZED !!!!! LOVE IT
 This works really well on all body parts except feet . I have very dry and cracked heels and this did nothing . But , I now have the softest butt , legs and arms so it does work on other places . I like that it is not greasy and has a pleasant scent , not overpoweringI would buy this product again . .
 This product was suggested by my podiatrist . I am undergoing chemotherapy and get a lot of hand and foot disease -LRB- redness and blisters on palms of hands and soles of feet -RRB- This product has been the only thing that brings relief.P.S . Podiatrist uses it too , he is undergoing chemo too
 You can not go wrong with UDDERLY anything . All of their skin products are wonderful . I am so thrilled with the last cream with urea for my son , I am now not going to use anything else.I also had no problems with shipping or the packaging . It all went fine.You will love these skin products . They are so silky and absorb so sweetly.Enjoy your new soft skin .
 I 'm a nursing student and I also volunteer in my local hospital . Being in the health field , there is a habit that must be practiced each time we have patient contact -- to wash our hands as much as possible ... -LRB- Infection control people -RRB- Because I 'm constantly touching patients and washing hands before and after contact , my hands get INCREDIBLY dry . I 've tried Aveeno , Nivea , Curel , Neutrogena , Vaseline etc. but my hands still get dry and irritatingly itchy . After trying this , I do n't think I 'm settling for more expensive and commercially played out products . I 'm sticking to this one -- it 's not only inexpensive -LRB- especially for students like myself -RRB- , it also totally works . This never leaves my scrubs pockets , even the nurses I work with want a couple of tubes now . By the way , get them in your nearest dollar tree stores . You will never regret it !
 I LOVE this moisturizer ! It 's non-greasy , non-sticky , and get my skin super soft . It absorbs quick too . This is my new favorite !
 I am a 24 year old female with extremely sensitive skin and I have never been able to find a lotion/cream mild enough to use after shaving my legs . Even brands like Lubriderm and Eucerin marketed towards sensitive skin did not work for me . My Mom introduced me to this product and I discovered that it works perfectly for use immediately after shaving ! It does n't sting , does n't cause a rash , and is moisturizing ! This has been the BEST find !
 Great product ! Not greasy and long lasting . Really good in the winter for chapped hands . None better . Used Corn Huskers for years . This is far superior .
 I absolutely love this as a hand moisturizer . Most lotions make my hands feel slippery/oily , a feeling that I HATE , but my skin absorbed this easily without leaving any residue at all.As a suggestion , this cream is available in 2oz tubes at Dollar Tree for $ 1 each , making it cheaper than the price listed here .
 Have used this product for years ; easy to carry in purse in the tube . Husband works for a printing co. & keeps a tube in his desk as it will not leave a mark on paper when he touches it after using Udderly Smooth . Keeps hands soft and promotes healing of cracked and dry hands .
 You can purchase this cream at the dollar stores for a $ 1 per tube .
 I love Udderly Smooth lotions . I 'm a fan . Maybe a more purse friendly size tube would be nice . It 's thin but it moisturizes well . Scent-free . Still , I 'm still more of an avid fan of L'Occitane Shea Butter Hand Cream . This is heaps cheaper though . I just happen to like the rich creamy texture of the L'Occitane better .
 love that it absorbs right away , really no greasy feeling better than any other hand lotion I 've ever tried ... my only complaint is after a while -LRB- and not that long -RRB- the texture changed and became thin so it does n't feel as good on the hands ... that said I 'm willing to try again ... this time in the pump ... I 'm hoping it 's just packaging that made the texture weird ...
 this is a great product to soften and heal chapped hands , and elbows , does not leave them greasy and smells good
 I have a job where I am outdoors most of the time and especially in cold weather . I also have to wash my hands numerous times in the course of the day and that is a problem as well . My hands get very rough and dry especially my palms . I 've tried all kinds of lotions but the results all seem to be temporary and my palms are sandpaper once again.I saw an ad for `` Udderly Smooth '' in a magazine and thought to myself ; `` why not ? '' . So , I made the purchase , have it a try and was pleasantly surprised by it 's softening affect on my hands . Uddery Smooth absorbs completely into the skin and does not leave a greasy , sticky residue behind like other lotions do . My hands stay soft and smooth all day with minimal reapplication . Love it , buy it !
 Ya do n't have to be a cow to love it . Great for harsh winter weather . It 's the best cream I know .
 I 'm very particular with what type of cream I use , I drive all day and I ca n't have my hands grease , this cream have work for me just great !
 I 've been using this for years and now ca n't find in the local market . This purchase was very efficient and received it very quickly .
 I 've used this product before and found a good deal online to buy a case of it . It was delivered on time and in good condition and the product was just as all the previous products I 've used from the same company .
 I got a small tube of this stuff as a sample from a website order . I saw the name and the pathetic packaging and said I 'll try it later when I run out of my `` best '' stuff . This is no joke this is some of the best stuff I have ever used . I put on my feet and the skin crackes were literally gone overnight . When I applied it on my hands it initially felt bland - lack of fancy scent and polished grease - but this stuff is professional industrial grade stuff that works when you need it . Now I only used it once , so I do n't know about long term .
 This is ok for me , my friend raves about but since my skin is really sensitive to lotion stuff i forget to use it coz i have so much to choose from and i forget which one i had put on .
 My heels were in terrible condition when I began using the product , so it may take a while for dramatic improvement , but I am pleased with the initial results and hopeful of having smooth heels once again !
 Well , I was initially confused by the directions telling me to wash udder and teat parts . `` Why , '' thought I , `` do I need to wash my teats just to put lotion on my hands ? '' Nevertheless , I went ahead and did it.Anyway -- the lotion works great on hands , feet , pretty much any body part I guess , to keep your skin soft and supple or to heal chapped or chafed skin . I 've found udderly smooth works better than any other lotion I 've tried!Words of caution
 I found it first in a quilt shop . I have n't used anything else since ! It absorbs into the skin so well that I never have that `` I 'm greasy , I 'd better not touch anything for an hour '' feeling ! It has relieved some occurances of excema for me too - I just put a `` glob '' of it on & let it sit for a few minutes before rubbing it in . Not only did it stop the itching , but after about a week , the spot was virtually gone ! WooHoo !! And if you have a small purse , buy a contact lens case & squeeze some in each side - the case is waterproof & does n't take up much room , plus it will hold enough Udderly Smooth for several uses !
 A friend bought this for herself but accidentally left it in my car . One day when I was out of my own hand cream , I decided to give this a try and I was hooked ! It 's very thick but it does n't go on greasy - it really absorbs into the skin . While I think it 's a bit too heavy for overall body use , I use it on my hands every day , and several times a day during the winter . Keep a tube in your purse for those cold , hand-chapping months .
 Not only is this product awesome for dry chapped hands , it is also fantastic for use on irritated skin caused from incontinence.My dad is in a nursing home . I turned him over last night and found him lying in a urine-soaked bed . His entire bottom was bright , blazing red from the urine burn . He was literally `` scalded '' ! I gently washed and dried the irritated skin , then applied a liberal amount of the Udder Cream . I turned him on his side and positioned him with pillows , then had a firm discussion with the nursing home staff about the situation . I called the staff this morning , and the nurse examined his skin and told me the redness was almost all gone , and what was left was only light red in color !!! The nurse put a phone call into his doctor to get a permanent order for his chart to use this for treatment on his skin as needed.I am MORE than impressed with the results of this product ! I highly recommend it !
 `` Industrial grade , '' as one reviewer put it , is right . This is the only stuff that works for me . If I do n't use this regularly during the winter , my hands get so dry & chapped that my knuckles literally crack open and bleed . When I use this stuff regularly , no problem . Note that their foot cream is recommended for diabetic patients because it contains no alcohol . I keep it in both bathrooms at home ; I keep it at the office ; and I travel with it . Any questions ?
 This product was actually made for chapped cow udders -LRB- you can imagine how grumpy a cow can get when you are trying to milk a tender teat ... lol -RRB- . These days it is sold as a hand cream and it works miracles on my chapped dry hands . The only downside to this product is that is does not smell like the perfumed hand lotions I am used to , but it 's worth the trade off . The New York winters can do cruel things to a ladies hands and I am happy to have this product , perfume or no perfume .
 This was highly recommended by my doctor for my severely dry hands and feet as a side effect of chemotherapy . Udderly Smooth smells very nice and moisturizes without that greasy feeling . I use it about 5-6 times daily and know it has really helped reverse the chapped irritated skin .
 I am an avid cross-stitcher and work a lot with cotton and silk fibers and linen and evenweave fabrics . For anyone who is worried about staining their stitching projects with greasy products , this is a great option . I use it all the time , and have no problems with it . I can put some on , rub it in , and go right back to stitching without a worry.My parents also love this product and keep a bottle of it around the house . Very good for winter months when skin get dry and chappy .
 It was recommended I use this to smooth on my chest area while undergoing Radiation for Cancer . It is soothing and has a lovely fragrance , suitable for men or women . My purchase through Amazon.com gave me large tubes at a very good price -LRB- $ l. 99 each -RRB- . They arrived promptly and I did n't have to look all over to find it . Thank you
 I love this cream . It moisturizes and softens skin beautifully without leaving a sticky residue . It is great for chopped skin and works good as a moisturizer on all parts of the body . I have switched to Udderly Smooth Udder Cream not because it is very inexpensive , but because it is clearly superior to other more expensive moisturizers on the market .
 This Conair Velvet Touch Brush is my favorite for styling . I have very straight , very fine , long hair , that just kind of hangs there doing nothing . I have been using this brush for styling when I blow dry and it works wonders . The round metal barrel is just the right size to give my hair some lift , a little curl , and leaves it much fuller.I do n't have much time or patience when it comes to doing my hair , so this works perfect for me.Starting at the roots just turn the brush through each section follow with the blow dryer and voila ! ... a whole new look . I also find that it does n't take as long to dry and style any more as the metal barrel helps retain the heat from the dryer . -LRB- anything that adds a little more sleep time for me is okay in my book -RRB- It even works great between stylings , adding shape and fullness to my flat hair , and it FEELS really good as it brushes through your hair as well.Almost like a nice scalp massage.A nice price too . . something to add to your cart when you need just that little extra for free shipping!Have a geat hair day ...

 My mother introduced this cure-all to me after bringing it back from Poland . It is AMAZING for nearly anything -LRB- respiratory , digestion , muscular pain , etc -RRB- . If you have aches and pains , rub this in and it will heat it up and your pains will go away . My friends were hesitant to use it because they have Ben Gay and Eucalyptus ... but once I rubbed this in on them , they have been hooked ... it works better than anything ! I use it mostly for when I am coming down with a cold -LRB- which always turns into bronchitis -RRB- . You rub this on your chest and back and go to bed ... you will sleep very very soundly ... and by next morning you will feel better . I use it all the time on my children and this is how we have been able to avoid/heal croupe .
 This is a great product . Use it for pain , upset tummies , and colds and flu . I wo n't ever go without it again .
 Oldschool Polish remedy , I 've been using this since the 90 's when my mom introduced me to it . It 's basically a potent mix of herbs , a few drops -LRB- 5-10 -RRB- in a glass of water will ease most nausea . You can rub this on your chest like vicks , but if you have sensitive skin you might get some redness the next day because this is potent stuff , so test on a small area first . One bottle lasts a long time .
 I was introduced to Amol by my polish roommate in college . It works great and I especially like for sore throats . The taste takes some getting used to if you do n't grow up with it , but it is not bad . I am excited to finally find it to buy as my bottle is old and it has gotten very strong .
 Amol is the best thing when you are having cold symptoms or pain . I 'm greatly satisfied with the product itself and its delivery , which was very fast right around Christmas time .
 So i purchased this flat iron when I was a cosmrtology student ... because it was pink . I really did n't expect much out of it , but it is actually wonderful and i love it . Now that i am a liscensed cosmetologist i have `` better '' flat irons such as my CHI , but i still love my hot tools and use it ofen , even on my clients .
 This flat iron is PERFECT , does exactly what those hundred dollar ones do and its PINK . lol yay !
 My sister paid almost $ 200 for her flat iron . I couldnt see myself doing that . When I saw this one on Amazon , I was hesitant to buy it . It looks just like my sisters $ 200 flat iron , but would it perform the same way ? I took a chance anyway and ordered it and found there is no difference . Except the price of course . The main feature I love about the ceramic hot irons is that you dont burn yourself or your hair like you would with a regular curling iron . And styling your hair is easier and faster . I Love it ! Glad I purchased it .
 This treatment is fabulous for restructuring damaged hair . I have multiple hair types from 3B , 3C & 4A texlax strands and this instantly helps strengthen my hair . Even seems to help my conditioner penetrate the hair shaft better . However , there are three versions of this . The formula before Nexxus went commercial to places like Walmart , etc
 After having my hair damaged past the point of salvation at a salon recommended to me by a friend -LRB- the rinse girl decided my highlights should sit for 15 minutes with perming solution rather than toner . How this happened , I have n't a clue -RRB- , I had to chop off most of my now Shirley Temple-esque curly/frizz/mop , but the ends were still an utter disaster . It even changed the texture of my previously fine hair to course and thick . But this solution is AMAZING . After just one use I noticed a difference in my hair 's texture and managability . I only wish I had known about this stuff before we cut most of my hair off.But a note
 This product is great to help strengthen and repair dry , damaged hair.After using this product just once my hair is softer , fuller , and shinier.Would recommend to others
 Nexxus Emergencee is one of the many awesome conditioners that Nexxus has to offer ... I have been using this for years .
 I received my product in a timely manner . It was packaged very well.I have started using it , but it is too early to evaluate the product itself .
 This is exactly what I wanted genuine Nokomis by Coty . Thanks for not selling designer version . I will definitely purchase from you again .
 This is the most incredible flat iron I have ever used . Its width is perfect ... you can shape sections so easily and its not skimpy on size , yet the bigger ones you ca n't shape the sections like you can on this one . It really , really heats up in one minute , hot and perfect . The decorations of flowers just makes you smile when you use it because its beautiful . The heat mat is an awesome addition and I use it everyday . I 'm going to Ireland in a week and plan to take this with me ! The best iron that money can buy ! You WILL be 100 % satisfied , I promise ! I 'm so glad I did n't get the skinny iron or the wider iron . The item is well made and strong . I love the temperature control ... the best iron ever !!!!
 This was a gift for my daughter . She used it first thing after opening her gifts . When I asked her , how many stars out of five , she would give it , she said `` TEN STARS ! '' I have n't messed with it so if there are any heat or technical issues , I will revise this review . It is a very happy looking flat iron . I like the brightness and uniqueness of its color .
 I am not going to lie I bought this because it was really cute and matched my personal style . However , I have had Hot Tools items before . I was looking for a CHI but noticed all the CHI 's on here are fake , and went with a brand I could trust . When this arrived I was so excited , and I straightened my hair right away . It worked great ! Love the look and feel of this straightener , it makes my hair so silky !
 This is the best flat iron I have ever had . I 've had it for about 6 months now and it does a great job -LRB- even though my hair is super puffy . -RRB- It heats up well and when you run your hair through it it does not feel hot -LRB- but it does work -RRB- and this makes me think that it is not damaging my hair . I have used CHI irons and they do not work well on my hair , but this Hot tools does ! For people who say that this iron does not work , maybe they should use a different shampoo and conditioner like CHI , or bio something I cant rememeber the name . If you use cheap products to wash your hair then you 'll have bad results with every iron you use .
 I was surprised the quality of the mirror was really good , and at such a cheap price too !! Good buy . I can see what the person who rated this lower was saying about how you have to hold it really close to make the 10x work , but I think that 's just what most 10x mirrors are like . It works better then expected .
 I have one of these that I purchased somewhere else for much more money ! I love it but my cats kept knocking it off the counter , and the holder broke . Was able to glue it a couple of times , but now it ca n't be fixed . At this price I do n't mind replacing it ! Travels well , magnification is great , the adjustability of this sliding holder is really good , I love it ! And you can use it as a hand mirror for checking the back of your hair , and for seeing the connections on the back of your computer case ! Multi-purpose !
 love the mirror.you can hold in hand or use small stand , you can see everything , really everything . . great for make up close ups , which is good when your eyes are failling a little . .
 Happy with this purchase . The magnifier side is actually quite good and the stand is adjustable . I bought for travel since one I had broke .
 It works well with no need for batteries . It 's fine even though there is no light in the unit . I 've only used the 10X side . I 'm really happy with it .
 Love this mirror and the stand comes in handy when trying to style the back of my head . my only reason for not giving 5 stars the magnifying side is a lithe tough to use , make my eyes hurt . the normal side is fantastic , scratch free , light weight and really fits int he hand great
 The mirror itself is sturdy and the magnifying power of the one side is awesome ! My only complaint is the stand , which is a great idea in theory , but it seems cheaply made .
 my wife has been looking for a mirror like this and she loves it , she likes the two sided feature .
 This is exactly what I needed for travel . Received it right on time and am very pleased with this purchase .
 This is a great mirror for detail work like plucking eye brows if you are fair and have a hard time seeing strays . The only downside is the stand is not particlary frindly to use , you need to be cautious to hve the mirror inserted at a safe angle . But the mirror is clear and good quality .
 Love this mirror , but be prepared to want to tweeze every lil thing on your face , even something that may just become something ... be careful , you can literally see inside your brain it 's soo powerful !
 No more problem to make up eyes or applied lipstick , etc !! , This the 3rd one , I CAN ' T lived without.it .
 I do n't know why I waited so long to purchase this quality mirror . The clarity is excellent , and the price was right . I use it everyday .
 I was very upset when I realized that I left my old mirror in a motel in TN ! In searching for a mirror that enabled me to see up close to put on make-up without my glasses and was set up very much like my old one , I came across this one and gave it a try . I am very pleased with this product . My old mirror did n't magnify as much as the 10X side of this one . Seeing without my glasses is NO problem . It looks almost identical to the mirror that I lost -LRB- and had used for many years ! -RRB- and does a great job !
 I bought this for my 18 year old granddaughter for Christmas . She loves it and uses it all the time .
 bought this to replace a very expensive mirror from one of those bigtime mall stores . where this was as far as I could tell the same except maybe the other was n't 10x , only 7x magnification . honestly , my wife has been extremely happy with it and now I need to repurchase as with all these things they do fall and break from time to time but my wife wants another of these so that 's saying something and the price was great as well
 This is a great mirror . The magnifying side is perfect for tweezing and for those who ca n't see well without their glasses . The other side is a normal mirror .
 The hand mirror I ordered is a good deal . The 10X side sure helps me to see to put on make up . The price was good too . I 'd recommend it to anyone .
 I love this mirror ! The 10X magnification shows everything , but if you can see all that , fix what you can , then you can go out confidently . The stand makes it more versatile if you have the correct placement , i.e. , counter height , seat height , that kind of thing . Of course , there is the regular mirror , essential for rear views . Best mirror I ever had .
 Nice hand mirror just the right size , I dont plan to use the stand .
 Mainly it was n't broken . It stands up just fine and is a good mirror !
 This is the best travel mirror . Lies flat and you can change height up or down with the detached stand ... removable and slides up or down . 10X for makeup and 1X for back of hair or rear view of clothes . I travel a lot . This is the best mirror for hotel rooms . I also purchase from Magellans the airplane foot rest they sell . This mirror fits great on the foot rest . Foot rest packs flat , as well . Put the foot rest opened on a desk with the mirror on top and VOILA ! you can sit and put on your makeup . Most mirrors are too low on a desk . Hope this helps fellow female travelers .
 I travel a lot , and I love how I can tote this along -LRB- with the stand -RRB- and have a decent magnifying mirror for applying makeup and getting those stray eyebrows -- AND be able to see the back of my hairstyle with the same mirror . Very good quality.I use the stand a LOT , unlike the previous reviewer . It is infinitely variable , so you can put it just about anywhere -LRB- in hotels , you have to put up with some weird angles to get good lighting ! -RRB- and still be able to have hands-free use!Good invention
 I found this mirror to work very well when compared to the other one I purchased from amazon shops . This one has a durable thicker handle , stand if you want to use that and has good clarity so is nice for viewing the back of your head while trimming your hair and checking for proper length etc. . In short they did a nice job on the design . No complaints at all !
 Reviewed about twenty bath mirrors before decidingon this one . We had a mirror in a stand , which was droppedand cracked . It was strictly economonical to make thispurchase . It was a third of the cost of the broken oneand appeared to be the same quality . Now that my wife hasused it for a few weeks , she is quite pleased with thequality .
 I broke the mirror I had used for many years . I bought some at local stores , but they were not the same strength and really did not work for me . I checked on some shopping channels , found this one with good reviews , and cost at least double for what I found it on Amazon . This one works fine for me . I am very pleased with this product and appreciate that I found it at a much lower price .
 This mirror is very well made - good quality , both mirrors without any flaws . It 's small enough to fit inside my makeup bag . The previous one I bought from QVC was just too large and eventually fell over and broke . This one is easier , and no light bulbs to worry about . I can not see well , but this really helps me pluck those pesky eyebrow strays ! Luvin ' it !
 Constructed well and stand actually allows for a surprising amount of adjustment . Not sure anyone should see themselves at this sort of magnification however - it is powerful and may take some getting used to . Excellent for those close up jobs . 4 stars since I wish it was a little wider - you have to focus on one part of your face at a time .
 This is a very powerful , clear , magnifying mirror . It is n't small . But it is still good for travel since it is flat . If you need a strong mirror for travel , this is a good choice . It also functions very well at home . The stand slips a little and needs to be adjusted with each use , but that is not a problem .
 I really love this mirror ~ they are light but feel like high quality , the size is proper that I can use it for make up ~ it 's not big so i can take it for traveling . I don ; t use the 10 times magnificent side , cuz you have to be very close to the mirror to use it .
 Purchased this product to use when I am applying make-up . It work well on the bathroom counter & the stand allows for free-hand make-up applications .
 It 's a simple design but works fine nonetheless . Can be kept in place on a table or easily taken out of the stand to use it .
 The 10X side of this mirror shows a clear and undistorted image large enough that I can pluck my eyebrows without glasses . The stand works so you have both hands free to apply makeup . Only thing that would make it better is if it were lighted , but then it would of been around $ 30 instead of $ 11 . I shopped around before I bought this one . Great for those of us who do n't see as well as we used too : -RRB-
 Very basic -LRB- especially the `` stand '' -RRB- , but good value . Decent quality mirror . The 10X side -LRB- which is 10 , not 8X as in the description -RRB- can be pretty cruel . : - -LRB-
 I purchased this mirror to replace my old one . It does what I need it to do.I would purchase it again .
 If you have trouble applying makeup , especially mascara , try this mirror . It has 2 sides , one of which is 10x magnified . It also has a stand , which other mirrors do not . I spent lots of time looking for a mirror like this in stores and finally found this one through Amazon.com . I 'm sure you will love it too .
 I bought this for my wife , but I use it while shaving now . It is so powerful , it makes it easy to see when I missed a spot .
 This mirror is lightweight , but magnifies well . The stand works quite fine . Seeing my pores up close can be kind of scary , but that is what 10x magnification will do .
 Love this double-sided mirror . The magnification is very clear . It will be a perfect mirror for travel as it can lay flat . The optional stand is helpful to stand it up in a corner when not in use . A very good quality mirror for the price .
 I like Clinique lipstick , but this color is especially nice to wear during the fall . It goes well with the typical fall colors . It is very creamy and has staying power .
 color is a little sheerer than I like , but could be a perfect fit if you are looking for just a little bit of color . A nice , fairly natural shade of lipstick .
 I have worn Clinique Plum Brandy lipstick for more than 15 years ! This is just the perfect shade for me and I love everything about this lipstick .
 I really like this shade of lipstick . It also has a nice light feel to it .
 I use these to make one of a kind bows for my daughter ... to match every outfit ! She always looks adorable !! I havent had any problems !!
 These were a good value for the price . They bend fairly easily , but work great for making hair accessories . Probably would not hold heavy hair during styling very well .
 I bought these because I make my daughter 's hair bows and I glue the clip to the bottom of the bow and these worked perfect !! These are small so if you 're making large bows I 'd recommend buying a bigger clip since these are just a little bigger than an inch . However these work great for small to medium clips ! I love them and I will purchase more as soon as I run out .
 Great clips ! We made some flower bows to clip on infant crochet headbands/hats ... and these were perfect ! They are very sturdy and the perfect size for a great price . The clips looked cute for the baby size and fit in my hair too so the baby will be able to use them for quite awhile , plus they 're a good quality and should last . Thanks !
 These clips are very sturdy , well put together , and do not break apart!IF YOU ARE MAKING BOWS - They work best for bows that are no larger than a silver dollar in diameter . I have tried larger bows and they just do NOT work .
 Bought these to make bows with . Works great . Fast shipping and exactly what I expected . Good deal on the price for the amount of clips you get too .
 Not only are these a great price , but they are much higher quality than I expected . The springs in them are very strong , and they stay in place quite well , even on my active 3 year old .
 I bought these for making hair bows for my daughter . I was tired of her losing her expensive bows so I decided to make my own . They work well . They cover nicely . They hold fine . My only complaint is that they are n't as strong as the ones on my daughter 's purchased hair bows . The next time I buy some I 'm going to aim for stronger clips .
 I received my clips before the date it said . Also great quality clips . Perfect size for my daughters hair bows that I make . I use 3/8 '' ribbon to cover them , they were great .
 I get these for cat toys because my cats love shinny things . They are great for attaching to yarn , etc. for my cats . These are the shortest that I have ever gotten by far , but you get more for your money this way as well .
 I use these to make bows for my daughter 's hair . They are the perfect size for small/medium bows and they stay in her hair nicely .
 I received these a while ago . Late on writing my review but , I love these . I make hair aaccessaries and these are the perfect set for me . I was purchacing these at walmart for a pack of 12 was about 5 $ now I would n't buy them any other way but here ! Great price and quality : -RRB-
 These alligator clips were swiftly shipped & exactly what I was looking for at a great price ! Ca n't wait to start making my daughter bows that clip for her hair !
 These clips came fast after I ordered them and were just exactly as shown ! I would order again - great price .
 My wife needed clips for a craft project . They worked out just fine . Plus we have extras for other projects . She also plans to use them as hold down clamps for small projects .
 If you want the most for your money these seem to be the best buy.I 've shopped around and you can get the same product in quantity of about 5 for two dollars but here you get 80 for $ 7 . I use the clips to make flower hairclips and they are the perfect size for the flowers . * IF * I run out I 'll be ordering these again.The box was slightly damaged in shipping but I was just so glad to finally receive these that I did n't care . Fast shipping I got it in a few days with standard shipping .
 I purchased these clips so that I could make bows for my daughter 's hair . Other than being a bit smaller than I hoped they would be , they hold her hair well and are consistently well made .
 The clips came in a timely manner but was not the clips I order what came was the double prong pinch clips . I kept them becauce I did n't want to go through the work of returning them .
 These clips worked out perfectly for my Korker bows !! I sold dozens of them and made some extra christmas shopping money ! Super fast shipping too . Great experience and I will be ordering more soon !
 I loved getting these in the mail , I make little girl hairbows and these clips are way better than using bobby pins . Thank you and i am very pleased with this item .
 I use these hair clips to decorate and make fancy clips with !!! They are FANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNTASTIC ! : -RRB-
 Im trying to create little top hat hair clips for my sister 's gender reveal party . I chose these clips strictly for the price and was pleasantly surprised with how well they gripped !
 I bought these for a craft project I was working on . I used them to make bows for my daughter and for a bunch of her friends . These clips were perfect ! They are not huge , but perfect for my toddler -LRB- for larger bows for bigger kids , you may want to go with a larger clip &#8230; but this was the perfect size for what I needed -RRB- . They are holding up very well and I will be buying these again for sure ! For the price , you can &#8217; t go wrong . The materials seems durable and not at all flimsy like other metal hair clips I &#8217; ve seen . For bow crafting projects , this is a winner .
 I would recommend these clips to anyone who has a hair bow business . I thought they were a fair price and I have made tons of barrettes with them and they are all still intact . They 've even been pulled out by my two year old , thrown on the ground and rolled over by the stroller and they still never broke !
 These were as promised . I would have liked a bit larger , but these were the correct size as advertised . All were in good shape and a good price .
 The clips are just what I was looking for . I create hair bows for my little one and they work great .
 I bought these because on a recent trip to the mall I encountered one of those carts that sell random stuff , this one sold hair ribbons for babies and toddlers . It was $ 5.50 for two , they were so simple looking I thought `` I could probably make thse myself with some ribbon , a hair clip , some glue and a charm . I was right . I bought some ribbon -LRB- 3/8 '' -RRB- , hot glue gun -LRB- $ 4.00 for countless glue -RRB- , some charms -LRB- about 15 cents each -RRB- , and these clips , which are about 7 cents each ... It cost me less than 30 cents per hair clip and were super easy . As for the actual product , it is just as good as any other hair clip you can buy anywhere else . They seem to catch a tiny bit on my toddler 's hair , but that is true of any hair clip of this kind . I would recommend these .
 I curl my hair a lot so these are super useful for holding each curl until the end and to section out my hair . I had imagined they would have been larger like the salon type I see used but honestly I am glad they are small . This is so convenient for holding each curl and I like to part my hair into several small sections rather than three or four large ones when styling my hair . Its time consuming but these help the curls stay curly for a longer time . My hair does not curl well and by the time I finish one side of my head the others losing curl . I have only used these a few times but I put them in and sprayed my hair once I was done and my hair lasted a lot longer than normal !
 These are smaller than I expected , but they were able to keep my thick curly hair up . Plus there are so many of them . It 's a great price and the actual clips are really sturdy .
 Ordered these clips to turn into simple barrettes for my toddler . They 're exactly what I was looking for , and a much better price than I was able to find at craft stores , and the exact same quality .
 This Product shipped quickly and was as described . I use the clips for making hairbows . The clips are lightweight yet did not bend out of shape during the bow making process . Great Price for product .
 I bought these fir my 8 year old daughter to use when she does other people 's hair . She loves designing hairstyles ! These are small , about 2 inches long . Perfect for her small hands ! She uses them to style mom 's hair and her American girl dolls hair !
 I am very disappointed that this item has been replaced by a new `` formula '' and was happy to be able to get some of the old stock from the internet . When Maybelline first came out with this foundation , the reason I purchased it was because they had a `` shade finder '' , which was a piece of plastic with the various shades that you held up to your cheek to find the shade for you . It was transparent so that the shade that disappeared when you held it to your cheek was the one . So much better than trying to guess !! Upon buying the product , I found not only was it the right shade , but I loved the texture and how it smoothed my complexion . Now , they have something new with different colors and no way to figure out which is the right one without purchasing the product . Thank goodness I was able to stock up on the old stuff .
 I love this makeup so much that I ordered three bottles . It really tightens the skin on my face and around my eyes . It does not rub off on my clothes easily and is practically waterproof . I can cry , sweat and get caught in the rain in it and it still looks good !
 It is very hard to find this brand and shade of make-up in New Zealand now . As the foundation is perfect for my skin tone . no-one can tell I am actually wearing make-up , which is as it should be .
 I 've found that I 'm limited to using very few foundation products which will cover the dark marks I have on my face . I have a medium-tan complexion and alot of full coverage makeup does n't do what it 's supposed to do . This makeup does ! It 's a full coverage makeup but lets your skin breath as well as leaving a beautiful coverage . I have been more than happy with this makeup and feel it competes with the more luxurious brands .
 Really enjoyed this make up ! It goes on evenly and very smooth . I was having a hard time finding this product in the store .
 I really love this product . I have been using this foundation for several weeks now and my skin just keeps getting better and better . The wrinkles around my eyes have diminished greatly and my skin feels so soft and it looks healthier . I would certainly recommend this product to anyone who wants to look younger ! .
 this arrived quickly . . we had tried it in another part of the states , and have been unable to find it anywhere . it was taped securely so it would n't spill , but the mailman asked what it was because the fragrance of grapes was very strong . . not a strong smell for use , though . . the little girl loves this
 What a great conditioner ! It definitely does what it says about detangling and conditioning . My son has a cowlick and very thick , dry hair and he just loves this stuff . The smell is wonderful ! I 'm half tempted to try it myself . I can just comb right through his hair after using it and it really makes it shine . I use a berry shampoo and then this as a conditioner on him and he smells just incredible . The frog on the front is a definite plus for boys too - that 's the reason why it came home in the first place . Great product and a great price . Sure makes it nice !
 If you can get pass the strong smell , this is one of the best cream you will ever use . The ingredients are natural . It really soften your skin . My whole family uses it .
 This Gary Null skin cream smells delicious . It 's thick like custard and super hydrating . A little goes a long way .
 Needed some small spray bottles to carry cleaners -LRB- Simple Green , TSP , etc. -RRB- to Techshop with me when cleaning parts for powdercoating , etc.One does n't typically think of buying pink spray bottles for machine shop use , but they 're a high-quality sprayer and just the right size ...
 I first ran across Pears soap at the dollar tree -LRB- a dollar store -RRB- , after trying it the first time I ran back to get more . Unfortunately there were apparently people more familiar with the product than myself . The entire stock was gone and none was to be had . I was delighted to find it again through Amazon.com.This soap is clean , pure and made with safe ingredients . Using a glycerin base instead of lye it is safe for the whole family , it 's all we use and we love it.Rev . Bruce RichardsPriest of the Correllian Nativist Tradition
 I love this soap , disappointed my local drug store stopped carrying it and now I have to order online with large shipping costs . Ca n't live without it though .
 This is it ! The original Pears deluxe soap . Often imitated , never duplicated . Demand the best quality . Do n't be fooled by imitations ! Feel the difference that Pears makes !
 I too had been looking for this soap . I was disappointed to find it is was now being made in India rather than England with a new formula . The new formula was very bad , but as of March 2010 Pears is changing to a version much closer to the original . Check Wikipedia for old and new ingredients . You will also find a complete history of the soap there which is very interesting .
 My drugstore is special . It 's like an old-time drugstore -- thus drugstore , not pharmacy . Because it carries all sorts of products , often those products will disappear after awhile . When I find a product I really like and it disappears , I always turn to Amazon . And always , Amazon satisfies.So I find Pears Soap once again . As I can not use perfumes , I find my special fragrance through soap . Pears has that special aroma without overwhelming the senses . It has a gently clean smell like a garden on a spring night -- rosemary and thyme wafting on soft breezes . It really reminds me of the soap my grandmother used . So it also smells of grandmothers . As a cleanser , it is gentle and mild . A perfect product all around.To be more technical , this information is from the product description : `` Pears Soap is the natural way to beautiful skin because it is made from pure ingredients , glycerin , natural oils , rosemary , cedar and thyme . For more than 200 years , each bar has been mellowed and aged for three months until reaching a pure transparency . Founded in 1789 . ''
 I received my Pears soap super fast . It is an excellent product , healthy & natural & you can see thru it . Very pleased with my purchase
 I love Pears Soap , it is the only soap that I can use without drying out my skin . I have used it for years but am finding it more and more difficult to find.If you have a Dollar Tree in your area , you can go to the website and order Pears and have it shipped to your local store for free . It is only a dollar a bar , the only downfall is that you have to purchase it by the case .
 I gave this soap 4 stars instead of 5 simply because I did not enjoy the smell as much as the green Pears Oil Soap . However , like the latter it lathers up well and washes away clean . I love the soap , but I prefer the green Pears myself . You wo n't go wrong with either .
 I was addicted to this bath soap after using it for about 7 years . Now I 've moved over it , but this soap is definitely something that I might always go back to.The money I paid for this product was a tad higher compared to other products in this category , but I 've always liked to use Pears products , especially since it is suggested by so many dermatologists .
 Pears Soap is an excellent , time-tested product . It has withstood the test of time . -LRB- Thomas Pears went down with the Titanic . -RRB- It is gentle on the skin - gentle enough to use on my face . Even better , my daughter has discovered that glycerin based soaps , like Pears , relieve her son 's eczema .
 Thank you very much , the seller delievered on time ! Best soap ever ! Thank youI will order again .
 When Bath & Body Works stopped regularly carrying their glycerin soap , I was pretty well devastated . It was the ONLY soap I had found that did n't leave me itchy . I 'm allergic to so many random things and soap is always a hard one . I had found a glycerin soap at a local drug store , but they put some kind of moisturizer in it that left me feeling like I had taken a shower in oil . Not good . My only other option was Body Shop , which was a bit of a drive away , but I did it for a while.Until I thought to check Amazon . Oh , why did I not think of this sooner ? I read the reviews , I looked at the ingredients and ordered a 3 pack . It came in a couple of days and ... yes , my friends , this is THE soap . Way better quality than anything I 've used before and it washes away super clean . If you like glycerin soaps or just want something that washes away completely , THIS is the one to get.We quickly ordered a 12-pack of the soap when we were on the last bar . It 's not the cheapest , but it 's the best .
 This review is to dispute the claim in another review that the Pears soap ingredient Rosin is a carcinogen and a mutagen.Rosin is not listed on any of the carcinogen or other toxicity lists at -LSB- ... -RSB- which include the following
 Works very well on my skin . I would recommend it to anyone to use . It is safe and a effective product .
 I have very very sensative skin . I can use Pears for facial cleansing with no problems . It does not contain soap . It is also great for bathing .
 If you have thinning hair . . look no more ! I have short white hair and the pink scalp showing is so sad . . but along came DermMatch and life is good ! So easy to use -- only the product and an applicator -- that 's all ! One cake lasts about a year , so this stuff is very very cost effective ! Lasts on the head from shampoo to shampoo . . no need to reapply . I have lots of people comment on my full white hair and the look is fantastic . I read of it in a book written by a makeup artist and I thank the day I found that page ! Try this product ... You will be so glad you did .
 This soap is really very nice . At first I just could n't even think of using the soap . A goat just is n't my animal of choice . Ugh ... the soap content just reminded me of goat cheese -LRB- something I abhor -RRB- . Anyway , I tried the body butter by Canus and LOVED it ! I constantly wash my hands because of my job and my hands were always cracked . The body butter cured that . So , I decided to try the soap . It is really gentle . I use it all over my body w/no flaking skin which all bar soaps do to me . Not only that , I could use it on my face w/out breaking out !!! My face is so sensitive that I have to be careful that I do n't get mini pimples from rich soaps or creams . This frangrance free soap does the trick -LRB- the soap with the fragrance does make my face break out but still does wonders for my skin on my hands and body -RRB- . Hope this helps you . I am now a convert . Who would of thought that ?!
 A friend initially gave me a bar of this soap and it is tremendous . Since that time , I have tried to find it everywhere and recently came across it on this website . The soap is fragrance-free and is extremely gentle and moisturizing.I 'm excited to find it in a three-pack . I also love the bubbling milk bath and the body butter !
 I held off on buying this shampoo because it was so expensive . Now I wish I had n't waited . My scalp itching -LRB- I do n't have dandruff , just itching -RRB- is gone within a week of using this ! I absolutely love it .
 This shampoo is fantastic and worth the money . It does n't get extremely bubbly or foamy , but it still cleans well , without leaving any residue . It does strip your hair of oil and product build up , so if you have dry hair , use a conditioner in conjunction with this shampoo . It feels and smells great , and the minty scent is very `` invigorating , '' as described on the package . It 's great to wake up in the morning and feel refreshed by washing your hair with this shampoo .
 I was all of a sudden having some dry scaly patches on my scalp and my hair stylist recommended this shampoo instead of dandruff shampoo . Over my life I have used EVERY -LRB- almost -RRB- shampoo out there . This shampoo may be clarifying , but I have not found my hair to be dry and unmanageable at all . The opposite is true . My hair is shinier than I can remember in years . I do use the accompanying conditioner . When I do not want to wash my hair so frequently , I use the conditioner only in between after workouts . I highly recommend this product .
 My new favorite shampoo . I love how the tea tree tingles my scalp . Not to mention the invigorating scent of the lavender and peppermint , it stimulates my senses to wake myself more quickly in my early morning routines . It conditions my oily scalp and leaves my hair soft and full with body . This shampoo is worth every penny . I highly recommend this product .
 I bought this shampoo -LRB- the green bottle , not the white one pictured -RRB- because in the winter I have a problem with dry skin and dry scalp . I read online somewhere that it was rated # 3 in the top ten best dandruff shampoos . I would rate it # 1 ! I had bought head & shoulders two weeks ago and it did n't work AT ALL . I still had a fine dusting of dandruff flakes . So I bought this shampoo yesterday , used it this morning , and poof ! Dandruff gone . PLUS , my hair feels super clean and smells great . If you make sure you use a really good conditioner after shampooing you wo n't have the `` straw-like '' hair issue that some other users had . I also use a leave-in conditioner just for that extra moisture and shine . Its just common sense for those who have thick hair . Plus I use a flat iron frequently so my hair is dryer than most . I love this stuff and will use it every winter when my scalp starts to get dry : -RRB-
 Excellent shampoo . Cleans hair and leaves it soft and get rid of the dandruff from my scalp . Smells nice as well .
 I read on a beauty website that Tea Tree Oil was good for acne , but very strong . That the best way to get use of it is in the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo . Let the shampoo rinse run over your face and body . Well , it has not helped with the face , BUT , it has hugely helped my 15 year-old son with the terrible acne on his back and chest -LRB- that nothing else has touched -RRB- . And it made a difference in less than a week . So there is a recommendation . I bought the smallest size to test , am now buying the 1 gallon size for refills -LRB- excellent buy -RRB- . FYI , this shampoo has a strong peppermint scent .
 My fiance loves this shampoo !!! He has used this bottle for over a year , and still has some left . Great buy for the price !
 I have used Paul Mitchell 's shampoo for years . I was introduced to it by my hair dresser and I fell in love with it . Makes the scalp tingle and , of course , gets my hair squeeky clean . I am happy to recommend it to anyone.And if you order it via Amazon , you will be very pleased with how fast it arrives.http : / / www.amazon.com/gp/r.html?R=2SN4SR6BKYFHF&C;=17ZSPKFDHLVQV&H;=V7IH8QAF3DSWISA5NX1SZ7ZIPVGA&T;=C&U;=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Freview%2Fcreate-review%2Fref%3Dpe_6680_20553630_cm_cr_ec_add_1_h_c20553630%3Fie%3DUTF8%26nodeID%3D%26asin%3DB0006ZEVU4%26customerID%3DAEYPGOSWXRH49
 We have been using the Tea Tree Shampoo for several years now . It smells great and makes you feel clean . When you use it in the morning you will wake up guaranteed !
 I routinely get ingrown hairs on my scalp and head . I had heard that this shampoo helped minimize the damaged hair growth and soften my hair . I have been using the shampoo for almost a month now and am very pleased with the product . I would recommend it to anyone .
 This shampoo is great for dandruff , itchy scalp!I have color treated hair and had no problems using this shampooIt does have a great smell and does leave your scalp tingling.My 20 yr old and I are both amazed .
 This stuff works great , especially if you have dandruff like I do . Glad I bought it !!
 This is my favorite shampoo . I have fine hair with a wave and a scalp that is prone to breakouts . This shampoo keeps the breakouts under control without frying my hair .
 The shampoo is a delight . Lovely aroma . Seems to decrease scalp itch . The dispenser is easy and works cleanly . Very satisfied !!
 People at work use this product , but I did n't want to buy a large bottle if it did n't work for my hair . So these small sample sizes were perfect . They do work wonderfully for my very thick and `` mind of its own in humidity '' hair .
 Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo Liter 33.8 oz With PumpExcellent shampoo for folks with sensitive scalp and problems with dandruff or Psoriasis ... The 33.8 oz size is a good bargin which lasts for quite some time because it takes just a small dab to shampoo your scalp and hair ... My rigorous first shampoo application reguires a second application followed-up with a good rinse for best results ...
 Although I had my doubts about buying online , I ordered the shampoo . I was unable to find any local dealers after moving and found that to be my only option . The shampoo arrived and worked just as well as the last , smelled the same and looked the same.This shampoo works great . It 's what my stylist uses to cleanse the scalp of any build up from other products . I 've had to stop using it due to a discovery of a mint allergy , but this is the best shampoo I 've ever used ! I recommend ordering from this company .
 This shampoo is the not bad at all , I changed different type of shampoos all the time from amazon , so far this is one of the best . It arrived very fast , and packaged nicely , nothing leak and damaged .
 With this shampoo and matrix conditioning balm paired with the teatree matching conditioner -LRB- using them both at the same time -RRB- , my hair after two weeks is amazing . Smooth , shiny , and I can not wait until a year or so until I can cut off my dead ends and start anew with my hair . I highly recommend using the matching conditioner with any shampoo you purchase , however this shampoo and conditioner is not enough for my hair to leave it smooth and the matrix conditioning balm is truly a miracle worker . Pricey but if you can not afford this plus coloring your hair , you should not color your hair . Shampoo and conditioner is the utmost importance in your hair care regimen .
 I have bought the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo and it was great . Previously I have read up a of review on certain Paul Mitchell products not genuine being sold in amazon , I was quite taken back . But after trying it , I realised that it was the same . Its is 100 % original and it gives a tingling effect on your scalp . One of the to three shampoo I tried so far , Really awesome .
 Tea Tree Shampoo is my favorite . I usually get the pump top version when I have it -LRB- due to the cost , I usually only use it when I want to slurge on myself or when it 's a gift -RRB- . It has a pleasant fragrance that is neither male nor female . It gets your head squeaky clean -LRB- You can tell if shampoo did its job by pressing your fingers around a bit of hair and pulling . If it makes a squeak , it 's clean -RRB- . You may notice that you need more Tea Tree Shampoo than some other shampoos . I use probably 20 % more than my day-in-day-out brand -LRB- Treseme -RRB- . You may want to get the conditioner to try it out , but I find that it 's not worth the added expense . I 'd rather get 2 shampoos than 1 shampoo and a conditioner .
 I had a baby six months ago and it takes some time for your hormones to return to normal . My hair was shedding badly and I started using this product . It helped my hair return to it 's normal Ph and also it promotes hair growth . I love how it tingles the hair folicles and my hair has grown alot . I would recomend this shampoo to everyone especially those with chemically treated hair .
 I really like this shampoo . It cleans the scalp well and leaves a minty scent . Tingly . And the price from Viv is really good because the salon charges A LOT more for something this size -LRB- 33.8 oz . -RRB- . I have med/short hair and this lasted me 5 months . Enjoy !
 This shampoo is great . This is stronger than most dandruff shampoos that just sit there and do nothing . It tingles the scalp . It has a strong minty tea tree fragrance and it rinses well . It is a bit harsh and drying on the hair , however . I recommend either using it every other shampoo or use an extra deep conditioner to go with this .
 My stylist recommended this to me after several problems with my scalp . It seemed every shampoo I tried either dried out my hair or made it greasy . Conditioners were the same , and no combination seemed to make it any less problematic . I also have allergies to coconut , wheat , and avocado , so a lot of other moisturizing shampoos were not an option . The very first time I used this , my head felt AMAZING . The lavender is incredible , but not overwheling . The mint is refreshing and subtle . It takes very little if you give it time to really work into your hair and lather well . I think I use 4-5 squirts and with my thick hair , I usually have to use about twice that for other shampoos . I love that I do n't have to use as much , especially since it 's much more expensive than products you can find readily available at a grocery store.Once my hair was dry , it was much more manageable , soft , and shiny . I have very thick , coarse hair that frizzes and is very prone to static . To tame my hair is no easy feat ! Combined with the conditioner at every other wash , my hair is amazing and my scalp is healing and getting back to normal . I love this stuff ! I used to balk at paying $ 4.00 for a bottle of shampoo , but this has converted me , and I doubt I will ever go back to grocery store shampoo . If you 've got unruly hair , combination hair , a tricky scalp , or are just looking for something pampering to make your shower more relaxing yet refreshing , this it is ! Thank you , Paul Mitchell !!!
 This fine shampoo has cleared up my folliculitis . I did n't have a bad case , just a few ingrown hairs every now and again . It took no time at all to clear this up . It also leaves the whole bathroom smelling nice .
 This shampoo was suggested to us by our hair stylist and it works well on controlling dandruff . Plus , it has a great minty smell . My son uses it several times a week .
 makes my head feel good and I enjoy the smell . I highly recommend . my wife also likes how I smell after a shower
 This is a wonderful shampoo for my hair type . I have long , fine hair that tends to be oily . I use this shampoo first and Nexxus Simply Silver or Platinum Pro second . Using the Tea Tree shampoo first removes all hair product and leaves my hair very clean . The second shampoo with Nexxus tones my blonde hair and softens it a bit -LRB- Tea Tree Shampoo does have a clarifying effect , so the suggestion about using a deep conditioner afterwards is a good one if you have dry , color treated or damaged hair ... either that or do as I do and use a more gentle shampoo after -RRB- . Also the strong minty/eucalyptus fragrance is n't for everyone . I personally like it but if you 're wanting a more floral , citrus or neutral scent , you probably wo n't like this product .
 best ever ! it refreshes your head and mind ;--RRB- sometimes after a hard workout I take it as shower gel ... fantastic !
 This shampoo leaves your hair feeling silky . Smells great and peppermint is so soothing on your scalp . Definitely the answer for hard city water that is rough on your locks .
 I have been using this for many years . I have very oily hair -LRB- I have to wash my hair everyday if I live in a place with 60F or higher -RRB- and I use this shampoo as a deep clean once a week.it have a mint smell -LRB- to my hubby it smells like medicine =p -RRB- but for me it 's refreshing in the morning and it leaves a `` cool '' feeling in the scalp . very nice .
 I 've been using this shampoo for years and really love it . It smells good and makes your scalp feel refreshed . I highly recommend it .
 This a great shampoo , my hair dresser used it on me and I found it refreshing and it made my hair feel clean and I immediately asked her what she was using and she said '' Tea Tree by Paul Mitchell '' . I used it in combination with my detangler shampoo .
 This is the best shampoo I have ever used . I have never gotten my hair to feel so clean . It also makes hair washing pleasurable . The scent and the cool sensation on your scalp are great . I do n't care if this shampoo costs more than others . I am a fan for life .
 I absolutely love this shampoo ! The smell is great , it lathers well , and it cleans my hair wonderfully without stripping it of moisture ! It leaves my hair soft , light , and smelling great ! I highly recommend this shampoo !
 I bought it at a beauty supply store after getting the hard sell to buy some at a Supercuts -LRB- the whole reason I bought it at a beauty supply store but I digress . . -RRB- Wow . I like the smell , and the tingling does go away after a while.But this -LRB- and the conditioner , which I also bought -RRB- do a fantastic job . Well worth the extra price , IMO .
 great product for removing impurities from the scalp tingles can also be used as a body wash
 Does a fine job cleaning the hair . Smells minty , like the tea tree leaves . I highly recommend it .
 My dermatologist recomended this shampoo foor me because I was loosing hair after I had a surgery . It solved my problem and also has a great scent and refreshing sensation . I think I will always use it ! My hair has never been better !
 My hairdresser used this on me for my dandruff , sothat is why I looked it up on the web - could n'tfind it in the store.It seems to be working just great . Will know betterin a few weeks .
 I use this shampoo to treat my dry , itchy scalp . It is the only shampoo I 've tried that keeps giving good results . All others have worked for a while and then my itching returns . I have been using this product for 3 years now and it works the same as always . The latest packaging change apears to be just that , and not a formulation change .
 Good stuff ... you can actually feel the cleaning action ... and it smells good too !
 First encountered this at my barber 's . Rich lather , stimulating tingle , cool and refreshing scent , and leaves your hair deeply cleaned without brittle dryness . Great product !
 My beautician told me that since my hair tends towards the oily side , I needed to look into getting tea tree oil shampoo . I searched everywhere and it was REALLY expensive for a small amount - but then I went to amazon . I found a huge bottle of shampoo for a reasonable amount . The only thing I would caution towards is the shipping price . It was pretty expensive , since it did n't come directly from amazon . However , the shampoo came very quickly and was in excellent condition ... and it works great on my hair !
 This large bottle has lasted me a very long time . The pumps keep the amount at a minimum so you are n't getting out too much . It smells nice and helps with dandruff .
 This is the greatest shampoo . It makes you hair feel really clean and it does n't make your hair look wash out if you hair has coloring . Also the smell is out of the world . With this product your hair and scalp feels really clean .
 Got it something like 3 weeks after I ordered it . The price was well below everyone else but if I needed shampoo within that week , I 'd be stealing some from the girlfriend .
 This shampoo is one of the few available to which I am not allergic . It has a wonderfully clean scent and does a beautiful job .
 I bought it for my husband and I ca n't quit using it myself . Will be buying another bottle for sure .
 Best shampoo ever ! The shampoo I hoard and dole out in tiny sample bottles so the rest of the family does n't use it all up . Smells and feels awesome !
 I have black hair and suffered from dandruff for a long time . Then one of my friends recommended this shampoo to me , which really works ! In addition I like the smell of this shampoo .
 Helped clear acne on my head . Feels so good and cool too . I found this when i went to a sportsclip and they used it.The bad part is i 'm totally hooked on the stuff . I wanted to use it once/wk but now end up using it daily . I wish it was cheaper .
 A hairdresser recommended this product to my son who recommended it to me and it is the best shampoo I have used .
 I have used this product for years -LRB- it 's the BEST ! -RRB- and the first time I have purchased this type product online - usually buy at Sportsclips . Had an initial problem with shipping damage by FEDEX and seller replaced in a timely fashion . Will be glad to do business with them again !
 I received this shampoo -LRB- along with the conditioner -RRB- a week ago . So far , I have used them for the last two weeks , not everyday though . I have scalp psoriasis and was looking for a shampoo/conditioner that really helped minimize the itching , inflammations and flakes.While there is still SOME itching , my scalp condition has radically changed over the past week . I believe that with consistent use of this product , I should continue to see progress in this area . I also use the soap -LRB- 100 % Australian Tea Tree Oil + FREE Tea Tree Oil Soap Bars -RRB- which comes with a bottle of the actual oil one can use for just about anything from toe nail fungus to blemishes and pimples.I 've only started using products with tea tree oil in them for about a month but because of their many uses and low cost , I 've quickly become a big fan .
 I used to use this shampoo -LRB- and the conditioner as well -RRB- but had stopped simply because of the price . True , this stuff is expensive.In that time , I 've developed some pretty advanced scalp problems -- itching , burning , redness -- , not to mention that my hair has been frizzy and just an all around mess . To deal with my dry scalp , I 've tried all sorts of inexpensive `` medicated '' shampoos OTC and other home remedies like apple cider vinegar treatments to stop the itching . None of that worked and I finally broke down and bought the shampoo and conditioner at the WalMart salon , where they are a bit less expensive.This product is amazing . I used the shampoo and conditioner last night and this afternoon , my scalp looks at least 50 % better . My head has n't been itchy and my hair is shiny and soft again ! I also love the scent and the tingly feeling you get from the shampoo is fabulous.Try this !
 This is probably one of the better shampoos around at the moment . It does exactly what it says and never disappoints . The price might be a little high but do n't let that hinder you . It is worth every penny !! Here is my opinion and some advice regarding this shampoo : > Be frugal . This shampoo lathers very nicely and so a small amount goes a long way . A quarter dollar-sized amount will be enough for men 's short/medium hair and a bit larger amount will do it for longer/women 's hair . > The scent of this shampoo is very good and soothing . It refreshes you . The scent is kind of like a cross between that of eucalyptus and mint . > When properly messaged into the scalp , it gives a tingling sensation -LRB- menthol -RRB- . I found it very handy in shaking off the grogginess in the morning !!! > It leaves your hair feeling smooth and clean . However , I do n't recommend this as a daily use shampoo , use it more like an ` in-between ' shampoo as it tends to dry out your hair/scalp with regular use . > For awesome results follow it up withPaul Mitchell Leave-in Moisturizer Conditioner . The accompanying Tea Tree Conditioner does n't work as well . > My girlfriend is a die-hard fan of the Aussie line of hair products and rarely tries anything else . Once she had this itching problem with the scalp that just wo n't go away so I asked her to give my shampoo a shot and , surprisingly , two days later it was gone !! So I guess this shampoo works wonders for some scalp problems as well . > ALWAYS buy this shampoo from a salon . Paul Mitchell does n't guarantee the authenticity of this product when bought from elsewhere -LRB- it says so on the back of the bottle -RRB- . > You also buy this shampoo for a cause ; every purchase leads to a tree planted somewhere in the US.Conclusively , this shampoo comes highly recommended from my side .
 My hair stylist recommended this shampoo to me 6 years ago , when I first started getting highlights , and I have been using it ever since . I had explained to him about my problem with occasional dandruff , and I wanted something that would be safe to use on color-treated hair . He suggested the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo . I find that it works beautifully ; it keeps the flakes at bay without ruining the color . I use it every single day , along with the conditioner , which works well also . I have n't had any problems with the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree products . In fact , when I ran out of the shampoo and had to try a different shampoo in a pinch , I ended up eventually switching back to the Tea Tree . The Tea Tree shampoo and conditioner seem to be the only products that take care of the flakes and do n't leave greasy residue in my hair.The only problem I have had with this product is that it 's hard to find in stores . A lot of times you can only get it in salons , which is more expensive , and not every salon carries it . Some salons and stores may only carry the conditioner , but not the shampoo . -LRB- For best results , I think you really need to use both on a regular basis . -RRB- So that 's why I just order it online . I buy the big bottle and use it to refill the smaller one I have . -LRB- Obviously the smaller bottle makes travel easier . -RRB- I love this product , as well as the conditioner , and I am so glad that Amazon carries them both !
 I 'm not sure how I ended buying this but my whole family loves it now and wo n't use anything else . You can only get it in salons so it is a bit pricey but well worth it , especially if you have dry scalp or dandruff . Also , if you have a child in school , it will help keep lice away . You can find some really good deals on it on Amazon too .
 I have very long , very straight , very flat , unstyled , uncolored and normal hair , but with oily and acne-prone scalp and skin.I was nervous about using this shampoo ; so much so that I decided to wait until the weekend to use it in case I needed to wash it out quickly . Though I do n't have sensitive skin in the least -LRB- thank goodness -RRB- some of the primary ingredients can cause irritation , redness and itching or burning on even the toughest of hides . The scent is rather strongly medicinal , and strongly scented products can trigger migraines in me . I also was n't sure how some of the oils in it would affect my acne-prone skin . I pretty much NEVER blow-dry my hair , preferring to make time to let it air dry , since it is n't that thick . So I had some reservations going into this . But much to my surprise , it made my hair soft , smooth and very easy to brush after it dried , without making it the least bit oily-looking , even on the second day ! It also had no ill effect on my skin or scalp ; no itching or burning , no clogged pores or pimples . I never use a rinse-out conditioner , but I do use a leave-in on the ends of my hair , and that was all I needed . I would n't use this every day , but I do n't see why anyone else could n't , provided they do n't have very sensitive or dry skin or hair . It 's probably especially good for those with skin conditions like excema . And the scent , while strong , gave me no headache at all ; indeed , it 's quite good for one 's sinuses if they happen to be clogged . I can genuinely recommend this .
 I bought this for my boyfriend because he had mentioned he used it years ago and loved it . After trying it out again , he said he wo n't ever go back to using any other shampoo again : -RRB-
 This product , unlike others I 've tried `` massages or invigorates '' the scalp . It smells great too . The gal that cuts my hair introduced the product to me years ago.As a guy with really short hair I use this because I like the sensation and the smell .
 I have EXTREMELY oily hair and was told to try this product and I could n't be happier . I was actually told to try this a year ago but decided not to bc of the price and now I wish I would n't have wasted my time with another shampoo . HOWEVER I bought mine at a beauty supply store and it actually says on the bottle that if its not sold at a professional salon than do not trust that it is a true Paul Mitchell product !
 Enjoyed finding this volume for the price but packaging left something to be desired . Arrived leaking into the box so i had plenty of cleanup to do since it had run down onto the bottle , making a slippery mess ...
 this was recommended to me by a friend and it has done everything they said it would and then some
 I have used this shampoo for a number of years , and I think it is one of the best . I intend to try the mint shampoo next .
 My hair cutting place uses this shampoo and each time they washed my hair , my scalp felt like it was tingling a bit . So I finally broke down and bought the big bottle.Pros : - leaves your hair and scalp feeling clean-tingly feeling for your scalp-great scent -LRB- if you like tea tree -RRB- - does not require a lot to clean a lot of hair , so you wo n't run out quickly-pump-action -LRB- if this size was the traditional snap open lid , you 'd get carpal tunnel -RRB- - dispenses not too much , not too little on each use-wife approved -LRB- she 's used it a few times -RRB- Cons : - It 's a bit pricy , but you do get what you pay for -LRB- still worth it -RRB-
 I use this in rotation with my regular shampoo 1-2x a week -LRB- since it 's a bit pricey -RRB- , and I love the fresh scent and tingling feeling .
 Refreshing for my scalp.Like the smell , but it is really herbal sweet smell . If you do not like that do not buy it . My hair is bleached , dyed and frizzy This shampoo Leave my hair soft . . I use it with P. M. tea tree leave in conditioner . I will buy it again .
 This shampoo has a very minty fragrance and feeling when lathering up but leaves my hair feeling a bit parched or dry . It removes just about all of the natural oils from the hair and causes my curls to go crazy but I have started to follow up the rinse with another shampoo that helps condition the hair as well and things have been much better since . The product has arrived quickly and in good condition . No leaks or problems at all .
 Excellent product . Got here very quickly without me having to expedite it . I really do n't have much more to say .
 Could n't find this shampoo in stores . I love this shampoo . Great product , I use it for my kids and it works really well .
 I had ordered and paid for TWO bottles , and at first , I was only sent one bottle . I contacted the person who sent me the shampoo , and at first I was asked to let them know what the number of the box was that the shampoo was sent in ... when I was able to confirm that , they sent my the second bottle . So I was disappointed in the supplier .
 I ordered this because my stylist was sold out and I just could n't wait . He had used this on my hair earlier in the week and I loved it so much I could n't wait for his shippment to come in . Thanks !
 I bought this for my husband . He wanted a shampoo with tea tree oil in it like his salon uses to wash his hair . He is very happy with this product .
 We 've tried many different brands and formulations of tea tree shampoos . This is simply the best , and leaves our hair and scalps with that stimulating tingly feeling.This is the best !
 Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo does exactly what I wanted it for . An excellent product .
 this product is one of the few personal items our Army Avaitor has requested since his deployment in August . I 've never tried it myself but it must be good stuff ...
 I reside in a hot and dusty locality , with lots of minerals . For years my Belgian neighbors have complained -LRB- lots of arguing -RRB- about the lackluster foliage on the tea tree in my front yard . After many attempts , I was at the end of my rope , contemplating the chain-saw as a solution . Then someone in my group suggested Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo , and I gave it a try . Now I get nothing but compliments!For best results , mix one 55-gallon drum of Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo with 5000 gallons of lukewarm rainwater and apply generously to your tea tree with an aircraft de-icing boom-truck . Make sure you work it into the branches nearest the trunk . Allow it to soak for half a day . To rinse , ignite the dead branches near the base of the tree and call the fire department.Hope this helps !
 I usually get compliments when I use Calandre . I first discovered it in Europe in the 1970 's and have never been able to find anything I like as much . Wish it were easier to find in stores here . The perfume is light and appropriate for everyday use , yet distinctive and sophisticated . I 'd describe it as a light and greenish floral with oriental , bergamot undertones . While it is not sugary or fruity like some recent additions to the market , the green is not at all sharp and lemony , just mysterious !
 I was very happy to find Eau de Calandre at Amazon . I have n't been able to find it anywhere for ages -- must not be popular any more . Unfortunately , 3.4 oz was the only size available . Would have liked one I can carry on an airline . Delivery was very speedy .
 I have loved this perfume since my marriage . I was thrilled to get it . The price was excellent . And it came on time .
 Always good service from Amazon . Calandre is one of my favorite scents for day or night . I am enjoying it right now !
 Very famous flagrance , very stylish and fresh.A very good gift for a middle age woman .
 Thank you so much for carrying Calandre ! This was my signature scent for many years before I was no longer able to find it in Department stores ... . I was totally thrilled to find it available through Amazon . My order just arrived and I could not wait to give myself a spritz . Smells as wonderful to me today as it did many years ago . It is a light , clean , classic scent that is not too strong or overbearing and will not fade away shortly after you apply it . I sincerily hope that it 's availability will continue because I would like Calandre to be my signature scent once again !
 I was dating a gentleman who wore the male version of Paco Rabanne . He asked me if he could buy this Calandre for me because he loves the fragrance on women . I decided to buy it myself.Unfortunately I broke up with him before he got the chance to smell it on me ... but everybody else who has been around me comments that it smells very nice.I do n't like the smell when it is first sprayed on , but like any good quality cologne , it takes a few minutes to mingle with your body chemistry ... and then it smells amazing .
 When I was in high school a friend told me about Calandre , and how it was always her mother 's favorite perfume . It smelled great on our friend . All of us girls went out and bought Calandre . It had become a favorite for all of us . I use to be able to buy it at the upper scale department stores . It is difficult to find now . Calandre remains my favorite . I am passing it on to my 2 girls for Christmas . I hope they like it too !
 Whenever I go out wearing Calandre , people ask me what perfume I am wearing ! This perfume is so fresh and light . While I do wear others at times , I always come back to Calandre . I highly recommend it for people who just want to wear a subtle fragrance .
 Vey good price for a very good product.Very fast delivery .
 I 've been wearing this fragrance for about 10 years and constantly get compliments on it . It 's very light and cool . If you hate the over-powering fragrances that seem to be so popular now , try this one !
 I was happy to find this again - I 've used it for years but you ca n't buy it in stores anymore .
 A scent I ca n't live without ! I cherish very spray since it cost a fortune , but I was thrilled to find it . Arrived in perfect condition .
 it is my very favorite , so you can imagine the disappointment when I opened the box and found a SUBSTITUTE perfume ... I called and was told &#34; oh , we do n't carry that . &#34;
 Have loved this perfume for 15 years now . A real shame it is no longer widely available anymore . It is light and fresh yet strong enough that you only need one or two spritzes to smell great all day long . Glad I was able to get it from Amazon . I was worried about the shelf-life of the perfume because as far as I know it has been discontinued , so I was concerned that it would have turned into a darker colour -LRB- It should be clearish -RRB- and would have smelled old in a gone bad sort of way . It did not however , it smelled pretty good .
 this arrived very fast , and the product is simply perfect , just as I remember it the packing is very nice and its a good price for this fragrance I was lucky to find it they do n't sell it everywhere .
 The items I received were exactly as described . The products came packaged as if I were to have purchased them in a store . I am very satisfied .
 Great seller . Product very hard to find . This is the only perfume my mother in law will wear . Glad it was available .
 Very fast shipping . I did not like the smell , maybe others will like it . It has that musky smell . I like a perfume that smells sweet flowery and citrus . However , if you spray this perfume on top of other sweet or flowery perfume , the combination is OK .
 About 20 years ago , my aunt , who was visiting from France , gave my mother a bottle of Calandre . It was such a beautiful scent , and on occasion , I would sneak into my mother 's room , and steal a spray or two . On one occasion , I was able to purchase a bottle at Bloomingdales , but could never find it again . Then by sheer coincidence , I check Amazon and was thrilled to find they carried it . This is a timeless , classic scent -- not heavy , not too light , evokes an innocence that is rare in most perfumes . I hope Amazon will continue to sell this product , so that I can continue buying it for my mom .
 I bought Calandre 40 years ago and I have always remembered it as my favorite . The fragrance is fresh , crisp and long-lasting . My daughter who is in her mid twenties likes it too , so I conclude that it is a scent that can appeal to younger as well as older women .
 I love this perfume since I was a teenager ; it has a very good fresh fragrance and when I use it people always has to say something nice and ask me what I am using to smell so extremely good .
 Twenty-five years ago I used to wear perfume . After two decades of working in the trenches of child rearing , I realized that I missed my trademark scent ... Paco Rabanne 's Calandre . When I decided to buy a new bottle , I discovered that it was nowhere to be found . I searched everywhere for it ... shopping malls ... airport terminals ... knock-off stores -- still no Calandre . Finally , a light bulb went off in my brain and I logged onto Amazon . A couple of keystrokes later I found my elusive bottle of perfume ! I placed my order and in under a week Calandre was at my door and on my pulse points.Thank you Amazon !
 Paco Rabanne Calandre has been my wife 's favorite for years . It has been nearly impossible to purchase in this country . I have traipsed through many a department store , even Macy 's in New York with no luck . Last year , even the internet was unrewarding . This was a GREAT find , price was fantastic , and delivery was prompt . I was able to surprise my wife on her birthday .
 This is a subtle woody fragrance that has been discontinued by Paco Rabanne . I 've worn it for over 30 years and there were going to be a lot of unhappy people in my life if I could n't wear it anymore as the fragrance = me . So glad I found it on Amazon . It was delivered in perfect condition and promptly .
 I 've been using this product since it came on the market . Always get a compliment . Have n't seen it lately , so I 'm rationing what I have left .
 I do n't know why this fragrance is not readily available in stores because every time I wear it , I always get compliments . Unfortunately , I can not smell it on myself , but I love how I know I smell when I wear it . It is soft yet sexy and understated but distinctive . Four of my friends wear it and we always talk about how much we love it .
 This is a great soap with a wonderful fragrance . I have been using it for a couple of years now and everytime that I unwrap a bar , I am reminded how great it is by the wonderful fragrance.It 's funny -- before I used this soap , I used whatever was available . Now that I tried it , it 's the only soap I use.Now , it 's available in a travel size . I warn you , though , if you travel with it , you 'll bring it back home rather than leaving it behind -- it 's that good !
 I have been trying for over a year for this product , which is great for my age and could n't get it anywhere till I found it through Amazon Unbelievable Store had it .
 I use this scent during the spring/summer and Dior 's Pure Poison during the fall/winter . Sunflowers is , by far , one of the most beautiful and universally tolerable perfumes I have ever tried .
 One of my all time favorite fragrance . It is light yet long lasting fragrance.Multiple compliments have come my way while wearing this.My highest recommendation of this product .
 I usually wear Red Door by Arden , but decided to try Sunflowers because it is less expensive , and I am glad I did . Red Door is still my favorite , but Sunflowers is beautiful scent for summer . Not overpoweringly floral , no musky notes like Red Door , but I really like it . So now it is my Number 2 favorite -LRB- after Red Door -RRB- . Hubby does n't like it -LRB- says it is too strong -RRB- , but ALL Arden fragrances are strong -LRB- which I like , because you use less -RRB- . Hubby will have to put up with it until I run out , or he can buy me a bottle of the more expensive Red Door .
 So glad I can find Sunflower on line ! Seems to have disappeared off store shelfs.It 's a great fragrance for Spring and Summer .
 I got this scent as a Christmas gift . I do n't particularly like women scents because they are so floral and sweet . When i was pregnant it made me nauseous n I started liking men fragarances but this was a sweet surprise . It is not too overpowering and I LOOOOOOVVVVVEEE it . I find it wears off fast because it is an eau de toilette , so it 's definitely an evening scent . Would recommend this to everyone , great !!!
 THIS PERFUME HAS BEEN MY FAVORITE FOR TWO YEARS . I LOVE THE WAY IT SMELLS , A CLEAN FRESH SCENT , FLORAL TYPE WHICH LASTS ALL DAY . WHICH MAKES IT OWN STATE EVEN WHEN I HAVE LEFT THE ROOM . IT IS NOT OVER POWERING AND STRANGERS ASK ME EVERY DAY I WEAR IT WHAT I 'M WEARING . I GET COMPLIMENTS ALL THE TIME . IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY AND THEN SOME . I RECOMEND THIS FRAGRANCE TO EVERY FLORAL JUNKIE .
 Sunflowers is my daughters favorite fragrance and she was delighted to receive it she loves the way it smells and was very happy with it . It arrived on time and in great condition .
 Sunflowers is my favorite perfume so I ca n't say anything bad about it . I love ordering it through Amazon because I always get it quickly .
 I always get compliments when I wear this frangrance . It is especially delightful to wear in the Spring and Summer . However , I wear it year round . Buying it through Amazon provides me with the best possible price for this perfume .
 Thank you so much for all your help ! This was a gift for my cousin who has been unable to find this anywhere . It 's her favorite fragrance and I made her birthday a very special happy day !! I will be doing business with you agian for sure !!
 I think I discovered Sunflowers about 14 years ago when I was 12 . The scent was so uplifting and confident but soft and friendly . To this day , it 's still one of my favorite perfumes . And this vendor shipped my perfume in a timely fashion and in excellent condition . Highly recommended .
 I got a mini of this for my mom a couple of years ago for her birthday and she thought it was so-so . However I , on the other hand , loved it ! To make a long story short , the perfume became mine -LRB- my mom is more of a Red Door person I guess -RRB- . This flowery , powerful perfume is sure to seduce and allure ! * This fragrance has notes of rose , cedar , lemon , musk , moss , amber , manderin , and jasmineTips/Suggestions/Comments involving Sunflowers :1 -RRB- This is a rather moderate scent . I would ` nt call it subtle nor would I call it intense . It 's juusst right ~ 2 -RRB- This perfume lasts about as long as most perfumes -LRB- 8 or so hours -RRB- .3 -RRB- This perfume is great for a day at work OR a night out in town .4 -RRB- This perfume , at least in my opinion is great for both adults and teens so Moms , feel free to share this scent with your daughters ! -LRB- or vice versa -RRB-
 Sunflowers is a distinctive fragrance that I find more floral-like than fruity . It is a strong , unique scent , but one that is likely to be wearable on many due its simplicity and appeal . My only complaint is that I wish the container was better made
 Every time I wear Sunflowers people tell me they love my perfume and where can they get some . Nuff said !
 The wife loved the perfume . We looked for the product and could not locate it at Christmas . Keep up the good work .
 Trust me , you can not go wrong with this fragrance ! It 's been around for such a long time and it 's STILL one of the best !!!
 Great to find this cologne still available and at a reasonable price . Was packaged well and ready to wrap for holiday gift .
 My daugther is pretty particular about her cologne . This is one she asks for yearly . One of her overall favorites .
 Bought this for my wife for Christmas . I 've always loved this smell and can pick it out in a crowded room .
 es un perfume muy rico primera vez que lo uso , lo recomiendo , es excelente , justo lo que quer&iacute;a tal cual como se muestra en la foto
 My mother has purchased Elizabeth Arden products for many years from many different department stores in California and in Arizona where she live now . The best deals are always through Amazon.com . What she paid for on a 1.7 oz bottle of perfume in a department store . She got double the amount and less expensive by ordering it at Amazon.com . She said `` No more department store shopping for me '' . Sunflowers By Elizabeth Arden For Women . Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 Oz .
 I love this perfume and I 've used it for years . It is so subtle and smells soft and sensual . I get lots of compliments and asked by total stangers -LRB- mostly men :--RRB- -RRB- what perfume I 'm wearing.The Oil does n't have the same smell at first , but after you 've had it on for a while it begins to smell much better . Not sure I 'll order the oil again .
 For my sister - she loves this perfume . I like the ease of shopping on-line . Thanks and that is it .
 This is my favorite perfume of all time - it smells so clean and fresh , with a hint of lemon , but not sugary or overbearing . It lasts all day -LRB- I am not one of those people who , when you walk by you can smell the entire room -RRB- it is just soft enough that if someone is close to you - they get as slight hint of the fresh light scent . I always get complimented on it . I even spray some underarms and it works awesome with my deodorant mixed together . So for those times where you are really hot - you still smell so GOOD !! lol . I buy like 2 bottles at a time for fear one day the online stores will run out . Best perfume ever !!!
 After searching the internet for this perfume , found it at Amazon for the best price . Will definitely make the perfect gift .
 my absolute favorite perfume . ca n't buy it in the states anymore . best smell i 've ever used . clean , crisp smell . ca n't go wrong with this item .
 I love this fragrance . I can never get enough of it . The scent is fresh , not `` heavy '' or `` perfumey '' , if you know what I mean.If you are woman who likes fresh , happy , optimistic scents , with a splash of citrus , this is for you .
 Showed up on time . It was packaged well . Very happy to find it at a reasonable price . However very sad that they are not going to make it any more .
 I have been using this product for a few months now . I have had mixed feelings on the the product , especially after seeing alcohol as the first ingredient . I do n't know about the previous review , but it does smell like alcohol . Having stated that I would like to say that the product does dry to a smooth finish quickly . I also believe this has helped keep my acne prone skin to a minimum -LRB- in my mid 40 's -RRB- without overly drying it out . -LRB- and yes I at times have VERY dry skin-esp . in winter -RRB- . I apply this after cleansing and toning and before using a moisurizer.Ambience Shimmer SerumI would recommend this product to others on this basis . It may not be the best product out there but the benefits I have personally received have made it worth it . It also lasts a while unlike many other serums .
 Love fragrance and dry silky finish , not felt on skin at all , even in hot weather yet lovely scent .
 So I ordered this and read the directions five times before I attempted it . The english instructions are not that great to be honest . It took about one to two hours to do my hair . I almost lost all the leave in conditioner because it 's like water and I almost poured it all in my hand in the first go . It also has the temp in Celcius instead of Fahrenheit . But the flatiron should be between 350-365 F . After I finished my hair was dry , frizzy , smelly , and stiff as hay . I almost cried and it only got worse as the two day wait to wash went by . BUT , after two days I washed my hair and the hard brittle frizz that was my hair was suddenly straight and soft . It was amazing . Everyone ca n't stop talking about how great my hair looks . It now takes about 5-10 minutes to do my hair instead of over an hour . I would recommend this product to anyone but caution to follow the directions to a tee and to expect your hair to be not so fabulous for the first few days until you can wash it .
 Soooooo glad to find this product in a large size . This cream is not really heavy or oily , as some would think , and it 's wonderful for a myriad of things . It 's supposed to be used sparingly -LRB- and a good thing 'cause it 's not cheap -RRB- , and is water soluble - not like heavy moisturizers . I use it all over my body . Even had an infected cuticle that cleared up using this cream with a bandaid overnight . Remember , we 're talking real Lanolin here , not some mystery cream with mineral oil !!!!!!!
 I work as an RN and my hands are in water all day . We use alcohol based hand gels too . In the winter my hands were a mess -- cracked , dry , painful . I bought this cream and everything changed . It 's the best for protecting hands from the cracking , dry effects of the excessive handwashing that nurses do every day . If I get a small crack at the nail it will heal it faster . I will never go through a New Hampshire winter without this cream . It 's not stickey and lasts through many handwashings . A necessity for all working hands .
 I love this stuff . It does not leave an oily residue on your skin , although some people might not like the slightly waxy feel . I use it on my hands and face.The only problem I have with the pump dispenser is learning how to control the amount of lotion that comes out . Sometimes I 'm too vigorous with the pump . I bought the 4 ounce jars after purchasing this . It 's almost gone after several winter months .
 I used to have a terrible time with my fingertips splitting in the winter . Since I started using Lotil -LRB- and it has been years now -RRB- I no longer have that problem . I just apply Lotil to my hands every night before I go to bed , being sure that I massage it well into my fingertips . No more painful splits ! This is a heavy waxy product , however , and not really suitable for a quick application during the day . I love the stuff ! It 's expensive , but well worth it . Buying it in the large container is more economical that buying the small jar .
 Love this product ! Have used it for many years . The retailer where I always bought it -LRB- 20 + years -RRB- has mysteriously stopped carrying it , so I was thrilled to find a new source . Bought two , just in case this turns out to be short-lived . Shipped quickly and the price was quite fair .
 Venezia is one of my favorite fragrances that I 've been wearing for several years . I 'm pleased that I was able to find it on-line .
 This item allows you to purchase the Ralph Lauren Romance cologne at a value price . You just do not get the cap .
 another great smelling cologne . I have like 40 of them and I rotate it one . this is one that is on top of my list .
 Thanks for carrying this product -- my husband loves this fragrance and it is NOT easy to find . We both will be enjoying the scent !
 This is my favorite fragrance for a man . I have purchased several as gifts and will continue to do so . Very nice , light aroma .
 Easy to mount and works great . Consider the upgraded model if you want a night light and clock .
 I purchased this hairdryer after numerous stays in hotels which were equipped with various similar units . This was the one my husband and I liked the best , for its light weight , quiet operation , and overall effectiveness . It is a great addition to our bathroom at home .
 I bought this parfum for my sons girlfriend for Christmas . I love the scent and thought it would be perfect for her .
 I gave a rating of 5 stars because this IS a great perfume . I wore it a long time ago , but its been rather hard to find lately . I was so happy to find it offered on Amazon .
 had n't found this fragrance in this size for this price in years . was a gift to me by my roommate will buy again
 This perfume was my go to perfume for many years and then it vanished . I saw it here at Amazon and could n't resist . It arrived well packaged and I ripped it open to get a smell . It 's just like I remember it . The light clean fragrance was there . I ca n't wait to go somewhere to wear it out . Hope I never loose it again .
 Love this . It was as scent my mom used to wear and I am pleased to say it is still a wonderful scent .
 This is an older perfume , but the aroma brings back wonderful memories with my wife . It is the perfume that she wore when we first dated and got married over 26 years ago . We can not find it at places where they sell perfume , so I was ecstatic to be able to find it online and order it for her -LRB- for me -RRB- for Christmas !
 I 'm so happy to have found this fragrance again , and for a great price ! I 've never been much for perfume , but this is one of a handful of exceptions . my mother found me a bottle at a discount store once and said she used to wear it in the 70s before she married my dad . i gave it a try and i loved it ! I adore jasmine , and this fragrance smells like spring and life . I love that it smells like a perfume made directly from flowers , rather than an abstract fragrance like most perfumes . smells like a beautiful spring day !
 I am so happy to have found this again . I 've worn it forever , and was really upset when it was discontinued . I just love the fragrance , and have never found another that I like as well . Really happy to have found it , and if I remember right , the price is about what I used to pay for it .
 my daughter was very happy that I was able to find this for her
 The back of the box says `` jasmine , gardenia and honeysuckle , '' and that is what it smells like to me . It may sound like something your grandma would wear , and she might . But I fell in love with it at 21 , and it 's always been my favorite perfume . It 's intensely floral , but clean , not heady . Very feminine , and yes , men like it .
 A rare find ! This was my `` signature '' fragrance for MANY years - till it suddenly vanished from the market . I was thrilled to locate it here .
 In the late 70 's on a flight to St. Maarten I met a model who was wearing Tatiana . I liked the scent so much that I asked her what it was . For years after that I always wore Tatiana ... until I could n't find it anymore in the stores . I thought maybe it was discontinued . I was so happy to find it at Amazon , and at a good price as well . I definitely will be buying this product again .
 I have worn no other perfume but Tatiana since 1980 ! It has a beautiful light -LRB- yet noticeable -RRB- floral fragrance -LRB- primarily jasmine -RRB- that is not overbearing or annoying to those around you . I have tested other perfumes out of curiosity and will purchase nothing else but Tatiana .
 I was really amazed that this perfume is available now . There has not been any other perfume I have smelled or used that has the smell of this one . Every one around me asks me what perfume i am wearing . I like fragances that do not overwhelm , but that can turn heads . This one , definetely is the one .
 Very happy with this purchase ! Tatiana is hard to find and in the past , I had bought some that did n't smell right . This was perfect !
 I wore this as my spring fragrance in high school . It was pricey at the time . I was thrilled to find it again at such a great price and shared it with my daughter . She said `` mom , that smells delicious ; it smells like spring '' . Light , not too sweet floral , just smells great !
 a special spray.not like the common ones I used.It really suits women in love.I found coco mademoiselle fit me better.Spray means one 's scent or charactor from other aspect , I think .
 I used to purchase this perfume at Macy 's years ago and then after finding out they were n't selling it anymore I was devastated . Thankfully amazon came to the rescue . I absolutely love it , I just wish I could find the 3.4 oz bottle instead of only the smaller sizes .
 I have used this hard to find fragrance for a long time . Glad to see it online again . Try it
 Very inexpensive and as good as any home coloring kit.It completely covers my grey , thick and course hair.It only has a small pack of conditioner for 1-2 uses , not a tube.Color is close , not quite as light . It does have good hi-lites .
 I loved it !! I was skeptical about the price being so low until I looked under the Good Housekeeping website and saw the Dark Brown listed as one of the best colors/outcomes/prices . I figured it was the same company , same formula only Medium Golden Brown and decided to give it a whirl . I hope to post a video review showing off the color but the lighting is n't that great and would n't do it justice . I applied the color and waited for 25 minutes as instructed . I was worried at first it would n't cover my entire head of hair b/c my hair is really thick and past my shoulders . To my delight , I had just enough . I made sure to rub it through several several times to ensure complete coverage and started to wait . It does n't smell bad , which was great . I rinsed it off , applied conditioner as instructed , blow-dried my hair and straightened it . The results were amazing . Darker than the box said it would be but it was what I was hoping for . Perfect . I worried at first that ` golden ' would make it more red than desired , but it was perfect and had it not been golden , my hair would have been a flat color . It covered well , smelled good , worked great and to boot it was under $ 5 bucks ! Great product that worked just as effectively as they said it would . For those who did n't get the results they wanted , I suggest leaving the product on longer . It suggests that for stubborn gray hair anyway , maybe their hair is just stubborn ! I would try an extra 5 minutes . It could n't hurt and in the end if it does n't work - it 's only 5 bucks you 're out . I paid over $ 150 at a salon for what Revlon gave me for $ 5 . Ca n't beat it !
 I couldnt have asked for more . I had a tough schedule -LRB- I was leaving US next week -RRB- , and upon my request the order was shipped within no time.Thanks for the speedy and wonderful service . The customer care reps were just great.Cheers
 I just purchased this hesitatingly . As a child Maja was the all around soap and perfume that my Mom and Grandparents used.Back then it was made in Spain . Myrurgia , the company that makes Maja sold out to a company in Mexico in 2002 . The new company in n trying to fix what was not broken , changed the formula so that the perfume now smells like skid row brown paper bag stuff . Nothing even resembling the old Maja.I was pleasantly surprised that this bath and shower gel smelled a lot like the old formula ; which the perfume no longer does.Some advice ... If you are a fan of Maja ... make sure it is from Spain and if you want the smell of the old perfume do n't buy from Mexico or before the year 2002 vintage . Otherwise you will be very disappointed . Spanish versions and Mexican versions are nothing alike . Also if you are buying online check it out closely . Many sellers are saying their stuff is from Spain or are vintage products , when in fact they are selling you inferior products at astronomical prices!Buyer beware ! As for this product , it is fine !
 This comes closest to the old smell I love . More like the soap or old talc from Spain I got years ago .
 I would recommend Maja bath & shower gel as well as soap to anyone . I 've used it for years and , like most everything else , it 's hard to find at stores anymore .
 MAJA IS THE MOST WONDERFUL BODY WASH , IT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE , THE SMELL STAYS WITH YOU JUST SO SOFT NOT OVERPOWERING.I 'M GLAD I FOUND IT AGAIN THE RETAIL STORE I USE TO BUY IT FROM STOPPED STOCKING IT .
 Maja has a fragrance that comes from my past and tickles memories of sensuous experiences of youth . WonderfulMaja by Myrurgia for Women . Shower Gel 17-Ounces
 Oh what a delectibly fine scent descended from the very Heavens themselves ! I originally utilized it solely to soothe the dryness of my hands while waiting with my husband in line at a checkout counter . Two hours later , the gently fresh and wildly compelling smell had me running back for the purchase . I highly suggest applying a dime size amount to the neck and kicking back in the sun with your eyes closed . Alfred Sung 's Paradise makes it easy to imagine lying on the deck of your own private yacht . Wear it out on the town for second glances from any men that should pass . It is a truly fine and sophisticated scent .
 this blends superior to anything else out there and will give you a naturally flawless face . i took one star off because mine has started to crack in places -LRB- still works -RRB- and i have n't used it all that much for it to make sense at this price . also because it has become stained from my foundation and i ca n't wash it out . this bothers me not only because it looks gross but also because it could be make-up gunked in there which is unhygienic .
 I reallly LOVE the beauty blender but it 's hard to clean ! I 've washed it but it is stained with foundation ! :-LRB- other than that it is amazing ! It blends in allll my foundation like a dream and covers up everything without looking cakey !
 This is a great way to apply foundation . The rounded shape of the sponge helps a lot in avoiding lines and streaks , while the tapered point works just as well in tighter areas around the nose and eyes . On the down side , the Beautyblender only works with cream makeup , and it does soak up a lot of it . -LRB- Hey , it is a sponge after all ! -RRB- But , in spite of that , it 's a great way to put on foundation , and right now I can not see myself using anything else ! -LRB- Review of BeautyBlender Makeup Sponge - 1pc -RRB-
 I love this product ! I have nothing bad to say about it . It blends well with both liquid or powder make up . It 's just amazing ! And worth the cost .
 This is the finest men 's scent I have ever experienced . I realize that scent is a very personal thing , but this one is just exceptional and I think that most people will agree . It is n't too strong , it 's quite masculine , a nice , warm scent that you will find very appealing . I think it 's a scent for a man with a strong character , a man who walks in a room and gets noticed because of his commanding presence . -LRB- That 's why I 'm buying a bottle for my husband ! -RRB-
 I am sure many of Creed 's customers enjoy this scent Like No Other . Of all Creed 's many accomplishments Bois du Portugal is true Timeless Fragrance . Of All My Father 's Gifts This Is The One I Treasure Most .
 Boise du Portugal is an excellent cologne if you want to stand out . Goes on strong , lasts all day . It 's complex , meant for the cool , confident , debonair , man who 's got an air of mystique about him.It 's hard for me to explain the actual fragrance but it 's not for casual wear . I can imagine a middle aged guy wearing a tuxedo with a gorgeous woman by his side , at some fancy formal event , with a dab or two of this cologne on him . Just enough for the other women at the party to want to get closer to smell it on him .
 I purchased this for me and my daughter . We have used this after epilation and there are no ingrown hairs that can sometimes be associated with this type of hair removal . Have been using this product for over a year now and love , love , love it ! The investment of a good epilator and this gel , saves hundreds a year we used to spend on waxing , with the same smooth results .
 When I shave in personal areas I always get ingrown hairs which is what I purchased this for . I have tried every shaving technique and have had no luck in the past . This stuff does a decent job and I am happy with it . I still have redness after shaving where the hairs grow back in , but they have not turned into bumps and I have n't had to pull any ingrown hairs out . Not a miracle worker , but definitely helps !
 I have been having ingrown hairs around my bikini area and upper thighs for about 5 years now . I also have dark scars from them . I have been using this product for about 2 months now and havent seen any ingrown since I started . I am also starting to see the scars fade away . First review I have written because I was just so happy that it was the first product that has actually worked on the ingrown hairs as well as the scars ! Great product ! Highly recommended !
 I love this stuff ! It helps my neck stay clear and prevents ingrown hair . I still have some random outbreaks ... but I feel this product does it job . The seller is awesome too ! Way cheaper than buying directly from the supplier and ships really fast ! I highly recommend both the product and seller .
 I found this item almost by accident , but am so glad I did ! I 've only applied this product when I 've seen an `` issue '' arise & it has solved the problem each time . This will definitely be part of my beauty routine from now on !
 This product is just Amazing !! I have suffered for many many years from ingrown hairs -LRB- ever since I started shaving -RRB- . I have tried everything over the counter even some old fashioned home remedies and they where all sadly disappointing.Princereigns has changed my life forever . The results are fantastic !! I am proud to say `` I ca n't wait to go to the beach this summer ! '' I love this product . A little pricey but I do n't care it is so worth it.I highly recommend this product .
 This product does very well to remove ingrown hairs due to shaving . Love it !
 it did n't get rid of all of my ingrown hairs but has definitely helped!i will definitely keep using this as it does n't dry out my skin like some other products do . it 's all natural !
 A bottle of this stuff is pricey but it works better than any other product claiming to do the same thing . Smells pleasant and is n't greasy .
 Ok , so I know I gave this product 4 stars and then I say that it is iffy if I would repurchase this item ... contradictory ??? Allow me to explain , I give it the 4 stars because it is awesome if my legs are really itchy from all the hair trying to regrow , but I do n't feel that it prevents the ingrowns , maybe it helps to soften the skin to allow the hair to break through , but I find I achieve maxium results by exfoliating and then using the product . After I 'm done with it I am going to try only exfoliating and see how I fare ... more to come ! ALSO , another reason why I liked it , it really helps reduce the redness from epilating !
 The product is great and does the job , but you do have to use it regularly in order for it to be 100 % effective.The shipping cost seems to be higher than the actual cost of having it shipped , I noticed the tag on my package was less than $ 2 , but I was charged around $ 4 .
 No lie its good and worked for me . In 4 days my face cleared up completely no bumps no nothing.Expensive though but worth it .
 Pricey , shipped quick but well worth the dough.It worked for me and my face was jacked up plus i had bumps on my neck which wasnt cool . I cant say enough about this stuff its good stuff .
 when you have severe ingrown hair problems at least for me my goal is to be open and try most everything . in another post i gave thumbs down to tendskin but i gave it four stars because i could see some results but tendskin burned my skin very badly . maybe it will work for you though . after reading hundreds of posts on various products i chose princereigns because many people were getting results and it did n't denote many `` burns like hell comments '' . while i applauded previous posts for warning away from this product because it was not 100 % natural as stated , costly or plain did n't perform , when you have severe/painful ingrown hairs , again you try most anything once . for starts the little bottle is small and lasted me about 6-7 weeks . while it is a small bottle because it is a gel i never wasted a drop rubbing it in - big plus . i would like to see this product in a roller bottle none the less as another method of applying the gel . while somewhat costly my goal was to find the lowest price and free shipping . ordered my 2nd bottle and both times were shipped/recv 'd quickly - under 5 days and shipping was free - that was reasonable . total price w/shipping $ 20.00 - reasonable . my plan of attack was first to see if my face would tolerate the product or the burn test . no problem with burning and princereigns did a rather good job of soothingly - big plus . even directly after shaving and liberalling rubbing it in good i had no problems at all with burn - this is very good . i used it twice a day in the morning right after shaving and at night before bed . the first week i noticed my skin smoothing a bit . it was like the little pores in my face were closing . would i have liked my skin to be like my 8yr old son 's skin , yes but realistically my face appeared to get smoother certaining better that it was before a few weeks of this application . i used the product faithfully and liberally over all my shaved areas which is about 3 squirts X 2times daily X 7days a week . is more better , i do n't know . slowly and i mean slowly one ingrown here and one ingrown there would either disappear or become smaller . after 4weeks about 20 % ingrown hairs were gone . miracle no but will i take those results anytime . during the 4-5week , i still plucked a few really deep stubborn ingrown hairs . with about 1-2 weeks left of the first bottle i am convinced and satisfied it worked . my wife and some friends made a point of saying my skin looked clearer/smoother after a month of usage . ordered 2nd bottle and the plans are to keep using the product at least another 2 months . i figure about 3months should be a good gauge as to where i 'd like my face to be . i do agree with some posts that it does a somewhat decent job of evening out ones skin tone . the smell was absolutley acceptable and not so overwhelming that it would wash out ones cologne or parfume . of course i am still researching other products -LRB- like anthony 's logistics , min ny solutions2 -RRB- and will keep you posted after 3 months -LRB- 12/31/2009 -RRB- of princereigns . so yes , i would say give it a try and see if it works for you . for now i would say so far so good - this product is better than most .
 This is the first product review I 've ever written . I always mean to write them , but life tends to get in the way.I was compelled to write a review for the Prince Reigns gel . I was skeptical about this product but desperate nonetheless to find something that would help me with my ingrown-hair problem . I heard about it in a beauty magazine -LRB- and read that Gisele Bundchen , who is quite often modeling in bikinis and underwear , uses it ! -RRB- and thought why not . I 've been trying my whole adult life to figure out how to get rid of this problem.I can not believe how much it has already helped . The hairs have straightened , and the itchy bumps have disappeared . I have pale skin , and have some embarrassing scarring from previous ingrown hairs , which the gel seems to be help lightening . It is quite literally a miracle in a bottle for me ! I never thought I 'd find something to help this . I 'm beyond relieved and thrilled.One tip -- be sure to use the gel as the bottle says , both morning and night and after you wax/shave , to make sure it works to its fullest potential.P.S . Do n't worry about the price of the bottle -- it lasts forever !
 I have only been using this gel for about four days and already I 'm seeing results ! My hair tends to curl and hide under my skin , plus it 's usually thick hair . I have had an ingrown hair for , I do n't even know how long - probably years , I always had a huge bump and I would try to dig out the hair with no luck . After two days of using this gel , all of the sudden , a long hair emerged from this bump in my skin and the bump finally went away ! I recommend this to everyone ... I am buying more for my friends and family !
 I had heard of this in LA before and its in all the goodie bags at these award ceremony 's but It was never available to us regular folk . I had tried Tend Skin -LRB- horrible -RRB- and It just burns the hell out of my skin . Princereigns worked miracles for me in 2-3 days . It removed all my ingrown hairs and bumps and I also had those little dark dots where hair is starting to grow and I didnt notice them anymore . I can go 3 days without shaving or trimming down there now and its not noticeable . WOW , living in LA I am ofetn in a bikini or top with sarong so it is key for me . I highly recommend this stuff for all the girls out there .
 I ordered this product and received a serum . So it says on the bottle.Anyway , I like this product . It 's more effective then Tend Skin and you do n't need cotton rounds to apply it . I use epilator -LRB- a device that pulls hair out at root level -RRB- on my underarms , legs and bikini line.This product came in handy . I 've never had an ingrown hair ever since .
 I 've held back on reviewing this for a while because I wanted to make sure it worked over the long term . As it turns out , it does -- to an extent . I like the fact it is natural and does n't leave a burning sensation , but it does tingle -LRB- it might in fact burn if you have sensitive skin -RRB- . It works like it claims and teases out a lot of ingrown hairs , and tones down the red spots , but it does not entirely remove blemishes and dark spots from previous cases of ingrown hairs . Since removing the hair depends on how fast your hair grows , it 's effectiveness as a `` remover '' can vary.It 's helped me a lot , but it 's not a cure-all for ingrown hair and bumps . While expensive , I find that I do n't use that much -LRB- but I do n't use it for legs -RRB- , so one bottle will last me a long time . The gel is surprisingly thick and spreads very well . If you need something for a very large surface area , you might want to try something more economical .
 I am probably the last one of all of you to find out about this product , but I 'm blown away by the results I 've seen . I had never heard about it until I just sort of stumbled upon it about 3 weeks ago . I had some ingrown hairs in my eyebrow area , & needed something to help this . I had heard about `` Tend Skin , '' & went online & read about it . I had fully intended to buy this . However , I was browsing the internet , & typed in `` ingrown hairs , '' and the Princereigns info was brought up . I was intrigued about this product being in several magazines like `` In Style , '' etc. , & the fact that there was info that Angelina Jolie uses this . I think that her complexion is gorgeous . I then went to several of the beauty boards to read reviews , but could n't find any . I then went to Amazon.com , & read testimonials that convinced me to give it a try . It is supposed to remove bumps on your face , as well as dark spots & ingrown hairs . I began to notice a difference in my complexion the second day , which is hard to believe , even for me . Some of the bumps that had been there for years were just gone , and my skin looked so clear . One bump just went away , leaving a long hair that had been clogged in it . I 've had so many problems with my skin the last few years that I 've been going to a spa and having lactic acid peels and facials . However , the peels are very expensive , and I 've noticed only a very small improvement . I 've used this product now for about 3 weeks , and have already ordered three more bottles . I am sort of rationing it until my new bottles come in . I do n't want to be without this gel ever . The lady that does my peels and facials is going to be disappointed that I do n't have to come back , but my complexion has not looked this good in years . In fact , I do n't think that I 'll have to even wear foundation pretty soon . I 'm truly amazed at this product . It does n't burn , sting , or have a strong smell , etc. , and is made from aloe and natural fruit ingredients . When I am just around the house , I do n't wear makeup , and have used this product about 3 times a day , rather than the 2 times recommended . Also , I find that only 1 thin layer massaged in well is enough for 1 application . I wash my face , and then let it dry . Then I apply the Princereigns , and let it dry before I put my foundation , which goes on smoothly over this . When I wash my face with cleanser , I use a warm wash cloth , and very gently massage it over my face . I can see big knots of white , like an imbedded blackhead roll out . Like I say , I 'm blown away by this product , and just had to rave !
 I 'm African-american and my specific hair texture is prone to getting ingrowns around the bikini area . Let me tell you , I 've gone to many-a-really high end spa in hopes of finding professionals who are more `` clean '' than your downtown nail shop . Turns out , I get ingrowns no matter where I go or how much I spend for my brazilians . Lucky for me , a new brazilian wax salon opened up near where I live . I tried them , it hurt like hell , but totally worth it . After a few visits , I got comfortable with my wax lady and I asked her what to do about ingrowns . She applied some of the soothing green Prince Reigns gel for me right then and there , and recommended that I purchase a bottle from the front . She also told me to apply to my bikini area three times a day to prevent ingrowns . I decided to give it a shot , because it felt great when she rubbed it in . It did n't burn , AT ALL , even though my skin was screaming from being freshly waxed.I have NOT had an ingrown since . For real.And I would also like to mention that I did not apply three times a day . I 'm horrible at routines , and I bareley do it everyday . I do it every other day-ish , and I have not had an ingrown since . I. LOVE . THIS . STUFF . It 's cool and soothing and goes on smooth.The only slightly -LRB- but barely -RRB- negative thing I would say ... is that for me , it has not removed the scars from previous ingrowns . I do n't mind this though , because like I said , I wont be getting ingrowns ever again.One last caveat ... I 've tried TendSkin before . TendSkin makes my skin look crazy ; it peels and turns an ashy grey , and it is so dry that it 's brittle to the touch . GROSS.hope this helps ! I 've never written a review before ! :--RRB- there 's no spell check ?! lol
 I tried it and it works great , within 4 days . Shipping was quick and though its a bit on the expensive side its worth it.Plus my legs a smooth and silky
 Saved my love life , literally.It worked for me in a couple days and though its a tad pricey well worth the money , doesnt burn or sting either . If only all other stuff I used worked this good I coulda had a date to the prom . Cause I tried everything.Thanks Princereigns
 If you dont mind shelling out the $ 24 bucks.I got ta say it works and it works quick . NO MORE BUMPS BABY!Plus it evened out my dark spots , More smooth looking so thats hot.Alll in all its worth it ,
 There seemed to be alot of hype around this product so I decided to try it . I have problems after shaving my legs with stupid ingrown hairs . I honestly ca n't say that I love it - it was n't the total answer I had hoped for - but it certainly has helped . I suspect that it could work better on some than others just by the nature of the product .
 This products works okay but you have to use it a couple of days before the hair appears . One thing it did do was stop the pain from the ingrown Hair.Overall it is a good product but you have to use it continuously .
 This product really works ! I purchased it to use based on the past reviews after purchasing a depilatory device . I have been tired of shaving my legs and having problems with ingrown hairs . I decided to give this product a try and have been amazed at how well it has worked . I find that the hair on my legs comes in straighter rather than under the skin and the pores on my legs appear smaller and overall my legs are always smoother and the skin looks better when I use this product . I left it at a vacation home of mine and found that when I stopped using it the problem ingrown hairs were back . This is a miracle product ! Thank you , thank you !
 This product works wonderfully ! After just a couple of applications , I was completely clear of problems . I use it now just once a week for prevention .
 This stuff works great . I have had razor bumps since I was 16 and it had made me feel insecure in a way cause I had always thought that I wasnt ever at my 100 % because of it . After using Princereigns for 1 week half of my bumps were gone and in 2 weeks it all cleared up and I started to feel great about myself and more confident it is remarkable . I just had to share this info because I know theres alot of guys out there that feel like me . Oh and P.S. I also tried all the other BS out there like `` Tend Skin '' aka liquid Fire and Magic Shave , Min roller and even Nads -LRB- I was desperate -RRB- but as you all know they are all garbage .
 I recommend Princereigns for women . It worked within a week , healing my bumps and blisters from shaving - without drying my skin . The hair grew back straight rather than curling . I had used Bump Patrol , which is about one third the price , but it dried my skin , causing peeling and took weeks to notice any difference . Tend Skin did n't work at all for me , Bikini Zone was a joke and complete waste of my money . Princereigns costs a bundle but it lasts forever .
 This stuff is very nice . It wo n't work miracles , but if you 're taking good care of your skin already , this will do a great job topping that off . I get fewer ingrown hairs and razor issues than before , but I still get one every once and again .
 I have very curly hair , so I get ingrowns everywhere . Just a little bit of this stuff and the hairs unwind & come to the surface . I love it . As a woman , application is a bit silly , tho . Because it 's so expensive , I do n't want to waste it so I end up dabbing a bit on each individual ingrown which takes forever . Men using this for ingrowns probably wo n't have that problem . This is slightly scented , but it 's a clean smell , not flowery or masculine , so anyone can use it .
 this product definitely helps A LOT . i was very skeptical but decided to try it anyway . I LOVE IT . It helps with bumps , irritation , the little hairs that are stuck underneath quickly peak out . and I dont even use it constantly . -LRB- who knows maybe if I did my condition would be completely gone -RRB- WORTH TRYING for sure .
 i am enjoying this . i use this as a shaving gel to shave with the panasonic wet/dry electric razor . i can tell the difference on my bikini line . ingrown hair starting to fade after just 2 days of shaving with it .
 It seemed like once I hit my late 30s , I started getting all kinds of painful bumps or `` boils '' in my groin area . My OBGYN said it was ingrown hairs ... I found that hard to believe since some would end up on the inside of my thigh where there is no hair . I started researching and came across Princereigns and decided to give it a try . It took about 2 weeks for me ... but I noticed I wasnt getting those bumps anymore . I figured maybe I was just having a `` dry spell '' but kept using it . Its been about 2 years now that I have been using it and I very rarely get any bumps or boils at all . I used it once a day for the 1st year or so , now I used it every 3 or 4 days . One time I stopped for about 2 weeks , and those bumps started coming back . 2 of my friends at work started talking about having the same problems I did and I told them to try this and they did , and are amazed . Its been about 1 month and neither 1 of them has gotten any at all . I say if you have problems like this , try it ... just one bottle . If you dont notice any difference at all , then dont buy it again but to me , $ 25 total is sooo worth it to get rid of those horrible bumps ! And now it lasts me several months since I dont use it as much , so $ 25 every 3 months or so is not bad for the relief !
 Really good stuff . I just switched from TendSkin to this . Not because TendSkin does n't work , because it does work very well , but because it seems this stuff lasts longer . Which of course means I 'm switching because of the slight cost difference . But yeah , this stuff really works great ! I would think for starters one should use it twice a day , then after a week start using it only once a day and you 'll get great results . I like how the bottle is designed as well , the bottom lifts so you do n't have to tilt it upsidedown when the bottle is almost gone to try and get that last bit out .
 Now I finally have the look and feel of a celebrity . The best product on earth period ! I 've tried all ingrown hair product 's since 1985 beleive me Ive ' spent thousand of dollars , nothing comes close to it `` forget about it '' Saliylic Acid is history in my book . Sorry Dermatologist their is a cure . I bought 1 bottle before christmas 2006 . Since the new year 2007 started I 've already bought 2 bottle 's and I 'm spreading the word . Do n't delay a smooth and perfect face is just a few days away.Thanks to all who have complimented my slick and smooth face.J . Diaz Aka -LRB- Papi rico -RRB-
 I got this to help with razor bumps and ingrown hair around my bikini line . Red bumps are so embarassing during swim suit season . I apply this to the area after I shave and no more red bumps or ingrown hairs . My husband is African American and I recommended he use it on his face after shaving . He just started using it and it works great for him too ! A little goes a long way . I 've had this bottle for over a year and still have a lot left . I do n't use it everyday though . But now that my husband is using it , I may have to buy more . I also like that the scent is not too powerful , it is light . If you have problems with razor bumps or ingrown hairs , this is the product to get .
 I 've tried Tend Skin and a bunch of others but I 've been using this for about a month and it really works better than anything I 've ever tried . Recommended .
 My entire shaving life I 've dealt with razor burns , ingrown hairs , and bumps . Even so I 've been way too much of a chicken to wax or sugar . Up until this product I pretty much avoided tanks and swim suits , which is fine for the area I live in . But I found myself having to move to sunny southern California and I became a little bit panicked . My sister had used this product before and referred it to me . By this time I 'd used my fair share of serums , natural and chemical . None really worked , but Princereigns ... wow . WOW !!! No more bumps , no more razor burns and no more ingrown hair . The level of excitement I have at the results is almost ridiculous really , but I 've NEVER been confident wearing a tank or swimsuit and now I am ! So happy ! I 'll be using this stuff forever and recommending it to everyone I know.The bottle says to apply twice a day , but I 'm so forgetful I only do it once a day but it still fixed my problems ! I shave less and the bumps and whatnot were gone after 4 days . FOUR DAYS ! Try this stuff , it 's not expensive so give it a shot !
 Works as stated and all though it is a tad on the expensive side it works and works well , no burning or stinging at all and helped get rid of my dark spots too . All and all a good product
 It works , but not for all of them . I do n't use it as much as it says I should , though . . so I 'm pretty sure that 's the only reason why . Even with occasional use I 've seen a dramatic reduction in ingrown hairs .
 I am really happy with this product . It arrived before expected and works really well . I waxed my bikini area and got several very bad ingrown hairs . I 've been using the serum for about a week and can see a significant difference . Some reviews say the product did n't work as great as expected ; I suggest they be more liberal with the application . I noticed results after 3 or 4 days of use , but when I applied more -LRB- 2 pumps instead of 1 -RRB- I saw even better results . The product is a little costly , but for small areas like face and bikini it will last a while . Definitely highly recommend . I 've already told several friends about it . Overall , I 'm very happy with the product and service .
 It really helps the ingrowns grow out . A bump would come to the surface and then heal after just a week of use . It smells good , and feels good going on . Dries quickly . Waaaaay to expensive though . I used this for full leg bikini application and it only lasted about 3 weeks with daily use . The other thing is that it leaves a kind of film on your leg , which is n't noticable when it 's dry , but when you shower , it gets kinda slimy . Weird , but does n't affect the effectiveness of the prodcut .
 This stuff really is better than Tend Skin or other anti-ingrown gels . I do think it 's made a noticeable difference after one or two weeks . The problem is that there 's not enough in a bottle ! Or , alternatively , it 's too expensive . But it 's nice stuff . Warning
 It dries out the problem in no time ! A little bit of this stuff goes along way . It works likes a charm .
 Prince Reigns product for ingrown hairs is wonderful . My friend and I tried it for the first time last month and fell in love with the product . Not only did it help with ingrown hairs , but it 's great to shave with - makes your legs feel amazing !
 I have seen much improvement in the bikini line area with the use of Princereigns Ingrown Hair Gel . I still have a few brown spots but am by far pleased with the results i have had . Thankyou .
 It took a couple days but I have no bumps or ingrowns so that is awesome.Worth every penny
 Fast delivery . Product in good condition . Really works . Loved the results . My son was home for a visit from the Navy and thought it was so great , he took it with him to share with the other officers on his ship .
 I really adore this product , I use it all the time . I really gets rid of the red bumps on my legs that I get from shaving and also just from dry skin . I most often see results the next day , and sometimes after two days of use . I also love that you do n't have to use it all the time , only when you need it ! This product also helps to soothe and heal ingrown hairs , so I find it really useful when I get my legs waxed.Some people have said in other reviews that the product is a little bit sticky after use , but that only lasts for a minute or so ... If it 's more than that you 're probably using too much . That 's another great thing about this product ; you do n't need to use a lot to see results.I definitely recommend this product to people looking to get rid of red bumps or ingrown hairs . For me , it even moisturizes my skin , and softens it . Five stars !
 This product is just Amazing !! I have suffered for many many years from ingrown hairs -LRB- ever since I started shaving -RRB- . I have tried everything over the counter even some old fashioned home remedies and they where all sadly disappointing.Princereigns has changed my life forever . The results are fantastic !! I am proud to say `` I ca n't wait to go to the beach this summer ! '' I love this product . A little pricey but I do n't care it is so worth it.I highly recommend this product .

 Arrived quickly and packaged right.No burning or stinging and worked for me .
 I 've been using this product for a month now and the ingrown hair problem has decrease so far . I encorage you to try it .
 My husband used it so I stole it from him and have been a fan ever since , THIS IS THE BEST STUFF ON EARTH , cleared up my bikini line in a matter of days and now i use it to shave my legs also , I cant sing enough praise for this stuff , now I know why people have hyped it up so much . It works
 WONDERFUL PRODUCT !! I have struggled for years with ingrown facial hair -LRB- especially on my neck -RRB- . I have used dozens of products over the years and I find Princereigns to be the best to help control and eliminate ingrown facial hair on my neck . I have used this product for about 2 years and could n't be happier with the product !! However , my only complaint is the shipping method this reseller decided to use . They shipped the package to me via USPS with SIGNATURE REQUIRED . This made it VERY inconvenient because I had to make a special trip to the post office to SIGN and pickup this package . I will not use this particular reseller again since it is not convenient to make a special trip to the USPS office to sign and pickup the package .
 Im a long time tend skin user and once I stopped using tend skin and started using this ... I noticed a dramatic improvement . Tend skin works . . dont get me wrong but it didnt suit my skin type it would dry me out all the time and cause me to have an itchy face . This stuff does not dry me out , has no unpleasant smell , and can be used on acne and it works very fast . This stuff easily replaced the tend skin in my opinion , remember they both work but this has a lot less of the drawbacks that tend skin has .
 I used to get ingrown hairs after I shaved and although I still get a few , this product has exponentially decreased them . It is a little more money than other products but it actually does work ! I use it every time I get out of the shower , even when I do not shave . Give it a shot , I truely am a happy customer and am about to reorder another bottle .
 I have always had a problem with the bikini area . I have tried every diffrent way to remove the hair but always had bumps and ingrown hairs . I tried Tend Skin first and that did help some , but nothing like Princereigns . This stuff cleared everything up . I still get some ingrown hairs but nothing like before . When I do get an ingrown hair the gel seems to clear the skin up quickly . For the first time in my life I have a smooth , clear , bikini line . I would definately suggest trying this product .
 I have used this product for over 2 months now and it really does reduce the bumps and irritation . I have shaved as well as use hair remover and it has always kept the irritation down as well as reduced the bumps . I used to have a lot of red bumps after shaving and I would put lotion on it and other things but it would never reduce or make the bumps go away . I tried this product and after using it the bumps went away and stays away . I love this product .
 I have had issues with bumps caused by ingrown hairs from my late teens to my early thirties . I went to a dermatologist years ago and got a shot in my scalp and took some ointments that helped for a long time but it was expensive.Years have past and the bumps came back to make matters worse , I was invited to a wedding and I always shave my head and the bumps are here again in all their pain full glory . Any one who has had these kind of bumps on the back of their scalps and their faces can tell you how pain full and how much these bumps itch.I have used TendSkin in the past but it burns and leaves my skin really dry , With the wedding coming up and the itching driving me nuts , I jumped on amazon.com and eureka I found the wonder gel and here comes the great part I have only used it for two days now and the itching has stopped and the bumps are shrinking , I recommend this product to any one who wants to get rid of the bumps caused by ingrown hairs .
 Dries quickly , and has soothing aloe which is good especially if you have razor burn . Works pretty good I think . I put it on after my shower . A little goes a very long way . There 's no odor , and very thin when applied . Absorbs almost immediatley . It 's worth it if you do n't want nasty ingrown hairs or razor bumps to show !
 It is pricey but hell I woulda paid double cause it cleared up my face in 4 days and I cant tell you how much of a pain ingrowns were to my skin.GOOD STUUFF
 I purchased this product after having suffered with chronic ingrown hairs on my bikini and stomach areas . I often had one or two on my stomach that would be there for months as a huge inflamed red thing that would n't go away . I 'd tried alternatives , like Bump patrol and bikinizone which did n't work that well , and pfb vanish which worked slightly better . However , after applying this for a few weeks my chronic ingrowns disappeared -LRB- leaving an inch long hair coming out -RRB- and did n't come back -LRB- or if i did get another big one , it only lasted for a few days -RRB- . I 've also started using an exfoliating brush , one that is very stiff and you use when dry . That , combined with princereigns has gotten my skin back close to normal . My life has literally changed with it . I 'd recommend using it with the brush , and being consistent . Good luck !
 I was wary about trying another product that would supposedly solve my ingrown hair problems especially with the cost and the seemingly small amount you get.I use an epilator so I really needed something that would help with my ingrown hairs , I was surprised that after 2 days of usage I noticed a difference . It seems to help make deep ingrown hairs visible but it does a better job at preventing and making your skin feel a bit softer . I already got rid of a couple of ingrown hairs that had been hanging out under my skin for a couple of weeks which made me really happy.I would recommend this product because even though you do n't seem to get a lot it 's worth not having to deal with ingrown hairs and if you only use it once a day it seems just as good . Also it does n't really smell.Cons
 At first when I bought this product I thought that it would n't work , another over expensive thing . I have had ingrown hairs for years , anytime I shave or do anything to remove the hair , and it 's not just a couple its many , tons of them . I recently bought tend skin and that only helped a little bit!This product Princereigns worked exactly as described ! I shaved then applied the gel to my legs , and not one ingrown hair !! The dark spots I do have are slowly disappearing , takes time though . This product works perfectly !
 this is , by far , the easiest curling iron i 've ever owned . you just place the handle part on top of your head , then -LRB- with the kevlar glove on -RRB- you twist a section of hair around the iron , and hold it for a few seconds . then you just slide the iron out of the curl . it leaves no `` kink '' mark because there 's no clip ! depending on how thick the sections of hair are , you can have really tight spiral curls or looser , wavier curls . i have one-length , shoulder-length hair , and i made lots of loose curls that were so cute and sassy !
 this is the best curling iron I 've ever had , I have never been able to get the beachy waves I 've always wanted , until I got the enzo milano . the iron is super hot , and creates the best curls , a little tricky to work with at first but you quickly get the hang of it . I suggest sectioning your hair when you use this , and alternating the way you wrap the curls around the iron to create a more natural look . I you want a curl that is more set , when you slip the iron out of the hair , pin the curl to your hair , and repeat with ever curl you do , once your entire head is done and pinned start taking them out one by one , it will leave nice bouncy curls that are super set . I recommend this to everyone !
 I bought this curling iron because I saw a friend 's hair style after she bought it . It gives you a curl that you see now in fashion magazines and it is easy to use ! I was very impressed after using it the first time . It really did n't take that long to achieve the look . My only recommendation for the product itself is that it needs some sort of stand to sit on the countertop .
 I love this curling iron ! it 's so easy to get the hang of , heats up fast , gives me the exact curls I want -LRB- in between wavy & tight curls -RRB- , and a reasonable price ! I really recommend this !
 This Was My First Curling Iron and i did ALOT of research on it so i could get one that best fits me ... I wanted sumthing to give me beautiful curls , that were not so time consuming , but would last ! At first i was gon na get a regular curling iron , until i was at the mall at a stand , that looked just like this one . -LRB- NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING AT THE MALL -RRB- But as i continued to research the item i knew that the one at the mall was an imitation of Enzo Milano and me wanting the best quality decided to purchase the original . when i went on the EnZo MiLaNo website i noticed the videos they were showing videos demostrating how the curling iron work . the one on the videos was different from the one the company is selling now . The barrel was steel NOT teflon . i looked it up online at AMAZON because they always have great deals and i noticed that some went for 145 $ while this one was only 35 $ i couldnt Believe my Eyes . so i immediatly went to look at the reviews to see what others had to say about this product and there was NO reviews at the time ! So now i was More Skeptical than before , but i took a chance and bought it anyways . I mean thats a steal if it works , i was not going to let that pass me up . and if it didnt work i thought to myself that at least it didnt cost but 35 $ intead of 145 $ !!! My husband ordered it for me around Christmas time and it was here in 3 day . that was Awesome because i couldnt wait to try it out ! in the box , it came with a lifetime warranty , the glove and the curling iron . It is very easy to use , all you do is get a section of your hair wrap it from the base to the tip of the barrel , hold for like 30 seconds to a minute -LRB- depending how tight you would like to have your curl -RRB- and peel the tip of your hair and pull PRESTO ! its majic , it really works . I was Ecstatic , Before you know it i was done w / my whole head . -LRB- you would be suprised how HOT this things Curling iron gets ! MUCH HOTTER THAN A REGULAR CURLING IRON and no clip to fool around with ! =-RRB- -RRB- Thats a thumbs up for me ! Just play around with it and you will get the of it and get faster at it . you can make wavy curls , loose curls and shirly temple curls.There were a few things that could be improved like a light to show when its on and a better heat glove because it doesnt work that well to protect your hands from the heat . Frankly i could get more protection from my fall gloves than from this thin thing ! and a swivel cord would be nice so the wire wont get tangled . And one more thing if you flat iron your hair Before using the curling iron , the CURL WONT HOLD AT ALL . you can wash , blowdryand add hair products but your hair has to be preety much as is . -LCB- idk if thats w / all curling irons but the sucks ! -RCB- But Hey for 35 $ Who Can complain ! It Gets the JoB Done .
 I 'm Asian and my hair will only hold a curl for a little while . After using this curler my curls were bouncy and lasted for a very long time . The curls looked very cute and peicey even after I ran my fingers through my hair . I did n't use any styling products to preserve my curls , just some biosilk . At first I did n't like that it did n't have a clip to hold the hair but this makes it so you do n't get any kinks in your ends . This also means you will be using two hands to curl your hair . My arms were killing me when I used it . I accidently placed mine on a plastic bag and it melted onto the curler . When it cooled the plastic peeled off completely . The curler also has no on/off light which puzzled me because it is a basic feature on most curlers . I really do like this curler and wish I bought mine on Amazon for this price . I paid 117 for mine , grrr ! So , if you 've got hard to curl hair this curler is for you .
 I have been using Miracle Oil to soften a surgical scar . With regular use , it softens the skin and helps to ease the stretching pain .
 I use this oil for everything . Acne , scrapes , cuticles , cracked heels , etc. . The smell alone is amazing . Thank you for such a wonderful product .
 I absolutely love this product ! I use it for almost everything . I originally got this to help with ingrown hairs that I sometimes get from waxing . It not only prevented hair bumps , it also got rid of the scares from prior ones . . So then , I decided to use it on my face as a moisturizer and I hardly ever breakout anymore . . It also keeps my nails from breaking and they are actually growing healthier than when I was going to the nail salon every two weeks . I thought my nails were a hopeless case . Now , I do n't have to get fake nails for my wedding day . . This is by far , the best product I have ever come across in skin care and no where near as costly . It 's my all-in-one skin care solution .
 Love this oil . It is organic and healing . Just massage it into your skin wherever it is dry . Works wonders .
 this is a healing product . I have had cracked bleedingdry fingers , and this oil has help heal the cracks , and works great !
 This stuff is incredible !! I used this on a burn I had on my hand -LRB- from hot soup -RRB- and it went away . I also used it on a rash I had on my chest -LRB- remniscent of blister/burn -RRB- and it completely went away !!! I ca n't say enough good things about this product - it really is a miracle oil !!
 I love the smell of this oil . It is n't overpowering but definitely lasts long enough for that uplifting , refreshing aroma through the day . I also put a few drops into my laundry for my bedding . Fantastic !
 I 've used this product at my nail salon for 4 years and it works great ! Helps heal nails and make them much stronger . I finally ordered two bottles for the house .
 All Natural , this product used twice a day on post surgical scars literally made them disappear!I purchased this for my niece who is now 7 months pregnant and horrified about stretch marks . She has been rubbing all over her bellie and so far not a mark.We need more . I only wish it came in a larger size !
 This is a great Product - use it for everything for dry skin to a little on my hair for shine -
 This was recommended to me to aid me in getting rid of a fungus on my toes . I think it really helped .
 Nice oil , works well . It really moisturize the area that you would like to work on . I would definatley order it again .
 This is my go to men 's fragrance . It is the perfect combination of cool fresh scent and warm scent . It is very refreshing but not too dull and forgettable . Plus it 's not overly used like Coolwater or Aqua di Gio so you wo n't run into anyone else wearing it too often . I get people asking me what cologne I 'm wearing from time to time because they love it and have never smelled anything like it .
 I bought this years ago at a dept store for my husband and he loved it . It 's a light citrus scent and smells yummy ! After a few years I could no longer find it in stores , so I searched online and it popped up on Amazon ! Yea ! Just gave it to him for his bday and he was all excited to have it again . Now I know I can always find it here
 I bought this as a valentine 's day gift for my husband and he loved it ! Speedy delivery and no problems with product will order again in the near future .
 The name says it all !!! This is the best cologne I have smelled to date ! I love this ~ Of course it helps , that I love the person who is wearing it too . . LOL . . but the cologne is great !
 I love this fragance ! I think it would be a perfect gift for any man .
 My fianc&eacute; and I were discussing the new men 's fragrances on the market and how none of them really stood out . He mentioned that he use to wear Paradise By Alfred Sung For Men a long time ago and really liked it , but could n't find it anymore . The first place I checked was Amazon and I surprised him with it for Christmas.It smells SO GOOD ! When I smelled Paradise on him , all I could say was , `` Ooohhh , intoxicating ... '' ;--RRB- We love it !
 I am hooked . I am not a huge scent wearing guy , but this has to be my new favorite . People will take notice n a good way .
 product sent as promised . arrived in one day -LRB- using supersaver free shipping that was supposed to be 5-7 days . -RRB- buy stock in amazon !!
 This cologne rocks it is so fresh and clean Outkast should do a song about it the ladies will love it smelling it reminds me of being on some tropical island with hot chicks in thongs , nice thought , buy it or dont that means more for me
 I have been buying Sung For Men since around 1989 or so . It 's a fave . I tried HEI before and thought it was pretty good . Now I decided to give Paradise a try.It is a nice , fresh , clean-smelling cologne that is sure to please most who like a nice citrus fragance to add to their character . I am glad I tried this one out . My favorite is still Sung Por Homme . . the original Sung For Men , which is easily recognized by it 's Purple color.Both Paradise and Sung For Men are considered FOUGERE scents . J.M.
 This scent is just so clean and fresh , a great scent for a man of today .
 Nice , fresh , clean scent that 's perfect for any occasion . Good price ; excellent value for money ... this means I 'll be coming back !
 If paradise had a scent ... this would be it . I was vert satisfied with the product and it didnt take long to get it . This is an underated classic . Love it !
 i purchased this cologne from a marshalls or tjmax . As soon as i opened the box i oould smell a signature cologne , something that was unforgetable . soft , but deep smelling , green , airy.nothing else i have in my collection of 20 + smells like this one .
 I used this cologne prior to my purchase and it smelled amazing so I had to find and purchase it I really recommend
 Although this fragrance came out quite some time ago and is no longer made , it still smells quite nice if you like the lighter more fruit-based fragrances . For the price offered on Amazon , you just ca n't beat it for a cologne to have around for use when out running errands , etc. when you do n't want to wear your more expensive scents but still like to smell nice !
 This scent is great ! Very clean and light , citrus-y and fresh smelling . I 've been wearing it for years and every woman that smells it on me has that `` wow what is that ? '' reaction . I love it . Unfortunately , it 's hard to find these days . This price is fantastic !! I bought 3 of them and it 's the real thing . All came sealed in retail boxes . I purchased from the famous auction site once and got a fake one so it 's nice to get the real thing for this price . I think I 'll get another 3 in case they run out or discontinue .
 Paradise is a great scent , Day or Night , one of my top 10 ever . Used it years ago and found it again here on Amazon . Iam Back !! Great Price ...
 I have been crazy about Hermes Merveilles for a very long time and I finally own it ! It is my favorite orange and woody scent !
 I LOVE this product . It goes on smooth , stays on a long time , and is exactly the color as pictured !
 It 's been years and I 'm still devastated they discontinued this product . I 've received so many compliments over the years -LRB- and from complete strangers ! -RRB- that I 've lost count . Do n't be fooled by `` Pure , '' which smells like an alcohol swab . It smells nothing like `` Pure Moment '' despite the name similarity . I keep hoping a miracle happens and Sung brings it back , but in the meantime I buy it off the net when available . It 's not easy to find , but believe me , it 's WORTH IT . If you find it , TRY IT ! -LRB- Or better yet , tell me where you found it ... :-RRB- -RRB- sigh ...
 Believe it or not I use this skin cream for my tattoos , I am sure it was not meant for this , But it works Great . Also works great to smooth elbows
 i have been using the spearmint cream for about a month and my skin is clear and soft . I am very happy with the results as well as my dermatologist who ca n't believe the results he has seen . I have had this for 15 years and it 's almost gone . Thank you Fernwoood Soap .
 for decades I have suffered from -LRB- and with -RRB- dandruff . I have tried them all - the usual suspects like Head & Shoulders , T-gel , etc. , and the best I got was temporary relief.Then , about 4 years ago my wife brought me home the Rusk Purify shampoo from her hair salon , and I tried it . WOW ! Dandruff gone , healthy hair , no strange fragrance or chemical odor . Plus , this has to be the most concentrated shampoo I have ever used . . just a drop or two will do the trick . Which means it is great as a travel shampoo , packing months into the carry-on 3 ounce -LRB- 100ml -RRB- airplane limit .
 just a dime sized dollop does the job for 2 days . great price cleans and shines what more can you ask for ?
 I originally bought this for my son who has an itchy scalp . Well , when my husband , who washes his oily hair every day , ran out of his shampoo he tried the Rusk . He originally said he did n't like it ; however , I began noticing him coming home from his physically demanding job without oily hair plastered to his head . Now he wants to use it , as it has made a huge difference ! We ran out of the Rusk recently , and had to order more ~ I do n't like paying more for stuff than I have to ~ but the extra cost of this shampoo is definitely worth it !
 I am one of those people who suffer from dandruff -LRB- the shame !!!! -RRB- . I had tried all of the usual and even some unusual products on the market , all the way from the mass market shampoos to the boutique shampoos to the fragrant tar based shampoos -LRB- ah , the essence of La Brea right on your scalp -RRB- . Nothing was really effective -LRB- not just dandruff effective , but also cost effective -RRB- . Then my wife spotted this product at her hair salon , and I bought a smallish bottle - that was 2003 . Have n't had a dandruff problem since!The shampoo is amazing - a small drop will provide luxurious lather - I always wet , lather , rinse , re-lather , let it sit while I shower , and then thoroughly rinse . So , about once a year I buy my litre of Rusk Purify and live is good . -LRB- PS , it is so concentrated it makes a great travel shampoo since the allowed 3.3 ounces , 100 ml will last one about 2 weeks ! -RRB- A fresh , clean light herbal scent remains with the exfoliated scalp flakes all gone.Do yourself and your head a favor - get Rusk Purify and lose your dandruff .
 Bought as part of a hair cutting outfit . All items purchased worked together to provided good haircuts saving money over time .
 I have yet to find anyone wearing it other than myself , but it is always complimented . I 've worn it for years and I very much enjoy it . The first time I purchased it , I went through over 20 scents before picking this one . When it was presented to me by the saleswoman , she said that it was the most edible scent they had . I agree .
 My Husband really enjoys the smell of this . . We were very pleased to find this because we searched everywheres for this product and could not find it thanks for a great product
 This is one of my favorite colognes , very unique and long lasting scent . Is a hybrid scent between a classic and modern aroma .
 What a great deal and a great scent . I get comliments everytime I wear this cologne . I was unable to find it for some time and ran across it through Amazon at a terrific price . I will order it again when I run out .
 My son loves this stuff and I wasnt able to find it in the local stores so I found it at my favorite place to shop ... . and it was sent right out and its the real thing .
 My dad has been wearing this for years , but can no longer find it in stores here at home . So I was thrilled that I could get this for him for Father 's Day on Amazon!It arrived in a timely manner and he loved it !
 Tiene un aroma excelente , el producto lleg&oacute; en su empaque original y la entrega en tiempo oportuno . Buen precio comparado con el tama & ntilde ; o del producto . Recomiendo este perfume y este vendedor para sus futuras compras .
 The lavender almond creme is soothing with a refreshing scent . I use it on my feet and elbows . The creme is a must for the sensitive and thin-skin areas of my body -LRB- bikini line and vagina , entire breasts esp . nipples and areola -RRB- . It moisturizes quickly and deeply , which cuts down on the rubbing and friction and pulling on sensitive skin . The soothing scent is aromatic when opening the jar , but it is not overpowering and once it is on your body -LRB- and not the large amount in the jar -RRB- , the pleasant aroma is less noticeable . It remains a personal scent the way all scents and fragrances were meant to be . No one can smell you coming from a mile away or even 4 feet away -LRB- smile -RRB- . I used to buy the almond creme , which I really love but I did n't see it as a choice so I have been buying the lavender almond creme . The creme really does heal and protect my skin .
 I purchased this item when my husband and I happened to stop at the crafters village in MD during their Holiday Light pagent in early December . The creme absorbs quickly and gives off such a wonderful scent . The lavender scent 's calming abilities are an added bonus at the end of a long day . The skin on my hands is soft each morning when I wake up to start a new day . What more could a person ask for ?! I 'm sending a gift basket with this product to my Mom who justs loves natural products . I really recommend this product for anyone who has dry skin on their hands . The Holiday Craft show is worth a look see , too !!!
 this stuff works great on my clippers . I shave my head once a week and use this to clean the blades once a month . The cap is just the right size to use as a bowl for cleaning .
 I 've always cut my husbands hair but never really cared or worried about how well I cleaned the clippers I guess . This time , after buying some BETTER clippers than I 've had in the past , I decided to also try this cleaner . Well worth it . Really cleans and lubes the blades so it is ready for the next hair cut . Just put a small amount in a small dish and run the blades in it for several seconds . Then I oil as normal . Like using new clippers every time .
 great product , got more out after I thought it was clean . left a little oily residue so it helps lubricate too . definitely a must have
 i love this product for my clipper blades removes all those little hairs and keeps the blades moving smoothly for continuous great haircuts
 It keeps my expensive Oster clipper blades in good shape . Just a little after each grooming cleans them up ready for next use .
 These head towels are wonderful . They are not heavy and bulky and are easy to use . So easy that my older two daughters , 6 & 8 , have no trouble using them . No more puddles of water on the floor due to dripping , wet hair !
 I love the turbie twist . I have a few turbies around and it is great . I especially love the tag where you stick the end of the towel in so it does n't fall off like the other regular towels .
 Dolly girl is maddeningly feminine . It is n't at all metallic like some frangrances intended for a youthful or fresh scent ; yet , it does n't go too far to be musky or overbearingly warm like some stronger perfumes . Its top scents and base scents are equally excellent so you can put it on early in the day and still love the way you smell all day long . It is subtle in some ways , but detectable enough to make you feel alluring and be complimented upon . Honestly , Sui 's best potion .
 Dolly Girl by Anna Sui is my all time favorite perfume ever . The light scent has sort of a vintage feel . Its wonderful !
 My Mom could no longer find this in Bloomindales , so she had me look for it online for her . She absolutely loves it ! She was so surprised when I sent it to her for her birthday .
 Strawberry my Daiquiri is one of The Balms best shades . The natural rose tone lip gloss is smooth and lasts . Your lips appear plumper .
 I am a makeup nut and I LOVE this lipgloss its amazing ! Im on my 4th tube and I am very fickle . . this makes ur lips looks gorgeous a plus it hydrates and plumps ... color is the perfect nude . . not sticky at all ... nice flavor to it too
 feels great and looks great on lips . not funky chemical taste to it . i LOVE this lip gloss !!!!
 This lip gloss is true to it 's advertisement . It actually tingles -LRB- it the menthal in the product -RRB- when it goes on and lasts for a very long time . It looks great on too !! Would definately buy this again !!!
 I bought this after finding a partially used tube in someone 's car ! It is the only gloss that I have ever found that is actually the color of natural lips . Nice smell , long-lasting but light .
 I loved this lip gloss and it is also good for your lips.I also really liked the color and it went on nice and smooth .
 After my lip-gloss was lost in the mail , glominerals immediately sent out a replacement along with some free samples of other products . Their customer service department is top notch ! I would feel great buying anything from glominerals and their cosmetics are quality products .
 I love this gloss . It is neutral and makes any other color worn under it more rich and lustrous . I will buy it again .
 A staple in my make up box and in my purse ! Works for day and night makeup . Good quality . Non drying . Stays on better with lip liner underneath , like any lip gloss or lip stick . Price point is good on Amazon vs salons . No flavor or fragrance added .
 GloMinerals GloGloss is a beautiful product . A little pricey but beautiful application and flattering color selection .
 not over powering , lovely floral scent and a great value for the price , makes a great gift for yourself or any woman
 i get so many compliments on this perfume . it last a long time . i prced it other places and i paid half the price . very happy .
 I always wanted a Kenneth Cole Black . I waited so long to buy it and guess what ... this product is worth the wait.This smells amazing and would surely recommend to others .
 Extrta large size bottle - for the price this is a great value . In the future will only purchase the same way .
 I have purchased this before , and though I do n't spray much on each time , it lasts a very long time . The scent is distinctive , but not heavy .
 Was shipped quickly and given tracking information . Product arrived on time and meet all standards . Would recommend shipper for future purchases .
 First review , and I did n't even buy this product on Amazon -LRB- TJ Maxx I think -RRB- . A while back I had store credit from a return item and just wanted to use it up . I stood in front of the cologne rack testing a few items and happened upon Kenneth Cole Black , and I loved it ! After wearing if for a month , I proudly showed it to my sister . And just as I was handing over my `` Manly '' Cologne , I read it ... `` for Women '' . Mortified , I gifted it to my sister . But I still think it smells great . -LRB- for about 2 hours -RRB- .
 This is a very nice , clean , yet a bit woodsy scent . I always get compliments when I wear this perfume . It is my daily go to . Great any season .
 Love this scent very sad it was discontinued . I was very happy to order 2 bottles and get them quickly
 I have wanted to purchase this perfume for the past 7 years and just never got around to it . I loved it since first smelling it from a tester . This smell is perfect for evening and daily wear . It is strong but not over powering . It is feminine but not girly . I would say this is a woman 's perfume , though it has an androgynous smell to it . I am very fond of it . I have gotten several compliments . I would definitely recommend this to any woman .
 This was my favorite high school and college scent . I would get tons of compliments , specially from men . It is my perfect scent ; it smells fresh and makes me feel nice and clean in a girly way . It is not overpowering at all . I do n't like perfumes that walk in the door before you do , so this scent works well for me . I wish it would last longer but it only lasts a couple hours .
 I absolutely `` Love '' this perfume by Kenneth Cole . My sense of smell is very sensitive & strong perfume 's give me headaches . After spraying it on myself , I ca n't even tell it 's on until someone approaches me & asks me what I 'm wearing , it smells good . This was fairly quick to ship , the price was great along with the S&H , and was cheaper than buying it at a high dollar retail store . I will definitely keep purchasing this & other things through Amazon.com from now on .
 I smell amazing . This is my most favorite scent , second to none . I am told by everyone how great I smell . It is not powerful just delightful in fragrance . Its very different . It is most definitely worth the purchase . I will get some as gifts for friends . You will not go wrong with this one .
 Excelente entrega a mi lugar de destino ... estoy satisfeha de la compra . Bueno , siempre la compra con ustedes ha sido puntual .
 I love this perfume . It 's light and fresh . I always get compliments . Great price and good shipping . Overall very pleased .
 This is my sister-in-law 's favorite perfume . Last Christmas I searched all over for it & finally found it on Amazon . This year I just went directly to Amazon & saved so much time.The perfume was shrink wrapped & reasonable in price . Thanks !
 Kenneth Cole created a beautiful scent with this perfume . The scent is not overpowering and just a squirt or two last all day . The Black for women and men are both awesome !!! I absolutely love it !!!!!
 great product , great service and great price ... . i received my product before the expected date ...
 I love Kenneth Coles Black for Women . It 's a beautiful scent that is n't over powering . It smells clean and fresh . I 've read that it 's an evening parfum , but I wear it all day long . I get compliments all the time . It does wear off through out the day.I wish they made a purse size . I 've been using it for about 3 years daily . It 's price is a little steep and you ca n't find it every where . I do n't think it 's advertised enough . I think it would be a huge seller if more people knew about it . It 's sensual , refreshing , sexy , and very pleasing to the nose . I have never ever had a negative feed back on my wearing this product . Sometimes when I think I 've put too much on I really did n't . I just get more compliments . You will not be disappointed when you purchase this product .
 This perfume is fab , it last on you all day . I 've wore this for several years.So once you buy your first bottle of Black you will fall in LOVE with it .
 Love the product and it smells great ! Amazon.com is the cheapest I have found this product and will buy more from this site .
 This is a beautiful scent but does not last long . It has a very strong scent of honyesuckle and stays with the drydown also . This is sweet and not for everyone , I like it alot but perfer stong and powerful scents better but this is a great summer scent !
 Came quickly and just what I wanted :-RRB- Very pleased with shipper and product ! Highly recommended ... a b c d e
 Fast and perfect and I was very pleased . Bottle protected . Easier than searching stores . Love this fragrance and ca n't always find it !!!!
 Love this perfume , ca n't find it anywhere . Glad to find it finally at a great price .
 I have used this fragrance before and really like it . Was pleased to be able to obtain it at a lower price than in the stores and the product arrived in a very short period of time . TjamlsBlack By Kenneth Cole For Women . Eau De Parfum Spray 3.4 Oz .
 Ordered the big bottle of Black by Kenneth Cole for the price of what department stores sell the small bottle for and even got free shipping !
 I bought this for my girlfriend and loved it so much I bought some for my mother as well . It is a great smelling perfume that is not too strong -LRB- which I like -RRB- but does have a very nice scent that lasts a long time .
 This scent does not coincide with the name in the least ! Black to me implies heavy and dark , this scent is not either in the least ! This is a springtime scent indeed . It has a very heavy scent of Honeysuckle . What else is in this I can not tell , all I can smell is honeysuckle . Its a very pretty scent but not one of my favorites at all .
 I usually wear Christian Dior J'Adore , which is feminine and soft . Black by Kenneth Cole is a little sexier , and I wear it to change things up a bit when I 'm going out .
 Kenneth Cole , as we all know , is a master at creating the most captivating of scents . However his `` eau de toilette '' , Black , is the most luxuriously sexy scent . Black offers a woman the scent of sensuality , love , and overall hotness . To sum it all up , Black is just sexy .
 Bought it for my wife . She smells great in it . Great price , too , through the Amazon marketplace .
 I usually like only spicy perfume . This is an exception and my new favorite . This smells fresh ! I love it .
 Really controls the flyaways of my wavy hair . Not sticky on hair . Hair still remains soft to touch . Have been using for more than 15 years now and will not use anything else on my hair for this problem . Have tried many `` expensive brand name '' products to control and tame those nasty flyaways over the years and keep returning to this one .
 The Bio Ionic iDry Travel Pro is the BEST travel hairdryer I have ever used . It is powerfull , lite in weight and easy to handle . It dryes my hair 10 times faster than a regular blowdryer .
 I purchased this dryer for a coast-to-coast trip I have planned in the future . I have n't had much success with hotel dryers , and I hate taking up space and weight on a flight with a full-sized dryer , so I purchased this based on two outstanding reviews and the fact that I already own the Bio Ionic full-sized dryer . Although the image on Amazon is white , the one I received is matte black . I have only used the dryer once , but I am giving it 5 stars based on the information available to me at this time . The dryer is extremely light weight - it weighed in on my digital postal scale at just 17.4 oz . The size is approximately 8 &#34; from back of dryer to front end of barrel , including the concentrator attachment . The height is also approximately 8 &#34; , and the cord is 5-1/2 feet long.The switch to change from 240v to 120v is actually a screw , likely requiring a screwdriver , so if you are traveling to a country requiring the 240v , you will want to change it before you leave . -LRB- And of course do n't forget to change it back immediately upon your return so you do n't damage the dryer . -RRB- The dryer folds compactly with a twist of the handle , and it unfolds just as easily . The settings are high , low and off , and it is controlled by a slide switch . I am right handed , but I hold the dryer in my left hand . I could slide the switch from off , up two positions , to high with my left thumb , but I needed to turn it off with my stronger right hand , as it is a bit stiff . I assume it will loosen up over time.The dryer is only 1200 watts , and I have thick wavy hair , but it dried my hair in about the same time as my full-sized dryer . My hair was left smooth with minimal waving . Although the full sized Bio Ionic dryer allows you to unscrew the threaded dust/lint screen on the back for cleaning , I can not see any way to do that with this unit . All things considered , I am looking forward to using this dryer while traveling . I will upload some photos as well .
 Owned one previously for about 8 years ... LOVED it ! Bought it from my hairdresser ... it was powerful , yet lightweight . Did not burn or scorch my hair like other hairdryers . Even if my old one did not completely `` die '' , I thought it was time to get a new one . It was n't as hot and one of the settings did not work ... I did a search for the same make and model ... was VERY happy to find that it was still available ! The process to purchase was very easy and it came with about 5-7 days . AWESOME hairdryer ... cuts drying time in half . Just as good or better than my old one ... = -RRB- I am a very happy camper ... = -RRB-
 It 's upbeat , sensuous , and full of life . Live , the latest fragrance from Jennifer Lopez is as zesty as the actress herself - it attracts with notes of Sicilian lemon , Italian orange and pineapple . This delicious fruity concoction is enriched with Peony and Violet to produce a totally feminine yet mysterious scent.The bottle ? It 's a knock-out as light catches the flashes of purple , yellow and green , all glowing over the rounded glass flacon . It is topped by a spherical green cap above a metallic purple collar . You 'll want to keep the bottle long after the fragrance is gone.If you like a scent that is different , makes an impression , this is it . It 's also available in shower gel and body lotion for a total Live experience .
 One of my employees bought me this a few years ago for Christmas ... and though I think it 's a GREAT scent , I 'm always amazed at the number of compliments I get on the way I smell when I wear this.My favorite compliments are from my children , since my little one never fails to mention how much he likes it , but it 's great getting compliments from both men and women ... I needed to buy a smaller bottle for when I travel since I 'm tired of wearing other fragrances that NO ONE comments on.It was delivered quickly and great condition and just as advertised .
 I love the sent of this perfume , I wear it more than my other fragrances . I love that I can buy it in a small bottle , because I do n't wear perfume alot , and the small bottle lasts a long time without me having to spend a fortune on perfume ! : D
 This hand cream is moisturizes great and does not leave a greasy after feel like other hand creams .
 I 've tried many kinds of hand creams , and this is presently my favorite in the category of ` rich and creamy ! ' This is GREAT stuff . It coats my hands very well but sinks in , does n't leave any slimy coating . And , of great importance , my cats approve -- and there are some creams I 've tried that make them run away . They remain on my lap even if I am applying more L'Occitane to my hands . I will definitely keep using the ` Dry or Damaged Skin ' cream -- have already come back for more tubes of it , recently !
 I love this handcream - it is not greasy at all . I hate wearing hand cream during the day because it gets all over everything . This is the best hand cream I 've found - it absorbs completely and really helps to heal my very dry hands . It is a tremendous deal with the $ 10 off $ 49 Amazon Grocery .
 I picked this up from a bin in the check-out counter at Sephora and was extremely impressed when I began using it . I have applied it to a number of dry areas on my body as well as some persistent itchy spots and this creme has done wonders . It absorbs quickly and has just a tiny hint of fragrance -LRB- although i 'd prefer if it had none -RRB- . An exceptional and affordable product from a company that keeps earning my respect .
 I am pleased with the L'Occitane Shea Butter products I 've purchased , but they are n't miracle workers . I 've got the hand cream , foot cream and body lotion.I do n't know what I expected from the foot cream , but it is soothing and complements the body lotion . In my opinion , the foot cream -LRB- 15 % shea -RRB- could be used as hand cream ; sorry to say it disappointed.They hand and body products work well for temporarily softening the skin , and there is no stickiness or oily feeling . The body lotion is rapidly absorbed and does not give that sweaty clammy feeling that other lotions leave after you 've put on your clothing . The scent is pleasant and the container size is generous.The consistency of the body lotion is approximately like thousand island dressing . Consistency of the hand and foot cream is approximately like cream cheese.The tubes of the hand and foot cream are like old-fashioned toothpaste tubes ; as you use the product you flatten the tube and roll it up . I find this somewhat inconvenient . In rolling one tube , it separated at the bottom and some of the cream oozed out . The caps of the tubes are ridiculously difficult to use . They are very small , and when you 've just put cream on your hands , almost impossible to grip them . Even if you can hold onto the little cap , it 's a challenge to actually get it onto the top of the tube and attach it.The hand cream has a thickness that seems to really soothe , but it does n't have a lot of `` slip . '' -LSB- It is n't slippery . -RSB- The lack of slip means that I 've had to use quite a bit to cover my forearms . I have very dry skin and full coverage is important . I 'm consuming the hand cream -LRB- 20 % shea butter -RRB- pretty quickly . It may become too expensive for me to use it on a regular basis.The foot cream is also approximately the consistency of -LRB- whipped -RRB- cream cheese , but I 've noticed no difference or improvement of my heels or toes . The cream just does n't have the power needed to affect the tough areas . I wo n't be reordering it.As compared to other products , I like this brand . The creams are not runny , are not over-fragranced , and the hand cream and body cream do seem to offer skin softening . There 's nothing in these products to produce a permanent change -LRB- such as alpha or beta hyroxies -RRB- but they are soothing and give relief from dry or older skin .
 A thick hand cream that absorbs quickly and is not greasy . I give it to my mom -LRB- s -RRB- for Mother 's Day and they all love it too !
 I really like this product , but it seems I must reapply it a little too often . I love its delicate soothing smell .
 Though its probably not formulated for African American hair , it stengthens my hair . I use the Pantene Relaxed and Natural shampoo and conditioner for women of color and wrinse them out according to the directions . Then I spray on this leave-in and leave it in and dry my hair and style as usual . It really works ! My hair is so much stronger than it was before .
 this is a great product that makes your hair shine and keeps it strong and fortified for maximum fullness ! Go for the gold with this product .
 I have been using my Homedics paraspa for weeks following wrist surgery . Prior to purchasing the mitts , I was wrapping a towel around my wrist . The mitts fit perfectly and have a velcro closure to keep them tight . They are definitely worth buying if you use your paraspa frequently .
 I have been a Sorbie customer for years . The shampoo Cleane for chemically treated hair is wonderful . The conditioner is the best I have ever used . Now I am using cleane-forme energizing shampoo and I am very pleased . I remain a Sorbie customer and now I can have it delivered to my home .
 Oil free - no problems with acne . Great smell too .
 Great moisturizer , easily absorbed , nice scent , I 've used others this is by far the best moisturizer I 've used , and it 's SPF 15 .
 I 've been using this stuff for a while now and I like it a log . I use it every morning when I get out of the shower and about every other night before I go to bed . I love that it has the spf 15 in it too . Daily sun protection and good moisturizer .
 I have experienced this line first at the Barney 's NY . This pricing is much more reasonable . My girlfriend loves it , so do I.
 This Mebco comb with a handle is a surefire problem-solver for those with tangly , uncooperative tresses . It goes to work gently separating the hairstrands in a gliding unstressful way , and even works under the shower . It takes all the pain out of combing , and does n't pull the hair out at the roots . But I discovered one great hidden talent it has . It distributes hair color during a touch up so evenly and quickly . I just apply the touch-up color to the ends of the teeth of the comb , and run it through my hair . It gets the job done in 2-3 minutes on long hair !! I 'm in love with this comb and just ordered a batch to have on hand for spares and to give to my daughters and friends . They 'll love them as much as I do !! Thank you , Mebco Company , and please ALWAYS make and sell this gem of a comb !!
 This is actually my second comb -- my first one was `` borrowed '' and never returned . I had it a long time , and when I searched for another one it was hard to find -- until I found it on Amazon . This is a great comb that will last forever . I love this product and highly recommend it .
 A classic perfume , never forgotten and hard to change.I have treated thousands of other perfumes but I always come back to the same .
 An awesome product that sells out - and that 's the only problem ! I had to call around the US to find it in a department store , in stock and that would ship . Amazon 's supplier was sold out .
 Great medium to heavy coverage foundation . Love the portability and ease of application.This works like a snap to make me feel confident when I do n't feel like getting dolled up and just want to even out my skin tone and slap on some lip liner/balm . One tip
 I have used this stick for years and repeatedly come back to buy it . However , after using tinted moisturizer recently now the stick feels a little heavy . It is good for spot coverage , or for summer weather to blend a tan , but I think I will go back to inted moisturizer for most of the year . I went to the mall and got matched first and then purchased online . The shades quickly get dark/orange .
 I loved all of Bobbi Brown 's products but this might have to be my favorite . It 's full coverage is what I need without being heavy or greasy .
 I have used this foundation stick for 15 years . I use it with a foundation primer and a little powder and coverage will last all day !
 After having tried a ton of pricey salon shampoos and buying a lot of expensive brands over the years , I 've fallen in love with Sunsilk . My hair has never looked better or felt softer , I get comments from people on how good it looks now , and nobody can believe that a `` cheap '' shampoo and conditioner work so well.I ca n't recommend this stuff strongly enough , it 's done wonders for my hair and saved me money in the meantime .
 I bought this fragrance at a local dept. store and really loved the way itsmelled . There have been some fragrances that i 've bought over the yearsthat once i started wearing them quickly decided that i did ` nt like themas much as i had thought . I 've had too many compliments on this one to count . Ladies ... for the most part ... seem to LOVE it . I have a few other fragrances that i enjoy but this is DEFINANTLY one of my favorite ...
 This has an incredible scent . It does n't attract bees . It 's no fun trying to make out , with bees buzzing around your head . The spray nozzle design is tough to use , unless you have long strong fingers , like an eagle.I think the designer was committed .
 I got my first whiff of this exceptional fragrance from a little -LRB- high-tech looking -RRB- sample vial , sent to me by an online cologne company as appreciation for my frequent patronage ... I was really impressed with this fragrance that has a hint of vanilla in its ` classy scent . . Everyone I encountered while wearing this fragrance , immediately inquired about it , and gave it the `` thumbs up '' !! This is really one attention-getting fragrance that you ca n't go wrong with !! `` Ultraviolet Man `` should be sold complete with a can of pepper spray and a large stick . . Guys will find these `` additions '' to be extremely useful , when clearing a path through the advancing throngs of amorous women they 'll have to beat back , whenever they wear it for a night out on the town !!! Constantly fighting off the ranks of women attempting to ravish you , while wearing this fragrance , will cause you to appear to be an UltraVIOLENT Man !!! All joking aside , this cologne is a definite winner , plus it comes in the coolest , futuristic looking `` bottle '' ever !! This is one exceptional fragrance !! In my personal experience , this exceptional/original scent is second ONLY to Cotys ' -LRB- extremely rare -RRB- `` Iron '' cologne as my top `` chick-magnet ''
 After using Armani Mania for years , a friend gave me a sample and I had to have a bottle . Although Armani is still a favorite , this cologne is the best . Unique scent that does not overpower , but is long-lasting . You will not find this in stores . Amazon always has a place , and the price is great -LRB- about 1/2 of cost of Armani -RRB- . Shape of the bottle is unlike any other cologne , which makes this an unforgettable product.Chicks love this stuff !
 It was very convenient to reorder Dior lipstick through Amazon.com ; I could not find the lipstick in any of the department stores here.Glenna
 I first bought this brush 20 years ago . Hard to believe it lasted that long but I take good care of my things . It 's been used constantly to blow dry my hair straight and brushes thru all knots and does not leave my hair static . My teenage daughter started using it and because of double the use , the bristle part detached from the base which was glued in very securely . I just ordered this new one and have to say I love it just as much as my original one . I was afraid it would 've been made cheaper or that the bristles were n't going to be the same . But , I was wrong . It is still quality-made and I am so happy I did n't have to search endlessly and settle for something close to it . This brand makes quality brushes as I have several different sizes . I highly recommend it !
 I think that like many people , I 'll purchase gifts for other folks that I wo n't get for myself . My mother and I both have sensitive skin , but I 'd always purchased my skin products at the grocery or , occasionally , the department store . When my skin got dry and flaky , I 'd try yet another product.In 2000 we went to Europe . The first Body Shop -LRB- wonderful foot lotion -RRB- I was ever in was in London . The first L'Occitane was at the train station in Paris on our way back to London . I picked up two jars of the L'Occitane Honey Skin cream for my mother as it said it was for sensitive skin . She loves it and is still using it today . The next year I added the Sensitive Skin Body Balm for myself and last year the Eau de Meil Honey Gentle Water and Gelee Moussante Honey , Royal Jelly and Propolis Foaming Jelly along with mom 's skin cream . Since the closest L'Occitane -LRB- or Body Shop , too -RRB- shop to us is 60 miles one way , I was delighted when I discovered the items could be purchased from Amazon . I 've been using the L'Occitane ` Honey ' line for many years now without any dryness or flaking and love it . The perfect combination for me is taking a shower with the Foaming Jelly , applying the Body Balm when fresh out of the shower -LRB- in the winter , I even use lightly on my face -RRB- , and then a quick spray with the Honey Gentle Water . Your skin feels great and the scent is delightful .
 Goes on smoothe with no oily feeling . Also moisturizes as it protects from the sun . Dermatologist recommended it . Shame Aveda quit making the product .
 Great product with only natural sunscreens , but it 's discontinued . Look for a very similar product made by Neutrogena . I found it at Target . It 's a lot cheaper too !
 I really liked this flat iron . My hair stylist recommended this one . She uses it at her salon and at home . I have been very happy with this compared to my cheap Conair Wal-Mart one I had purchased years back . It definitely is worth the money and works very well . I wish it did have a automatic shut off after it has been on for so long since it does get very hot . Instead of using the on/off switch I always keep the switch on and use the plug in to turn it off and on so I remember to turn it off . I would definitely recommend this product to anyone !!
 This is the same flat iron used at the salon I go to , but I got it for half the cost from Amazon . I have course , naturaly wavey hair and this flat iron makes it soft and straight . It does n't tug as I pull it through my hair , its very smooth . It also heats up in seconds and does n't loose heat as I flat iron my hair .
 I love this straightner . It works so well . I had my last one for 5 years before the wiring broke and it was no longer safe to use . And it shipped on time !!
 I gave this to my wife , she is still using it and she loves it . Its very high quality and she uses it a lot with fast results ! She has very curly hair and after using it nobody can tell that she does .
 5 years ago , I bought the same version of this straightener from a friend who was a hair supply store owner , and she told me it would be $ 80 with a % 50 discount , so when I saw the $ 60 price tag from Goodman 's , I was astonished . Not to mention that GA.MA straighteners are the best I have ever come across , especially for the price . I mean , CHI claims to be the best and sells for almost $ 160 , and come on , they 're not even Italian made ! GA.MA straighteners are apparently not the easiest to find online or in stores , so I 'm very happy Goodman 's buys European products for those of us who desperately want them . I was alerted about my product being shipped the same day I bought it and it arrived around 8 or 9 days later -LRB- bc i ordered on a thursday -RRB- . Overall great in every way .
 I had a Chi straightener before this one and it broke . I decided to go with something a little bit cheaper and read the previous reviews on this flat iron and decided to get it . I am really glad that I did . It works really well and gets really hot .
 I had tried this flat iron before and liked it . I had purchased a great iron in Italy -LRB- which is only 220V -RRB- , I was attempting to find something comparable and this seems to be just great . I like that it has an off/on switch , is just one temperature and heats up fast . It is narrow enough to twirl and leave my hair in soft curls as well . Long , sturdy swivel cord , heat resistant iron plate covers and sleek design , all make this a great pick for a flat iron .
 Workslike a pro 's and has plate guards to keep the user from burning hands or fingers while in use . That helps someone like me who is not a pro .
 Ga.ma Leonardo ceramic flat iron , 1 '' plates . is an excelent product . . I am satisfied with the product , it is very easy to use and very light
 Ga.ma Leonardo ceramic flat iron , 1 '' plates.I absolutely love it . Great value and worth every penny .
 This is the best flat iron i have had and I speak as a person who has has accses to any iorn out there and payed $ 150 for my last Chi iron that did not evan last a year . This iron gets hot alnost right when you plug it in which i love no more whating around for your iron to get hot .
 This is the fragrance that Bryant Gumbalt wears . Kelly Rippa was making a big fuss over him on `` Live ... '' when he was substituting for Regis . I have worn it since My time in London in the late 70 's and still get a GREAT response from all . Now it is hard to find . Thank Amazon for keeping me in touch with this product . I recieved my Devin quickly and in good condition . It was just as it has always been a great fragrance . Just the same as I would have bought in the Department store if I could find it .
 I was in my 20 's at a loss about my future , having just walked out of a `` Bible college , '' I turned to retail , and worked the old Belk # 004 in downtown Charlotte , North Carolina , before it was `` uptown . '' I worked in the men 's clothing department , shirts , ties , umbrellas . Things of that nature.I took careful stock of what it meant to appreciate the finer things in Belk , and learned quickly how much I loved Aramis Devin , but nothing prepared me for the reaction in public to it.I most often took the public transit , the city bus , to and from work . It was easier than trying to find parking in those days , not to mention cheaper - unlimited rides for a month for $ 10.00 . Riding home the first day I 'd bought , and applied , Aramis Devin , person after person that was near me on the bus was astounded by the fragrance , and driven to ask me the name of it.I have never seen such a reaction before , or since then , in my now 53 years on this planet.It is truly a classic of the greatest quality .
 This is a classic fragrance because that has gotten me good notice for over thirty years . It does not make you smell like a ponce or a gender-confused trollop . It has unapologeticly clean notes and mixes well with wool and leather . If your clothing choices trend towards lycra and latex , you probably want something else.After wearing this for long hours , you still smell pretty good.True story
 I 've generally used only the cheaper or more common colognes -LRB- Brut , Aspen , Adidas Moves , Daytona 500 , Vurt , British Sterling , Stetson , Stetson Black , Stetson Untamed , etc. -RRB- . This is the first `` quality '' cologne I 've used , and it really stands apart from the rest . Most colognes are a bit too sweet or too spicy -LRB- if that makes sense -RRB- , but this really finds the right spot in between ... and boy does it last ! I 'm good for a whole day with just one spray , and I would n't recommend using any more than that.As for describing it , it 's very masculine and somewhat subdued and relaxing , but it still makes its presence known . It suits casual and formal wear both quite well , but I almost think it fits a casual atmosphere a bit better . I 'm no cologne expert , but that 's just my two cents . Hope you like it if you try it ... chances are you will .
 Outstanding service on a product I ca n't get anywhere else . After wearing this fragrance for over 30 years , I can no longer get it at Macy 's or other department stores . Annoying , but thankfully , I can get it from Amazon for the time-being .
 My husband has never been one to wear cologne , saying that so many of the scents make him smell `` like a girl '' and leave his skin feeling `` dirty . '' However , I got this cologne for him after hearing that Bryant Gumble has been wearing it for years and often has people ask him what scent he is wearing as it smells clean and `` manly . '' On a whim , I bought it for my husband for Christmas and he absolutely loved it ! He wears it everyday and will often walk up to me , lean in , and tell me to smell him . It has a very woodsy , natural , and clean scent . It is not overpowering , yet it lasts all day . My husband puts some on after his morning shower and I can still smell it on him when he gets home from work 12 hours later . It 's not greasy and it does n't leave his skin feeling slightly sticky , like some of the colognes I 've purchased for him previously -LRB- and that includes some very expensive , name brand colognes -RRB- . He says he has gotten many compliments from strangers , both men and women , asking him what scent he 's wearing and where they can get it . I can understand why Bryant Gumble has worn it for as long as he has . Why fix something that is n't broken ?
 My Man loves this cologne , hard to find in the local stores . Great Price here and fast delivery . Thank You : -RRB-
 Just like all Aramis products , this has a great scent . Bought for my husband and it really smells great on him ! Supposedly same cologne Bryant Gumbel wears ... ???
 I 've been using devin for about 40 years and always make sure I have a bottle.the scent is perfect not too strong
 Good scent but not the greatest for my husband . Everyone has their own best cologne . This is a good one but I like Monsouir -LRB- sp ? -RRB- Musk better & Poco Robainne the best on him .
 they used to tell me so but that was before I got old and invisable . I use it every now and then because even though they wo n't notice me passing by they will at least get a wiff of what used to be . Too bad it cost so much .
 Like some others , I first heard of this scent when watching the Regis and Kelly show and Bryant Gumbel was substituting for Regis . She always commented on how nice he smelled ! I looked for it here in Canada and was unable to find it . It is available from some ebay sellers but I have to wonder how genuine some of the things are there plus the price was even more than what I got it for on special here at amazon.com . I purchased it here on amazon.com never having smelled it before but really like it . My wife too raves about it and I am now always ready to impress Kelly if she ever stops in for a chat some morning !
 I 've worn Devin off and on for close to 30 years . I love the scent , and am often complimented on it . It 's difficult to find locally , however , so I have n't worn it in a long time . I did n't realize how much I 'd missed it until I received it from here . Highly recommended !
 Compared to `` regular '' Aramis , which I find to be very `` citrusy '' , `` Devin '' is very dark and brooding , reminding me of wood , leather and pipe tobacco.I like the scent , it stays with me and my wife does n't disapprove . I find many scents to be too floral or too bright in character . This one suits me well . YMMV .
 Great seller . Good service . So glad to find this cologne . Have had more compliments from this scent than any other .
 Yet another item that we used to be able to buy in local mall department stores , but nobody is carrying any more . We love the scent . It 's the only cologne my hubby will wear , and he 'll probably be wearing it until the very last bottle disappears from the face of the earth !
 Great product . I have used it for years . I would recommend this vendor and would uy from ths vendor again .
 Ok people let me give you the facts . I have tried all sorts of similar products that really just dont work . They dont blend well and get easily remove with sweat or any sort of liquid , NOT THIS PRODUCT !! This is fantastic , it really coats your hair making it look MUCH thicker and fuller . I instantly noticed a difference and feel much more confident out in public when using this item . Going swimming ? NOT A PROBLEM ! The only way this comes off is if you shampoo your hair . This is THE easy solution to help cover up thin spots in your hair . TRUST ME . You will love this product as much as I have . I consider myself a life long user from this point on.Thank you so much for this product .
 Let me just set the predecent for this - 1 . this is the first time I have ever been compelled to write a review for anything in my life , and 2 . I consider this truly a life changing product for me , which made it imperative for me to share my experience . I have had hair loss / thinning issues at a particularly young age , and have been using propecia / rogain for a couple years , which has been great . This product just augments all of that - it make my hair truly look unnoticably perfect looking , by smartly `` filling in the thinning areas '' , and blending in with the hair I have . Using it , I for the first time in a couple years have been able to feel remarkably more confident both in social settings and work-related meetings , and feel a renewed energy for life . A few notes on it : - it works particularly well for thinning hair , as the black color / impact on surrounding hairs creates an unbelievably seamless effect - not sure how it would be as helpful for completely hairless areas - it takes about 5 minutes in the morning , every morning to apply / get right - a miniscule price to pay for the impact it has - it actually does stay on both in the rain , and in the pool , which is literally shockingAnyways , just thought I 'd share that with you . Hairloss is tough to deal with , particularly at a young age - I was smart about it and took good care of it early on , but it certainly did it 's damage to my self-esteem / `` zest for life '' for the couple years it 's taken it 's toll . Adding this product literally makes me feels hair-issue free , which is nothing short of life changing in every regard.Best of luck to all of you sufferers out there !
 I 've been using hair club for men for 7 years and wish I found this product sooner . I have very thin hair in front and then patchy spots in terms of hair thinness from after 1 inch in from my hair line . I also have very thin hair on my crown . My Mom suggested Toppik because she started using it . I bought the travel size to try it out . It works as described by the company however it better when using you have more hair between each other . I read reviews on various site and gathered a list of product to try . I decided to try Dermmatch and if that did n't work then Courve . Dermmatch proved to be the winner and my saving grace . It applies like makeup concealer very easy . Blow dry after its applied and made sure it was dried and then I ran some tests . I rubbed my head very hard back and forth and even though a little of it came off , it was n't noticeable on my head . I also put some water on my hand and did the same test rubbing hard back and forth , same results . This is a great product . Comparing the pictures I took with Toppik and Dermmatch , Dermmatch look much for life like . I 'm really happy and excited that I can get back a natural look compared to my hair system . And if it looks dull just add some kind of shining product and it looks good . All in all , I 'm happy and will be able to get rid of my hair system . It will be a low cost solution as even worst case , I 'm assuming just if it lasts half the time the company says , would be 9 months . I highly recommend trying this product .
 Used For
 Covers and blends well . For me , I DO NOT WET the applicators , i rub the applicator over the disc and apply to my scalp , it creates a lesser degree of a shining oily affect and makes it look so much more natural . My hair is buzzed very very close to the scalp to minimize the thinning and balding look , Dermamatch fills in and creates a thicker look . I get almost no rub off on pillows , and as a swimmer , very little if almost none comes off after a 45 minute swim in chlorine water .
 This product is my new ultimate solution for my receding hairline ... It does the job pretty well better than most products out there . . However , the price on it is so expensive and I think is much exaggerated ! This should have been around 20 to 25 dollars maximum and not 47 dollars ! It is definitely overpriced !
 I have been going crazy to try and figure out what is causing my female hair shed and hair loss . Unfortunately I have not yet figured it out but this product has saved my sanity for now . At least I have something to cover it up . Although if I do scratch my head I get black fingers nails . I will take the black finger tips over the scalp showing .
 The easiest way to apply this product is by DABBING with the applicator . Smudge it along the hairline so it looks more natural . After a shot with the blow dryer , this stuff stays on until you wash with shampoo . I do cross-fit for a workout and sweat like a fiend - it stays in place . I really like this product !
 It 's very good in covering bald patches . However , will not stay when you get wet in rain . Not sure how the guy swims in the ad without losing the color in water .
 Great product ! It really works I read the reviews and agree it is amazing . My family could n't even tell it was on .
 Looks a little phony , but I guess it should be used to cover small areas and not large one . My grandmother tried it and she is completely bald on the top . It made her head look like peach fuz . So I guess it seems to work to tone down small shiny spots on the scalp . Its doesnt seem to cake up the scalp and it had no odor . I am considering ordering another for myself .
 I really like this hair enforcement product , easy to use , no itching , no redness,anti-water does really work , looks like real hair.A + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + I will continue purchase this product .
 Once upon a time , before Toppik became well-known -LRB- at least to me -RRB- , I used to use black eyeshadow to cover up my thinning spots . It took awhile to do , and nobody could touch my hair because if they did , they 'd get black smudges all over their hands . That experience is the first thing I thought of after using this product . Once again , touching the top of my head leaves smudges on my skin . It 's also a pain to get off of surfaces , and it will stain your clothes if any happens to drip on -LRB- though to be fair , Toppik also leaves its mark on collar areas -RRB- . I ca n't say I would ever use this stuff on its own . The coverage is n't even enough , and I really do n't want to go back to worrying about people coming anywhere near my hair . But as most of us know , Toppik is ridiculously expensive . Despite the cons I just listed , I would still recommend this product to others . I 've started using both products together , starting with Dermmatch and then filling in with Toppik . It 's not perfect , but it makes the latter product last longer , and they 're actually pretty identical in terms of color matching . And if anyone has any tips for preventing that smudging problem , please list them !
 I 've only tried a couple of products for my alopecia , but this product is miraculous . It is easy to use , and truly does NOT come off -LRB- once it 's dried -RRB- under ANY circumstances ; unless you wash it out with shampoo . Rarely do you come across a product that stands up to its claims ; this one surpasses them .
 I liked this product because it was easy to apply and lasts . It looks like it will last a very long time , so for the price , it was worth it . The only thing I do not like is that it makes my hair dull and dry , but I have other `` shine '' products I apply to my hair that can fix that issue . All in all , I am glad I purchased it , and will again .
 Excellent product , I use it in conjunction with Toppik , it works great and I love that .
 Dermmatch is amazing !! it covers the scalp and also covers the white hair ... . i use it every other day ... . and it does n't fade , or stain your pillow ... Fantastic product ...
 So I 'm a 30 year old guy who started to notice some thinning in the crown area about 2 1/2 years ago . I instantly started a regimen of Rogaine which I DID NOT LIKE . It had some very unwanted side effects with libido and erectile dysfunction that I discovered are quite common once I googled . So I stopped with the Rogaine , got my mojo back , and was still dealing with the bald spot on my head . Enter Dermmatch . I ca n't even remember how I heard about it , but now that I have it I 'm never going back . It 's a very simple and easy product to use , it works very well , and it is not noticeable at all . It blends perfectly to my hair and looks great . Of course the baldness is still an issue , but I 'll probably join hair club for men or something in 5-10 years when I can afford it . For now , this is a perfectly good coverup for me . I feel more confident knowing that I at least give the appearance of a full head of hair . The only issue I have is that I must find a hair gel product that does n't require wet hair , because wetting my hair after applying dermmatch kind of defeats the purpose , but that 's more my issue than any with the product . They actually caution against using hair products with a lot of chemicals while using dermmatch so I 'm going to hunt for an all-natural pomade or something that works better.Here 's a tip
 Got ta say this is definitely a great tool . Totally transforms my confidence . Sucks having to wash it out & I usually will sleep with it the most a day & cant sleep on white pillows haha . But Definitely a great help for anyone thinning !
 The face cream is excellent and keeps your face moist and protected in the high altitude . Also , does wonders for dry hands .
 This is a good little addition to your regular anti-aging routine . It 's a small tube , so I try to use it where I need it the most . I was worried I would have lighter spots on my face where I used it . Thankfully my skin looked very even and not spotty .
 another great product by dermalogica . I have hyperpigmentation after acne and i love this product ! Just remember to use spf everyday cause otherway its pointless to use it .
 I have been looking for a soothing aftershave and I think I had with Alpine Menthol Skin Toner . It leaves your skin cool . It has great healing qualities as well as it is ph balanced , so no more dry or greasy skin . Give it a try and you 'll love it !
 I have reviewed many aftershaves but this one is different in a great way . Has everything I like . The initial rush is menthol but only about one third as strong as Osage Rub.Clubman Jeris Osage Rub , 14 Fluid OunceThe scent is fresh and fairly mild . The surprise is that after about five minutes it has smoothed and toned my face better than any of the others Ive tried . It is cooling and should also be used on the scalp . Contains boric acid which acts as an antiseptic and oils of lavender and peppermint as well as camphor . Stephans has been in the barber supply business since 1897 and has made a number of purchases over the years that props up their position . This is well worth having in your cabinet .
 My hair is short . The cut is a little shorter on the sides than it is in the back . I needed a brush that would flip my hair up in the back as I was drying it . This brush works perfectly . It is small barreled and has stiff bristles . I love it .
 An exceptional brush . Kind to the hair . Strong bristles . Easy to hold . Nice on the scalp . So happy that I bought it . You can tell that it is a well studied product of superior quality .
 Searched high and low for an affordable product that salons use . After my last visit in which my stylist gave me pointers and showed me what tools she used I ran to amazon to find something similar . This brush works amazing for drying/straightening hair -LRB- if you know how to use it right ! -RRB- It can be a little tough to learn how to use it , but once you get the hang of it it works wonders on your head !
 I love this perfume and now I do n't have to worry about getting it.I was so happy to find it on Amazon.com.I received it quickly and in great condition.Thank you very much .
 great bath salts . great product
 Wonderful bath salts that are clean , fresh and organic . They are free of harmful ingredients - you will be bathing is pure heaven ! Try them !
 I was getting this from a local store and loved it . I am allergic to so much and this never irritates my skin and the smell is so calming I love it .
 Nice product for a good price , smells good and works well with a nice bubble bath . Would buy it again .
 This is my favorite bath salt by far . The aroma is lovely - like an orange cream . My skin feels soft and I appreciate the blend of salts . I will continue to purchase this item .
 This stuff smells so freakin good ! It has lasted quite a bit longer then I initially expected based on the container size .
 For that alone anything in this industry gets 5 stars ! Smells great and I am looking forward to using it . Only con I have ... is what exactly means '' add generously to running water '' ???? Does this make 2 baths ? 5 ? 10 ? waht is generously ???
 I purchased three of them , and gave to my pregnant friends because it shows organic . She loves the smell , very mild and natural , but the salt melt little bit slow than she expected , besides that it 's good product
 Originally I had purchased this thinking it was bath milk as that it what I typed into amazon and this is one of the products that showed up due to it having coconut milk in it . It is my own fault for not double-checking so I can not be too hard on it.The scent is pleasant .
 Bathing is amazing , especially when I am transported through the scented steam to a feeling of a tropical paradise . The time out blend is a favorite to use and makes a great gift to a new parent , a pal who just moved or a frazzled friend . Easy , fast and appreciated - ALWAYS !
 These are great like all EO products - very fragrant and leave your skin feeling soft not itchy - all natural . Enjoy and relax !
 Tuve un poco de miedo antes de comprar el perfume por lo que es considerado clasico y para personas mayores pero DEFINITIVAMENTE LAS MUJERES LO ADORAN jajaja 100 % recomendado , incluso se acercan a oler y comprobar si eres tu el del olor o es el ambiente !
 Though not the longest lasting cologne , it does smell good and that is after all the only reason to buy a cologne
 I like the smell of this cologne , it 's not to strong , and I looked around and found it on Amazon , it 's alot cheap here .
 this is my second purchase and chrome suits me . my wife who has rhinitis is very sensitive to smell and chrome passed with flying colors .
 My boyfriend has used this cologne for years . He has always paid store price . Here , it was easy to find , affordable and exactly what I needed for a last minute birthday present .
 I bought this for my boyfriend , I 'm not giving it to him till Christmas , but of course when it came in the mail I had to open it and smell it ! It smelt soooo goood ! This is a deffinite pick . I sprayed some on my arm , it stayed ALL day . I just wanted to get a smell sniff , it was there the entire day until I showered the next morning ! Good thing I did n't hang out with him that day he 'd be like whaattt haha . But this is a deffinite pick for any guy that wants to smell yummyyy .
 I 've been wanting to try the Azzaro Chrome for some time and the great price on Amazon was too tempting . And boy am I glad I did buy . . Its a great unobtrusive perfume which I plan to use on a daily basis
 although after a while , i think the nose gets used to the smell and ca n't smell it as well as it did the first time i applied it , the chrome is an excellent product
 I really like this product . After dry down it really smells nice . I will buy it again .
 I gave this as a Christmas gift for a family member . I thought he would like the scent as much as my husband did .
 Bought this fragrance from Amazon for my husband without even trying it out based on online descriptions and reviews . I am very happy with my purchase . The smell is fantastic . It is very fresh and clean and very distinctive . Also , the smell is extremely lasting . My husband puts it on early in the morning and I can still smell it quite strongly when he comes back home from work . He already finished up half a bottle . And the price on Amazon is unbeatable . It was even considerably cheaper than the prices on duty free store . I know , cause I did compare . You just ca n't go wrong with this if you need a fragrance to wear at work .
 Something about this EDT just sticks to my skin like glue . I 'm a boilermaker from Australia , I put this stuff on at 6am to go to work , welding with fumes everywhere all day , sweating in 40 degree Celcius heat . Come home at 5pm and still smell good , that is really worth something . Its not overbearing , just crisp and sharp . Excellent value for money .
 This is the best scent that I have ever worn . Do n't tell people about it because everybody will cop our style !
 I first heard about this cologne from a female co-worker . After going to the mall to have a smell -LRB- amazing -RRB- and jumping online to read some customer reviews , I was sold . To be honest , I was skeptical about ordering online because I had read other reviews of cologne on Amazon stating that the bottle they received was `` stale '' or `` not the same as when -LSB- they -RSB- smelled in stores . '' I 'm telling you right now , I had no problems with this one.Some men are going to say this cologne is n't masculine enough and it smells like perfume . It definitely smells like perfume when you smell the bottle , but if you actually spray it on , it smells nothing like it . I usually wear Drakkar Noir by Guy Laroche . Just to let you know right now , this scent is the complete opposite . While DN has a strong , masculine spicy seductive tone of smell to it , Chrome has a soft , under the surface , hint of citrus , intoxicating kind of effect . It 's like smelling a more gentle side of a man 's personality . How sexy can that be ? The scent is so soft that you will be tempted to spray more because you think it 's not there , but trust me , it 's there ! This smell works better when I spray on my skin rather than clothing . But then again , you have to find a cologne that works well with your natural scent . For me , this will be number two all-time only behind the Noir . I love getting random whiffs of this cologne throughout the day.Obviously , I tried to stay away from the typical `` LADIES LOVE IT '' kind of review . If you 're a male and the only reason why you 're buying this cologne is because `` women love it , '' you should definitely find another cologne that works for you . If you 're a female looking for a gift or looking for a scent for her man , look no further . I would recommend Chrome and rate it 9/10 overall -LRB- 10 for smell , 8 for longevity -RRB- . It 's one of the best colognes I 've ever worn .
 This smells so good and it does n't wear off quickly ! I ordered it for my guy and amazon has it at the best price .
 Love the smell - it 's very sexy . The product arrived fully wrapped as if I had bought it right from the store . I received the product before the estimated delivery date .
 Chrome belongs in every man 's collection . It is a great scent that has no peculiarities that someone out there might hate . It is mainly floral with some fruity tones and minimal spice.PROBLEM
 I can pretty much sum this up in a few words . I often get comments about how good I smell . `` Ooh ! You smell good ! '' even my daughters tell me , `` Daddy , you smell good . '' This fragrance is smooth . It is cool in the summer and warm in the winter . It is the most consistant fragrance for me to date . I would say , that is why this recent purchase was probably my 6th bottle . I recommend !
 Great product ! I have used it a couple of times and the smell lasts for hours and hours . Unlike other fragrances I 've used , I can actually smell this one on myself . The smell is not too strong and not too light . I fully recommend it .
 I bought this product for my boyfriends b-day . The product came in its original box just like the ones you would buy at the mall . he absolutely loved it !!!
 Chrome was always one of my favorites , but it would take me forever to use 3.4 oz up ! But for the price , it looks like you 'd pay the same for 1/2 that much -LRB- at least today -RRB- .
 This is a great value for the price . The shipping was quick unlike what the prediction was and I am very happy
 I tried chrome for the first time at kohls and fell in love with the long lasting scent , pretty addictive too . Found it on Amazon for such a cheap price , the 6.8 bottle is the best way to go!Even straight guys ask me what cologne is that !
 OK , I 'm going to order another one soon . All reviews are correct . This one smells magnificent . I always get `` lucky '' every time I wear this . Do n't let this pass guys !
 I ordered this perfume online and it is one of the best perfume i have ever used . Smells great and very reasonbaly priced than leading stores .
 Great smell , but I 've been using it for a while so it 's not as exciting to me as it once was . Also , it 's so popular instead of hearing , `` Mmmm you smell great , what is that ? '' I hear , `` Hey , are you wearing Chrome ? Oh yeah , so-and-so wears that too . '' So it 's nice , but it 's getting a little played out so to speak .
 Great fragrance , amazing price , fast shipping and very well protected so it wo n't break on the way . I use it almost every day and it has lasted for a long time .
 Has a really nice crisp smell that is not too overpowering and yet lasts a surprisingly long time . Very happy with this purchase and the price .
 My husband loves this cologne and has been using it for over 2 years now . It does not irritate his skin like some others . Lasting , soft scent makes me love it too .
 I was n't aware of this cologne , until someone suggested it to me . Good value . I will buy this product again .
 Great smell , long lasting , however ... not strong enough . I find myself having to use 5 sprays before it is noticeable . Respond to this if anyone has any recommendations!Areas sprayed
 Have gotten compliments on this scent , its great and not too expensive . Came in nice packaging and looks good on my dresser .
 Bought this for my son for Christmas as this is one of his favorite colognes . It has a very fresh and clean smell .
 This is my sons favorite cologne . So we bought him the big bottle for Christmas . He was thrilled . I am gladI found it at such a good price
 The ladies love this cologne . I need a broom to get all deez honeys off of me . But seriously its good cologne and i recommend it .
 Was a bit skeptical at first because of the price but this product is what it say 's it is and I loved it . Thanks !!
 This is my husband 's fave cologne - he gets others , but keeps coming back to this one . The price on Amazon tends to be pretty good compared to dept stores . He actually had just bought some from a dept store , looked on here and saw it $ 10 cheaper for the next size up , so we 're returning the one to the dept store . why not , w / free shipping -LRB- amazon 's super saver -RRB- ?
 I shopped around at my local department stores and this item was much more expensive than what I bought it for online . This product was purchased for my husband . He was pleased with the scent and so was I.
 I have been using Azzaro Chrome since 2004 , when I first found my Roommate 's . I used his until he pretty much cut me off and I bought my own . I have used this in the Clubs and just going to work , when I feel like smelling great . I have received many compliments from women . This is actually my wife 's favorite Cologne that I have , and I have many . It is definitely in my top 3 Colognes that I have EVER used . If you want to just smell good , or get attention from women with a fragrance , this one will not disappoint .
 I love the smell of it , not heavy like some of them out there.But price is higher on Amazon I bought it at Macy 's for less .
 Chrome is a wonderful Summer sent . I have worn it for years alternating with Cool Water . I like to match the deodorant to the cologne so nothing clashes . Lots of positive remarks from people I meet .
 very good , i was going to buy it at kohls for $ 60 but found out its cheaper here
 Al principio como que no me acostumbraba a la fragancia pero ya luego de un tiempo huele bastante bien.Muchos halagos por su exquisito olor . Cada vez que la uso , wow !! es una de las mejores fragancias en el mercado100 % Recomendado .
 I have to agree with everyone else who is giving this product a great review . It 's really good and longevity is pretty nice . This is def . a summer cologne and I use this mostly as my work cologne . It 's inoffensive and smells wonderful and clean .
 I 've been using Bvlgary Aqua and Armani Aqua Di Gio for some time , and I really liked the fresh aquatic smell of them . I ordered this cologne on Amazon even without having a try seeing so many positive comments . It also features fresh and aquatic smell . But when I opened the package and had a first spray , it really smelled weird . I even wondered if it 's a fake one ... However , after using it for days , I 'm getting more and more used to it and now kind of like it . Therefore , for those who come here because of Aqua Di Gio and other aquatic colognes , be careful or you might be disappointed . Overall , I like this outstanding cologne , and the price offered by Amazon is really amazing .
 Fresh clean scent that 's not too strong or sweet . Just the right scent for a man .
 Although I was n't able to receive this item by Christmas , it was delivered shortly after . As the product is cologne , I was concerned that it may have sat on a shelf for a while and the scent may be off . Turned out that it was in mint condition -LRB- packaging and scent -RRB- and I got it for half the price of a department store !
 I 've been using this for a few years now . Girlfriend loves it , and a bottle this size lasts me over a year , using 1-2 sprays a day .
 I bought this for my 16 year old son solely on reviews alone . This is by far his favorite cologne . It has such a fresh , clean scent ... it 's wonderful . I 'm going to buy this four my.youngest son 's 5th birthday . He loves it too ! This is a must buy , you wo n't be disappointed .
 My wife and I both live the smell . My Marine son started wearing it andI tried some . He said its the cologne of the Marines .
 bought this for my boyfriend for christmas and he likes it alot . . im not to fond with some colognes but this one smells pretty good !
 bought this colone 2nd time one month ago from AMAZON and love itthe price was great -LRB- ca n't beat it anywhere -RRB- and smells great , getting many complimentswill buy it again in the futurethanks AMAZON ... M.P.
 My husband has worn the same cologne for years and makes sure to buy it himself . I can understand that but this year I went out on a limb and bought this based on others reviews . It is better than Cool Water and Nautica . I love it . The bottle is even sexy . He was very surprised to get this and that he genuinely likes wearing it everyday to work . I will be buying more !!!
 It 's hard to go for a cologne without smelling it yourself , but I would highly highly recommend this one as a good everyday scent . I would describe it as being very fresh or crisp , like a cool ocean breeze with a hint of some sort of spice and slightly grassy or herby -LRB- Citrus notes maybe ? Sorry , I 'm not a professional ! -RRB- . I have gotten many compliments on it when I first started wearing it to work and would highly recommend it as a great , cheaper scent useable almost anytime ! It will last well through a full 8 hr shift at work using 2 sprays .
 Ok , this product was a good price and good packaging , but the delivery time was long ! it seemed to be in transit forver ... I liked the product and gave it as a gift !!
 This is the one cologne I can wear & people will always comment on how good it smells -LRB- very nice and not over-powering -RRB- . And amazon always has a great price on it !
 This smells so good , this is such a great price . The smell is not too strong , it smells shower fresh . Great stocking stuffer
 This cologne has a really nice smell . I use 3 `` sprays '' every morning and lasts me an entire 8 hour day if not more . Not overwhelming at all . I get compliments in the elevators all the time !
 I bought this for my boyfriend , already knowing that it was one of his favorites . He was not disappointed . It smells great on him and it 's not too strong or overpowering . I would reccomend it for sure !
 I bought this cologne for my boyfriend for Christmas . He really loved it and it smells great . I love the scent on him .
 one of the best colognes ! I recommend it ! definitely will draw the ladies attention ! and be smelling good all day n night !!
 Awesome scent to it . Not that musky but it has a pure smell to it . I have purchased this brand many times .
 I bought this for my boyfriend and I love when he wears it ! The scent is clean , masculine and very sexy . It is a long lasting scent , as others have previously noted ... . he puts it on in the morning and I can still smell it at the end of the day . Guys if you 're looking for a cologne your wife or girlfriend will love pick this one up !
 Geat purchase ! This is my favorite men 's cologne and definitely one of my husband 's favorites as well . . This is an excellent deal !
 My husband got this as a sample when he bought my Dolce & Gabana ... so I got him this for Christmas ! He loved it !
 I usually never buy cologne without knowing what it smells like first . I took my chances this time , and based my decision on the great reviews this cologne got . I got it today -LRB- it 's a Christmas gift for my Dad -RRB- . I could n't wait to smell it . IT IS AMAZING ! Wonderful scent . My Dad is going to be thrilled . I get him a new cologne every year .
 I 'm always being asked by other women why my husband always smells so good . This cologne is really the best smelling on the market as far as I 'm concerned .
 Gift for son for Christmas.If you have priced this fragrance you know how expensive it can be ... this was a GREAT deal .
 My son 's favorite fragrance and I happen to think it 's a great one too . It was a gift and he was happy to receive it . Service was quick and product was received as I expected - new and in perfect condition .
 Good and authentic product at great price . Will back for more . Recommended for your own and as a gift in any occasions .
 My husband first loved this cologne and alternated between it and Chanel Bleu . He has since switched to the Sport version and my son has taken over wearing this original version . They both smell great when they wear them , but there are subtle differences between the two and I think it 's just a personal preference .
 I smelled a sample of this cologne in a sports magazine . . and thought it a must have for my husband ! He wears it and Im smiling
 After reading reviews about the possibility of getting a fake product I was really concerned . The price -LRB- $ 36 -RRB- was almost half the price of department store prices . So I decided to take a chance especially since it was shipped directly by Amazon . I am glad I did , as the product came in sealed original box , made in Paris , and the original scent . It was the real thing , at a real bargain price . I am happy . I can not say anything about other suppliers that Amazon works with , but Amazon ships the real thing .
 I 'd been wanting to try this cologne for some time and finally ended up forking out the dough to get it and it 's pretty darn good . I really like it .
 o perfume foi uma otima escolha a fragancia &eacute; muito boa e permanece no seu corpo por um bom tempo mesmo depois de vc lavar a roupa kkkkkkkkk
 usually try something different every time , but i think i 'll keep a bottle of this on hand no matter what.lot 's of compliments . amazon has great price compared to the dept stores .
 This is my husbands favorite cologne . I rarely buy it for him because it is very pricey . So I am glad I was able to find a better price on Amazon . : -RRB-
 Well i have to say that chrome is great . The first day i wore it work people were just like WOW ! I usually cycle about 7-8 different cologne trying to change it up everyday , but Chrome really got peoples attention especially the ladies ! Even some guys were like `` Dude what is that ? '' . This is a must have . But dont tell everyone hahaha
 I Got This Spray This Week , I Sprayed It Once And It Literally Lasted All Day It Even Smelled Like Chrome The Next Day , This Fragrance Smells Amazing , And It Last 's All Day , What Else Can You Want ?
 My boyfriend had been asking for this cologne for over a year , but in stores it was so expensive . Here , I got it at half the price and he 's so thankful .
 Item ordered in a timely manner and it perfect condition . My boyfriend and I love this fragrance!Thanks
 Chrome Azzaro is one of the best Mens perfumes i have ever used . I would highly recommend this for someone looking for a light , long lasting fragrance .
 Azzaro CHROME is one and only one ! I like it very much , and Ill by more ! Everyone should try it !!!!!!
 I thought it was too good to be true . The package was a gift for my boyfriend and he loved it . I will buy again .
 The price I paid for here was worth it !!!! I love Chrome and it 's always been my favourite !
 I 've used chrome azzaro for many years . its scent and effect goes on from morning to night , on same level
 I have enjoyed Chrome Cologne for a very long time . It is a really good sent that stays with you at the same time it does not overpower you with too strong a smell.I will continue to purchase and wear Chrome probably for the rest of my life .
 I chose this because i like this product and because it was a great price ! I would recommend this to anyone interested in this product !
 A MUST HAVE IN YOUR COLLECTION , OR GIVE AS A GIFT . THE BOX WAS SEALED AND NEW JUST LIKE A SAW IT IN THE STORE , I PUT IT ON MY SHIRT AND I STILL CAN SMELL IT ON MY UNDER SHIRT .
 I bought it for my husband . He loves it and I love it ! -LRB- maybe I do more than him -RRB- The scent is not so strong as usual for men fragrances yet it has a manly thing in it . Good to try . I am not gon na say too much because I want just my husband wearing it !!
 There are dozens , perhaps hundreds of men 's toilette spays and splashes on the market . For the money , and after years of personal experiences with many products , I have found Chrome to be the best of the best . Or at least I am told by those who get close enough to me to make a ranking of their own . Not one was a negative .
 This cologne smells great ! My teens use it every day , they wo n't even try my other ones . Apparently all the girls at school like that smell . I think it 's more for the younger crowd . It 's pretty strong , so it should last you for many hours . If you like the clean , sporty smell , you wo n't be dissapointed . I know i 'm going to have to buy another bottle soon .
 I got one after reading all the positive reviews and I have to say , I agree with them . The smell is very strong -- all parts -- head , heart and base . Do n't know why it is not labelled as unisex .
 This stuff is great . Seems to last pretty long especially on your clothes ... You will get compliments on it where ever you go !!
 It 's a clean fresh scent and not overpowering when used in moderation . I really like it a lot . I get compliments all the time when I wear it .
 Well i was thinking that this item might be a tester which is used and has no cap but i was surprised when i recieved it.It was brand new in sealed packing , never used and with Cap.Perfect scent . Must buy
 Very good transaction . Would do business with this vendor again in a heartbeat . 5 Stars !
 I smelled this cologne on a man at my workplace and it was wonderful but I bought it for my BF for Christmas and he has used over 1/4 of the bottle already because I keep having to ask him to spray more on because the scent just does not linger with him . I will not buy this one again . When I smell my man , I want to smell him everytime I get cloee to him . Honestly it is more perfect to spray on when you climb in bed and snuggle
 Product good value for the price . I would give it 5 stars if it were n't for the fact that I wanted to return the gift , as the person for whom it was for cheated on me . However , because its a liquid it could n't be returned . Ended up giving it to my dad for his bday . Wish I could have returned it tho . Good value of item tho
 Esta fragancia es acu&aacute;tica - met&aacute;lica un poco fuerte al principio pero conforme avanza se torna elegante , fresca y hasta un poco sensual , no me gustaba al inicio pero si es bastante agradable .
 este perfunme es muy bueno y el olor suave y dura mucho para ser una colonia . megusto es mi humilde
 My wife bought this lipstick in Spain , and was happy to find that she could purchase it in the U.S. also . It 's the perfect color for her , and does n't smudge .
 Just a note to let you know this is my wife 's signature perfume , and the price is the best we have ever found . The bottles arrived about 3 days after purchase . Great service .
 My wife 's favorite fragrance and my favorite on her . She is irresistible as is but when she 's wearing this I just melt . You could n't pry her away from me with a crowbar !
 This has always been my favorite fragrance . Its light and sweet and last a long while . I would definetly recomended it . .
 Adoro este perfume es muy bueno y tiene un aroma rico , dura todo el d&iacute;a en la piel . siempre lo compro
 with its compact size , this rack holds lots of spices with a significant amount of each.sturdy , good looking and comfortable . love it .
 This rack worked perfect for my spices , although I had a lot of leftovers since the bottles I believe are only 3oz . I would love to see this in a model with larger jars . I had no warped or broken jars and as a bonus , some of the jars I already had fit into the rack . The rack has been perfectly stable and it is easy to get jars in and out . My existing jars are a bit fatter and shorter and even wrapped in paper they fit just fine.When I bought the unit I really did n't pay attention to the labels . I really do n't care about stickers . However , I must say that I very much enjoyed the nice labels that were packaged with the rack . So much so that I even applied the correct stickers to jars I already had . I have n't had any issue with the stickers coming up , but I have only had them about a week . I will update later if the labels come up.For those who are concerned about having your spices exposed , it 's easy enough to wrap some paper around the jars . The jars will still fit into the rack just fine .
 he seemed to like them . seems to be a good basic set of jars that one can personalize . the bottles are glass and lids are plastic .
 Loved the first one so much , I bought a second ! Love it ! Easy to install and looks very nice . Unobtrusive to countertop items as well .
 I love this little thing -- it 's classy , easy to clean , sturdy , matches my other stainless appliances , the labels are a nice touch -- my only problem is that I wish a 16 - or 24-bottle size was available . But , since there are n't larger sizes , I 'm ordering another one ! WOOO !!!
 Easy to hang , great storage , looks amazing . Comes with the 12 glass jars and labels . Labels are printed with spices and herbs , and there were a lot more than I thought ! Space on the top can hold 5/6 more regular jars of spices/herbs . Huge space saver -- might get another !
 Got this for Christmas from hubby . Very neat and easy to find each spice . Heavy enough wont tip over . Love it !
 The rack is sleek and neat . I love how you can choose the stickers for the tops of the canisters . I also like how it comes with additional plastic lids incase there are spices that need bigger holes . Containers seal well . I probably will order another one .
 Love it ! This product looks great in my kitchen and provides me a way to get my spices out of the cabinets -LRB- in an organized manner -RRB- . No issues with any of the glass bottles that came with it . Mounting was very simple -LRB- hardware included
 Not cheap stainless material , very heavy . They gave the common spice name tags . I found almost all of them . The left you can write by yourself .
 Update to previous review : I emailed the company requesting a replacement for the warped bottle . They responded within a few days and shipped a replacement within a week . Replacement is totally fine . Completely satisfied w / product and seller.Overall it 's pretty good . Looks great , easy to mount on wall , easy to fill , functional , etc. . However , two things to note :1 . One of the 12 bottles is warped . It 's slightly oval shaped , so it wo n't fit into the rack 's hole . Let 's see how miserable it is to get them to send one replacement bottle -LRB- as I did n't realize this flaw until I was done filling all of the other bottles and have zero desire to empty , repack , replace and ship back the entire item -RRB- . Wish me luck .2 . The labels are not meticulously printed , so some are a little off center . Not a big deal for the average person , but I have an OCD sister in law for whom this would be maddening . Just a heads up .
 what else are you gon na do with your spices - lose them in the cupboard?there are LOTS of uglier designs than this - you could do worse.good points are it works as a countertop freestanding model , and also wall mounted - I bought three -LRB- yes , 36 spices -RRB- and have not regretted it.get a silver sharpie and write right on the cap for a spiffy functional look .
 I like this spice rack because it was the only contemporary-looking one I could find that let me fill my own spice jars with my own spices . Comes with labels for all the common spices you can think of - just choose the 12 you use all the time that you 'd like to have on your countertop . Also comes with blank labels . It looks really nice on my countertop and takes up hardly any room . One downside - it 's really dry in my place and some stickers did n't stick , so I just glued 'em .
 Quick adequate shipping . I was excited to get this product since I have two full shelves of spices in my cabinets and my old rotating spice rack took up too much space and didnt match our decor . The lids fit well . the labels look nice . and they have extras you can write on in case they dont provide the label -LRB- for instance , I was surprised they did not have a label for Garlic Powder :-RRB- Anyway , overall , I think I will be satisfied with this spice rack.Con
 The Prodyne Metalla 12 Bottle Spice Rack is truly an exceptional spice rack . Stylish and yet simple , incorporating stainless steel which has become quite popular for kitchen appliances and accessories . The black lids are a nice touch , as white too often yellows when exposed to the heat and light in a kitchen and I appreciate the choice of mounting options -- it can stand on a counter , be mounted on a wall or cabinet , and stacked . I only puchased mine a few weeks ago , so we 'll see how well it holds up . My only complaint with the rack is the pre-printed spice labels , which do not contain `` salt '' . There is `` celery salt '' , `` garlic salt '' , `` onion salt '' , and `` seasoned salt '' , but not plain old table salt . I found this listing while searching for an company website to see if they offered additional labels , but no luck so far .
 Well built , easily wall-mounted , convenient and thoughtfully designed . One caveat
 My search has ended ! I really like this spice rack ! I purchased 4 and have put all my spices in them.I love the fact that I choose what spices are in them and not getting the pre-filled with ones I would n't use . It is a well built unit , goes well with my other stainless steel . I did have to make some of my own labels that were off the beaten spice path . The bottles will hold a fair amount of spice . I did find that the holes in the shakers were larger in some cases than I wanted , but some of my shakers that came on my spice jars fit these so I switched . The spice racks came in perfect condition . Everyone that comes in my kitchen oohs and ahhs at them ! I think I need to purchase more for my daughters so that mine do n't walk off !
 This product looks nice and can contain a decent amount of spice per jar . Some of the pastic caps with the perferation / holes were a bit torn though , but still usable , and besides , it came with extra ones . Labeling caps with chalk marker worked well .
 I have this rack hanging in my small kitchen , it saves me precious cabinet and counter space while keeping the spices accessible . I would like slightly larger jars , and would rather have 15 or 18 than 12 , but chose this over racks on Amazon for price and aesthetics . I am very happy with this rack .
 Works as advertised . What else is there to say ? Comes with various pre-printed cover labels whichis a nice idea although very western-kitchen centric
 I love it . perfectly feet the space and very useful . thank you again . Just maybe need a little bigger stand with more bottles to add . : -RRB-
 We have owned two of these for almost two years now and love them . All of the labels provided have remained on the bottles . We secured these to the wall behind our stove and it is just what we needed . I am considering buying two more but right now I have to resolve one issue - getting some replacement bottles ... . someone either accidentally tossed some bottles or took them home . Very odd .
 Absolutely love it . The only con that I found was sometimes the labels do n't stay on the lid . I 've put them back on and then they do n't come back off so I do n't think it is going to be a problem . Very sturdy and heavy stainless . Looks great on my counter but you can hang them also .
 i really like the look of this - I bought 2 and am ordering one more . Perfect for my small kitchen . I buy spices not in jars , but by the bag , so I can adjust the amount needed . You do need to locate a bit away from the stove so as not to gather a bunch of oil on it , but it does clean up nicely . So easy to know where a spice is and if I need to get more .
 This is a very attractive , modern , clean-looking spice rack that I use regularly in my kitchen and it looks great against my wall .
 I have always alphabetized my spices to simplify the &#34; hunting &#34; process for just the right one . But these racks has made it even easier for me as it makes it where I can see all of them immediately . I bought 3 racks . I did n't hang them because I do n't have enough wall space to do so but just sat them on my cabinet shelves . I need to order at least 2 more racks to accommodate the remaining spices . The only complaint that I have is that the plastic dispensers that is to be place under the caps are absolutely useless as they do n't fit tightly enough to stay on . I just threw them away .
 Nice present , she loved it and will probably use it forever.A little pricey -LRB- if you include the cost of spices , which I did -RRB- .
 We have a very small kitchen and no room for spices in our cabinets so these spice racks were a great space saver . They mount to the wall with screws . We ordered two and they fit all our spices . They come with nice labels . They do n't take up counter space and I love the ease of getting the jars in and out . Very well made product .
 I really like that this can hang on the wall . I have limited room and try to get as much vertical space as possible , this did the trick . Look good too
 Great product !! Got this as part of a gift for the bf . He will be able to hang it on the door or wall , or set it on the counter . I really like how versatile it is .
 I purchased one and was enough for all my spices . Looks nice and function well . I did not hang mine because I like the mobility of taking where ever I am cooking . It is well designed .
 I have 3 of these mounted on the wall under the cabinets . Attractive and handy and it clears up a couple of shelves in my cupboard . I did n't realize how colorful spices are until I put them in these clear glass jars without all those labels hiding them.The unit is very heavy duty so I hung them up with spring open toggle bolt drywall fasteners instead of the kind that swells into the hole that are included . I also bought the Spice Jar Premium Waterproof Circular Labels in silver with black lettering for the lids so the lid tops match the brushed steel . The lids screw on tight and you can even use the plastic shakers and lids from the Spice Islands jars if you like . I fastened mine to the wall just above the counter backsplash which gives me enough room to use the top of the spice racks as a shelf to store my liquids and oddball stuff -LRB- vanilla , orange , peppermint extracts , salt & pepper mills , etc -RRB- . The only downside I know of with these jars is that they 're a touch smaller than the spice jars from the store . I can fit about 80-85 % of a Spice Islands container and 85-90 % of a McCormick Gourmet Collection container in the jars so be prepared to keep a box stuffed in the back of a lower cabinet with your original spice bottles . I pull them out once in a while to top off my jars.All in all a very good , well built product that does n't clutter up the counter top . It has rubber feet on the bottom if you want to leave it on the counter but with a coffee maker , crock pot , toaster , cream & sugar containers and glass cutting board already on the counters I wanted something I could hang on the wall to save what counter top I have left .
 I first bought this item because I needed a spice rack for non-traditional spices -LRB- Indian cooking -RRB- . The containers are a good size and they have quite a few already made labels with them . It also has blank labels to label other items , which I used all of them . The rack saves room and looks clean , only real downside is the tops do n't stay on as well as I would like . They also have tops with smaller holes for the powders . It is a good buy .
 I love it , serves it 's purpose , more convenient than anything else . Definitely recommend it to anyone who needs a spice rack .
 I bought this for our RV because we have some narrow shelves that not much else would fit . I was surprised at how heavy this was . My only issue is that I one broken glass bottle for the spices but I do n't think you would be disappointed if you were considering this item .
 This stainless steel rack is exactly as pictured -- very simple and well made . I bought two of them , thinking they would hold all my spices -LRB- which had been stashed here and there all over the kitchen -RRB- but unfortunately I underestimated and may get a third . One of the nicest features of this rack is the fact that you can either stand it up or hang it and you can stack one on top of another . I also bought a silver sharpie to label spices not included in the large selection that came with the jars -LRB- I cook with a lot of unusual spices . -RRB- It will be easy to clean , which is another plus .
 Exactly what is says , liked the spare blank labels as I have a lot of other spices . Racks are standard size and I just put some old spice bottles in it rather than decanting all my spices , then put one one the included stickers on the old lid and it all matched .
 Overall i really it . It 's well built , well priced , etc. . My only complaint is that the containers a bit smaller than most standard size spices in the plastic containers you buy in stores , so I have to keep the original containers around for a few weeks and use up the remaining spices . If they were a little bigger , 5 stars .
 This is a very convenient spice rack that does not have to take up any counter space . I grow most of my own spices so I like that it came with empty , unlabeled containers . My only complaint is that the the separate labels that came with it do not adhere very well at all so you have to come up with your own label system .
 I put this on the wall right in front of the prep table where I make meals . It is great having them right at your fingertips .
 I bought this spice rack for my mom as a gift for her modern kitchen . The spice rack fits in perfectly with all of the other stainless steel in our kitchen . I was pleasantly surprised by the size of this rack ; it looks larger than you might think , but the picture is otherwise accurate . The glass jars feel solid , as do the plastic tops . We have not mounted this , but leave it on the top of the counter ; it is solid enough to stand alone without fear of toppling . Our only concern was with the stickers provided ; many of hte spices that we keep were not among the options of the provided pre-printed stickers , and we did n't want to ruin consistency of the stickers by using some pre-printed and some with our -LRB- bad -RRB- handwriting . But , that 's a minor problem . Overall , we were very happy with this beautiful and modern rack to display our spices !
 I really like this set . It sets securely on my counter and looks very nice . I really liked that it did not come with spices already and that you could label your own bottles . Plus it takes up minimal room on my counter vs. the spinny ones at all the regular stores . I was very pleased with purchase and it was exactly what I was looking for .
 This spice rack is even better than expected . I love how much more organized my pantry looks . I ordered 2 racks but I 'm planning to get one more so I can get rid of even more cluttery little mismatched spice bottles . I hung mine on the back of my pantry door which has worked great , but be aware that it 's a bit heavy so you may not want to hang it on a thin cupboard door . You do have the option of standing it on the counter or a shelf if you do n't have a place to hang it .
 It was a Christmas gift for my nephew who moved in to his first place . He liked it . It 's modern and masculine .
 I 'd been needing to organize my spices for some time , especially since I 've started cooking mostly Middle Eastern and Asian dishes ; but all of the spice racks I saw in the stores came prepackaged with spices I never use - who uses Sage anyways ! Then I saw the stainless steel M912 spice rack on Amazon.com and ordered one . I was disappointed when the rack arrived and one of the glass spice jars was broke ! I had to mail the whole thing back ; but Amazon has sending returns down to a science ! In a week I received a new spice rack and I was in business . The rack was easy to install on the wall and looks great . The plastic lids on the glass jars seemed at first to be a little cheap , but work fine . You are also supplied with pre-printed labels for the jars so that you can customize what spices you want to put in the rack , which is really a plus . My only complaint is that it would be nice if there was a rack that held 4-6 more jars , as 12 does n't hold all of my spices and I do n't have room for two racks , which would be more space than I would need . Other than this one minor issue , the rack is working out great and now I can actually find the tumeric and coriander when I need it .
 I looked long and hard for a reasonably priced stainless , 12 bottle , spice rack . This one looks great and does n't take up a lot of real estate . It can be mounted or sit on the counter . I am very happy with it .
 LOVE my new spice rack . . Right now sitting on the counter not hanging and it looks so nice glad I bought it . The labels had a great variety of spices pre printed and they stick on the lid . The bottles are clear glass and are very nice . Well worth the money
 I orderd two of these and they really organized my spice cupboard - they sit side by side and everything is accessible . I do agree with other reviewers that the labels are kind of strange - it did n't have some common spices -LRB- turmeric -RRB- and include some weird ones -LRB- what is beau monde ? -RRB- Otherwise , it is wonderful , very clean and practical .
 I love it so much that I would like to buy two more ! Very beautiful and well made .
 This spice rack was just what we needed , it fits snug to the wall and was easy to install . The jars are slightly smaller than more grocery store spice containers so you have a little left over . Also the lids could fit better and the rack itself could be more solid , but like I said it 's great for the price . Only real flaw is the stickers are peeling off some of the lids and I have to keep rubbing them back on but it 's not working and there were n't enough pre-made ones so I had to write in a few , I 'll be peeling them all off and writing with silver sharpie on all the lids for a uniform look .
 This is a great product for my RV.mwish the bottles were a thick plastic though . I love them although I would make that change .
 What can I say , this spice rack is great . After buying two , my wife and I decided to buy another and expand our spice selection . We now have a library of spices in simple , modern jars . It 's surprisingly hard to find modern spice jars that are actually functional , but these are the real deal.The one thing you have to look out for is that these jars are a little smaller than you might be used to . Also , expect it to take a little while to transfer all of your spices neatly into these jars . While you 're at it , pick up a spice funnel or two to make the job a bit easier.The one thing I 'd change is the inner lids . They 're cheap , and do n't &#34; snap &#34; onto the jars so much as sit on the top of them . When we transfered our spices to these jars I re-used the inner lids from the old jars and ca n't be happier . The openings are standard size , so anything you have now is likely to work on these .
 I poured over product selection before deciding on the Prodyne m-912 stainless spice rack . I wanted to fill my own spices into glass bottles and I did n't want to spend a fortune . I debated getting two of them from the start but only went with one . I am ordering a second one because I love the way that it looks and I want to keep all my herbs and spices uniform and on display ! The standing design with small counter or cabinet footprint is a key positive feature . I 'm not nuts for the modern look but it 's smart and I took the advice of another reviewer and wrote my spice names in silver sharpie for a personal touch rather than using the labels . Each of the twelve jars has a shaker top with the large holes . They do have a few that you can swap out for fine holes . Some of my spices I prefer to pinch anyway . Very satisfied with this purchase and ordering my second one right away . So naturally I am recommending that if in doubt just go for two !
 I 've had this for a few month now and it 's really very nice looking in my newly renovated kitchen ! I have it sitting on my counter because I hesitate to poke holes in the wall for now . It comes with most of the spices I use regularly , I still have some other spices that I keep in the fridge -LRB- paprika for instance -RRB- . The white caps that you put on to sprinkle the spice does not fit perfectly because the grooves in the bottle top come up to high to the rim . That said , I have n't had one fall off yet . I would consider buying another set if I needed one .
 Not much to say . this is simply put , fantastic ... It is VERY studry steel with rubber feet . It can be hung up , laid downand put in a drawer or , you can let it sit on the counter -LRB- thats what i doo cuz it looks so nice , very contemporary -RRB- it is really sturdy and heavy pretty thick gauge and that is what makes it MUCH better than others.also i like the fact that it doesnt have spices inside already beacause i like to pick each spice with scrutiny.OH btw it comes with 5 extra lid/tops/sifter -LRB- not the black lid on the jar but the one you snap on the glass to prevent your spice from pouring out -RRB- with fine holes in case the larger holes dont float your boat . also i should have mentiond first EVREY jar has a lid and sifter already includedThis thing is fantastic i would have bought a larger one if it was avalible but instead ull just buy a second.ADDED
 Spice rack is great . Arrived with one broken bottle , called Prodyne and they promptly sent me a replacement . Ca n't say enough about this company , excellent service -LRB- hard to find today -RRB- .
 This spice rack worked great ! I wanted an empty spice rack so I could fill the bottles with organic spices . It even came with labels , perfect size bottles , and a nice stainless steal rack to be alabetically organized and space saving ! I bought 2 so I could have 24 spices .
 I bought two of these racks and mounted them side-by-side on the wall in my kitchen , underneath the cabinets . I love them -- out of the way , yet accessible .
 I really like this spice rack . I did n't hang it ... I just put it on my counter . Looks pretty . The bottles were all smaller than my normal spice bottles from the store . So I have those hidden in the pantry . There are plenty of labels that come with it . I do wish there were more slots and bottles . I will have to order another one : -RRB- Really like this rack . : -RRB-
 I love this spice rack.It is stainless steel and looks great in my kitchen.I wish it were bigger but it is so much better than the one I had.It arrived when promised and looked great when it arrived.It was a great experience buying from amazon .
 This spice rack is a great quality product . Love the look and slimness . I was able to place in a cabinet in front of my glasses which really keeps my spices within easy reach .
 Superb rack . It comes with two easy mount screws and can be mounted in about 2 minutes . The bottles sit at a slight angle and the labels are big enough to be seen across the kitchen . Light weight yet solid and attractive . And the seller delivered it to my house way ahead of the projected delivery dates .
 Got this for my food nerd girlfriend for Christmas , and was surprised at how quality it was . Have n't wall mounted it yet and it is a little bit heavier than expected , but to me that just signals that it 's made of quality materials and is sturdy . The stickers that came with it were a great touch , she loves it and I scored on present buying .
 Awesome spice rack . Highly recommended . No longer do I have to fumble through the cabinets looking for spices now that I have this rack mounted on the kitchen wall . Comes with lables , just peal and stick on the lid . High quality , very classy and convenient . Well worth the $ 39.95 .
 One bottle was broken in transit and Amazon replaced the entire set and let me keep the original too ! Nice and compact and simple . Can fit a teaspoon in the jar . Definitely a great upgrade from using the plastic bag that the herbs and spices I buy come in ! Plenty of stickers too and the slightly off centred occasional one does n't worry me . I plan to have the set sort of out of sight , well at least not a display feature anyway .
 this is a great fragrance . It is light and is a good summer fragrance .
 I was very happy to find this product here . I use it and its the only thing I can use on my thick hair and it gets cancelled . So I needed it fast and thats what I got . Fast service .
 I have curly hair and when I mix this with John Frieda Volume down , it works great !! I ca n't do without this stuff . I must have spent thousands on millions of products , but this is truly what works !!!
 Impossible to find . It appears it is no longer available . Bummer ... The good things always come to an end .
 Love this product , works great . Took a little longer than I thought it would to receive the item . It all worked out well in the end .
 Worth every penny . Wonderful strong scent and rich foam . Both this scent and the Lavender are just fantastic .
 This is the only bubble bath that I 've used that does n't irritate my skin . I LOVE it , my 12 year old son loves it , my 7 year old daughter loves it , my husband loves it , my mother-in-law loves it and I 'm ordering some today for my mother .
 My husband smells fabulous . Recommend that you buy it . Will buy it again . Good for the price . Go ahead buy these .
 I got this cologne for my husband on the recommendation of a friend . It 's great , I love the way it smells , and he does too .
 IT DOES SMELLL GOOD FOR A GOOD PRICE . ITS A NICE GIFT FOR CHRISTMAS WHICH THATS WHAT IM GETTING HIM
 Gift for Christmas , he has not received yet . But was a recommendation my by son . Hopefully he will like it .
 I bought this cologne for my father and we were both pleased with the scent . It is n't overwhelming , not musky , but is still masculine . That being said-a little goes a long way . Do n't bathe in it guys , just a spritz or two and you 're golden . A great alternative to the traditional colognes . Branch out , try something new ! Also of note-It arrived exactly on time .
 I really like the smell of this cologne especially in the summertime . It is so fresh and clean and makes me feel sexy
 Chrome is my favorite fragrance for men . It has very refreshing and lingering citrus notes which I absolutely love on my man . Its great for both day time as well as night wear . Very attractive and not loud . I absolutely love it !!!
 finally a brush my dog is n't trying to eat . inexpensive and comfortable in my hand
 An awesome product that sells out - and that 's the only problem ! I had to call around the US to find it in a department store , in stock and that would ship . Amazon 's supplier was sold out .
 Great medium to heavy coverage foundation . Love the portability and ease of application.This works like a snap to make me feel confident when I do n't feel like getting dolled up and just want to even out my skin tone and slap on some lip liner/balm . One tip
 I have used this stick for years and repeatedly come back to buy it . However , after using tinted moisturizer recently now the stick feels a little heavy . It is good for spot coverage , or for summer weather to blend a tan , but I think I will go back to inted moisturizer for most of the year . I went to the mall and got matched first and then purchased online . The shades quickly get dark/orange .
 I loved all of Bobbi Brown 's products but this might have to be my favorite . It 's full coverage is what I need without being heavy or greasy .
 I have used this foundation stick for 15 years . I use it with a foundation primer and a little powder and coverage will last all day !
 It was very convenient to reorder Dior lipstick through Amazon.com ; I could not find the lipstick in any of the department stores here.Glenna
 I have used color stay nail polish for years ... all of a sudden they discontinue it . It upsets me so much . From time to time I can find it on the internet . Now I ca n't find any in my shade...440-Always Natural . It is the best nail polish ever . I keep trying other 10 day polishes but non can compare with Color Stay . BRING IT BACK !!!!
 I bought this product in two different colors . I have been currently wearing the color on my toes for 22 days . THEY ARE STILL CHIP FREE ! I swear up and down that this is the best LASTING nail polish ever . Previously to this color of nail polish I tried another and that lasted closer to the 14 day mark -LRB- on my toes -RRB- . On my hands the polish lasts around 10-14 days depending on what I 'm doing . Sometimes I will reapply the clear coat to make them look all nice and new looking . I 've had SO many people comment on my nails and toenails about how nice they look -- all for about $ 5 a package.Now , the negative . This stuff is SO HARD to get off . I wanted to just cry and give up the first time I took it off . It left residue all over my hands . It really depends on the remover you use though , because the 2nd , 3rd + times that I used it , it came off a bit better with another remover . It was still a struggle but it did n't end up everywhere.The only other negative is that it dries so quickly that the brush can get lumpy but if you are quick with doing your nails it 's not so bad.Good Luck !
 I love this product !!! I bought 2 different colors to try them out and see if it really stays on longer , and it does ! I have 2 young kids so I 'm washing my hands all the time . Every other nail polish lasts maybe 2-3 days for me . This one lasts a week minimum each time I use it . I will no longer use any other nail polish , now I just need to buy more colors !
 While I am not crazy about the colored polish the sealing shine top coat is awesome . The best out there ! I am a nurse , so I wash my hands numerous times throughout the day and my color will stay on atleast 5 days or longer . Getting my nails done by manicurist the polish may stay for one day if I am lucky . I can use other polish with the top coat and it works just as well . Try it . . Good luck . .
 I was ill for awhile and my hair fell out quite rapidly . From a full head of hair to obvious hair loss was not a big deal as adjusting to my my illness took precedence . However , it was a side effect of the illness which I did not like . I purchased this and was quite happy . My partner took it to dive into my stash and uses it everyday . I 'm no longer ill to where my hair is falling out as much , but it is just slowly growing back . This has helped the both of us .
 There 's a bit of a learning curve , but it works really well for the hair line.if you goto dermmatch.com you can get free applicators mailed to you .
 As a woman losing her hair ... all I can say is that Dermmatch works wonders ! The colors are dark , so be careful in when you order . It helps make the balding look not so bad . It 's a coverup , that 's all it is , but it can make you feel a lot better about your hair . I wish I had found this sooner.Any questions about my experience with this please feel free to email me @ FSUBIGDOGS@aol.com .
 I have used Dermmatch it for years . My hair looks thicker and better with it . It helps cover my bald spot . It is a lifesaver .
 I 've never tried this kinda thing before , but my hair is thinning and I thought I would give it a try . I think it is a great product . It is fast and easy to use , it dried out my hair a little , but a little gel makes it look really goodDermmatch Dark Brown . Good product.Dermmatch Dark Brown
 I have a lot of bald spots on my head and i 'm ONLY 19 !! : / I 've always been embarrased abouti it and i read a lot of good reviews about this product and i just received it in the mail today and i tried it right away and let me tell you . . I LOVE IT !!! It covers my bald spots . My hair looks fuller and thicker . . it really works ! I really recommend it . . my self esteem is higher than ever . . thank you DERMMATCH !
 i like the way this covers the gray , but it tends to dry the hair a bit , it also hides thinning hair pretty well . this allows me longer time before i need to color my hair again .
 A helpful item if you have thinning hair , widening of the part , or a bald spot from alopecia areata -LRB- more helpful for women if the bald spot is one that can be somewhat hidden by rearranging the rest of your hair but you still want to put something on the spot to make the skin less noticeable through the hair -RRB- . I ordered the dark brown shade and it is very dark brown , nearly a dark charcoal gray/soft black , with a hint of taupe/olive brown in the hue . Probably if you have dark brown or black hair this will be fine , but if your hair is lighter brown or reddish brown you should check out other color options . The dark brown does not have reddish tones . The powder is kind of like eye shadow and creates a shadow on the skin that makes thinning hair seem thicker because you do not notice the contrast with the skin so much . If your skin on your scalp is very dark , maybe you wo n't notice as much contrast to begin with so then this product probably wo n't do much but if you are like me , with bright white scalp which can create a very noticeable contrast when you have dark hair and hair loss issues , this product will help you feel less sensitive about your hair loss issues . It probably would be useless to cover a large bald spot that had no other hair to style over it -LRB- for example a man with very short hair and a large bald spot would find this product useless -RRB- .
 After trying several alopecia masking products , I prefer DermMatch Dark Brown for its color , ease of use , and value . For background to this review , my particular hair loss type is generalized thinning . My hair is now also quite gray ; although , I dye my hair a light ash brown.The Dark Brown DermMatch color is more of a taupe than a brown , but as such it very effectively mimics the shadow that hair casts upon the scalp . I believe that is why it works with my lighter hair color . The taupe cast is also more effective in blending with ash brown hair colors . There 's nothing worse than ash brown hair with a glaring reddish brown scalp . I found the Couvre products to produce too much red in contrast with my hair color.DermMatch is very effective at shadowing the part in my hair , creating a more uniform look . In addition , pushing the color around the roots of the hair also helps to camouflage my new gray growth . Since I am only applying powder to my scalp , only about one-half inch of hair is receiving any product ; therefore , it does not dull the appearance of my hair at all.I prefer to apply the material dry with the provided applicator , because it gives me more control of the color depth and works perfectly for my specific type of hair loss . The product has a very firm consistency in the compact , and using it dry does not create extra flaking powder left behind like Joan Rivers Great Hair Day.Another plus for me is that this product is nearly unscented , and I have a very sensitive sense of smell . Only if you bring the compact up to your nose will you notice a very pleasant , unobtrusive scent . This is also in contrast to the Joan Rivers product which knocks you senseless with a sickeningly sweet overpowering stench.There is also a significant amount of product in one compact . The disk of color is a full three inches in diameter and should last a very long time . I 'm very pleased with DermMatch .
 IT COVERS WELL , NO COMPLAINTS , BETTER THAN COUVRE , ALTHOUGH COUVRE IS QUICKER SINCE ITS WET THIS IS BETTER FOR NOT GETTING ON YOUR PILLOW AS MUCH AND ON COUCHES , AND WATER RESISTANT TO A DECENT DEGREE .
 so I figured I 'd add a review as well . I 'm a 32 year old woman and I 've been slowly thinning on top for about 10 years and its finally become pretty noticeable and incredibly embarassing . My hair is medium to dark brown and I keep it longish - shoulder length with some layers - but my scalp is noticeable through the entire top of my head . This is the first product I tried , although I 've since tried Nanogen fibers and My Secret Hair Enhancer spray . All have their ups and down IMO . I like the Dermmatch a lot because the coverage works well AND its waterproof - my scalp is VERY noticeable when my hair is wet so I would n't dream of hitting the beach without it ! It is somewhat time consuming to apply , so I have n't used it daily and one container has lasted over a year . I 've gotten it down well enough now that its maybe a 10 minute application , but I 'm not a morning person so often I just opt for a ponytail with a quick spray of the MSHE . It covers well BUT will leave residue on ANYTHING that touches your head and I 've often ended up leaving ashy fingerprints on my forehead . Dermmatch does n't have this problem . I 've never used much for styling products though and the Dermmatch does make it feel like I have a bunch of product in there - like mousse or something . I 've found the best application is to wash my hair first , apply to my scalp while my hair is wet . Then I blowdry the roots to make sure its dried to my scalp and quickly shower again without shampooing to rinse off any excess . This cuts the `` gunky '' feel down and when there is excess in there , I find it will come off a little on my fingers if I run them through my hair -LRB- which I tend to do a lot when its down -RRB- , though not nearly as bad as the MSHE spray . I then style as I normally would . Since trying the nanogen fibers , I 've decided the best approach is a combination of dermmatch and fibers -LRB- I plan to try X-Fusion this time around -RRB- . Overall , the waterproofness alone makes this product a key component to camouflaging your hair loss , so I would highly recommend it .
 This is an amazing way to work magic on your hair . It is near effortless and not messy at all . I wish I had known about this much sooner . My preference has always been to dry my hair without using the hairdryer or any styling products . This makes it easy and possible for me . I just apply it according to instruction , comb my hair through and let it dry naturally . It gives me alot of volume that lasts for days . The only negative thing I have to say about it is that it can make your hair very dry and tangled up . However , this is easily managed by rubbing some oil to the ends of your hair .
 I 've been using this product for over 7 years and am pleased with the results . One kit lasts a very long time and can be used dry , or damp as directed . I do notice that it does make my scalp a bit itchy by the end of the day , and seems to come off easier with sweat than the company will let on.Overall a great product that I recommend .
 I bought this product because I have an annoying gaping part on the back of my head that looks like a bald spot . I wear clip in hair extensions to make my hair look fuller , and sometimes the extensions would become visible because of my cowlick . This products works great for covering up the part , and the extensions remain unseen after I use it . I also use it to keep the grey hairs that grow in at my temples dark in-between dye jobs . The product is messy , but once you get the hang of it , it 's easy . The reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars is because it leaves your hair feeling gunky where it 's applied , and small amounts will rub off throughout the day if you fuss with it . It looks totally natural however ; nobody would ever know that I use it . Admittedly I 'm not trying to cover large bald spots , but for the dime-sized gaping part , it 's the perfect product .
 I agree with the previous reviewer . I am in my 50 's and it gives me a nice dewy complexion . Amazon is currently out of the product . I do hope they get it back in stock .
 I bought this because I really liked the Bijan Black , but I wanted something slightly different ... it smells really good ... . and now I use it even more than the Black . All my co-workers like it , and some even bought it for themselves !
 This was exactly what I was looking for . I do not use it on a wig but on my own hair . It does not leave the static like an ordinary brush .
 Does n't create static on wigs , which is really important for a wig brush . Well spaced and everything for breaking knots without pulling hair out .
 After many years of various hairbrushes ripping out my hair after blow drying and everyday styling , I finally discovered the best brush on the market for people who care about keeping their hair in tact ! Not only is this brush eye appealing due to the various translucent color choices -LRB- blue , pink , clear -RRB- but the bristles are soft on the hair and scalp and do not `` snap '' off one 's hair during a brushing routine . They have safety tips which prevent your hair from snagging and are soft on your scalp and the bristles are very gentle and flexible to avoid losing all of your hair during your brushing or hair drying session . I will never let my hairdresser brush out my hair at the salon again , I always take out this brush and do it gently myself and spare my hair from damage . You ca n't go wrong with this one and you will never go back to other brushes again after using the Spornette 9300 !
 Of all of the hair brushes I 've ever used , this one is by far my personal favorite . Seems to be very gentle on my hair but at the same time seems to leave my hair looking far better than before I ran the brush through it . I always have a spare at the ready in my hall cupboard in case I ever accidentally drop or break one of them , or drop one accidentally into the `` flushing device '' while half asleep in the cRaZy morning rush -LRB- what a drag that can be . -RRB- I always want to have an extra around - yeah , I like them that much .
 This round , natural bristle brush is something I have been looking for for a long time . I tried avoiding the computer for a long time -LRB- 69 of age -RRB- but guess it has its place . I love a similar brush I bought from a beauty supply store some 20 years ago , so someone else may be brushing my hair in a nursing home before this one needs replacing . Thank you AMAZON .
 Just blow out my hair with it and love it !!! I have a lot of thin hair that is in the middle of straight and curly with a lot of volume . This was a gist to get my hair as I wanted al sleek and with the right volume . I bought this brush after reading about it here -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- -RRB- It really is and excellent product .
 Love , love , love !!! Every women with frizzy hair schould buy it!not so expensive and is doing its job : -RRB- Maybe this is not Mason Pearson brush but still ... is good !
 The brush is very nice . The quality is great and does a great job . The price is not outrageous when compared to similar products online or locally .
 No perfume I 've ever worn has received as many compliments , or requests to know `` what is that fragrance you 're wearing ? '' from other women . Even men have noticed and complimented me on my perfume -- happened again just last week . I love Tocade because it is subtle and evocative , but never overpowering . Try it ! You 'll like the gentle floral scent with woodsy undertones , and you 'll be amazed at how a little fragrance goes such a long way !
 I love this perfume and was fortunate to buy it in a gift set for $ 20 at a second-hand retailer . I love Bijan Original , and was `` charmed '' by the mysterious packaging and color combination on this one . While the scent invokes every possible characteristic of what a `` Wicked '' scent should smell like , it 's not very strong and fades after a couple of hours . I have to layer it with a perfume oil -LRB- White Amber -RRB- and pomegranate/apple-type perfumes to have it radiate . It works VERY WELL w / my white amber perfume oil and it lasts!I will definitely keep this one at the front of my vanity ...
 When first applied this smells like hairspray for about 10 seconds . Then you get the sourness of red berries , the watery notes of lotus and earthy patchouli.Somewhat lighter than what I expected a fragrance called `` Wicked '' to be , but quite pleasant . I 'd recommend to someone looking for a not so intense chypre.Poor lasting power , but it is an eau de toilette .
 One of my favorite scents . It is Bijan 's best to me , very sexy and gets comments all the time . I have been buying this for years and the price now is ridiculously cheap compared to years ago . A steal of a deal .
 The Bijan Line smells wonderful . I have had the chance to smell and purchase almost all scents from Bijan . I 'm Loving it .
 This product is really great and is the only thing that has shown significant improvement in my rosacea type acne . It is thick and tinted and can look really cakey and gritty so I just use it at night before bed and wash it off in the morning and my skin looks amazing ! I am so happy to have found this because I have literally tried everything .
 I have used this product since my very first ZIT !!!! It is cover up/make up for MEN !!!! And it heals my acne very quickly . What a life saver before a date : -RRB-
 I 've been searching for a mattefier for my super oily skin . I 've tried several products over the last 20 years . Most help for a very short while , then the shine comes right back . Make up only lasts a couple of hours . Acnomel is the first product I 've tried with sulfur . I 've used it for a week , and wow ! It really helps the oily skin . My makeup is lasting all day , with only 1 or 2 blots during the day -LRB- compared to 6-8 times . -RRB- I 'm curious as to the long term effects . Will it make my skin start flaking ? I look very young for my age . Everyone says it 's because of my oily skin .
 I use this when a zip appears and it will usually be gone in 2 days or less . It really dries out the spot and is tinted so it covers the redness . Great stuff .
 I tried many things and this is the best product out there . It does leave a brownish tint , which does n't blend so well with a light skin tone . So I wash it off after 20 minutes or put on before going to sleep , or just do n't put on that much . But it works great . This is hard to find in stores , so I went to Amazon . Highly recommended .
 Acnomel works pretty well . When I get a big honkin ' zit , this stuff helps to dry it out and shrink it within a night or two . Use extra moisturizer before applying acnomel to avoid flakey spots . It 's not a flattering smell , but I use it at night so nobody cares . Or even during the day if I apply a slightly smaller amount , then my makeup goes on after that -LRB- after acnomel dries/absorbs into skin -RRB- so the smell is pretty well covered up . I either wear it at night or wear makeup -LRB- foundation -RRB- over it , so I 'm not concerned about how the tint is off -LRB- though it 's not too badly off anyways -RRB- . I highly recommend this to acne sufferers . It 's not the only thing you should have , but it is an excellent addition to your skin care products . The bottle seems to go a long way , and it is totally affordable : -RRB-
 I have been using this product for 20 years . I tried a lot of those salisylic acid and benzoyl peroxide acne treatments before this and none of them did anything but irritate my skin even more . Acnomel gets rid of acne quickly after it starts and I wear acnomel on problem spots like chin and forehead at night and it keeps the acne from even starting . If I get lazy and stop wearing it the acne will slowly come back . I do n't wear it during the day though because it 's kind of cakey looking . That being said , I always stock up on it whenever I can find it . Like the other great Numark Lab products it 's cheap and very effective and unfortunately hard to find . I get mine at Rite-Aid where it 's often out of stock and I 'm always worried they will discontinue it and I will have to go back to being a piazza face .
 ACNOMEL ADULT ACNE CREAM IS THE BEST ZIT CLEARER AND PREVENTION I HAVE EVER USED . I ESPECIALLY LIKE THE TAN COLOR TO TONE DOWN THE RED ...
 I have been using acnomel for a short time now . It does dry up my pimples and reduces itchiness and redness . When I stopped using it , the pimples began to come back . I bought the white vanishing cream , not the tinted version , so it goes on and disappears into my skin . For those people who do n't like the tinted version , this could be a better option . The only down side for me is the smell . I personally do n't mind the smell but I think other people could smell it on me and they might be turned off by that . Because of the smell , I use it mostly at night . Maybe it could be combined with a nice smelling essential oil or cream that is noncomodogenic to hide the smell .
 I have used this product for my face , back and shoulders.For face , It is not any better than average . It is tinted for coverage -LRB- I think also to cover the color of sulfur -- active ingredient -- which is yellow -RRB- , but it has too much red for my skin . My skin is medium with a yellow tone . So , it shows as red patches unless I cover all of my face and neck . Then , my face becomes redder than usual , not my natural color.If you have medium skin with red tone , it should be fine for you.It is also hard to spread because it is gritty and thick . I mix it with a drop of moisturizer to have a thinner cream so I can spread it better.But , it works well for light acne on my back and shoulders !!! Certainly , better than salicylic acid products , and it does not bleach my clothslike benzoyl peroxide does . The color does not matter , it does not show as much as it does on the face . Sulfur is also good for your skin in general , so you will notice that the skin on your back and shoulders starts looking brighter .
 Good product and is a better alternative for acne that does n't respond to salicylic acid and or benzoyl peroxide . Just note that it is TINTED . The tinting is n't bad but it certainly is n't the right color for everyone and it wo n't blend like your foundation will .
 This stuff works great for cystic acne . Whenever I feel one coming on , I 'll dab some of this on it and within 2-3 days the cyst is gone . The only downside is that it 's tinted so I only use it at night . Very inexpensive and definitely worth at try !
 This both dries and covers ... I have used it for years and continue to purchase it and use it as necessary
 My friends and I used to use this in a different format when we were teens . Bought it for my 14 yr old son who is using Proactive but still breaking out . Acnomel has a different active ingredient than Proactive I believe so hopefully it will help . We have n't used it yet , but if it 's like what I used it has a bit of a tint to it that helps to hide the redness ... three days later ... WOW , this stuff really works ! Bumpiness is gone and most pimples healed . Not too drying on him , no flaking skin.You should get some : -RRB-
 There are many similar products in the market but Acnomel cream is the only one that truly works for me.Highly recommended .
 I 've used this acne medicine several times over the years and imagine my surprise when I could n't find it at any stores ! So glad that I found it on Amazon . This is the best adult acne medicine I 've ever used and trust me , I 've tried them all .
 I have dealt with acne since I was 12 , fortunately only lightly as an adult , but it is still an issue . This is the only remedy I 've ever used that works and usually showing results within less than 24 hours . The best aspect is the absence of benzoyl peroxide -- meaning no more ruining of sheets , clothing towels etc. -- and it is so much more effective .
 I have suffered from Acne since I was a teenager . Now I am in my late thirties . This is the only cream -LRB- except a prescription only lotion that worked well also but was much more expensive -RRB- that consistently keeps my skin clear of blemishes .
 Acnomel was my old standby when I had terrible cystic acne . And though it did not clear my cystic acne - only product that worked well was accutane this worked well to at least mask the huge cyst while it was healing . I really love this product and it 's been around since my mom was a kid and used it .
 Got a good deal on this product . Product was delivered earlier than promised date . Good job ... thanks
 This conditioner is very creamy and light . It can be rinsed out or left in . I like to leave it in when my hair needs extra moisturizing . The aroma is nice and not too overpowering . This product is good for all hair types .
 I have very long , fine hair and struggle to find a conditioner that nourishes without weighing my hair down but alas this conditioner does just that and for FAR less than the high-end spa products I 've purchased in the past . I love the light lavender scent that 's not fake or overwhelming and I appreciate that they use natural ingredients and are a family owned business .
 I have been using EO conditioners for several years now , but I have n't tried the French Lavender conditioner until recently . I absolutely love the smell of lavender . This conditioner has just enough of the lavender smell to relax you and enjoy the wonderful smell . I love the fact that EO uses natural essential oils rather than lab created ones . I have very sensitive skin and since swithing to EO products several years ago , I have not had any problems . Last year , while travelling overseas , I forgot to pack my shampoo and conditioner . I had to use prodcuts with detergents and I started having skin problems . After coming home and using my EOs , my skin problems went away in a few days . I highly recomend these conditioners by EO .
 This conditioner does n't feel like it is working but when you style your hair , it will have lots of shine and body . My hair is fine and I liked the fact that this conditioner did n't weigh my hair down like some do . On the other hand , some lightweight conditioners make your hair frizzy . This one did n't . It was the right blend of smooth and light . The lavender smell does n't hurt , either ! Love it .
 It 's clear that EO products are developed through trial & error by thoughtful people , starting from gentle & mild -- but also substantial -- ingredients . They are definitely NOT the result of some corporate cosmetics laboratory process . I apply a dab of French Lavender Conditioner after showering -- do n't worry , you CAN leave it in -- to condition my hair & scalp .
 I have used this between more heavy conditioning treatments like keratin . This conditioner smells wonderful and does rinse out well . It is very light but does the trick . I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a daily conditioner that will detangle and moisturize .
 I use the EO chamomile shampoo first , then the conditioner . Love the smell and it makes my hair so soft and healthy ! I comb conditioner through my hair in the shower , wash my body , then rinse . Perfect !
 I originally purchased this product while on vacation -- something cheap to tide me over temporarily . I need a conditioner to detangle my fine hair without weighing it down . -LRB- Though this product claims to be for all hair types . -RRB- EO French Lavender conditioner has a fairly pleasant fragrance -LRB- that disappears -RRB- , applies easily , and washes out quickly . I have never had a product that leaves my hair so shiny ! After using it , my hair is soft to the touch and has some volume to it . Love it !
 I love this conditioner ... it 's perfect for my thick , dry hair and very sensitive skin.Here 's why I like it :1 . Almost all shampoos and conditioners cause breakouts on my back and shoulders , but this conditioner did n't . It 's on the `` short list '' of products that do n't irritate my skin .2 . It left my hair feeling soft and natural and well-hydrated -LRB- with help from a couple drops of jojoba oil after my shower , but I always add that to tame my hair since it is so thick and dry . -RRB- 3 . It rinses clean and does n't leave gunk in my hair . That makes it a great conditioner to use by itself -LRB- without shampoo -RRB- on those days when my roots are oily but the rest of my hair is very dry . It emulsifies the natural oils and distributes them more evenly .4 . The smell is beautiful and natural and wholesome . It 's perfect if you prefer `` essential oil '' scents -LRB- some people do n't ... but I do -RRB- . I sniff-tested dozens of conditioners before I smelled this one and thought `` Finally , one that smells natural . `` My only complaint is that the bottle is so small . 8 ounces wo n't last very long for someone with thick , long hair . And it 's expensive compared to other conditioners , but I have had such a hard time finding a good conditioner that I do n't mind the price as much as I normally would . I am definitely stocking up now that I see it on sale .
 The smell is the best thing about this product . As a conditioner , it 's very good but I 've used others that were as good and cost less . Still , I like this because I use the same brand and scent of shampoo and I give that 5 stars plus !
 Ok so it is defintley tingly but this is the BEST lip plumper ever ! i am completely addicted to it , really give you full lips and great natural color !!
 This smells really good - it 's light and not over powering but makes a statement . I love the smell and I ca n't wear the heavy scents .
 For the price and it was the BEST price out there and loved it . Came perfectly wrapped with packing so it did n't break .
 Nice product !!! I love it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !!! good , good !!!
 I smeell weell I love this colonge nude bill blass for women in spray 3.4 ounces of bill blas s
 Beautiful sophicated romantic scent.I always get compliments ! A little goes a long way and the scent lasts all day .
 I have used Nude by Bill Blass for years . I took a break , and now back again . I get lots of complements . I thought it was eau de toilet though .
 I have been using since it first came out . People always ask what I am using when I wear it .
 I search high and low for the cologne , absolutely love it . I get so many compliments when I wear this , it has a clean smell .
 I have worn this perfume since 1988 . I can not wear any other perfume because I am very sensitive to scents and get serious headaches from almost all other perfumes . I am so happy that Nude has been around for so long and I hope it continues to manufactured . So many people compliment my signature scent .
 I been in love with this perfume all my life . Every time I wear it I get complement . Women love it , man love it . It small awesome ! If could give it more stars I would
 I have worn Bill blass `` Nude '' for over 12 years now , and anytime I wear it someone will almost always say , `` Oh my , you smell so good ! , What is that frangrance you are wearing ? '' I hope that this will always be available online , because the only store you can find it in is Perfumania .
 A woman at work wore this sometimes and whenever she did I would ask her what she was wearing . She always told me `` it 's Nude '' . She would laugh and say that men found it `` interesting '' as well . She said that she had been accused of using `` chemical warfare '' by men who were utterly commanded by her fragrance . Finally I purchased it and it smells even better on me . :-RRB- When you apply it , go light . I use just a tiny bit and people come in closer just to try and get a whiff . It is very provocative .
 I chose Amazon.com , because it 's prices are reasonable . I love my perfume Nude . I it a beautiful smell . I get many compliments from men as well as women . I would recommend this to all my friends and family .
 We have a running joke at my house , when my wife asked for a bottle of this years ago she said &#34; and its very hard to find they dont make it any more &#34; and I went out to Pennys and found a huge display of it . Not so much anymore , so glad to find it on Amazon
 My husband purchased this for my birthday ! I remembered a friend wore it in the 90 's and wanted to find a new scent for me . Good price !
 thank you very much ! Excellent service!Very accurate ! I would love to get more ! I will recommend to my friends and family !
 This product was excellent . This is a fragrance I have used for several years and get lots of compliments when wearing it .
 This deal is awesome ! You ca n't find this cologne anywhere . 20 years ago Nude was over $ 50 a bottle . I get compliments all the time when I wear it !
 Bill Blass personally handed me my first bottle when I worked for the airlines and little did I know this would become my signature scent . It mixes really well with my body chemistry but lately I have been saving my last bottle for special occasions . -LRB- I have saved some from the original bottle that I received from Mr. Blass and will never throw it out -RRB- . Now I have to go online to find this scent as it 's not around so much anymore . Thank goodness for the internet and thank goodness for Bill Blass . Rest in peace and thank you so much for the special gift and for sharing your talents with the world !!!
 Bill Blass Nude is a wonderful fragrance I used for many years before trying others , usually gifts . When someone mentioned they 'd always liked Nude on me , I tried to find it in stores where I had previously purchased it . No luck . Then someone mentioned amazon.com , and there it was ! I ordered 2 , one for me and one for my daughter-in-law . We both love the cologne , and our husbands do , too . A couple of spritzes last a long time . I do n't know if I 'll ever be able to find it again , but I 'm enjoying it while it lasts .
 I 've purchased this perfume for many years only to have it taken out of stores . The Amazon way was the only way for me to get my favorite perfume . Nude by Bill Blass leaves you smelling soft and clean . I 've had people stop me in the stores and ask me what perfume I was wearing . At first I thought I was wearing to much -- a definite no no !! I hope Amazon has enough of a supply to last me all my days .
 This perfume is excellent for women of any age . This perfume conveys an attitude . It says , I am confident , sexy , sultry , and most of all a lady . It smells a bit strong at first application , but as the day goes the smell becomes intriguing and subtle . One or two spritzes last the whole day !
 I have worn Nude by Bill Blass for years and was pleasantly surprised to see that I could still purchase it on Amazaon.com . I have seasonal allergies and it is the only perfume I can wear all year round that does n't give me a sinus headache . I also found out that it is as an aphrodisiac for men . They love it !
 I have been looking for this perfume for a very long time and have finally found it on Amazon !! So excited !! When ever I wore this perfume I would get compliments daily on the sensual scent . Thank you amazon for carrying Nude by Bill Blast and thank you Bill Blast for this fabulous perfume !!
 perfume smelled as it should -LRB- was a little concerned because of the heat , but it was only outside in box for about an hour -RRB- pump did n't initially work , but I kept messin with it , and it ended up being fine . i love this cologne ... it smells so clean and now my nieces and nephews associate the smell with their aunty carol
 It 's the only perfume my wife wants to wear . It 's up to me too see that she does n't run out . When shopping for any item on Amazon and you 're told they are out of stock , try a different supplier -LRB- Amazon usually has more than one -RRB- . This year it worked out in my favor . First place was out of stock . Tried second place and not only did they have it in stock , it was less expensive than my first choice . With Amazon , there 's more than one store in town . Take advantage of it .
 Nude By Bill Blass For Women . Cologne Spray 3.4 OuncesThe first time I used this was years ago . I got it on HSN but after I used it up I could no longer get it . This has to be at least 10 years or more . I am so happy to have this back in my life . This smells so good . As long as amazon carries this I will always have it .
 My favorite perfume since the 9th grade . Wore it daily for years . Only recently have been mixing it up but in my opinion nothing can compete with Nude by Bill Blass .
 My wife will not wear any other cologne except `` Nude '' . I typically do not like the excessiveness of most perfumes but this one very soft and easy on the senses .
 A Bavarian friend wanted me to purchase this item because they could n't get it there . I found that it is no longer being made , so I purchased 2 bottles for them . However , when I tried to send them through the mail , I found that the post office does n't allow perfume to be sent . The only saving grace was that a local person is traveling there and took it with him . At this point , I presume it made it . I wo n't hear from the recipient for a couple of weeks . Hopefully , it was n't a purchase in vain .
 If you like a smell like patchouli , you will like this very much . It does n't smell like that , but it is one of those scents that is unique . Very clean . Not flowery . Not musky .
 The name of this scent says it all . Nude . Invocations of confidence , sensuality , and intimacy . It is very filmy , gauzy , powdery notes . Sprinkle a few drops in your lingere drawer for racy feelings even while still clothed . Spritz some on your sheets for a soothing night scent .
 The perfume arrived even earlier than it was promised , carefully packaged . Will definitely buy again .
 As a first-time shopper at amazon.com , I was rather wary of how the experience would turn out . I 'm very happy to report that the items I ordered arrived precisely on time , packaged securely , were brand new -LRB- in-the-box -RRB- and exactly as I had hoped to receive them . Adding to my pleasure was the wonderfully low price plus the free shipping ! I could not be more pleased with the experience and will definitely purchase from amazon.com again . Thank you !
 Nude by Bill Blass has been my signaturefragrance since 1996 . I 've been wearing it for so long that I do n't even smell it anymore when I put it on . A little behind the ears and on the pulse point on my neck and I 'm good to go . Never , ever have I ever worn a scent that garnered more compliments than Nude has for me . People love it on me ! It 's just a lovely , sexy fragrance . However , I would recommend that , before buying it online and if you 've never worn it before , one should go to a department store and try it on first . Get the opinion of your husband or boyfriend or good friends because fragrances tend to smell differently on different people . My sister plopped down $ 40 for a bottle of Nude years ago after smelling it on me . Her husband told her it smelled awful , LOL -LRB- now , mind you , he always complimented me when I had it on -RRB- . She ended up giving it to me and going back to what she had used before .
 This is the only perfume I wear . Years ago , I went to a Dillards and tried 30 different perfumes on various locations on my body . The poor people who rode up the elevator with me afterward all died of asphyxiation . Went home and hours later , picked this one because it went best with my body chemistry , was not overpowering , light and just the right combination of flowers and musk . Got several second opinions from friends and family , as well.That is the only way to pick a perfume . Perfumes do NOT smell the same on everyone . Halston on my best friend smells heavenly , while on me ... you would think something had died.Frequently , someone asks me , `` What IS that perfume ? I love it . '' I love the expression on their face when I answer , `` Nude . '' Reactions range from a smile and a comment like , `` Really ! '' to a full body blush . I will never forget the waiter who came up to me in a restaurant and said , `` That 's Nude , is n't it ? '' The person with me had no idea what the waiter was talking about , and sincerely wondered about my reputation.Nude is not sold in stores much any more . It went from being sold at Dillards and Macy 's to Drug Emporium , then vanished . I have to order it from Amazon and other online vendors . I hope that Blass keeps making it , or I will have to start over with the above process of perfume selection . More people will die .
 I love Nude . I have been wearing it for over 10 years and it is the only fragrance I wear . I try other fragrances , but always come back to this one . I get so many compliments on it . And it does not have that overwhelming scent . It is very light and refreshing . The price is also very good through Amazon.com . I highly recommend it .
 As a man , this perfume gets my attention fast -- very feminine , not too floral or fruity , and clean . I 've been buying this for my wife ever since I discovered it . Nothing else can compete .
 For a cologne spray it stays with you all day and people have asked me what I was wearing . Even my husband likes It really does stay with you and the price is very reasonable . I will order it again.I wish I could give it more stars .
 I Loved that this item can no longer be found in stores but was easy to purchase off Amazon.com . I ordered two and one came without the cap on it ... oh well .
 I have thoroughly enjoyed Nude by Bill Blass . The fragrance brings back some fond memories . I would definitely recommend it to others .
 Great price for this product ; could n't find anyone else coming close . Fast shipping too ! Will buy from again !!!
 I have purchased this product years ago when it was available in stores . It crossed my mind and I looked online to see if anyone still sold it . I was so happy to find it on Amazon.com and at such a decent price , I bought it right away.I get compliments on how nice I smell when I go out using Bill Blass 's Nude . Hopefully , it 's still available on here when I need more .
 My favorite perfume since the 9th grade . Wore it daily for years . Only recently have been mixing it up but in my opinion nothing can compete with Nude by Bill Blass .
 Purple Smoke is just what it sounds like , a like smokey purple . It 's kinda blue based like Special Effect 's Wildflower , but starts our pastel , whereas wildflower fades to it.For a deeper , brighter purple try Special Effects Deep Purple , as it 's special effects brightest most true purple color .
 This Produt will stain anything is touches !!!! Make sure to wear heavy duty gloves and cover anything it may splatter on . I would suggest rinsing hair with cool water after dying hair . This for me does n't last a long time but after it fades it becomes a really awesome soft lavender . Has no smell to it .
 At times a man `` MUST '' be a man and take the `` Lead '' and move first , never forgetting his `` special one '' , especially if it is for his long wedded wife , for are n't they the forgotten ones ? Those that do NOT consider themselves the `` woman '' in his life!But , the right man can never allow that to happen or develop . So , while you are reading this , I shall present myself as a 61 year old coeur d'lion , or l'amour to my never forgotten spouse , and say , start right her and put this only where you know is the right spot -LRB- s -RRB- and you know that your wife will really remember you for this ... really . and do not forget a light Rose ' , like `` Lancers '' or nice Portuguese `` Mateaus ' as I prefer red , and the purpose is not to get your prized wife , which you longed for so long to get ` tipped ' or out of her element , you want her , completely sober and always thinking and wanting to respond by putting on that which you love her the most in , and it does n't need be `` Victoria 's Secret '' , but , there is no harm there , remember , my wife of 42 years is not the same as I am not.You do not wish her to be embarrassed , so do n't let the months go by w.o. an evening that started off with your `` Perry Ellis '' here and a bit there , now , you MUST plan the evening with only her pleasure in your gestures and her pleasure the only thought in your mind , and it will always start this way , Wo n't it ?
 This is hard to find , especially in stock ! I was really happy to find it through Amazon.Most people have never heard of this cologne but boy are they missing out ! This stuff smells great !! My father really likes it and it 's unique !
 Love it love it . Yes its not like your average hair curler ... I did burn my fingers one time and then I just figured it out !! Salon styled hair !!!
 I love this perfume , it 's my favorite , it 's smell is wonderful , unique !!!! And price is very low for such level perfume .
 I 'm a huge fan of witch hazel , and I 've been dying to try this . I went out and bought a bottle for $ 5 today , and used it immediately . It cleaned my skin very well ! I also love that smell , it 's my favorite scent . . So worth it . It left my skin soft and glowing . I 'll probably use this 2-3 times daily , -LRB- I have very oily skin due to PCOS -RRB- so me enjoying this so much just off of one use is really , really awesome.Great stuff ! Also , the low amount of alcohol is excellent for sensitive skin and the acne prone . Woooh !
 I 've tried it all - Proactiv , creams prescribed from the doctor , drugstore brand washes ... nothing has worked since I started getting acne in middle school ! I use this toner after washing with Clean and Clear 's Deep Action Exfoliating scrub and my acne has significantly been reduced ! I do n't know why this does n't have more reviews , it 's a heaven sent product ! The only negative is the smell , but that goes away after a minute : -RRB-
 I recently decided to add an astringent to my skin care regimen just because I could.It was a great idea.I use Dickinson 's Witch Hazel -LRB- Pore Perfecting Toner -RRB- every time after I wash my face . It leaves my skin feeling softer , more refreshed , and most importantly to me , cleaner than it did when I did n't use an astringent . I 've even noticed that it helped with my acne.I also appreciate that this is a 100 % all natural product . It contains no dyes or mucky chemicals that could possibly affect your skin.I believe the product says it is non-drying , or even moisturizing , but make no mistake about it
 This witch hazel toner is great for a lot of reasons : * It 's very affordable , costing under $ 5 if purchased from a drug or grocery store ; even Amazo n't price is n't too bad compared to other skin-care products . * It controls oil very well . My skin is very oily but when I use this toner regularly , applying it in the morning and at night after washing my face , the sheen and greasiness stays away for hours , almost the entire day . * It improves skin texture moderately . I noticed immense improvements when I first started using this product ; some of the redness on my face and deeper acne marks faded and reduced . Now that I 've continued to use it I do n't notice as much improvement but it does prevent my skin from getting worse . * This works really well as a primer for foundation and powder , working as well as if not better than drugstore primers I 've used in the past . When i apply it in the morning I wait a few seconds for it to dry and then apply my foundation . It goes on smoothly and my pores appear minimized , almost non-existent . For people who like to use primer , I would recommend trying this as a replacement
 I 'm new to using witch hazel , but I bought this product recently and I 'm quite pleased with it . It is cool and refreshing -LRB- I 'm thinking about storing it in the refrigerator for the heat wave we 've been having lately -RRB- , and it did n't dry my skin out . Also , it does a great job of removing makeup that some cleansers leave behind . My only caveat is that to me , the smell is unpleasant . Thankfully , however , it is not so strong that I still smell it on my skin after I 'm done using the product . All in all , a good toner !
 I got several bottles from Walgreen ... for free :-RRB- After less than a week of using this product , I can testify that it WORKS . I do n't usually go out without at least applying powder on my face , but just in two days , I was confident enough to go out on a short trip without my powder . No noticeable difference . Now that I 've found it , I ca n't live without it ... lol
 I have only been using this toner for 4 days and it has done WONDERS for my skin !! I love this toner ! I have combination skin and my T-zone started to get a slight pink tone & more and more oily as time went by and nothing I tried would help , if anything , it 'd make me break out . After the FIRST time that I applied it to my skin , I noticed a difference right away . I use it twice per day and I just love how my skin looks WITHOUT any makeup on and it feels sooo soft . If only I had known about this a long time ago ! I 'm hooked and will continue to buy this !! Oh , as for the smell ... . it kinda reminds me of tequila lol but it fades so quickly before you even notice it so it ai n't bad . I 'll tolerate that smell any day as long as it keeps doing what its doing !
 VERY good product ... great addition to your cleansing regimen.If you do n't care about smell and just want something that works , look no further.It WILL keep your skin clean , and believe me I know because I have very stubborn skin .
 I love this stuff . I have been using it for a few months and my pores appear smaller , my face feels tighter and cleaner . I use it twice a day and have n't noticed any drying , but then again I also use moisturizer with it . I do n't notice a smell any different than other face washes .
 I tried this stuff for the first time just a few min ago . I cant tell you yet what the long term affects are but i can tell you that just from one use of this that i am hooked for life . I have HUGE poors and this stuff made them appear smaller after ONE USE !!! my skin feels amazingggg . its not oily or dy its baby soft !! im in love < 3
 now i understand the way skin works and i have underlying problems with acne and this has really been helping to draw out blackheads and pimples , now that being said i have had a few more smaller pimples then usual but they clear up quickly and i follow up with ddf acne cream which is wonderful product also . my face feels actually more moisturized then before when i did not use a toner .
 I love how soft my skin feels after using this product but I think it has alcohol in it . This makes it pretty harsh and drying on my skin but moisturizing real well seems to do the job for me !
 What 's the second ingredient in Dr. Perricone 's Super Detox Elixir ? What 's the second ingredient in Murad Clarifying Toner ? What 's the second ingredient in Olek Henriksen Grease Relief Face Tonic ? I could go on and on ... but I 'll just let you know . It 's witch hazel , which you can find in your local pharmacy for a few bucks , is a great astringent . And its one in its purest form.What is witch hazel ? It is the leaves and bark of the North American shrub known as Hamamelis Virginiana -LRB- sometimes you might see this on a label as an ingredient in your favorite toner or astringent instead of the words `` witch hazel '' -RRB- . Witch hazel naturally grows in Nova Scotia in Canada , and Florida in the United States.Witch hazel can be used for so many things but using it as your daily astringent can not only give you great skin but also a lot of bang for your buck ! In addition , witch hazel is an herbal and natural product and thus it is great for sensitive skin . You can apply it after shaving , waxing and any kind of skin care regimen.There is a reason you can find witch hazel in so many skin care products . It has so many benefits
 Ok , I bought this toner earlier this month -LRB- Sept 2012 -RRB- in the store and the packaging has changed -LRB- its definitely cuter - haha -RRB- . But this toner is amazing ! I was using Biore blemish fighting astrigent and although it kept my skin clear-ER - it did n't ultimately keep it CLEAR . I still would get pimples . And @ night after removing my makeup or in the morning after washing i would go through 3-4 cotton balls full of dirt , makeup , etc. and the cotton still would n't necessarily be clear -LRB- a pertinent reason for the pimples I would still get -RRB- . I feel that a toner/astringent should work with 1-2 cotton pads or balls -LRB- and be fairly clean -RRB- . I definitely needed something more effective for my skin . So , I came across Dickinson 's Pore Pefecting Witch Hazel Toner - and it 's Awesomely Amazing ! I love its inexpensiveness and accessibility . The smell is n't my favorite-but I do n't mind it and it fades quickly . I didnt expect it to work this WELL -LRB- REMOVES existing pimples , PREVENTS new ones , softens my skin , and evens out my skin tone quite a bit -RRB- . I use ONE cotton pad and my skin is competely toned , even , clean and the cotton pad is clear.I use this product 2x daily -LRB- morn & night ;-RRB- after washing with Neutrogena Oil Free Acne wash -LRB- Orange -RRB- - -LRB- check out my review -RRB- . My skin is awesome and pimple free!About me : Female , early 20s , naturally tanned skin tone , oily t-zone , acne-pron skin .
 I 've been using for some years now ... I happen to have not found this on my own , my brother bought it for me , thank goodness for the find . This stuff does not irritate my skin nor makes my mild acne more red , sting or increase the size out of pimples I might run into . It 's very refreshing and removes the the remaining bits of dirt leftover from cleaning . The little breakouts I run into clear up faster than usual and my skin is quite smooth with it sometimes I opt out of moisturizing . The smell is n't horrible , almost faint to me . I highly recommend this to those who need a new toner and do n't want to go through the having your skin be on fire using the other brands .
 i read rave reviews for this product and was hopeful my 27 year old skin thats been damaged by adult acne would be helped . but i still have scars and large pores . the pimples have lessened some what ... UPDATE
 I have suffered from acne since my teen years . Now in my early 30 's , I noticed milia -LRB- small keratin-filled bumps -RRB- on my cheeks and under my eyes . I 've tried numerous treatments in vain for the past year or so , but they would always come back . I actually searched `` milia '' on Amazon , and this product came up , so I thought I 'd give it a try . That was several weeks ago , and my skin is now smoother and clearer than it 's been in recent memory . I use the toner every morning after showering , and have no complaints , aside from a small complaint about the smell . But , I 'd rather use a product that smells like what it is , than something perfumed with artificial chemicals.Update
 I dont often use anything on my face except lotion , but seen somewhere that this would help dark circles go away from under my eyes . I havent noticed a difference in that aspect , but it does make my skin sort of glow and it feels softer and smoother . I really havent seen a change in my pores , I always thought they were big but I dont use it twice a day as directed on the bottle so maybe that 's why I havent seen a huge change . I would recommend this for soft glowing skin , but I really cant promise you will see a change in dark circles or smaller pores . It is a very pleasant product and gives you a fresh face without giving you dry patches , it improved a rash I had on the back of my neck thats been bothering me over the years so it is definitely something you may want to add to your daily routine .
 This is a very gentle product that leaves your face feeling cool , soothed , and refreshed after use.I love how my face does n't burn when I use this product , versus other astringents and toners . It also picks up everything that cleansers leave behind!The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because it 's quite smelly .
 i bought this a few days ago . i have scabs on my face from where i popped some zits and it does n't sting at all . it does n't feel dry right away either . so i can put my moisturizer on without feeling my skin being pulled . the smell is very subtle so even if u do n't like it it is n't strong and it goes away . i work as a mechanic and i needed something to add to my routine to get all the dirt that is left behind after my cleanser . so far i have n't gotten any new acne : -RRB-
 I 've been using this for four days now , and I can see the difference in my skin . The pores near my nose -LRB- which were huge -RRB- are getting smaller , and I look better with or without makeup than I used to . It really does smell awful , but you can only smell it for maybe two minutes when you put it on , so it 's definitely worth it . It did n't dry my skin out at all , using it twice a day , and it does n't irritate existing acne . My skin looks clearer and this is definitely a must-have from now on .
 This product works well , after receiving my package I instantly opened the bottle and put some of the toner on my face . After an hour or so I could already tell that it was working . -LRB- My face was sun burned and the toner actually calmed down the redness quite a bit , very nice !! -RRB- It works well with toning and correcting skin colour in the long run , too , I ca n't tell if it 's helped with my pores though . It 's gentle enough to put on your face multiple times a day , but that 's unnecessary , really . Works wonders!It 's a big bottle so it 'll most likely last you a long time as long as you do n't over do it . People have mentioned that you can buy it at certain drug stores for cheaper , but I ca n't find it anywhere near me , so I 'm glad Amazon has it stocked and the price is n't TOO ridiculous.I 'd recommend that people try this toner , be warned , though , it smells absolutely awful because they do n't put artificial fragrance in it . However , after time you get semi-used to the smell . Also , after applying it to your skin , the smell goes away very quickly .
 I have used Thayers witch hazel , and yes it works ok . However after light exfoliating every two days as normal ; then cleansing with the big D brand of witch hazel , the family of medium sized pores around my nose are almost extinct . I know now from previous experiences , that since I have oily skin in those areas , I need to astringe every day . Moreover it does n't dry my skin.Also I clean my makeup brushes with this stuff , and they dry really soft , instead of crunchy
 I have very oily skin , and this product does what I 've read all over the internet . It controls the oil on my face . It 's not all shiny like normal . If you are looking for something that controls that greasy shine on your forehead this is it . But , it does smell a little funny .
 It was awesome . . it cleaned out my pore , no more acne marks and evened out my tone . . I have oil skin and this product is awesome . . it does n't leave any res due . .
 Amazing !!! Great value for the price ! This toner is sooo good for both skin of the face and neck ! Its doing wonders on my combination acne prone skin , reducing the inflammation and occurrence of blemishes . It leaves my skin feeling incredibly moisturized and refreshed , leaving no residue behind ! I 'm sooo loving it !! The best toner ever !!
 I have used Dickinson 's witch hazel for a long time . I basically use it after I shave it relieves any irritation . I think I get a better shave and my skin fells great .
 It seems that it is a decent astringent . It gives a sense offreshness . I did not have any negative side effects .
 This product is truly amazing in its simplicity and overall effectiveness . After years of suffering with milia on my chin , they are now gone after using this for just one week ! I tried everything - from eliminating foods from my diet to different face washes , toners , moisturizers , etc. . I now realize that it was n't what I was doing that was causing my chin to constantly break out - it was what I was n't doing . I was not using an effective toner after cleansing . I also realize that the fewer ingredients in a product , the better . My skin just did n't need all the additives that most beauty products have in them . Some of the other benefits are softer , smoother skin . Even with the 14 % alcohol , my skin is n't dry at all . I use twice each day , morning and evening after cleansing.As far as the smell goes - really ? Who cares ? If it does the job and the end result is as good as I 've gotten , I could care less about the smell . Besides , the smell goes away as soon as it dries on the skin which is very quickly . I plan to use this toner for the rest of my life !!
 This toner is refreshing and effective , with no added chemicals that I need to be concerned about.Most drugstore brand toners and astringents contain artificial coloring and fragrance . Why would I need a brightly blue colored toner ? To give my skin a blue cast?Things can be absorbed transdermally . I do n't know that there is any proven harm in applying artificial color to your skin , but why take the chance?I also appreciate that there is only a minimal amount of alcohol added to this product . My skin is dry enough as it is.This is a great natural formula . I use it on a cotton ball , plus I pour some into the plastic packaging that contains facial cleansing cloths . Those cloths are typically too dry to suit me , and Dickinson 's offers the perfect solution .
 I 'm African American and for some reason my skin has started to take a turn for the worse . I 've tried tons of creams , soaps , etc. . . but the dark spots on my face from white/black heads were not fading . My pores also started to get noticable , my skin was extremelly oil yet dry in some areas . A year ago I had none of these problems , but now that I 've started to wear makeup to hide my dark spots etc , it just made my pores stand out even more and by the end of the day my face was super shiny -- Gross!After reading some great things about witch hazel from another site . I decided to give it a try . I absolutely love it ! Yes , it 's a tad drying -LRB- just a little bit -RRB- , but it makes me skin oh soooo soft and smooth that my makeup just glides on . I definitely recommend it , and also maybe invest in a good facial serum to help with the slight drying . It does smell really gross , for me I instantly choke up from the smell , but it fades very quickly and should n't stop someone from trying it out.Oh and on a side note for anyone with dark spots on thier face -LRB- I 've been taking vitamin E , internally for a week , and they 've cleared up considerably -RRB- . Just goes to show that I should have been taking my moms advice a long time ago .
 I use it for my face , and it kind of evens out the tone . My face feels soooo soft and refreshed after applying this product . I love it and will be a lifelong user of this product .
 I 'm a thirty-something guy who has wasted a LOT of money over the years on high-priced aftershaves , skin balms , and aftershaves.I read about witch hazel as an astringent online and I decided to give this a try.My results ? Awesome.My skin feels smoother and firmer , I have no more razor burn , and I have been getting compliments about my complexion -LRB- all of a sudden -RRB- . The bonus ? It 's dirt-cheap . If you 're a guy who wants great-looking skin , DO NOT waste your money on all the fancy department store skin `` science '' products . Use a face bar -LRB- Basis or Cetaphil -RRB- , this witch hazel product , and a basic moisturizer and you 'll have great skin . Anything else is like flushing your money down the toilet !
 My 4 year old had flat warts on her chin . Dermatologists suggested strong systemic medications as well as retin-a . It occurred to me that witch hazel sloughs of dead skin cells just like retin-a does , so I thought I would give this a try instead . Her warts are gone ! Plus , I use it to clear up my own blemishes . Dickinson 's works better than any witch hazel I have ever tried . Well worth the price ...
 I have been struggling with acne & white heads for a couple months -LRB- due to pregnancy -RRB- & this toner is the only product that cleared my face ! I noticed a difference after the first night I used it ! I Will recommend this product to all my friends & family !! -LRB- I purchased this at Walgreens on sale for 2.99 -RRB-
 I use this witch hazel instead of the disposable moist pads . Saves on packaging and money , and I love the way it makes me feel . I put a thin washcloth into a plastic bag , moisten a bit with the Dickinson 's and add a little water . All day this can be used to wash my hands and face . If the day is hot , it feels sooo good on the face and neck . It puts me in a happy mood , uplifting . If the day is really muggy , I go through two washcloths . Then I take them home and toss them in the washer . I use unscented laundry soap and softener , so no scents are clashing.Some people say they do not like the scent of witch hazel but to me it is so fresh and refreshing . After you use it , the smell goes away . Makes my skin feel great . I also use it at home on a cotton pad , as a toner or quick face wash.I would n't want to be without this witch hazel !
 My skin feels so much better after using one week ! It is cheaper than any toner I 've tried and it actually `` de-puffs '' the puffy eyes . I 'm not a fan of the smell , but it fades fast . I 'm not sure I want to try the scented Witch Hazel as I 'm afraid it may not work as well . My forehead has n't been this smooth in ... ever !
 i brought this @ my local drug store for an incredible price . i used it twice / day . my skin felt smooth and soft immediately . it controls oil without overdrying my skin . my skintone was brighter than before . i used several brand of toner got from the asian and usa department store and online shop . this was number one most effective and valuable !!!!!
 This is a great value . The bottle was even bigger than I expected ; it will last me for a while . The product arrived promptly as well . I am satisfied with this order .
 Fairly good product.Did not notice any difference in skin other then more dry skin than usual and I have been using it for about a month . It smells like hazel nuts and is fairly cheap . I honestly did not like the smell much . It tightened up or dried up my skin a bit as I mentioned . I might buy again ... not sure . Seems to be fairly good without much chemicals in there .
 This toner makes my skin feel so smooth and healthy . It does everything it 's supposed to do . The smell took a long time for me to get used to because it is very strong , but I highly recommend this toner !!
 Like this product because it cleans the pores and makes them slightly smaller on my nose . This is the second bottle I have purchased .
 This is syrupy which is good as compared to local varieties , a miracle product that addresses everything from insect bites to rashes . An old time remedy yes but always effective . I have pets which bring into the house the proverbial fleas . When they take a chomp on my leg having defeated the flea collars , a splash of origina Witch Hazel immediately mitigates this . Good for many skin irritations.Jay Adler Music Critic
 This witch hazel toner is 1/3 the price I usually pay for other facial toners . I When I saw this I was literally astounded . They 're so cheap and affordable -LRB- $ 2.99 for a 16 fl oz bottle at my local Walgreen -RRB- , not to mention it works fine . This soothes my acne prone irritated skin after I remove my make-up at night . It does n't dry out my skin despite the fact it contains 14 % of natural grain alcohol . Witch hazel is also great for acne . Besides , you should really apply less of chemical ingredients if your face is breaking out and start going natural . There 's no added artifial fragrance either but I found the smell to be very fouling , but I ca n't really complain . This should last me a long time and I 'll keep on buying this product unless there are n't going to be any change in ingredients and price .
 What 's not to love about this toner?I originally bought this toner just to add to my cart to get $ 25 worth of stuff to qualify for free super saver shipping , and I am very glad I bought it.I love this toner because of the gentle smell , gentle formulation -LRB- wo n't even sting on fresh acne wounds -RRB- . I 've been using it for a while now , day and night after cleansing my face and I noticed that the oiliness of my skin definitely decreased -LRB- I have oily sensitive skin -RRB- . I also noticed that my skin tone is more even now . I love this toner and I would recommend it to anyone . Definitely a toner that I will be buying for life .
 This is a big part of my post DE shave regiment . Works great , helps keep the ingrown hairs at bay , and this size is excellent value for money .
 This is the kind of product I love to use . Simple , earth-friendly , made by a small New England company . It 's also inexpensive and works great on my skin - not too harsh . Definitely recommend .
 My face is stupid soft right now . Starting to look a lot better too . But make sure you do n't get it in your eyes ! :D get it .
 I have combination skin . I have used so many different skin products over the years . Some days my skin is so dry it 's falling off , but I tend to have breakouts around my jawline . This is the 2nd bottle of this product that I 've used in the last 6 months . It keeps my skin looking great , and my breakouts are fewer and further between . It 's light , it does n't have a strong smell , and it DOES N'T overdry my skin like other toners I 've used in the past . I will keep using this for years to come .
 Have n't seen a motionless difference in my pores appearance . I got this stuff hoping it would aid in cleaning them out . It has n't but it does smell nice and wipe off any remaining residue in my face , a good prep before my facial cream .
 I would n't say it 's non-drying , but it 's nothing like using rubbing alcohol to clean your face ... the water here is horrible , so I use this exclusively to clean my ugly mug .
 I have been using Dickinson 's Original Witch Hazel for many year with great results . Its the perfect cleanser . It not only cleanses it stops pimples and and other skin problems without drying out my skin .
 I ca n't say much that has n't been said . To speak to the scent/odor , I 'm not particularly a fan , but it 's not bad enough to keep me from using it . Has really helped my complexion and evened out the skin tone .
 Good , natural , all-purpose astringent . I like using natural products . I use this on my face and on my kid 's faces . It cleans and refreshes the skin . It 's safe and gentle .
 I 'm a guy and use this stuff after shaving , I think it helps . 2 weeks into it and my skin looks smoother already . Will probably keep buying .
 Came packed in plastic so that if it did spell or break nothing else in the box would have been damaged . Service was great . The price was great . Easy to use .
 I buy this product for my boss and she loves it!She says that it works for her . She has me buy it for her again and again .
 This product is cheaper at Walmart -LRB- about $ 3 cheaper -RRB- . I say that if you can , get it from there or your local drugstore before you pay $ 7 + here at Amazon . I 've regularly used T.N Dickinson 's witch hazel in the blue bottle and I really enjoy that product . I wanted something specifically for pores so I decided to try this product . This product -LRB- AND THE ONE IN THE BLUE BOTTLE -RRB- makes my skin smooth . They both make my skin feel clean and they both make my skin glow . Here 's the difference . When this product says pore perfecting - they are not playing ! I dab this on my skin and I feel like I have a small dose of botox in my face . I believe that that 's my pores shrinking/tightening/closing . The first time that I used it - my facial skin became so tight that I told my husband to stop saying funny things because my face might hurt when I laugh or smile . Now some might say that does not sound like a good thing . I say when you considered this product , you thought about your pores and you wanted them to shrink or whatever your pore issues are , so that kind of tightening should be welcomed and should be a sign of the product working the way it says that it does . This is a fantastic product . My facial skin is as smooth as a baby 's butt and is very firm and moist . I use it every day and my facial skin is constantly improving . I did n't experience any bad smell like some here have mentioned . It smells like , like - witch hazel ... . The smell does n't linger and I did n't even smell it until I put the cotton ball to my nostrils . I like that this product has witch hazel , 14 % alcohol and witch hazel extract . The extract makes a world of difference in my opinion . This is an excellent facial product . * I am LC from NC *
 ALLURE by CHANEL in one word is really `` alluring '' . The scent is feminine and sexy , not the cute floral kind . The smell is hard to describe , it is the type of perfume you can use as a signature scent because it is noticeable ... sweet , mildly spicy and lingers on .
 I was given this as a gift from my boyfriend . The only deal was that I could only wear this when I was with him . :o-RRB- It has such an intoxicating scent . I 've had strangers come up to me to ask what cologne I was wearing because it smells so good . Allure tends to last a long time -LRB- at least on me -RRB- . Chanel # 5 tends to fade off soon . You will not be disappointed with this purcahse .
 Pros
 Mmmmm ! The aroma of Allure ... Allure has been one of my Wife 's favorite perfumes or Eau de Toilette for 20 years ! I purchase it for her every Mothers Day . She has other favorites , but this tops them all . The aroma is energizing and will have an impact on your love life!Allure has become my favorite for her as well . So , if you are looking for the perfect gift for your Spouse of GF , then look at the different presentations that Allure has to offer and buy it ! You ca n't go wrong !!! RECOMENDED !
 Up until recently , this product was sold under the Clairol brand name . The packaging looks identical , but the `` Clairol '' name has been removed . Over the past few years this has become more and more difficult to find on the shelves of big box retailers and drug store chains . That 's a shame because this is a terrific product . No scent , never clogs , never sticky and even contains sunscreen . I 've been impressed with the whole 3-in-1 product line and I 'm pleased it is available through Amazon . Women and men alike will enjoy this product .
 I was surprised at how much I liked this scent combo . As a guy , it was nice to have such a clean alternative to florals . The EO story/company is one of thoughtfulness and integrity . Check it out - www.eoproducts.com . I feel better knowing I am supporting a company commited to values that I share .
 I have long been a fan of EO products , and recently tried the EO Everyday Body Lotion Grapefruit & Mint . I was very impressed by it ; it has a fresh , natural scent and excellent skin softening.I appreciate that the EO company is committed to natural , organic ingredients and uses botanicals that make their products aesthetically pleasing and effective .
 I first found this product at a resort in Zion National park . I have to order it over the internet as it is not found around here in brick and mortar stores . I love this lotion , I do not have a allergic reaction to it . It moisturizes my skin and the smell is perfect ... not overwhelming , and yet it is stimulating .
 This has a very subtle natural scent that is very clean and energizing . The grapefruit is not too sweet or overpowering . It absorbs quickly and does not leave an oily finish . It is light weight enough to use every day after a shower . I have been amazed that something so light really works on my dry skin ! I like this better than aveda body lotion .
 This is a good mirror and the base is great . Alows you to use both hands without holding the mirror . However the light is so week that I never use it . They could have left the light out and reduced the price .
 item is as stated , first class , arived in great shape , well werth the moneyA 1 DEAL XXXXX
 Lightweight , easy to work with , but plastic stand not adjustable and angle is difficult to use.Appears that Zadro is discontinuing this mirror and they should not as it is the only mirror with this design .
 THE MIRROR IS PERFECT , JUST WHAT I WANTED . HOWEVER IF YOU ARE HOPING THE `` LIGHT '' IS GOING TO HELP YOU SEE FORGET IT !! THIS IS THE SECOND ONE I HAVE PURCHASED . VERY SATISFIED .
 I use this hand held to apply make-up and tweeze eyebrows . The 10x side is perfect for tweezing and applying mascara . Lights are not worth putting buying the batteries for !
 I have purchased this mirror from Brookstone at the mall . I have used this mirror for the last 10 years and it is excellent . The battery life on the mirror also lasts quite a long time . Do n't be afraid to purchase this mirror - best money I have ever spent .
 This is NOT a lighted mirror . There are two useless LED lights in the handle . Waste of batteries!The mirror itself is fine in regular and in reverse -LRB- magnified -RRB- .
 nice detail and lighting , works great for travel since its just 2 AA batteries , I would get another one if this was lost or broken
 This is a great product for those of us over 40 who need a little help seeing our imperfections . I use it daily and it is so easy to swivel from one side to the other . The light does not really help much however I use it occasionally . This is a great product for the money , I even bought one for my mother and she loves it too !
 I have been pricing mirrors on stands that provide lighting and magnification . It 's been difficult to find 10X mirrors and their costs have been too high for me to justify the purchase . After Christmas , I went to Amazon.com to see if I could find one at a more reasonable price than I have seen in retail . I discovered something even better - a hand mirror with 10X magnification at less than 20 % of the price of a standing one . I only require magnification that high for a few jobs , so a handheld was a terrific option . Amazon expanded my shopping choices from the comfort of my home .
 The 10X mirror is great . It is a definite plus that it runs on batteries . This makes it convenient for travel . The lights are okay , but I would have liked to see more of them . It is a really good design for a portable make up mirror . The adjustable stand is also a good thing .
 The optical quality is very good especially for this price range . The light provides only limited illumination to a small area and could be improved in future products . But , overall it is a very good value for the price .
 I have problem to see clear while shaving . I use 7X but it is not handy . I found this product on amazon.com first I hesitated to order of 10X but when I received the product , my hesitation gone . I am happy and satisfied with the product.I like it feature : Make-up mirror rotates so the light can be used on both magnificationsVanity stand to be used on on a counter topUse as a hand held mirrorOptical quality glassPatented design allows for mirror to swivel 360 degrees8 '' x 14 '' x 2 1/2 `` But I am not happy with it 's Led Light , it is useless . Instated of this company should give good adjustable stand so we can set it height as we need ...
 The mirror itself is one of the best I have tried . I do have a little trouble with the stand as I have to bend down to counter hieght to use it without holding it in my hand . I find the light to be a little glaring but ny eyesight with this mirror is perfect . I rate it for the price as a good value .
 Very good magnification , but reflections blur when mirror is angled . The stand is convenient for free hand zit popping . The light is as bright as a firefly however . I suppose if you needed to illuminate AND magnify something deep in a dark patch of woods at night during a new moon and only had this mirror with batteries installed , you may actually have praise for the light feature . Of course , if you happened to be lost in that deep dark patch of woods at night during a new moon and wanted the light of the mirror to actually help you illuminate anything other than your nose , you would be as disappointed with the light as at almost any other time . Save your batteries . Regardless and overall , it is a good mirror .
 The mirror swivels nice . The 10x magnification is amazing . The only thing that I would have a problem with is that the light is not very bright or powerful .
 Heard about this for cutting water weight and it worked ! No complaints ! I would give this product 5 stars except it took almost an extra week to ship than advertised . Great product though .
 This helps keep my skin soft and hydrated all day even my feet and elbows . It does tend to leave a greasy residue which my hands which is quicky absorbed after a minute or two . It even keeps my hands hydrated after multiple washings .
 I bought this product to use as a moisturizer and to help remove my makeup . It does a great job , although it is similar to a mixture I made of Vaseline , coconut oil . But this product wipes of easier . Because I have oily skin I do tend to use a cleanser after . So what I do is I use it to take my makeup off when I get home from work , and then before bed I will wash with a regular cleanser and apply a tiny bit of this around my eyes . I am young but I wan na start prevention early.This product is also great for working out . Similar to Sweet Sweat . I used it this morning during my workout . I apply it on my problem areas -LRB- stomach , arms , thighs -RRB- , and it really helps to warm up and burn those areas . I had a waist trimmer belt on and when I took it off , sweat literally cascaded down my stomach . Awesome !
 I 've used Albolene Cleanser for years and then suddenly could not find it in stores . Was so pleased to find it on Amazon . It is the best cleanser to remove eye makeup without drying the sensitive area around the eye . I have very dry skin so the cleanser is perfect for me keeping my skin soft while cleansing the makeup off every day .
 really good . good good fine the best love it really works really works fine good i recommend it to everyone . # 1 doctor recomended
 i have had an eczema for 20 or more years and after using albolene cleanser it has cleared the redness and i seldom use a steroid application now . also use it as an all over moisturizer and it has helped my extreme sensitive skin . wonderful stuff
 I have always worn a waist trimmer during workouts and have had great results with it . Recently I was at a health/supplement store when I saw the competitor 's product Sweet ___ . Anyhow , I bought it in a stick version and loved it but what I did n't love was the price . So when I ran out of it I kept the hollow plastic stick and wondered if I 'd be able to use this Albolene cream with it . It seems to be the exact same consistency and very similar so when I received the cream I filled the empty plastic balm container with it and placed it in the freezer to set since I was n't sure it would not leak or hold up but it worked out very well and I have been keeping it in my medicine cabinet since then and have not had any problems . I do n't have to slather it on as others have mentioned because it is greasy and as bit messy . But as I mentioned it works great and it does not seem to have any smell/odor . This is a great buy , I highly recommed it .
 Excellent ... I actually apply the product prior to putting on my neoprene shorts B4 workouts ... It is excellent ... It enduces the sweat during my workout as well as keeps my skin moisturized due to the neoprene material is comparatively to rubber ... which can dry out skin ... No issues now ... great !
 Why pay $ 50 dollars or higher for something that smells like a unisex salon . This is the smell my old barbershop smelled like . It has been around for a long time . The talc used after a shower and when your done with everything the aftershave is great . I 'll never stray from clubman !
 I used once Albolene -LRB- the blue letters jar -RRB- and does n't has any scent . it 's unscented . I liked it using it on my face , but not on my eyes , due to the petroleum or mineral oil on my eyes after trying to take off my mascara . I do n't know how women can take out mascara with this product without irritation , but what I am sure to say ... is that the make up easily goes off with a Chubs or a face little cloth , not with cotton balls.I bought this product again -LRB- the little jar -RRB- to try it ... because I have used Estee L. , Elizabeth A. , Clinique , and other make up removers and all give me irritation .
 A few of the reviews mentioned the `` overpowering '' smell of Abolene , but personally I could n't smell it . I have heard no comments from my husband and he has a sensitive nose . So whether that was a problem that was fixed later or my nose is gone , I did n't have that experience.Here 's the experience I did have . My skin is dry now where in places that have previously been oily . And my skin tends to be sensitive and break out from sime moisturizers or skin treatments . So I read an article in a woman 's magazine where their panel reviewed various skin treatments and this sounded like it could work for me.And it does . I use it to wash my face and my skin is soft and smooth . It plumps up some of the fine lines I have on my face . I have also used Abolene as a moisturizer for my body . Just one application to my elbows made a world of difference to my elbows . No bad reaction form my skin from using Abolene.It may seem pricey , but it really is n't when you compare it to other moisturizers . You only need a very small amount to get good results . I would recommend this to anyone who has a problem with dry skin .
 Albolene cream is the best makeup remover that I have ever used , especially for eye makeup . It is non greasy , yet still moisturizes my face . A tiny bit goes a long way and feels so good on my face . I used to be able to buy it in any drug store and they no longer carry it . Thank Goodness for Amazon since I could not used anything else .
 Much better than the more expensive cleansing creams . Takes makeup off quickly without drying the skin .
 This stuff has been great for the last twenty years . I could no longer get it locally , so ordered . The shipping was fine . The product is not the same consistency even though the ingredients read the same . It used to liquify upon contact with the skin . Now it feels heavier and does not exactly liquify . What is up with that ? I will still use it but I wish it was the way I have always known it to be .
 I have been using this since high school , when we used it as theatrical makeup remover . That 's over 40 years ! I have very dry skin , and I use it daily as a total body moisturizer . I have had friends with very dry skin , and after using Albolene Cream , their skin is much smoother . I do not have any problems with oily skin after using the cream , probably because my skin is so dry without it . I can not say too many great things about this cream . I just hope they never stop making it !
 Not only is this a great product for your skin , but also for children 's skin ! I use it to treat my son 's diaper rash , it does n't smell like the other stuff , it does n't hurt him at all , and best of all ... if I put this on him at night before he goes to bed ... his rash is completely gone by morning ! I love this ! It is DEFINITELY worth every penny !
 Reminds me of Don 's Barber shop in Philadelphia where I got my first haircut in 1961 . -LRB- Before hippies and men 's hair spray took over -RRB- . Has an Olde Timey `` Floyd 's Barber Shoppe '' scent . For people old enough to remember barber shops this can be a welcomed addition to your after shave rotation
 Opened my pores during workout which decreased the acne on my face , it hydrated my skin which help the tone color of my face . It was hard to find instruction but I found it on a random page on the net . I was my face before using it as a moisturizer and after a workout
 Also great as a sexy lube . Not so good for your day to day cleansing needs as it may leave your face oily , but for removing make up its the best .
 I discovered Albolene while in college as it was used to remove stage makeup and I have been using it since then -LRB- 30 years -RRB- . It does an excellent job removing waterproof mascara too , I put it right on my lashes . I cover my face withAlbolene Moisturizing Cleanser , 12ozfor a few minutes then wipe it off before cleansing my face - if it ai n't broke then do n't fix it . The jar lasts a long time too so it 's cost efficient as well . I wear contact lenses and Albolene does not smear my vision nor sting my eyes like other removers . I used Loreal , Almay , Maybelline removers , etc. -LRB- hated them -RRB- which you are n't suppose to use near your eyes - plus due to the eyelash extensions I wore for a couple of years , Albolene 's oils were a no-no as it break down the surgical/medical glue used to attach the extensions to my real lashes . I have been using Latisse for a couple of years which means no need for extensions - and no more `` breakups '' with Albolene !
 This stuff is truly timeless & ALWAYS in my daily/weekly rotation of aftershaves.A classic blend that reminds you of the old barbershop , with a masculine clean sweetness that lasts for a long time.Why would someone want to spend in excess of $ 50 for `` designer '' fragrances when there are these old faithful standbys that never change , are always there when you need them ? In this day of constant `` change '' its really nice to know that some things are exactly as they have always been ... CLUBMAN original is one of those constants that is always the same
 I have sensitive skin and have tried numerous and expensive cleaners and aftershave lotions . But none have ever been a invigorating and healthy for my skin . You can not go wrong with this aftershave -- pinaud has 200 years of experience in blending this formula . It cleanses , renews , and heals , with a wonderfully clean and natural scent.Use the Parker 11r Double Edge Safety Razor with Col. Conk 's Almond scented Shaving Soap and finish your shave off with Pinaud Clubman After Shave Lotion and you will join me in looking forward to your morning 's ritual . It 's the best way to start my day !
 I have rarely used colognes or after shaves for the last 20 years as I find them to be overwhelming ... to me , they are `` guy perfume '' even if used sparingly . Clubman after shave simply makes you smell good / clean without being overpowering .
 I have used Albolene Moisturizing Cream for almost 20 years as my make-up remover . I used to use Vaseline to take off my mascara but switched to Albolene when a girl in my dance troupe turned me on to it . Mascara and lipstick come right off and leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized . It 's main ingredient is mineral oil rather than petroleum jelly , therefore , it liquefies quickly and turns into an almost baby oil-like consistency.I do n't know if the company will like me saying this but Albolene is an amazing sensual lubricant , too . Because of its petroleum base , it has wonderful staying power and is so silky to the touch . Needless to say , I go through many jars of this excellent stuff and it 's not inexpensive -- but worth every single penny !
 I use this product to increase body temp and sweat more during my workouts -- elimintating excess water , fast . It 's a WHOLE lot cheaper than products like Sweet Sweat that claim to do the same thing . I learned this while training as an amateur kickboxer/boxer on an MMA team . This is a secret of all the pros for cutting weight for fights and competitions . You can slather it on just your upper body , or your entire body . I usually put it on my entire body , except for my face -LRB- ironically -RRB- , but you can also `` target '' areas like your abs , arms , etc. . You can also combine this with sauna suits and extra layers of clothes for an even more intense effect -- but be careful b/c if you are not used to this type of training or workout in the extreme heat , then you can OVERHEAT and incur serious illness/death . SO USE WITH CAUTION and make sure you are well hydrated . I have no idea how it works as a makeup remover , it seems rather greasy so I have never wanted it NEAR my face .
 This is a great bedtime moisturizer , especially if you need to take make-up off at the end of the day . It has really saved my skin , since I used to spend hours in the sun when I was a young swimmer . I feel as though Albolene has really maintained my youthful skin ... if only for a few more years , ha!I would n't recommend this for daytime use , however , as it will open your pores , and you 'll find your skin getting oily about 15 minutes after you 've wiped off the excess product . It opens up your pores , so it would be especially messy if you wore make-up over it . Plus , Albolene does n't have an SPF , which is important for everyone to wear during the day.Albolene is also a BARGAIN . I can go an entire year on maybe two big jars .
 I have used Albolene for the past 15 years as a makeup remover . It works great ! It easily takes off waterproof eye makeup without any rubbing . This prevents any irritation to the sensitive skin in the eye area . Be sure to wash your face after using this product or it could leave your skin feeling a little greasy .
 Great product ! I use it both as a facial cleanser and also as a workout product . I put it on my body in the areas I want to target , like my abs , then wrap myself up in plastic and do my work out . I eliminate a lot of liquid that way .
 This is the top recommended sexual lubricant on the market . I have tested just about every product that is marketed at a lubricant and none of them can begin to compare . The all cost much more . If someone were really smart , he/she would repackage this as a sexual lubricant and quadruple the price in small containers . There is also a scented version of this but I have n't tried it yet . I have used this for about 20 years and it has made all the difference in my sexual pleasure . Try this , you will have no regrets .
 This cream was recommended to me by a doctor to use as a sexual lubricant ! It works as promised ... not leave you feeling greasy ... and Amazon was the only place that I could track it down .
 I 've used Albolene to remove mascara for over 30 years -LRB- yikes -RRB- and even when I tried to replace it with dept store brands that matched the mascaras -LRB- Lancome , Estee Lauder , Clinque , you name it -RRB- none of the other brands ever came close to being as good as Albolene ... Never gets in your eyes or interferes w/contact lens wearingI have much fewer eye wrinkles , where the Albolene has been in contact , than any of my friends in their late 40 's . I 'm careful about sun , etc. , but I really believe Albolene has been a big part of my good-around-the-eyes skin.I do n't use it on my face because I am oily skinned and find I need regular cleansers.The price here on Amazon is exactly HALF of what they charge at CVS & RiteAid ... Highly recommend ... . works just as well w/waterproof mascaras ...
 Stage makeup and body paint are both part of my craft and easily wiped away with Albolene . It is equally effective removing everyday makeup . Over time I have even noticed that the skin around my eyes and mouth has remained soft and smooth because of the mineral oil ingredient . I often leave a dab on my lips before going to bed at night to keep them moisturized.Albolene is reasonably priced for the effectiveness and quantity which lasts a couple of months at least with daily use . There are no perfumes or ingredients that would irritate most sensitive skin -LRB- like mine -RRB- and the moisture properties are a great bonus . I highly recommend it !
 When having physical therapy on my arm several years ago , the therapist used Albolene as a lubricant . I liked it so much that I started using it as a makeup remover . Now , I use it as a moisturizer on my arms -LRB- especially elbows -RRB- , legs , and feet before I go to bed . I ca n't believe how soft the bottoms of my feet are now that I 've been using it regularly -- no need to use my Ped Egg . The only thing is , you 'll need to be sure to wear slippers , because it 's pretty messy if you like to walk barefoot .

 Been wearing this Cologne for years . Complements from the girls all the time . Clean , fresh , not a sweet fragrance
 I have been searching for a cologne for my husband that is different , in a good way . Some of the colognes are so overpowering and they all smell the same . This cologne is just perfect . He receives many compliments on how great he smells !! Luckily , I am not the jealous type .
 Okay people . I really do n't keep up with whether it is Eau De Toilet or cologne . All I know is how it smells.This makes me smell important and Western European.I 'm not European but I am important.Purchase it . I assure you it is one of the best smelling colognes out there .
 This is a great cologne at a super great price because it 's a tester with no cap but who cares . It was a FULL bottle and smells great !
 This is my favorite fragrance for my husband . When his last bottle ran out , I found this on Amazon at a good price and the shipping was really quick .
 i love my fragrance Bulgari , beautiful , wonderful , perfect , incrible , nice!i love my fragrance Bulgari , beautiful , wonderful , perfect , incrible , nice !
 I am very grateful for this product because it had already time looking , thank you very much , keep it up
 This was a gift for my son at Christmas and he just loves this scent . He usually gets this cologne every year .
 Essence and smell goes away to soon . Need to improve and work on the perfume to stay longer on the body .
 really good product and just what i expected , is get on time and is just beautiful and original botton line i love it
 Got it for Christmas for my Dad , its my favorite cologne and his as well.If you want an amazing smell that is n't overpowering but subtle and clean , this is the one !
 My favorite cologne ! I ca n't ever find this in stores in this size . I was able to purchase the 3.4 oz for what is being charged for 1.7 oz in the factory stores . Product was delivered WAY ahead of est. delivery date and exactly as described . Thank you Amazon !
 I test scents at Sax Fifth Avenue and purchase online . This is a nice , clean scent . Women love it . Worth it .
 Eu sou muito muito apaixonada por este perfume , apesar de masculino , uso muito e , sempre recebo elogios com ele . Amo !!
 Producto de Excelente Calidad , el cual cumpli&oacute; con el tiempo de entrega establecido . Debido a lo delicado del producto el empaque estuvo adecuado para su anejo y manipulaci&oacute;n .
 Got this Tsar cologne for my husband for Valentine 's Day ! Great buy on the eau de cologne - ca n't find it in any stores where we live so I have to get it online and Amazon provided lots of choices . Great smelling cologne - my husband loves it and has been using it for several years !
 Seeing as how amazon does n't yet have a separate listing for the new SENSITIVE SKIN version of this cleanser , I 'm posting it here . Though I think this product line is marketed more towards teens , this cleanser is excellent , superb , fantastic for my combination , adult-acne-prone skin ! Does n't dry out my face or make it too oily by day 's end . So gentle it wo n't strip off make-up ; to remove makeup , first smear a layer of this cleanser over dry , made-up face & wipe off with tissue . Then wash normally with more cleanser . Salicylic acid in cleansers is not very effective against acne , since it has to remain on skin for long periods to work . I leave this on in the shower for several minutes before rinsing , but for bad acne , you may need to use this plus a medicated leave-on product like Nature 's Cure Body Spray -LRB- yes , I use that on my face and never had problems -- but close eyes & hold breath before spraying ! -RRB- May need to follow this with moisturizer , though I do n't . It 's also good to use a sunscreen product for sensitive skin in the daytime - I like Neutrogena 's sensitive skin sunblock . I love this product , try it ... it may be the EUREKA ! cleanser you 've been searching for .
 I never thought I 'd be someone to like a cream cleanser , but this stuff works really well . It has a great smell to it , and after using it , my skin feels fresh and clean , but not dried out like most cleansers tend to leave it . As the previous review mentioned , it 's great for taking off makeup too . It does n't lather up like a soap , but it still seems to do the job ! I would definitely recommend this product .
 I bought this product initially several years ago and experienced something which really left an impression . It claims to have a tingling sensation and it has that and so much more . Actually , when using this , my face feels like it 's on a cold fire which tickles insanely and while it sounds negative , it actually feels great!Besides , a very effective tingle -LRB- and I always like any product which feels like it 's working -RRB- this does a nice job at clearing up acne and helping skin feel oil-free all day - though the product itself does feel a bit greasy . It 's not drying , either.I 'd recommend this product .
 In my first experience with St. Ives I thought , '' `` gosh , this is too abrasive . '' '' I continued and rinsed my face as recommended . My face felt very smooth . I tried it the next day and the abrasiveness did n't bother me . I 've had a problem with blackheads since I was a teen , and that was many years ago . I 've had to go to a dermatologist to have them removed -- not very pleasant . I 've been using St. Ives Apricot Scrub for a few days now and have noticed the change in my face . My skin seems to have a shine that I never had before . The blackheads are actually disappearing . I 'll continue to use this product . I was n't impressed with the smell , but I guess that would n't matter if you get good results . I would highly recommend this product to everyone .
 I LOVED this product !!! It cleaned my face and left it with the softest feeling I 've ever had ! My skin felt soft all day ! Not only that , but I used it on my hands , arms , and shoulders for that same wonderfully soft feeling ! I will DEFINITELY recommend this product to EVERYONE ! It 's the best I 've ever tried !
 The first thing I noticed about the apricot scrub was how great it smelled . It 's grainy so I had to be gentle when rubbing it on my skin . It left my skin smooth and polished . I have extra dry flaky skin and it worked wonders on me . I 've been using the scrub every day , with great results . I was using a tea tree scrub before , but I prefer the apricot scrub because of the clean fresh smell and because it is n't drying .
 I used St. Ives Swiss Formula Apricot Scrub every morning and every night before bedtime . I noticed a significant increase in the softness of my skin . It left my skin feeling smoother throughout the day . It helped tone out my combination skin , making the oilier parts less oily and the drier parts less dry . I 'd recommend it to anyone who needs help beginning an easy skin-care program , and who does n't have the time to use multiple products but wants to be able to wash their face and go .
 St Ives apricot scrub jar works on my oily skin . My skin feels great after using it . This jar lasts me for a long time too . I used it at night time .
 I 've used this product for years , a couple times a week or so.It does n't break me out or irritate like many products do , and it makes my skin feel extra-clean . I do n't scrub too hard with it , i just add some water and rub lightly with my hands -LRB- not a washcloth -RRB- , then rinse.Whether it actually DOES anything or not , i do n't know . But it makes me feel kind of pampered at a very reasonable price . And ca n't we all use a bit more pampering -LRB- without spending a lot of cash -RRB- ...
 A good exfoliator but , a little on the harsh side . Use lots of water with it . I bought a 12 oz . tub 3 years ago and still have n't used it all .
 Both my mother and I use this -LRB- well , I usually forget ! -RRB- , and we swear by this . It is grainy and therefore needs to be applied gently . I just wash my face with water and then work in the scrub gently and then wash off . After an application , my face feels cleaner , the skin feels tighter . I have had no breakouts while using this product . Hmmm . . I should probably get back to using this again.P.S . If you are hesitant , you can always try the sample size .
 This was my first time using this product , and I was impressed . After I used it my face felt cleaner and much healthier . It really gets your pores clean . The smell was relaxing and the exfoliates were n't harsh on my skin . I 've used similar products with no results . I 'd definitely recommend this to a friend . After a few days of using it my face was already clearing up !
 My skin is feeling smoother already . Got rid of those dry flakes . Wish I 'd used something like this sooner . Love the smell . I 'd recommend it .
 I enjoyed using the St. Ives Apricot scrub . My face felt clean and fresh after using it . I especially liked the scent . I use it in the shower and it works great ! No mess and it does n't dry my face like soap does . I would buy this product again .
 This is a St. Ives product that I 'll definitely purchase again ! The apricot scent is GREAT -LRB- certainly not one of those facial cleansing products that you ca n't stand the smell of ! -RRB- and it really leaves your face clean and fresh . This product seemed to cleanse and moisturize my skin better than other products I 've tried . I 've always been a fan of St. Ives shampoos and now I 'm certainly adding this product to my list . I 'll recommend it to my friends and family .
 The first thing I noticed about the St. Ives Apricot Scrub is its wonderful smell . Very '' `` almondy '' '' . Now if you have sensitive skin , this scrub 's not for your face , as it 's a little harsh , but I use it every night to clean really well . I found the scrub is best in the shower as an all over exfoliator . It really sloughs off those dead skin cells and feels great . Other body scrubs are pretty expensive , so with its great price this is a terrific alternative . Overall , I would recommend this to anyone who does n't have sensitive skin . It leaves your skin clean and fresh ... but its best work is done on the rest of your skin in the shower !
 I have used this product for years . It is very friendly to my dry hair ; in a dry climate . Does not make the hair stiff.LFB
 Extremely difficult to find this particular product anymore , so I am thrilled to find it here . It is the only hydroxy product that I have used that does not dry out my skin . I am 60 , have used St. Ives products for years , and most people think I am in my 40 's . Ca n't say enough good things about this particular product or St. Ives .
 I had very happily used the referenced product for a few years when I learned it was being discontinued . I bought several jars at that time . When I was down to my last jar , I began looking for it locally , but could not find it in my area . I then searched via the internet and located it through Amazon.com . I bought three jars and stored them away for future use . A few months later , I decided I should order three more to add to my `` cache '' . I was very happy to have found what I wanted through Amazon.com , was impressed with the ease of ordering , the promptness of delivery and overall service of Amazon.com . I will be using you again in the future !!!
 This product slowly fades away stretch marks , the longer you use it , and evens out skin . I use it as an all over body wash , and its great . Unlike other products that lighten your skin , this product just exfoliates which in turn speeds up the natural renewal process . Great product !
 Stretch & Seperate delivers everything as promised and more . It 's clump free and does n't disintegrate into undereye concealer causing `` raccoon eyes . '' When preparing for a really long day , I use one thin coat of Stretch & Seperate followed by one coat of clear masacara . It magnifies a natural looking effect . I am using Cover Girl Professional Natural Lash No Color mascara for the top coat.Max Factor Stretch & Separate Waterproof Mascara , Rich Black 305 1 ea
 You have no idea how hard it is to find beautiful , stylish hair combs , unless you get online . You all have the prettiest combs I 've ever seen . I love them !! Thanks so much !! Martha
 I have chronic dry eye/blepharitis , and had to stop using eye makeup . Sigh . No mascara , shadows , pencils , creams , nothing . I was so happy to find this eyeliner!The felt tip paints on easily , does n't irritate my eyes , and does n't make the blepharitis irritation worse -LRB- and I 've used it occasionally even when I 'm having a minor lid flare up -RRB- . It 's slightly pearlescent , which I 'm not crazy about -LRB- I like a very dark line -RRB- , but I just do a couple of coats for evening.With some care , it lasts all day -LRB- it is n't waterproof , so I have to be careful about rubbing my eye and no watching sad movies -RRB- . It comes off so easily ! Just a couple of splashes of water , followed by patting/gentle rub with some tissue .
 Being deployed in dessert conditions , it is needless to say that it is dry , infact that is an understatment . This product helps with the harsh weather and water conditions , it is absolutely perfect .
 I use the Wonder 8 oil on my skin after a shower and although I have not used it long enough to give an expert 's opinion , I like it so far . It was recommended to me by a friend who said it has stopped her itching from allergies . In time I hope to use it for some of the other recommended uses .
 I use this for hair , face , body - it 's good anywhere . Nice light oil that soaks into the skin easily , leaving a nice glow . Better than any creamy body lotion that sticks to my body hair . Handy little spray bottle too . I also find it useful in the bedroom for lubrication when/where needed . I 'm not crazy about the fragrance , however - it could use an upgrade . -- I squirt a little cologne in the bottle and shake it - that helps .
 this product is great . . problem is . . i lost the item in the shipping the 2nd time round that i bought it . . and its hard to get my money back
 Ginseng is very well known for its therapeutic properties.This ginseng oil i use for my hair ensures that my hair grows strong and healthy throughout till my golden years.It is an investment ... and I am glad to have found and known this product even if I have to get it all the way in USA -LRB- I 'm from Singapore -RRB- to get the best of the best for myself !
 This has been my signature scent for the past fifteen or more years . It 's light and fresh and in no way overwhelming . I always get compliments on how good I smell -LRB- not a bad thing -RRB- ! It 's a `` green '' scent , not cloying or too flowery or powdery - just very clean smelling . I hope Elizabeth Arden keeps on making it because I ca n't imagine wearing anything else !
 The product was exactly as displayed . I had owned this perfume before and the one I bought on Amazon is the same one . I completely satisfied .
 This item comes in a lovely glass bottle with frosted etching of a green tea leaf on it . It 's such a nice cool green look . So nice for Summer use . The scent is light and subtle . I believe I will use the scent for years to come . I even use it when I 'm at home because it makes me feel good . Very pleased with this purchase .
 I love this clear blue antibacterial soap - it smells wonderful . Great for kids in the aquarium bottle but also great for grown-ups -LRB- you can buy it in a large refill , also -RRB- . As to the previous reviewer 's comments about antibacterial soaps making us more resistant to antibiotics - how can that be true if there 's truly `` no difference '' between antibacterial soaps and `` plain old soap and water '' ?
 These Toolworx Professional Hair Shears are a good value . Bought them for my wife . She uses them for cutting wet or dry hair at work and says they work great and like the fact that they are ajustable .
 We always used this soap growing up . I continued to use it with my family until I could n't find it anymore . I was very disappointed when I found out they no longer made it .
 I have four kiddos , three who are currently in diapers and I wash my hands a whole lot . Most soaps dry my hands out , but this soap helps to keep them moisturized and it smells great without an overwhelming scent -LRB- I have respiratory allergies and ca n't handle most perfumes but this soap does n't bother my allergies at all -RRB- . Even my teenage nephew who hates to wash his hands will use this stuff . Unfortunately , none of our local stores are carrying this soap , so I am glad to find it here on Amazon !
 The only reason I do n't give this 5 stars is that I wish the large jug was still available , rather than the 12 7.5 ounce bottles . This is great hand soap and the only one we 've found that actually smooths my husband 's hands and they do n't get dry and rough from frequent handwashing .
 This is the best household hand soap I have ever used . It has a silky feel that is not too thick , not too thin and is n't sticky . The scent is pleasant , but very mild . We use this soap all year around , but it is especially fantastic in the winter . Other hand soaps we have used in the winter have left everyone in my family with dry/cracked hands . This Dial hand soap with moisturizer and aloe completely eliminates that problem . When we use this soap consistently in the winter no one in the family has a problem with dry/cracked hands . It 's fantastic soap . I ca n't think of any way that this product could be improved .
 This is a nice large pack of 12 handsoap bottles . I love the smell . The fact that its antibacterial as well as moisturizing just adds to the value of this soap.Very standard , and nothing really special about it besides the price , antibacterial , and moisturizer .
 This soap lathers a lot and gives a nice fragrance . The consistency is so that you use only a little for washing . The product dries my hands less than any other soap . Excellent choice .
 I 'm one of those people who washes their hands a hundred times a day . Not OCD but borderline I guess . I touch my face and eyes a lot so I always need to have my hands clean because I get sick easy . Most soaps will dry my hands to the point where the skin is cracking and bleeds . I like this soap a lot because it cleanses well and a little goes a long way . Keeps my hands in better shape than any other hand soap out there . Even better than those fufu high priced ones . Will never fall for the hype of those PHI-LIES-OPHY type soaps and gels again . What a waste of money those were ! Good to know I can always come back to good old trusty dial . I grew up using fresh aloe for cuts , scrapes , and burns , so I know of it 's moisturizing and healing properties . Am glad Dial makes this with aloe . Definitely brought me back as a customer . Not only does it save me money on soap but also on moisturizer . I only have to put lotion on at bedtime unlike before where I had to every time after I washed . I hope they keep selling it because I will definitely be back for more .
 This cleans my hands , and leaves them smelling great . Also , I think in my head this moisturizes better than Dial Gold . Had to order from Amazon because ca n't find in stores .
 We enjoyed using the Dial Mountain Fresh soap . It has a clean fresh scent and rinses off well -- even in hard water . It 's a soap that 's nice for the family -- pleasant for my daughter and myself and not too flowery or '' `` girly '' '' for my guys !
 I really like the Dial Mountain Fresh soap . While some may find the scent a bit strong , I really like it . I have used Dial before and the Mountain Fresh scent is by far my favorite . I also like the fact that Dial soap does n't dissolve in the shower as fast as some other brands of soap do . This is a soap that I will purchase again in the future .
 I found that the Dial Mountain Fresh Soap had a very clean scent and was very refreshing to use . It had a long lasting deodorant quality . Some soaps dry out your skin , but this one did not . The soap lathered quite well and finished with a clean rinse . I would recommend this product .
 This soap cleans really well , but it did dry out my skin a little . It lathers up really well and the bar lasts for a long time . The mountain-fresh smell was n't strong . This soap would be perfect for a family because it 's both an anti-bacterial and a deodorant soap all in one bar .
 This soap has a very clean scent that I really like the smell of . I have tried other Dial soaps , but this is my favorite .
 If you want to try one of the most incredibly smelling soaps , grab this one . It just smells wonderful ! We 've been using it for quite some time now and just love it . It does n't dry and much as other soaps do but cleans better than most . There 's no filmy residue and if you work out , it REALLY gets you clean and you stay that way for hours . We can bring this home and it will smell up the kitchen and that 's a good thing ! Great soap !
 This product is great like the rest of the Dial products . The only difference is the scent , which I found to be quite pleasant !
 I have always hated using moisturizing lotion because of the greasy feel and thus I always have exceptionally dry hands . I wanted to try this soap for its moisturizing properties during the cold winter months and so far it seems pretty good . The soap feels silky when it comes out of the bottle and does n't leave your skin feeling excessively tight and dry after washing . It leaves no residue nor does it leave your hands feeling greasy at all . It was also a great value at the price .
 Sometimes you find a product that becomes a staple . Agree , this is just a super hand wash with a great scent and excellent texture . It is never harsh on your delicate skin . Many times a repeat buyer for years . Highly recommended .
 Liquid hand soap is about three things
 This handwash is fantastic . Every time I go to the States , I restock on more because of course , it 's unavailable in Australia . It feels like you are really cleaning your hands as opposed to using fragrant soaps that do n't really remove that grimy feel or dirt . It foams well and when you towell your hands , they do n't feel tight or dry so I get the feeling like it 's not drying out my skin . Also , to top it off , the scent is devine . It 's not overpowering but subtle , and yet you can still smell it faintly for a while later.I hate using bar soaps for my hands and I love this wash . I wished it came in bulk to use as an all over body wash . I highly recommend this soap especially if you get dry hands . I find myself washing them a little more frequently throughout the day just to get that gorgeous smell back in my nose . It 's a great cleanser and it looks after your skin .
 I am a 67 year old -LRB- very -RRB- male that went hunting for this stuff , Jergens Cherry Almond Scent Hand Wash. I had been looking for it oft and on for years , thought it was NLA . But then I went to the trusty computer and the internet to find it , and naturally , I could buy it through amazon.I wash my hands often daily with it , brings back many good memories of my mother , long deceased ... Sometimes , just the aroma of something clings to the heart.Thanks for keeping the product and the scent alive !!
 First of all , I love amazon because they carry avariety of products . This handsoap is very mild andpleasantly scented . The bottle is very pretty foryour bathroom or kitchen . I would recommend this product .
 This is my FAVORITE hand soap . It 's creamy and moisturizing and has a wonderful cherry/almond scent ... and I ca n't find it in the store ANY place.I found it HERE !!! Happy happy -- joy joy joy !!
 I am very sensitive to smell but I found the cherry almond scent very pleasant and not overbearing . The hand soap is gentle for daily use and does its job . I am only disappointed that I can not find this product in stores , but I am glad it 's available online .
 I love this soap I ca n't find it any where except on line . I use it for shower soap and my skin feels great . i have very dry skin especally in the winter . So with winter so close I want to stock up . Thanks Jergens .
 I like the almond scent . I do n't know what else you can say , it is a good product . I buy this regularly .
 Because of skin problems this is the only soap I can use for everyday and bath use . I was having difficulty finding it here so was thrilled to be able to obtain it on-line . It came very quickly and very well packed so it would n't leak . I am very happy with the service on this product .
 I prefer soap dispensers to bar soaps for washing hands , but I do not care for the ones I find in grocery stores and drugstores . The Jergens version suits me perfectly . I did learn that shaking the container prior to each use keeps the product evenly distributed . Otherwise , first squirts are nice and thick , but the last ones are too thin and watery . It is worth the extra , small effort . Also , I try to keep the cost down by checking the sellers ' prices and shipping fees .
 I was looking for a hair spray that was less pricey than the Sebastian product that I have purchased in the past and decided to try this . I am happy with the results and will purchase again . The hair spray held well without being sticky or heavy .
 I have used many brands of shampoo and conditioner over the years , including salon brands , and this is hands down the best I have ever bought . It removes all buildup and leaves my hair super shiny and silky - as good as the best salons . It comes out perfectly every time I use it . It 's also very inexpensive .
 It works great it rinses out great and deeply conditions . I love the way my scalp tingles and the smell is wonderful ! I feel like I am having a spa treatment when I use it .
 This is great on my hair ! It leaves my hair soft and my scalp feels refreshed . I leave it in for 10mins for deep conditioning . The smell is very pleasant and it works well with the shampoo . Together they keep my dry scalp and dandruff under control -LRB- with steady use -RRB- .
 The Herbal Essences Moisturizing Body Wash is a very good product . It leaves my skin feeling moisturized . It has a very nice scent and lathers easily which is always a big plus with a body wash . I 'd certainly recommend this product to family and friends .
 This product has very good flowery fragrance . I love this fragrance -LRB- similar to strawberries -RRB- and I can enjoy shower time more than before because I feel better . I live in dry area right now , so this product helps to keep moisture in my skin . The price is a little expensive , but I can recommend it to people who have been suffering from dry skin . If I could get more bubbles , I 'd like this more .
 Please notice the dates on the previous posts . That 's because Clairol discontinued manufacture of this and all body wash produts . My husband and I love this product and used to buy it from Target , but when Target no longer carried it , I bought it from Amazon in lots of three.When I tried to order recently , and saw the outrageous prices being asked for this bodywash , I realized the same greed that caused this country 's economic crisis is still alive and well . The asking price for what used to sell for a little over $ 6 for a 24 ounce bottle is now five times that , plus shipping !! I was fortunate enough to find a secondary market and purchased 20 bottles for $ 15 each for a 24-ounce bottle -LRB- including shipping -RRB- , which will not be sold for a profit , but will be for our personal use.When I contacted Clairol , I was told not many people liked the product as much as I , therefore they decided to discontinue it . They do , however , still carry the Herbal Essences hair products , for those who might be interested .
 I used Herbal Essences moisturizing body wash for years and then my local drug store stopped carrying it . I tried many other brands , only to be disappointed in the quality . Some were very expensive , some were bargain priced . Either I did n't like the smell , it came out of the bottles in huge glops , it barely came out of the bottles , or it lathered poorly . When I discovered I could order my old brand online , I was overjoyed . And , not disappointed . Herbal Essences has a very nice clean scent that is not overpowering or too sweet . It lathers beautifully , and it comes out of the bottle as it should . It is a no-brainer to rate this product with five stars .
 Surprisingly in Salisbury this town of 30,000 in NC the local Walmart , Eckerds , CVS , and Walgreens no longer carry this product as they stock only their similar namebrand . The local JC Penny and Belks department store cosmetics dept also do not carry this item . Amazon purchase was less time consuming then trying to buy and save a few bucks on Ebay . I was pleased with the promptness of shipment and the price seemed reasonable . The product itself has been used a long time by my elderly mother and was bought as a birtday present .
 I used Herbal Essences Body Wash and I was very impressed with it and I like the nice scent and that it gives a nice lather too . The only thing that bothers me is that the stores that I have shopped in that carry Herbal Essences products that they have priced the products at very expensive prices .
 This product was well-received in my house . My daughters and I were impressed with it for a number of reasons . It lathered well , the scent was pleasant but not overpowering , and a little bit went a long way . The only thing we did n't care for was the shape of the bottle . It was difficult to handle with wet hands , and was dropped a couple of times . It would work better in a smaller size or a differently shaped bottle . It 's a product that I 'd purchase and recommend to my family .
 It smells nice and lathers well . But one thing I have to point out is that , although it claims it 's for dry skin , I have n't noticed any difference between it and other products .
 I was very impressed with the way this product felt when I was in the shower . It had a wonderful aroma and when I used it on my body , it left my skin feeling soft and clean . It lathered up very nicely and a small amount goes a long way .
 The Herbal Essences Moisturizing Body Wash is a terrific product ! I have very dry skin , particularly on my arms and legs , and have tried many different moisturizers . This is the best . After less than a week , my skin is smoother and feels great . Love the fragrance too -- fresh but not overpowering . Will definitely be purchasing this product .
 I loved this body wash . Both my husband and I used it for about five days now , and we both notice a difference in our skin . It feels a lot softer , not itchy , like it normally is . I 'd recommend this product to friends and family . The scent is great , too .
 This is a nice body wash . It lathers well using just a small amount of product . It 's very moisturizing and left my skin feeling clean and soft . Also , the softness seemed to last until my next bath . I did n't care for the fragrance , though -- it was too sweet for me .
 This is one of my favorite scents that my husband wears . It has a clean , musky smell to it ... very sexy . He likes it , as well.It can be a bit overpowering if you put too much on , or wear it too often , but I think it 's a great scent to wear when you go out on the town !
 I ordered this for my teen son . It was a great price and my son really liked it . It stays on you for some time , not like other ones that fade away really quick . Smells clean and sporty . Kids at school like it too . I use it oncein a while . This is the best cologne that liz claiborne has for men .
 I just started using cologne not to long ago and I finally found this to be the scent of choice for me ! Everyone I know loves it and comments for it . Best of all my girlfriend loves it !
 very satisfied with my order . it came more quickly than expected . i got the 4.2 ounce , exactly the same as when i have bought from other store but half the price ! packaged well and bottle completely sealed and full , not diluted . i will be buying again when the time comes .
 Yeah I 'm not really sure why this is named Curve . I know women who work out at a gym called Curves and that makes sense to me , but a fragrance for men should be called something manly and dangerous like Stetson or Old Spice ... ok I 'm just kidding . I 've been using Curve on and off for 11 years I think it 's been . It 's my favorite scent and really the only one I consider purchasing . I ca n't really tell you why I like it which kind of makes this a worthless review except for the fact that I recently purchased the tester right here on Amazon and it was not only cheaper , but it was exactly the same bottle I 've been purchasing for 11 years . If you have to ask yourself why I 've been buying the same bottle of cologne for 11 years then you might not understand that I was talking about the 4.2 oz size . If you 're interested in this cologne and Amazon has the tester for sale do n't be shy ... it 's exactly what you need !
 Not sure why a few writers are labeling this a `` fake '' . I too have been buying this product since it came out in ' 96 , and purchasing it from a department store discounter in Springfield , MO when I go there in the summer . I can not see or smell any difference at all . I have n't seen this product in any higher percentage fragrance than the 1 to 3 percent of essential oils that you would normally find in an `` eau de cologne '' or `` toilette '' now used interchangeably . According to an on-line definition , the `` eau de parfum '' is rated at 7 to 14 percent and the `` perfume '' at 20 to 40 percent . So , you 'd have to be pretty well-heeled to afford this size in a perfume . Additionally , I find it difficult to swallow that Amazon 's people would be so naive as to be hoodwinked with a `` fake '' .
 After using Aqua di Gio for the longest time I decided it was time for a change . After looking at some reviews , I decided on this one . I 'm so pleased with this cologne and I love the scent . It 's just right and does n't hurt the nose . I 've gotten a lot of compliments about this cologne and I will be using this for a very long time . The only problem I had is that it does n't last the whole day . Maybe because I purchased the cologne . I 'm gon na try the perfume variety on my next purchase .
 I have been wearing this for years . One time I had a `` smell off '' at home spraying about10 different colognes I had on hand on to pieces of paper . I had two lady friends overthat were actually mother and daughter . I did not tell them what was what . They bothliked Curve the best . I have also been to Thailand several times -LRB- you can not buy itover there -RRB- . The ladies there love it , one said it smells like American !? Another askedme to give her some , which I did when I left . I am so used to using it , that I do n'tnotice it on myself , but I have had several great comments about it at the Bank , Dentist ` soffice , Eye doc . and more . Some recognize the scent by name when I have it on . I usuallybuy it at Gordman 's or Sam 's or Walgreens . Reasonable price esp . if on sale . I tried onceto get it in Thailand and could not find it anywhere and could not get it shipped to thereover the internet ... not sure why ? I recently got an email from a Thai gal - she nowwants more and so does her girlfriend . Guess I will have to go over and give them some!btw I am over 50 ! ps Do n't buy it just leave it for my ladies . Personally I preferJoop and Grey Flannel , but the ladies dicktate what I wear dontcha know .
 I received this gift from a family friend and feel in love with this perfume . I was wearing Tiffany and still wear and love but when I dont want to wear that one , I wear this one . It is so soft and delicate smelling , it smells like baby powder to me .
 This is a lovely fragrance that smells like a rose garden and other pleasant flowers mingled in . It 's not over powering , but a gentle pleasant fragrance if you like flowery types of parfum . The fragrance lasts all day too . It will linger in your clothing until you wash them . When I wear this fragrance I 'm always complimented about how nice it smells .
 It 's a perfum , it depends on your personal taste ... but it was cheaper than in stores , closed and sealed s they promised , and it arrived on time .
 This is a cologne that you can spray all over and it is still not overpowering . It has a cozy smell , sort of a sophisticated baby powder aroma that is richer as the day goes on . I definitely recommend this .
 I always liked this perfume . Smells really good and has a good fixation for all day long . And the price is really good if compared with another stores .
 Love it and GREAT price ! No reason to buy perfume at the department stores again . I 'll definitely be buying more .
 About 6 months ago I was looking for a new scent . I found BLV and loved it ! I had a small bottle and it did n't take long for me to finish that off . -LRB- I do n't normally finish a bottle before I move on to something else -RRB- I have two other favorites that I alway have and have worn them for years . But ever since I purchased BLV , I have n't been able to wear anything else . I 've tried and all I can think about is washing it off because I ca n't take the smell . BLV has turned me into a one perfume woman ! Clean and fresh and just a wonderful scent . I do n't wear anything else . Also my husband has trouble with any kind of perfume which limits me to what I can wear . But he does n't have any issues with BLV .
 muy buen precio excelente presentacion , muy cumplido y muy serio el distribuidor , muy recomendado , ademas llego atiempo la orden y tal cual se solicito !
 Bulgari is a wonderful brand . Price and service was wonderful.Would be buying more . Everything was great and in time .
 I love this product , its a clean smell , I get a lot of compliments when u wear it and the price is great
 The perfume packed well so delivered very safely : -RRB- Also I 'm so happy to get this perfume again!lol it 's my second time to purchase this as much asi love it !
 it came rather quickly , much sooner than i expected . it was packaged up properly and exactly what i expected . i love this cologne , it 's strong , it lasts , and it smells so good
 It 's one of my favorite things . It is great to shop online and not have to travel . Price was fantastic and roughly $ 20 lower than the local stores here offered .
 I always go to amazon.com for best price and difficult to locate items . Service was fast and item is exactly what I wanted for my daughters birthday gift . : - -RRB-
 Palmolive bath soap is the only major brand to which I do not have an allergic reaction . It is not oily or over-perfumed . I regret that retailers in my market no longer carry it . I will continue to purchase it from Amazon.com so long as it remains available . If it is ever discontinued by Colgate-Palmolive , I guess I ; ll just have to stop bathing .
 I was hoarding a stash of Palmolive and looking to renew it and found 30 bars of the good old fashioned GREEN PALMOLIVE BAR SOAP -LRB- not the `` naturals '' -RRB- at drugstore.com . Too bad they do n't bring it back , it IS the best , AND SMELLS WONDERFUL , but it just did not get enough advertisement .
 I have searched everywhere , , and was on my last bar ! I second all that arnold stated in his review ...
 This soap will take you back to the Forties or even the Thirties . Classic packaging and the nice old-fashioned scent you may remember .
 My mother loves the way the soap smell and cleans.The store she shops at stoped handling this product .
 I absolutely loved this body wash ! I 've used MANY body washes , and the others did n't achieve the lather this one does , using such a small amount . This is the first body wash for which I 've been willing to trade in my bar soap . I also consider myself a budget-conscious consumer , and I can see that this is more cost-effective than bar soap . I was able to use such a small amount and get the same effect . It also did n't dry out my skin . I love this product , and it will definitely be a regular in my household !
 I found the Herbal Essences body wash to be a very lightly-scented body wash that lathered up well , even when using a small amount . I normally use regular bar soap when bathing , and this was a nice treat -- especially since it did n't leave my skin feeling slightly dry as most soap does . I did n't feel the need to put on body moisturizer after getting out of the shower . Also , the packaging was very appealing and looks very nice on display . And the generous 24-fluid-ounce size will certainly last a while , even in our household of five !
 I lived thia body wash so much and have not found another i like as much in 12 years . Look at all the great reviews , please bring it back !
 This was a very nice product . The scent was pleasant and mild , not at all overwhelming . And a small amount lathered up very nicely . Also , my skin did n't feel dry afterwards .
 I really liked this product . It worked wonders as a shaving lotion . I 've tried other body washes for shaving and had problems with them . This one rinsed off really well . I 'd definitely recommend this to everyone . It has a pleasant smell and is very affordable .
 This body wash was a good product that I 'd definitely buy again . It lathers up really well and makes my skin feel smooth -- not dry and tight like some other brands of soap . Upon opening the bottle , the scent was fresh and clean smelling . But after lathering up , the scent was n't very strong . I like one with stronger scent that leaves the whole bathroom smelling nice . All in all , the product did the job , but not more than other brands of moisturizing body washes do .
 This is a wonderful product . It makes my skin feel squeaky clean , without drying it out . The fragrance is just right -- invigoratingly so !
 This is a great body wash . It left my skin feeling clean and soft . It lathered up very well with a pouf and smelled wonderful ! The price is n't too high ; you get a lot for your money . I would definitely tell my friends and family about it !
 My husband and I both like this body wash , and that 's rare . It 's not a female-only product . We 'll be buying this body wash !
 This body wash smelled so good ! In addition , when my family used it , our skin felt soft and silky . The lather is wonderfully scented and it was a truly wonderful experience to use it . Even my five-year-old enjoyed the lather and scent . I 've told all my friends about it ! I 've used many body wash products before , and this was the best !
 The Herbal Essences Moisturizing Body Wash worked great . It had a terrific lather and only required a small amount for each use . The only thing I did n't like as much was the smell -- it was a little overpowering . Overall , it 's the best lathering body wash I 've ever tried and I 'd recommend this product .
 The very contemporary design of this perfume bottle lets you know that a master designer is at work . It 's sleek and state of the art - very much like all from Miyake 's studio.Imagination and innovation are hallmarks of designer Issye Miyake . Born in Hiroshima where he was a student of graphic design -LRB- think his `` Pleats Please '' line -RRB- , he later moved to Paris where he worked for Guy Laroche and Hubert de Givenchy.In the late 1960s he moved to New York and the salon of Geoffrey Beene . Just a short jump from there to opening his own studio two years later . The rest is couture history and today his clothing is worn by the very fashionable.Miyake brought the same exuberance to the creation of his fragrance that he brought to his designs . While it is a floral essence , it is enhanced with a variety of flower scents
 I have used this mild , pleasant soap for years . I just wish it were stocked more frequently in retail stores .
 Winter is hard on my skin and we 've had an exceptionally dry winter . My skin has become very sensitive and dry as well . This soap is very mild and did not irritate my already sensitive skin . In fact , it seemed to lessen the dryness and flakiness I 'd been experiencing . It had no strong aroma . I 'd use it again and recommend it to others .
 I have used this product for years and recently have not been able to find it locally . So glad it 's on Amazon . I am very sensitive to any chemicals or smells so this soap is great for me . I recommend it for anyone with sensitivities or allergies .
 This soap was n't drying and harsh on my skin , as some others are . It smelled very fresh and nice . I 'd probably recommend it to someone . The only thing I did n't like is that it is n't anti-bacterial .
 This soap is a very good product . Both my husband and my son have sensitive skin but they did n't have any reaction to this soap . As a wife and mother , I feel that this was the best selling point . I 'd recommend this soap to anyone . Do n't let the plain packaging fool you -- it 's very good soap .
 This product , a special hypoallergenic bath soap , is no longer sold in retail shops -- perhaps no longer manufactured . However , this supplier advertised on Amazon and offered to supply it at a very reasonable price . The product apparently was taken from remaindered -LRB- old -RRB- stock , it arrived promtply , and the quality was as expected . I was fully satisfied .
 If you 're looking for an excellent bath bar , no scent , no anti-bacterial , just simple and clean , this is the best product available on the market today . Many retail grocery stores used to care it , but few do today , as flashier products have crowded it off the shelves . We will continue to buy this product until a better product comes along , if ever !
 This is the ONLY soap bar my husband will useto shave with . Cant buy in store any longer-so , grateful to find it here ! Says his face is soft and never irritatedwhen he uses it .
 It lathered nicely and felt great .
 We really liked the Pure and Natural soap . Our family has many problems with allergies , and this soap did n't cause anyone to break out in a rash or aggravate our eczema . It rinsed off well and we like the clean scent .
 This soap worked great . I found it did n't leave any residue in the bathtub . I usually suffer from allergies to most soaps , but this product worked great and left my skin feeling clean and fresh . Most importantly , there was no itching afterwards , like I have with most products . I 'll be buying more and recommending it to my friends .
 For years , I bought nothing by Ivory Soap , because of its purity . Though inexpensive , the individual bars did tend to wear down to nothing awful quickly . These days , my fiancee lives with me . She 's been buying the soap , and we 've been using Irish Spring . I 've never felt entirely comfortable with soap that has all those useless -LRB- to me -RRB- chemical additives . Hey ! That green color ca n't be natural . However , I dislike shopping , and gladly left it to Jessie . Thus , I jumped on the chance to Test Drive Pure and Natural Bar Soap . No driving to the store and waiting in a long line for this . The upshot ? Jessie and I will now be using Pure and Natural from drugstore.com -- the perfect answer for us .
 I just started making my own laundry soap . Pure and Natural was the brand used in the directions . This soap grates very fine making it easy to melt , an important step in the soap making process . Love it and am sad that the mfg. is no longer manufacturing it .
 I am making a review on the fragrance itself and not the seller . J'ADORE by DIOR is a sweet and sexy type of scent that is not overwhelming but also not a weak one . It draws attention and can be a signature scent because it is quite noticeable in a very good way . I 've tried so many expensive perfumes and this remain as one of my top five . Just a lovely kind of smell that my hubby loves ! Now , I bought mine from a store and paid full price , if I am going to save $ 20 by buying a fake one , I do n't think it 's worth it . Go for the real thing !
 Very nice , slightly sweet floral perfume . Great for summer or work where you do n't want a heavy perfume aroma floating around you .
 As Poison has become the ultimate classics in the Dior line , so will J'adore . It is very sweet , can be a bit too strong but very nice nontheless . I use it as an everydayer .
 I have been teasing myself with spritzers of this delicious scent for 3 years , each time I shop at a Department Store . The exorbitant price , however , limited me to spraying my hand , not clutching it in my hand and heading to a register . However , I discovered a great deal on Amazon that provided me with a 50 % discount . Thus , I was able to gladden my heart , without running a dagger through my bank account ! I may shop the cosmetic counter again to find what I like , but I 'll take my wallet to Amazon !
 This is my favorite perfume ! I always get compliments on it ! And I got a great deal on this purchase !
 Plain and simple ... no other bubble bath compares to Mr. Bubble . It produces more bubbles and is kinder to my child 's skin than any other bubble bath that we tried . We also love the smell ! It also is no more expensive than other bubble baths . In fact , it 's cheaper than many . With all sorts of scent varieties -LRB- including sensitive skin -RRB- , it 's great for the kids -- and me too !
 This is GREAT ! My daughter loves the bubbles ! and it is a mild soap - you dont have to worry about anything !
 What can I say ? It makes bubbles and the kids love it . I ran out and got in big trouble with my kids so I need to keep some backup bottles .
 It does n't matter how old you are , if you want a bubble bath Mr. Bubble is the right place to be !!
 My kids love taking bubble baths , I use it every day . Great value for the price !
 I love this product , but would buy it more often if it reminded me of my original Mr. Bubble . Mr. Bubble used to be PALE pink , and round , and actually looked like a bubble . Now he 's a solid darker pink and looks more like a frog . Why not bring back the old box of Mr. Bubble with the original image ?
 This is a nice big bottle of bubbles ! It provides lots and lots of dense bubbles in your bath : - -RRB- The bottle was not packed very well from Amazon and the weight of it cracked a CD case that was also being shipped . Luckily I 'm not rating this product based on the shipping !
 This is the 5th bottle for me . I also like Johnson & Johnson . I 'm biased because this is what I remember as a child.I might have a different experience with this product compared to others do to the following reason
 Seems Mr. Bubble 's been around for as long as , oh , the Rolling Stones , but it continues to deliver the goods -LRB- unlike Keith , Mick , Charlie , and Ronnie - in the studio at least -RRB- . One small cap of this stuff is more than enough to generate enough suds to completely conceal Wynonna Judd , if you could find a crane strong enough to drop her fat carcass into a tub that is . I was brought up on Mr. Bubble and I use it when I give my three kids baths , whether they like it or not . Sometimes just the promise of Mr. Bubble is enough to send them on a mad dash for the bathroom , leaving footprints on each other 's backs . Plus , in a stroke of marketing genius , there 's an offer on the back label for a Mr. Bubble T-shirt , which your trusty scribe used to sport when he haunted Detroit 's punk clubs back in the late 70 's and early 80 's . It was the source of countless compliments and I still have it and wear it to this day -LRB- at the tender age of 46 ! -RRB- . The version they 're hawking currently is a ringer , but if it 's anything like mine , it will hold together until well after your Social Security checks start rolling in . Has there ever been a better bath product than Mr. Bubble ? Duh ...
 I 'm giving this 5 stars based on the Mr. Bubble that was out when I was a kid ... in a box ... in powder form ! Anyone else remember that ? It smelled so good and some would always go up my nose LOL could n't wait until bath time . Ahhh the glorious 70 's : - -RRB-
 Purchased Mr. Bubble for old times sake . Not quite the same , but a good product anyway .
 Dove soaps are wonderful moisturizing soaps this is a staple in my household especially during winter months . It moisturizes dry skin very well and leaves it feeling smooth without the residues that some soaps leave behind.Also it has a nice clean scent that is n't heavy or abrasive . The fact that it comes in so many different types helps as well . My favorite is the original white bar , the nutrium bar with vitamins or the sensitive skin bar.The Dove products really do what they say . I also adore their line of deodorants ! Ca n't beat the price either . Great product at a great price . If you have dry skin give it a try you wo n't be out a lot of money if you do n't like it and if you do like myself and many others you 'll have found a great product deal .
 Did very well for my dry , winter skin . Much better than the soap I was using .
 I really enjoyed this soap because it made me feel soft and clean . Also , I smelled good . It 's hard to feel soft this time of year with it being so dry , but the Dove bar was up to it . My husband also enjoyed using it too -- his skin has also dried out this winter . I like that I can also wash my face with the product . Saves room when traveling .
 I have very sensitive skin , so I 've never tried Dove soap . I always use Ivory soap instead . However , I was pleasantly surprised that my skin did not break out from the fragrance . I also liked that my skin was not dry after using this on my face . It truly has a great moisturizer inside ! I will now use Dove soap on a regular basis .
 The Dove Beauty Bar has a great smell and awesome feel to it . I can feel the cream that they claim to have added to it . The suds it creates are soft and clean feeling , and it left my skin soft , not dried out like other soaps .
 I 'd highly recommend this product . The winter always dries out my skin leaving it feeling flaky . After using the Dove Beauty Bar , I noticed that my skin was much less dry and felt much softer . It 's much easier to manage my winter skin by washing with Dove than to keep applying moisturizer every day after washing with other soaps . It also has a nice , clean scent .
 This time of the year , my skin is so dry that Dove really did make a difference . I 'm a medical professional and I have a potty training 2-year-old at home , so I wash my hands frequently ! The Dove left my hands feeling softer than other soaps that I 've used and the smell is nice but not overpowering .
 I really liked using this soap . I liked the scent -LRB- not too strong -RRB- and my wife liked it also . One definite advantage was that it did not dry out our skin . It 's very dry in our house right now , and I noticed an improvement in about a day or so , that my skin was n't as dry and itchy as it had been .
 I LOVE THIS SOAP !! This is the most wonderful soap I 've ever used . It 's strong enough to clean but extremely gentle so it did n't dry out or irritate my skin . After using it , my skin feels so fresh and smooth . If you ca n't tell , I highly recommend Dove Soap .
 I really liked using the Dove soap but was unable to continue doing so because of my allergies . When I first opened the box , the soap had a wonderful scent although it was just a bit overpowering . With me being allergic to a lot of fragrances , I was unable to use the soap for very long because it caused me to sneeze . On the upside , the soap did leave my skin feeling soft and clean unlike many soaps that leave my skin feeling dry . So although I 'm unable to use this soap I would recommend it to family and friends .
 Bought this based on the reviews even though I 'm not a foody-based scent lover and guess what ? I love this ! This is not the typical perfume you expect one to use . It 's a daring and sexy scent which I love to use for a night out and I get compliments from men and women every single time .
 This is a deep , cinnamon candy scent . It 's very rich and buttery with a dark vein of patchouli running through it . Just a small dab does it for me , and it lasts all day until I shower . I always get compliments galore when i wear this , but my favorite reaction was when I was standing in line in the store . the man in front of me kept sniffing over his shoulder and gradually worked his way around until he was facing my direction . Then when it was his turn to check out , he took one last big sniff and faced the cash register !!
 love the scent looking to get moor later on husband loves it . lasts a long time , has a spicy dmell
 I was not expecting this vanilla scent to pack such a punch but I was pleasantly surprised . It has a really lasting and lingering scent and smells good enough to eat !
 I get so many compliments from guys when I wear this product - and I love it ! I knew it was something to keep on me at all times when I walked into a meeting and one of the guys said `` you smell like candy '' ; and said yum . Another guy I went on a date with told me that I smelled so good he wanted to eat me . Hilarious ! I did notice that not too many females are attracted to the sent ; I 've had comments that I smell like incense . Who cares what the women think ... guys love it ! I love it ! I will definitely continue to order !
 TO SAY THIS ATTRACTS MALE INTEREST IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT ! Dunno if it 's the pheremones or just the yummy scent -- But do not wear this stuff if you want to be alone !
 I have two bottles of this . It smells so good I do n't want to ever run out . I alway get compliments when I wear this . Well , except from my spouse , but everyone else likes it : -RRB-
 This is the perfect cool-weather sex bomb !! I absolutely LOVE this scent , and I ca n't believe how dead sexy it is !! I catch myself wondering `` mmm , what smells so good ? '' and it 's ME !! This is pheromone-free -LRB- unless you choose to add pheros -RRB- but you 'd never know it - it attracts like nothing else !! I will never let myself run out of this !!
 This was one of the first LP scents I ever tried after a friend recommended the line to me . I had grow so tired of `` perfumey '' scents that were too strong and overpowering and never felt like `` me . '' LP Red was at first a total departure than what I was used to in a fragrance . It comes in a Roll on type of bottle and it 's an oil base -LRB- they also available in spray form on the website -RRB- . It was love at first smell . I applied sparingly at first as it was spicy and resiny and I did n't want it to be too strong . It just kept smelling better and better . It 's got a mixture of spicy ingredients
 This scent is for the daring . Vanilla infused cinnamon sugared butter is what I call this delicious smelling sexy treat . My significant other loves this as well , and he always seems to want to live in my neck when I wear this particular blend . Wear with caution because this one is HOT !
 The ingredient combo in this works really well together to create a slinky , sexy scent that makes me feel super feminine and confident . Each ingredient combines as supporting cast members to create an overall sophisticated scent that is divine . I do n't want to be without this !
 Love Potion Red is one of the first perfumes I bought -LRB- several years ago -RRB- from Love Potion Magickal Perfumerie , and to this day is still one of my favorites . Not to mention my husband 's ;-RRB- The vanilla , dark sugars , amber and cinnamon mix to make this a sweet and sexy scent . I 'd definitely recommend it to anyone wanting a sensual scent that will capture attention !
 Words ca n't even describe the olfactory poetry that is Love Potion Red . It is sweet , complex , and drop dead sexy . Just absolutely beautiful . The other thing I love about Love Potion perfumes in general is that they can be worn and enjoyed even by people who are generally bothered by perfume . They are rich and long lasting , but cling close to the skin and do n't leave obnoxious trails that gag everyone in your wake . I hate department store perfumes ; wearing Love Potion Red is an entirely different experience .
 Actually , I found the Dove Ultra-Moisturizing Body Wash surprising . I expected not to like it and to go back to using my expensive body washes , but this product FEELS expensive . It goes on creamy and creates a lot of silky lather . But it rinses off squeaky clean . I would recommend this and will probably supply my daughters ' bathrooms with it too . The only change I would make is in the packaging . I prefer to use a pump so I do n't have to fumble around in the shower .
 This product is great . It 's a lot like lotion , and a very small amount of the bath wash makes tons of lather . It 's also a good value , because it will last for a long time . I liked the light , clean scent . It was n't overpowering , but it made me feel clean . This is one of my favorite body washes and I will definitely buy it again .
 About 30 years ago , in the summer I developed a rash on my legs . The Dermetologist told me if happened as a result to a reaction of the bath soap to the sun . He told me never to go out without sunscreen and to use Dove soap as the others were too harsh . I have used it ever since and have liked it from the beginning . I was happy when the body wash came out , I do n't think I waste as much with Body Wash as with bar soap . When I saw the rebate offer on Amazon.com , I took advantage of it .
 This is a thick , creamy body wash , white in colour . It will moisterize your skin but not to the point of where no lotion is needed , but almost . It also has a fruity scent , that truly I have to say , some will like and some will not . I do recomend if you have seriously dry skin .
 I liked this product very much . I normally use Caress brand body washes , but the Dove Ultra-Moisturizing Body Wash works just as well , if not better . I liked the way it lathered up and felt on my skin . I would definitely recommend it to family , friends , and consumers in general .
 I really like the consistency -LRB- for lack of a better word -RRB- of the Dove Ultra-Moisturizing Body Wash. . I have bought other body washes that are too runny , which makes you use too much . I think this product helped my dry skin somewhat . I thought the scent was a little odd , something like Bubble Yum bubble gum , but it smelled okay on my skin . I probably would n't tell my friends and family to rush out and buy this product , but if they asked me if I 've used it , I would say that I like it .
 The Dove Ultra-Moisturizing Body Wash was an excellent product . Once applied to my bath sponge , it foamed well , had a very pleasant smell and created a lot of soap bubbles for washing . I especially liked that I was able to use this product as a shaving cream . It was that thick and rich , eliminating the need for an additional product . I also liked that it did n't smell like heavy perfume , which can often be overpowering in the heat of the shower . I really liked the lather it created , too .
 I really liked this body wash . It 's thick and creamy and has a very pleasant scent . The soap does n't lather very much , but it 's very creamy and delightful to bathe with . It did a good job of moisturizing my skin . I loved the way the pleasant fragrance lingered after showering , and I would buy this product again . However , the one drawback is that on certain sensitive areas , the soap did have a tendency to sting a little . Both my husband and I noticed this . But overall , it 's a very pleasant soap and delivered what it promised .
 Hard to find a bar soap on the market that combines anti-bacterial properties and moisturizing in one product . This one does it quite well , though I 've had trouble finding it locally on a regular basis . So to find it here on Amazon in bulk was a nice surprise . Have been very happy with this product , even use it for shaving , as its moisturizers agree nicely with my face . Nice scent , not overwhelming like many deodorant soaps are . Recommended product .
 This is a great bath bar for winter use . It 's loaded with moisturizers and makes your skin feel moist . When I first used it , the scent brought back a memory of a visit to my grandmother 's when I was a child . I 'd forgotten that she always used Camay . I guess any soap that has been around this long has to be a good one .
 Camay has a very good smell and cleans nicely . It leaves the skin soft . A very good soap . I would recommend this soap to anyone who has dry skin or sensitive skin . You feel so clean after using Camay . I simply love this soap !
 I have used Camay for many years and love it . But lately I have been having great difficulty finding it -- in drug stores , supermarkets , or wherever . So I am delighted to find it on Amazon.com .
 Overall , I thought the Camay Softly Scented Bath Bar was a very good product . It lathered well and left my skin feeling soft . The only thing I did n't like was the fragrance . Even though it 's supposed to be '' `` softly scented , '' '' I found it to be a little too strong . The strong scent is only from the bar of soap , it does n't linger on your skin , but it was more than I expected while showering . Other than that , it 's a product I would buy again .
 The soap comes in a three pack , and is a very pretty pink color . The scent is floral and mild , but nice . I found it to be a nice soap to use in the bath or as a hand soap . The price is nice , too . I 'd definitely purchase this soap again , and would recommend it to others .
 I have used the Camay for a week now . I loved the fragrance of the soap and the shape of the bar . Camay did make my face feel tight and dry and I noticed that feeling throughout the day . After showering , when I rubbed my hand down my arm , it did n't go down smoothly . It would hesitate as it slid down my arm . I do n't know if any of this is because of our water -LRB- we have a water softener -RRB- , but I do n't notice the dry tight face or the bumpiness of my arm with my old soap . My son loved the soap and asked me to buy it again . I would recommend this product to others -- maybe this experience is an isolated incident only for me .
 The winter months are hard on my skin . Camay really helped to soften and moisturize my skin . I 'm not constantly applying lotion now . It has a nice fragrance also .
 I truly enjoyed using Camay . The size and shape of the bar is easy to handle . It 's nice that the Camay bar has a curved shape because it easily slides over your body . It has a soft and subtle fragrance that is pleasant . I personally have trouble with dry skin and was very happy to use a soap that left my skin feeling soft and moisturized . I did n't feel the need to add additional lotion as soon as I got out of the shower after using Camay . I would buy this soap not only for myself and my family , but would recommend to a friend as a wonderful moisturizing soap .
 It smells really good and is so smooth on the skin that I feel like taking bath twice a day . But , I would love to have this product in liquid soap , as I like liquid soaps more than bar soap . But I liked it .
 I 'd definitely recommend this product to anyone who enjoys relaxing in a bubble bath . The fragrance was wonderful and it left my skin smooth , slightly scented , and clean . This was probably the best bubble bath I 've ever used .
 I enjoyed this Test Drive . It gave me an excuse to take a bath every night . I like the product . It has a very pleasant flowery scent and a nice pearly blue/purple color . The bubble bath made the water feel silky , which was very nice too . The only problem was that it took a lot of bubble bath to make any bubbles -- and I have soft water . The bottle was huge though , so it was n't a sacrifice to use a lot . I 'd recommend this product to family and friends because , for the price , it 's a very nice bubble bath .
 I found the fragrance to be pleasing -- light and a little flowery . Very pleasant and soothing . The bubbles lasted the entire bath , about 20 minutes . I would 've liked the product to leave my skin a little softer . Although it was promoted as an oil-type bathing solution , I think it needed just a little something else to leave a softer feel to my skin . On the other side of the coin , however , it probably would have meant that if a little oil were added to the bathing solution , it would have left more residue . As it is right now , it left no residue , which was wonderful !!
 Smells good -LRB- though I 'm not sure it 's really like freesia -RRB- , looks pretty -LRB- light lavender -RRB- , and the nice big bottle goes a long way . I 'd definitely spend real money on it .
 I really enjoyed this product . It made me stay in the bath for hours . I hated to get out . Nice aroma . Also my skin felt very soft and clean . I would for sure recommend this product to anyone who enjoys a bath with lots of lasting suds !
 The first thing that grabbed my attention was the scent of Village Naturals Bubble Bath , Freesia & Flowers . It really smells wonderful . The bubbles were really thick and lasted a long time in the tub . I love to take bubble baths and this is a product I 'd use over and over again .
 I really like the scent of this product . Even though it 's anti-bacterial the ` mountain ' scent ensures that washing does not feel ` clinical ' . The scent is aromatic without being too floral , so it is a good choice for the whole family to use . Do n't pay more for basically simmilar body washes , get this product today .
 I think that the Dial Body Wash does a great job . I 've used many other body washes , and Dial performs just as well , if not better , than others . It lathers well and smells fresh and clean . My two young children like it just as much and do n't mind that it is n't bubble bath !
 Body washes are a favorite thing of mine . I loved everything about this one except the scent . It lathers up really nice with just a small amount . I used it even to shave my legs with , and did n't get any nicks . One more great thing about this product is that I did n't need to apply lotion after my shower . I 'd buy and recommend this product to anyone .
 The Dial Moisturizing Body Wash is a creamy , nicely scented body wash that works as advertised . It provides a rich lather and leaves your skin feeling clean and smooth . It 's also antibacterial , which seems to be unique in the world of body wash . I 'd recommend it to anyone wanting a body wash .
 I loved the soft feeling I got after using this body wash . I also love the clean smell . It was n't overpowering , but it stays with you all day . I would definitely recommend it to anyone .
 I loved this product ! It left a very light , fresh , clean scent after showering -- nothing perfumey or strong . No soapy residue was left on my skin at all , and it left my skin feeling soft and smooth . Definitely a keeper !
 I really liked using the Dial Body Wash. . It had a VERY clean , pleasing fragrance that I did n't find overpowering -- and sometimes soaps can be first thing in the morning . The lather was great , but the best part was that my skin was NOT dried out after my shower and I did n't necessarily feel the need to moisturize afterward . Usually , my skin is very dry so I found the product very soothing . The one thing I 'd suggest would be to include a puff with the product . It 's necessary to have one and I think it 'd be a nice touch . Another packaging suggestion would be to use a different sort of dispenser top . Otherwise , it 's a very nice product and one I would definitely recommend to my dry skin sisters ! And brothers -- my husband actually liked this too !
 The Dial Moisturizing Body Wash leaves skin smooth and alive . The clean Dial smell lasts all day and makes you feel fresher . A very good product at an excellent price . Affordable and effective . You just ca n't go wrong with this one .
 this is a hidden gem of high quality parfume i have yet to find one woman who i presented it with not be taken aback by its subtle mystical enchanting delicacy exactly like the last small town French woman i was in love with use to wear .
 The item is fine , but my instruction label was torn off the rear of the bottle . Also , this product ships from a third party , not Amazon directly , and the shipping cost was about $ 6 ! Had I known , I would have purchased it locally !
 The Clearasil goes on smoothly and rinses off with a minimum hassle . The fragrance is OK . The results after five days have been fairly quick , positive results -- drying up my skin without it feeling like it 's dried-up . I would recommend it to friends and family , as a better option than some of the other products that are similar . It costs a little bit more , but in this case , you get what you pay for .
 Nice product . My skin tents to become dry , and at first this product dyed my skin to much , but after three day it was fine . I always use facial moisturizer after using this . And drink lots of water.My acne is light .
 I really liked Clearasil Daily Facial Wash. . I use it nightly and my face seems to be less oily in the morning than it used to be . I wish the wash was a tiny bit stronger and had a nicer scent , but it lathers up nice and seems to get my face very clean . The only other problem I have with this product is that it 's so thick -LRB- which is good -RRB- that it 's kind of hard to squeeze out of the tube , and then the tube does n't go back to its original shape easily -LRB- which is bad -RRB- . Overall , though , thumbs up to this product !
 I was surprised to find out that this product did n't contain any zit medication . It 's simply for cleansing your face '' `` better than soap '' '' . I found that Clearasil Daily Face Wash was very effective in leaving my face clean and smooth , so if you 're looking for an excellent facial soap , Clearasil Daily Face Wash is the way to go , but if you want to truly clear up your zits , find something else .
 I was pleasantly surprised with this product . It 's a very '' `` non-soapy '' '' cleaner . I have never tried one like it before -- have used only bar soaps to wash my face . There 's no discernable fragrance , which was a nice change of pace from the usually '' `` flowered '' '' skin products . I used it on my face only , but the directions indicate you could use it in the shower , which is a great idea . The other thing I liked about this product was that a little goes a really long way . The only room for improvement might be to make a cap you could flip and '' `` squeeze '' '' rather than to have to unscrew it each time -LRB- with wet hands -RRB- . My skin felt very clean but not '' `` tight '' '' or dry after using this cleanser . I will probably continue to use it daily .
 This product seems to work very well overall . It does n't dry out your skin as much as regular soap . It cleans very well . It has cleared up my skin with using it for only one week . I would definitely recommend this product to all my family and friends .
 I would highly recommend this product . My face is very oily and I 'm prone to acne if I do n't wash it daily . I used this product for several days , and my face felt fresh and clean each morning . It did n't feel dry or chapped , and the product did n't cause me to break out . I recommend this to anyone with an oily face .
 I am 36 years old and had not used Clearasil since I was a teenager . Having mostly dry skin , I 've used the Clearasil Face Wash in the shower every morning . I think that it has moisturized my face without causing it to be oily . I have always been afraid to put moisturizer on my face thinking that it would be too oily . I did n't think that it lathered like I expected , but all and all , it 's a product that I would purchase in the future .
 I had been using soap and water as my cleanser for some time . My face has always been dry in the winter . I 've been using only the Clearasil facial cleanser for five days now and I can already feel the difference in my skin . I 've already recommended this product to my daughter and I 'll definitely recommend it to others .
 This product works great ! In just the little time I 've used it , I can definitely feel a difference . My skin feels a lot smoother and does n't feel dry at all . I would highly recommend it to anyone .
 Although I 've never had terrible break outs , I almost always seem to have at least some acne . As I 've grown out of my teen years , I grew tired of the gel cleansers I was using . Most of them were n't quite doing the trick
 I have dry skin , so was thrilled to see this did nothing to dry my skin , but dry up the problems . I never had acne has a teen , but as an adult I had the occasional bouts due to allergies . With my dry skin this seems to be a headache to control . I got this because I had been through everything Olay , Revson and several other lines , paying small fortunes and nothing helped.I used this and saw results first time . There is a `` tightening '' of the pores on first use . My skin looked polished . All blemishes vanished , and my skin was so soft . Smooth like a baby 's , not oiling . Second day was even better . Within three days everything was under control and boy am I sold on this .
 I have a secret . . I used to be an Aesthetician . When I moved across the country and took a new avenue in my life , I have moved away from the skin care business and do not have easy access -LRB- or the funds ! -RRB- to get the expensive cleansers I used to use ... I 've been using this cleanser for almost 2 years and I have not had any breakouts since I 've started using it.I love it ! It smells good . . yes , it 's creamy - but it 's refreshing and it WORKS.Try it , you might like it . = 0 -RRB-
 I really liked this product . It has a wonderful fragrance and it cleaned really well . I am sensitive to soaps and cleansers on my face and I had no problems with this one . My daughter also has very sensitive skin . She tried it too and loved it .
 There was a great improvement in my skin while using this product on my face for a week . I could feel it tingling slightly while cleaning , yet it is n't a harsh cleanser . My face felt fresh and clean after each use . My face went from rough with redness to smooth and healthy looking in a week . My husband had to try Clearasil after hearing how pleased I was with its results !
 Gentle but effective . Clear complexion without drying or flaking . Easy to use . I will purchase this product in the future .
 This is a good product . It 's in an attractive container and has a nice pleasant smell . If you use too much , it 's kind of hard to wash off . Not really hard , just dense . You have to use only a quarter-size amount on your face . I would recommend it to friends and family .
 I used the product for the past week , and it did a great job . I tend to have sensitive and dry skin , especially in the winter , so I was very worried about drying . But the face wash was gentle and did n't dry out my skin . The smell of the product is mild and pleasant , barely there , and it 's very easy to use . I can definitely tell that my skin is cleaner . Especially now that I 've stopped wearing makeup since my son was born , I tend to have more blackheads than ever , but they seem to be all gone now .
 I would recommend this product to others . It 's easy to use and does clear up oily skin . I would , however , prefer a flip top , instead of losing the screw-on lid . It 's easy to use Clearasil Face Wash in the shower , instead of messing around with cotton balls , hairbands and the like . I would buy it .
 I loved this product . It made my face feel fresh and clean without that tight feeling you get from regular soap . It left my skin feeling soft . I would highly recommend it to my daughters and my friends .
 I am allergic to many products . this is the only body wash i can use with confidence
 Ivory Liquid Clear Hand Soap is the best liquid hand soap . I stopped using antibacterial liquid hand soap after I read medical articles warning that anti-bacterial liquid soap may make medications to treat infections less effective . Also , Other liquid soaps release too much of the liquid causing drips on my counter top . Ivory release a smaller amount and does not drip on the counter top . I ordered Ivory Liquid Clear Hand Soap from Amazon and received it on time . I love shopping online at Amazon !
 This is now difficult to find -LRB- basic and unscented -RRB- . I have tried supermarkets , Wal-Mart , Target and others , but can now only find on-line .
 I ordered this item for a recipe to make homemade sugar scrubs as Christmas gifts . The Ivory soap smells amazing and worked great . Everyone loved their gifts and I will definitely buy this product again ! = -RRB-
 This is the only soap I have used for years to wash my hands prior to putting my contact lenses in .
 As a loyal user of Lever 2000 , I was surprised by how much I liked the Caress Fresh Deodorant product ! It has a nice -LRB- not overpowering -RRB- fresh scent , rich lather , and leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized . Compared to Lever 2000 , this product is probably geared more towards women . I 'd definitely purchase it and will recommend it to family and friends .
 I really did enjoy using the Caress soap . It left my skin feeling very moisturized and the smell lasted a lot longer than most of the soaps I 've tried . -LRB- But I did think the smell was a little strong for me . -RRB- It cleaned really well , also unlike most of the moisturizing bars I 've used . I 'd definitely tell my friends about this product .
 I enjoyed the scent of the Caress bar . I have very dry skin and it did n't dry my skin out . I felt , for bar soap , it was very moisturizing and left my skin feeling clean without any dull buildup . I 'd recommend this product to family and friends .
 The clean , refreshing scent was great . This soap left our skin feeling soft , smooth , and clean . We 've enjoyed Caress products in the past , and this was no exception . I 'd definitely recommend it to others .
 I have sensitive skin , so I 'm always afraid to try new soaps . Most soap makes me break out in a rash or I 'm extremely itchy all day , but this soap was wonderful -- I had no rash and was n't itchy . It has a nice lather , and a shape that 's easy to hold . It also has a pleasant smell .
 I really liked this product . My skin did n't feel as dry after using Caress . Other bar soaps seem to leave my skin very dry . I still prefer to use shower gels , because I think they work better for dry skin . I 'd recommend this product to any friend who asked about it .
 I wish i could get more of this , i understand they no longer make this particular product . if it is still available please let me know
 I liked the way Oil of Olay lathers up on the wash cloth . It 's long lasting , which is very good for my daughter 's bath . My skin is not itchy after taking a shower with this soap as it is with other soaps I have used . I 'd recommend this soap to my friends .
 Caress is my regular bar soap , which I buy for the moisturizing aspect . The Oil of Olay bars were comparable as far as leaving my face soft . I felt that it even rinsed off better , giving my face a cleaner feeling . The fragrance was light and pleasing , too . I 'll buy this product in the future .
 I 've been using my regular brand of soap for over 10 years . I was quite impressed with Oil of Olay . It left my skin feeling soft , smooth , and clean . It was also very gentle on my skin . I 'd recommend it to my friends and would definitely purchase it for my family .
 This soap was great -- not your ordinary soap . Left my skin soft and smooth and almost felt like I 'd put lotion on already . It did n't dry my skin out . It had a really good lather and a wonderful smell . I 'd buy this soap again and would recommend it to a friend .
 I enjoyed Test Driving Oil of Olay bar soap . It had a nice creamy texture and left my skin feeling soft and well moisturized . The soft feeling it left on my skin had an overwhelming advantage over other soaps I 've used in the past . I have two suggestions , however . I 'd have liked it to have a soapier and more bubbly lather . I would 've also liked it to leave a nice after-shower fragrance on my skin . I 'd recommend this product to family and friends .
 You 'll love the smell and the feel of your skin after using this for a week ! What a difference ! I used to use Dove , but I know that I 'm now going to be a devoted Oil of Olay Bath Bar user . They were wonderful !!! It 's amazing ; the texture of my skin feels so much softer , and a lot of the dry patches I 've been fighting for awhile have nearly disappeared completely !
 The first thing you notice when you open a package of Oil of Olay Bath Bars is its mild , yet clean , aromatic scent . The bath bar had a smooth and creamy touch . Lathering was about average and it rinsed clean and quickly . Afterward , I did n't feel any dryness or see any flakiness on my skin as I do with many bath soaps . Yes , I 'd recommend this bath bar to family and friends .
 This perfume use to get me compliments ... so I guess it works . For the money you are paying , this is good choice
 I love this powder . I have used it for years and I believe they discontinued it . What a shame !!!
 I am really tired of buying things I really like and then they are discontinued . I really like revlon age defying powder with botafirm I use number 11 honey beige , I order cool beige and I am mixing my last of my honey beige with it , to see if I get the color I need ... I have a yellow tone to my skin and the honey color and the way this power hides wrinkles is just too great for words , everyone always tells me how nice my skin looks . I am 72yrs but everyone thinks I am 58yrs , why do they take what reallys work out and put powders that do not hold up to the what they are suppost to do ...
 My mom gave me one and I use it sparingly since it is rather expensive . I have acne-prone skin but it 's very sensitive . This stuff really works , my face is free of gunk , it pull stuff out of my pores . It 's pretty soothing though . I have to replace this now as I am getting the bottom of the tube ... wish it were cheaper . Oh well .
 Other than the difficulty of getting the two creams out of the tube , this mask works great on decongested skin . My skin feels a lot smoother after the mask . Great product but I hope Bliss works something out on the packaging .
 I like to use Dove soap at night to help remove my makeup . It gets my skin clean and smooth , without drying it out or over-moisturizing it . The scent is also really light . I find it also gives just the right amount of moisturizing . It is perfect if you have fussy skin that tends to get to dry while still breaking out . Dove moisturizes but also leaves my skin clean enough so I avoid breakouts .
 Dove soaps are wonderful moisturizing soaps this is a staple in my household especially during winter months . It moisturizes dry skin very well and leaves it feeling smooth without the residues that some soaps leave behind.Also it has a nice clean scent that is n't heavy or abrasive . The fact that it comes in so many different types helps as well . My favorite is the original white bar , the nutrium bar with vitamins or the sensitive skin bar.The Dove products really do what they say . I also adore their line of deodorants ! Ca n't beat the price either . Great product at a great price . If you have dry skin give it a try you wo n't be out a lot of money if you do n't like it and if you do like myself and many others you 'll have found a great product deal .
 Dove for Sensitive Skin is incredible . I have very sensitive skin and found this bar to be actually soothing , which never happens with other bars . After drying off , my skin still felt moist , instead of tight and dry . It is a great product .
 For the price , the Dove Sensitive Skin Beauty Bar is a good deal . People with allergies might want to stick to a more anti-allergy specific soap . But if you 're just looking for a regular soap , this bar is good because it does n't leave behind that irritating bar soap smell .
 I 've used regular Dove for years . This had all the good features of normal Dove , but my skin did n't feel dried out as much . As much lather as you 'd expect from a good soap . Bar seems to last as long as my normal Dove . I 'd buy this again !
 I really love this Dove Soap for Sensitive Skin . It is a quarter moisturizing lotion , so really does a great job lubricating your skin while bathing . I tend to have dry skin , so this is a great find . Besides my skin feeling softer and less dry , I also feel clean after bathing with this soap . I love the good clean smell that the soap has . This soap is also hypoallergenic and it wo n't clog my pores . I would definitely purchase this soap and use it for bathing on a regular basis . I would also feel confident in recommending this soap to any friend .
 I have been using another beauty bar up until now , but after using Dove , I will make the switch to make this our household soap . My 5-year-old son 's doctor told me to use Dove on him , not Ivory . He also said that Dove is the purest thing to use on children . It never left my skin dry or oily , only soft and feeling really good . I had all the boys in the house use it and they all loved it .
 I really enjoyed this soap . It really seemed to make a difference in the softness of my skin , which I did n't expect . And it has a really great , fresh smell .
 I love this product ! I live in a very cold climate and the winter wind can really dry out my face and skin . Dove kept my skin soft and not dried out , unlike how other soaps leave it . It is a great all-over soap , and you wo n't need to use a bunch of lotion this winter . I would recommend this product to anyone .
 I used this soap on both my toddler and myself . I liked how easily it created suds . I did n't experience any reaction to it and neither did my daughter , who has more sensitive skin than I do . I prefer the smell of the regular Dove to this one . This one smells very clean , but I still do n't like it . All in all , I really recommend it , especially if you have sensitive skin .
 I just started using this soap after reading online that it is recommended by dermatologists for rosacea sufferers . I bought a two-pack from the store and used it last night ad this morning . I can already see a substantial difference in the way my face appears . Normally , it is really ruddy , and gets worse if I use something with irritants like fragrances . This has nothing that I 'm allergic to . The one thing I do n't like is that can cause flaky dryness , so use a mild moisturizer afterward .
 A great soap . What 's not to like ? Not too much lather , lasts a long time . It has a great smell . My son loves using it . We will definitely buy it again .
 I love Caress . The smell is pleasing and not too strong and it leaves my skin really soft .
 I have extremely dry skin , and the Caress bar really helped ! My skin is much less dry . I 'm actually able to take a shower every day without my skin literally flaking off ! Terrific product , I 'll buy it again .
 I really like the peach Caress Soap . My skin was softer and silky after using this product , and I saw a change after the first time I used it . My skin did n't feel dry like after other soaps I 've used . The wonderful peach fragrance was out of this world . I plan to stock up on this soap and I 'm never going back to my old soap . This soap is great . Try it . You 'll like it .
 I really liked the Caress peach scent . It smells heavenly ! Also , my skin feels so smooth and soft after using it ! It rinses clean and does n't leave me feeling like I still have soap on . I like using it on my face , it does n't irritate my skin like some soaps I 've used in the past . I 'd recommend Caress to anyone .
 I really enjoyed the Caress Moisturizing Body Bars . I liked the way the soap left my skin feeling smooth and was easy to wash off . It did n't seem to dry out my skin , although I probably still would n't use it on my face . It had a pleasant fragrance but did n't really smell like '' `` peach '' '' as the name would imply . I 'd recommend this product to my family and friends
 I was amazed at how this soap left my skin so soft . I loved the rich lather and wonderful peach scent . Caress Soap is a good product , and this is by far the best in their line of soaps . I 'll purchase this product and recommend it to my friends .
 I really like this . It made my body soft and the new scent is just great . Will buy this soap next time . It got my skin clean . But most of all , I loved the smell and softness .
 Overall I liked the peach Caress Bar . I have very sensitive skin and this soap did n't irritate it at all like most other soaps do . It also helped to keep my skin soft . I found this soap to be similar to the Dove Bar , which I normally use . Also , we have hard water and this soap worked well with it . The only thing wrong with the bar was it really did n't smell like peach . However , I did like the smell . It just was n't peach . It smelled more like a regular scented soap .
 The Caress Moisturizing Body Bar , Peach , is very pleasant smelling and works into a very good lather . My skin is very dry and this product seemed to help with that somewhat . It 's nowhere near as dry as what it was . I really did like it and I 'd definitely recommend this to others .
 I love the smell of this soap . I also like the way it made my skin feel . I 've tried other moisturizing soaps but was n't too thrilled with their scent . This has such a nice fresh scent that was n't too flowery . Even my husband liked using it and was n't bothered by the smell . I 'd definitely recommend this soap to anyone looking for a moisturizing soap .
 Definitely contributes to keeping my skin soft -LRB- especially in the winter -RRB- , and it does n't leave my skin sticky after showering . Good lather . I like the fact that it 's not overly scented . I find I go through these bars a bit more quickly than other soaps , but that 's probably due to the creaminess of the product . This is definitely the best body soap in my view .
 ExcellentSmells very goodAffordable deliciousGreat value cologne that smells good and makes you feel good and impresses others .
 I get many compliments with this cologne . It is never overpowering no matter how much you wear . I do not get any biochemical reaction with my skin that would alter the scent like some other cologne 's have done . I have been wearing Cool Water for over 20 years and it is still my favorite of all time unmatched by any other .
 Exactly what it said it was going to be ... ... ... ... . Great product ... ... . . . ...
 I bought it for a friend and had it sent to him . He enjoyed it wonderfully at first but watched it as it started to go too fast ! So now hes reserving it for special moments but goes to show much he really enjoyed it , he likes too much to use it ! HAHA !
 Tired of paying very high prices for make-up remover at your cosmetics counter ? My mother used to use cold cream to remove make-up decades ago but when I went on a search for it at my drug store , I could n't find it . I did find it available online.These are large jars and great value for the money . Plus it is a wonderful moisturizer for your face .
 This product is a great all-purpose face cream to remove makeup , moisturize , cleanse , etc. . I do n't go a day without it .
 I have been using this product for removing stubborn waterproof eye makeup for 40 years . Nothing works better ! Great for dry skin or problem areas . Oh-oh ! Jergen 's no longer makes this product . I just went to their website and this product is no longer listed . What a shame !!
 This has been around for many years and it is multipurpose . It is great for dry skin and eczema . I use it to remove makup and as a cream for my feet and dry rough patches . It also has that timeless nostalgia smell and in lovely pink packaging . According to Jergens , this is on the sales decline and no longer excist on their website . Would love to see it continue .
 So I have recently developed even drier skin than I had in high school and heard some older women raving about this . So I gave it a try and I 'm in love !!! I was worried I was going to get some generic or old thing of face cream because of the different/weird product picture that is shown but the one I received looks exactly like the other pictures for this product !!! My routine is to wash my face at night with the japanese clay bar soapDeitanseki Soap -LRB- Clay and Charcoal Facial Cleansing Bar -RRB- by lathering it in a washcloth and moving it in a circular motion then rinsing . I then moisturize with this amazing cream ! I do n't remove it with a tissue but leave it on over night and it absorbs into the dry patches of my face and it looks amazing ! At first the cream seems odd - kind of greasy and well just different . But I have sinced learned over the past three months to only apply about a nickle size amount over my entire face at night . I then only follow up with small applications in the morning after I shower and pat my face dry on the really dry areas of my face . After using this for months , I am only about 1/4 or 1/5 of the way through the jar which is awesome ! I have n't used this as a remedy for anything else but this is awesome as a moisturizer for dry elbows and knees too .
 I have been using this for years and have found that it makes removing make-up so much easier , especially mascaras .
 I love this stuff ! I have very dry skin , and usually after I apply my moisture cream and make up , it does n't take long , before my skin feels all dry , again ... . I saw this at walmart.com actually and thought I would give it a try . I applied it all over my face and neck , let it soak in a few minutes and then washed it off , with a damp cloth . I also use it at night , now , just massaging some in and leaving it on , all night . it gets soaked into your dry skin completely over night . My face looks so radiant , I 'm amazed , I had some wrinkles start on my forehead and even those are much smoother looking , just from this alone . I used it in the tub , on my face and then washed it off , when I got out of the bath my whole body was so soft , I did n't need to lotion up , from what cream got into the bath water.It is a bit on the greasy side , so if you have oily skin , this is probably not the best thing . I have been using it , now , for a week and had no problems with break outs or anything , just super soft , glowing skin.Takes off waterproof mascara , too ! . I love this stuff , hope they wo n't stop making it . FYI I got a 2 pack at walmart for 6 bucks , so cheaper than this .
 I have used this product for over 20 years . Walgreens quit selling it and it was had to fine across the Mexican border where I use to get it , also . Glad someone is still selling this good product . Fast delivery .
 I stopped by a corner market a few days ago to see if they had the Aloe Vera cream that I liked to use at night and under my makeup . I saw the Jergens cream and read it , and said `` hmmm '' , I do need a makeup cleansing cream and I love Jergens products so I picked it up . I almost left the market and noticed the my Aloe Vera cream was right next to it . Lucky ! I tried it and low and behold , it is absolutely fabulous ! I live in a very high dry climate and because I 'm from the east coast , I 'm not used to trying out products to replenish moisture instead of products that I normally use to eliminate excessive moisture because of high humidity cities . I love it ! I ask that Jergens NOT take this off the market . It seems like everytime I find a product like soap or a body spray mist that is popular and works , it somehow vanishes from the market . I know that this product is a definite winner ! I love it and it definitely moisturizes your face . I do suggest that if you use it to remove makeup to also use a cotton swab and go over any excess moisture with a hydrating toner -LRB- i.e. , L'Oreal hyrating toner , etc. -RRB- afterwards for the best results . Rinse your face with warm water and then use your favorite night time firming cream or vitamin e cream before you go to bed . Your skin will be radiant !
 This old-fashioned cream is inexpensive , but works great . I use it to wash my face and also take off my eye makeup . It is a bit heavy and oily ; so maybe not best for oily skin .
 My mom could no longer get this at her local pharmacy , so she asked me to order online . Amazon had exactly what she wanted at a great price , so ... I checked with her and this is exactly what she 's been using forever -LRB- it seems to me -RRB- . She loves the creaminess and coverage ; I remember that it does an outstanding job removing makeup .
 This is the best cold cream on the market and a 15 oz jar costs only $ 3.99 . It is light , fluffy and very efficient for removing makeup , even eye makeup . It leaves your skin soft and clean . I 've used this cream for years and panicked when I could n't find it at my local variety stores and was told that Jergens no longer makes this product . While the local stores such as Rite-Aid , CVS , Walgreen 's and the like do n't carry this product any longer , you can find it on Amazon -- thank goodness .
 Since we lived in the US many years ago , my wife insists this face cream or none . Now ordering and receiving a shipment half way around the globe is routine . I 'm sure this must cut into the business of our neighborhood drugstores .
 Usually I use the Ponds Cold Cream , or a homemade cold cream . I rarely see the Jergens Face Cream available at the store -LRB- usually Walmart -RRB- and if it is , I buy it . It 's a very good cream . It 's very similar to the Ponds CC and I do n't know if it 's necessarily better , but it is definitely a bit thicker and it 's an excellent cream , it smells great -LRB- somewhat old fashioned -RRB- and there is a lot more in the container than the Ponds.I just wish they would update the packaging . Seriously ...
 A friend initially gave me a bar of this soap and it is tremendous . Since that time , I have tried to find it everywhere and recently came across it on this website . The soap is fragrance-free and is extremely gentle and moisturizing . THis is especially handy in a trial size.I also love the bubbling milk bath and the body butter !
 I love this moisturizer . It smells great and leaves your skin feeling very soft with a refreshing clean fragrance . I am happy to see it on Amazon with such a good deal !
 This lotion is absolutely wonderful . It has such a pleasant smell and goes on smoothly . Not oily . It stays on the skin too . I put it on before I went to bed and my skin was still very moist with the lotion when I woke up . I have tried the body butter as well and that is an excellent product too . My hands get flaky and raw from washing them so often -LRB- bad in winter -RRB- . These were the first creams that took the dryness and flakiess away ! It works very well on dry irritated skin . I did n't have a problem with leaking in delivery like some other reviews . They must have fixed the problem . Thank you Canus and Amazon !
 This lotion is the greatest . It goes on so smooth , is n't oily and I love the scent !
 I am total `` bath person '' and this the by far the Best Body Wash ever . It has a clean crisp smell and leaves your skin soft and smooth .
 I 've used many different lotions , mostly from supermarkets -LRB- HEB -RRB- and department stores -LRB- Wal-Mart -RRB- . I liked some , and even though I loved some , but I do n't believe I knew what good lotion is until I started using this one.I love it.The fragrance may be slightly on the strong side and I agree I 'd like it even more if it 's not as strong , but it really is n't that bad unless you are extremely sensitive to smell.I 've never used the pump one so I dunno , I use the one without the pump . -LRB- You 'll see this review in both items if they both are on amazon -RRB- I was recommended by a friend to use it . He told me how gentle it is to the skin and I just nodded without thinking much of it . One day my hands were feeling extremely dry from the a/c so I asked to try some of that lotion . Gladly he let me do it and as soon as I applied the lotion I realized how little lotion was needed just to moisturize both of my hands , and they seem to spead so evenly and absorbed completely within minutes.My hands felt baby soft , even visually the skin looked different -- healthier , and has a natural looking shine.Best of all , I think it makes my skin look younger!I DO WISH THE PRICING IS LESS PRICY , though .
 Everytime I got out of the shower my arms and legs use to itch non-stop for at least 30 minutes . Normally , I had to put on baby oil , lotion and powder to just help the situation . After using this body wash and lotion , my problems have been solved . Not even high powered lotion with aloe and other stuff had helped , but this is MAGIC !
 packaging is great . . my pump worked great . its good lotion , the smell , its like a soapy fragance . . I enjoy it . .
 I love the Canus Goat 's Milk Products . I have very dry skin and it has been very harsh in the Northeast this winter.The secret savior for my skin has been a daily dollop of this lotion . I agree , I love the fragrance !
 I was introduced to this product by receiving it as a gift . I work in a laundry . My skin -LRB- especially my hands -RRB- are usually very rough and dry . Since I started using the Goat 's Milk Body Lotion , the difference is remarkable . Thanks
 These Q-tips are exactly the same as the brand name q-tips you can buy at the store . I use them for everything - cleaning my toes , my bellybutton , scrubbing the air-vents in my cars , cleaning my nostrils , shining my shoes , and everything else except cleaning my ears because the box specifically states that they are not to be used in the ear canal ! Ca n't go wrong with these . I bought 10 boxes to get a lifetime supply and got free ! shipping ! OMG !
 PRO - its Q-Tips or it looks like a Q-Tips , product as describedCON - can not think so any because its Q-TipsNeed it ? then buy IT ! wont regret it !
 Just kidding , that 's gross.They 're cotton swabs that you stick in your ears , what else can I say ?
 My wife and I have used the Q-tips swabs for many years . There has never been any problem with the way that they work . They do not come apart or unravel under normal usage and this includes using this item as a small paint brush or a cleaning tool for small objects . The Q-tips swab has always worked just fine as they should .
 I am so pissed that my local store sells this for a DOLLAR more than Amazon . I agree that the quality of the stem of the swabs as deteriorated but I use these more than ever because I have discovered that they go great up one 's nose as well as in one 's ears . I 'll never go back to the more frugal but gnarly experience of using my fingers to remove detritus .
 Cleaning my child 's ear is not an easy task . With Q tips I find the durable products are perfect for removing gunk from the ears and keeping my boy fresh !
 I used to get these in costco in 4/5 packs , and it took me FOREVER to finish them . I 'm glad i find this same brand here and i can buy them individually with the same value .
 Wether you need it to clean your ears , your navel or get the makeup off -LRB- amazingly thats what its main use is -RRB- , Q-tips are the way to go . You can use these for what i already said as well as cleaning hard to reach areas in your computer , cleaning your VCR and video tapes -LRB- extreme caution with the tapes -RRB- , and well , pretty much any hard to reach small area . You can usually get these fairly cheap -LRB- dollar tree has a nice 100 pack and the quality is nice -RRB- . So no home should be without these so get yours today .
 The Q-tips cotton swabs seem to have more cotton at the tip than other swabs that I 've used . They did a wonderful job of not falling apart . They never broke in half like other swabs , either . The Q-tips were also terrific at getting into those hard-to-clean areas around the house . The package does a great job of keeping the Q-tips clean until they 're ready to be used .
 I was tickled to test-drive this product . There are many uses for Q-tips . My entire family used these . We used them to clean our ears , our puppy 's ears , and to apply eyeshadow . My daughter used them to paint with -LRB- because she could n't find her paintbrushes -RRB- , to apply antibiotic ointment , and to remove nail polish . I would highly recommend this product to my friends and family . Compared to other cotton swabs , I prefer Q-tips . They seem to be more cottony and absorbent .
 These are as good as ever . What I love about Q-Tips is the way the cotton stays on . Some of the generic brands tend to unravel . These do the job !
 Q-tips have a softer cotton than other similar products I 've tried . Yes , some of the generic products may be a lot cheaper , but a lot of the time you get what you pay for . My family uses Q-tips everyday for various reasons . This product was much softer and sturdier than the generic . Yes I would recommend this to my family and friends . Thanks for the opportunity to try this product . You now have a customer for life .
 Q-tip brand cotton swabs , I have found , are superior to any other brand . I have been purchasing the store brand of cotton swabs for some time , now . After Test Driving Q-tip brand cotton swabs , they 've reminded me of the superb quality of the product . I am glad to have tried these swabs once again and will continue to purchase them in the future .
 I used the Q-Tips and found their quality to be far superior to other brands . When using them for the first time , I noticed that they 're soft , yet spun tightly . They left very little lint , and did n't fall apart or pull away while I was using them , even when wet . I felt the cotton on each end was very absorbent and held more moisture than I would have imagined . The stick was flexible enough , did n't break under pressure , and yet was firm enough to apply pressure without bending when necessary .
 The Q-tips are better than the other brands out there . They have a nice cotton swab that is able to handle many other tasks other than what they are made for . The swabs are soft to the touch so that they are able to handle delicate areas of the face besides the ears .
 Q-tips brand cotton swabs are the best you can buy . The cotton tip is by far the softest in the industry . Unlike other brands , Q-tips have more cotton at the end of each swab . The plastic-box type storage/use package is really nice as well . I would HIGHLY recommend this product to family and friends alike .
 I cant beleive the many purposes of Q-tips ! . Me , a single lonly male , does not have enough money for basic things like food , gasoline , soap , ect . I gots to take what I can gets . So I combine hygene products like q-tips with great food like ear wax ! mmmmm hmmm :-RRB- tastes great less filling !
 There 's a reason why these guys have been around for years . Their quality and price have made them the best value there is for cotton swabs . They do the job , however interesting that that may be , and come back for more . They 're indispensable if you have a baby or young children , but they grow with you into adulthood as well . There 's some things you should n't buy the generic and this is one of them . They 've been around for years and for good reason - they 're great !
 Truly , these q-tips have to be one of the greatest wonders of the 20th century . You just stick it in the ear and dig through , much like the special drilling machines dug their way to make the Chunnelbetween France and England . The tips are soft and the sticks are flexible allowing for extra precision when you ca n't quite reach for the holy of holies . Expereinced users have been known to derive much pleasure out of these tips and even excavated so much cerumen as that it was able to determine their age by the color graduations . They surely are superior to the arms of your eyeglasses ' frame or your trusty old Black & Decker drill . Only trouble is , when your wife will ask you to take out the garbage , set the table or perform one of countless chores that wives want their husbands to do , you wo n't be able to say `` What ?!!!? ... I ca n't hear you '' anymore . So hide these form the old Missus

 Early in my married days we were living , well let 's call it , a low-income life . With a baby on the way I picked up another -LRB- lower-cost -RRB- brand . The sticks were harder and the cotton was n't nearly as puffy and soft.All I can say is that on this item you CAN tell the difference!So in my house we always carry the Q-tips brand of cotton swabs and I must admit we also use a decent -LRB- and soft -RRB- toilet paper as well.Some things just are n't worth skimping on no matter how tight your budget .
 Q-Tips rock . HOWEVER , ... people , beware ! Q-Tips are n't good for your ears , -LRB- really ! -RRB- and is NOT effective in taking out earwax . It actually says so right on the box . This is really true . The Q-Tip pushes the earwax BACK into your canal , covering your eardrum , which makes you feel like your ear is clogged -LRB- which it is -RRB- . The earwax that comes out is really just a stain on the cotton . The actual earwax is more like tiny crumbs . The earwax stain is caused by the smearing of the earwax on your eardrum.What you should do : First of all , the best thing to do is to get used to it . Because the way earwax works , the earwax eventually ends up within pointer-finger range -LRB- meaning , you can just scratch it out without digging -RRB- . Try to get used to having it that way.The Doctors way
 Has anyone ever reviewed Q-Tips before?They 're soft . They 're clean . They have a cardboard stick in the middle you can chew on ... Use them to clean up spills , dab on paint , make little pugil-sticks for your GI Joe and Batman action figures . The fun of a Q-Tip is trying to figure out just what you can use it for .
 If one wants cotton swabs that are made with a hundred percent pure cotton and have more soft cotton at the tip than any other brand , then this is the cotton swab one wants . With five hundred of these little things at one 's disposal , they will last for a considerable length of time.These cotton swabs are ideal for a number of uses . While the most common and popular use consists of sticking it in one 's ears and giving the Q-tip a twirl in an attempt to clean them , one should be mindful that they are not designed to enter one 's ear canal . In fact , the manufacturer cautions the buyer to only gently swab around the outer surface of the ears , if the swabs are used to clean ears.Still , there are many other uses . In my household , these cotton swabs are often used for applying eye shadow , as well . I also used it when polishing furniture . If one has furniture that has carving , which is notorious for attracting dust and dirt in tight spots , dipping these handy , dandy little cotton swabs in lemon oil and then applying the soaked swab to those pesky little nooks and crannies , inherent in any carved piece , will remove that otherwise hard to reach dust , dirt , and grime.Anyway , at this price one should not hesitate to buy these multi-purpose cotton swabs , as they are a good value and guaranteed to give the buyer a lot of bang for one 's buck .
 They are Q tips . What can one say . If you have the means , I highly suggest you pic some up .
 These are n't those crappy q-tips that bend in your ear all quick . Great for its cost and helps get the dirt out your ear !
 I 'm usually a believer that generic usually does good enough . After trying a few generic cotton swab brands , nothing holds up like Q-tip . The cotton stays on the tip and they are softer than the rest .
 It does n't get simpler than this . These are simple cotton swabs that I use to clear around and in my ear after shower . A big box like this will last one person quite a while.A pretty good deal with Subscribe and Save , and they get shipped to my apartment . What 's not to like ?
 Shipping was Quick , packaging as described . After experiencing many generic q-tips we found they were inferior , cotton would fall off , it would bend easily meaning they were n't sturdy we went back to the original & this was A great Deal !
 Sometimes , it 's not whether this brand is so great but how every other brand kinda disappoints . Q-Tips are the number 1 brand for Q-tips :-RRB- ! I have used every other brand , found in countless hotel rooms and even resorts . I love the softness and fullness of the cotton swabs , and this was a pretty good value on Amazon . It is wonderful not to have to go to Target or somewhere else with Amazon offering these types of products online . Thank you !
 They work . Not too big , not to small . Gave them one star above average since they dont hurt like some of the cheaper ones and still they remain cheaper than most . Kind of bummed you cant by them used for cheaper ...
 Good ` ole Q-tips . none of the other brands can quite compare ... I use em for everything from personal hygiene to cleaning small delicate items .
 Seems odd writing a review for these , so I will keep it simple . They are the original . We use their brand name as though it is describing a type product -LRB- see
 what do you say a bout qtips ? good for cleaning your ears ... definitely better than putting a stick in your ear .
 These Q Tips are the bomb yo ! Do n't even play around and act like you aint caring about Q Tippies fo sho . Buy these and then you will = happy . Q Tips for life !
 You know how they say the only thing you should stick in your ear is your elbow ? Well , I have never followed that advice . :--RRB- I use Q-tips to get water out of my ears when I get out of the shower . Other cotton swabs do n't have the cotton as tightly wound and cheaper discount brands have left little strands of the stuff behind - whether in my ears or when using for a craft project or other purpose.Also very handy for cleaning the grooves in your outer ear , Q-tips brand are the most comfortable . I have used other brands , but they feel like you 're dragging a tree branch around your outer-ear , not smooth cotton.Good for cleaning your dog 's or cat 's ears as well -LRB- just do n't put them in too far ! -RRB- - and just a good product for about a million uses . I 've even used them to get shoe polish into hard-to-reach groves in dress shoes - and Q-tips brand does n't leave fiber strands behind like the others do !
 Q-tips are the best ! I use them for my little ones , for makeup , for nail polish fixes -- even for cleaning out my sewing machine ! Oh yeah , and I clean my ears with them as well . Q-tips are the softest swabs I 've ever used . They 're especially great because the cotton never pulls away from the swab . I would n't dream of using another brand .
 I have always used generic or store brand swabs , and never realized how great Q-tips are . I 've used them for eye makeup -LRB- to put on and take off -RRB- , as well as to remove nail polish . They are great for everything . I 'll never use another brand of swabs again . They really are a great product .
 Here in Skunk Holler , the wind does blow . And when the wind blows , dirt , dust , grime , and other unpleasantries become airborn ; inevitably , on a windy day , I often feel like half an acre of dust has been deposited in my ears . That 's why I always -LRB- count 'em , always -RRB- have an ample supply of the ever-ubiquitous Q-TIPS COTTON SWABS.I know , I know
 a national icon and treasure . what more can I say . Accept no substitute.you ca n't go wrong when a proper noun becomes a common noun .
 nothing to complain about , the price , the quality and the quantity . just buy it , if you need a lot of cotton swabs
 What can you say about q-tips ? I had two amazon gift cards and could n't think of anything to buy at the same so got these for free .
 My friend introduced me to this serum years ago . It 's amazing ! And it does n't smell , like some of their other products . The price is a bit steep but it keeps my face wrinkle-free . So to me , it 's worth the price !
 These Caudalie products are the best skin care I have ever used . I have sensitive skin and these products work their magic and leave my skin looking great .
 I have used a different Sauve Anti Wrinkle cream in the past and then it went off the shelf for 2 or 3 years , I was so excited to see it for sale again . I use it every day and have noticed a difference in my appearence.I will continue to purchase it .
 thank you so much ! fiorucci i love you has been discontinued and sold out everywhere for ages ! i am so lucky to have found it on your website . it was in perfect , new condition , and smells just like it always has ! thanks again !
 It smells great & long lasting.I have a hard time believing it has that pheromones in it . I say `` Marketing Tool !! '' I boughtit because of the good smell . It 's long lasting too .
 This stuff drives my wife crazy ... She wo n't stay off me when I wear it ... Highly recommend it ... Brian
 I bought this cologne at a local mall about 8 years ago and I really liked the smell . I had no idea that it had Pheromones in it . I tried to find it in the shopping malls again but no one carried it anymore . I recently found it when I was walking near some shops out at fisherman 's wharf in San Francisco near pier 39 . I saw it displayed and I had to buy it.My fiance loves it and knew about it having those Pheromones in it .
 my hair is thick and long but it makes it flip on the ends with little or no product . my curls stay until i shampoo !
 Becareful it gets sticky ! But it does work really well . i use it after a manicure to keep the nail polish lasting longer . i hand wash most of my clothes that are delicate and washing dishes all the time and i must say the Brush on Glue keeps the nail color from peeling off too soon . will buy again .
 I do like the bigger size , it last much longer , and holds pretty good , . 5oz is a good size to get , it helps save on money . and if you take care of your nails , you wont have to buy any nail glue for a while .
 I use this with fiberglass wrap to strengthen my nails for guitar playing . It 's easy to apply , and it dries fast , hard and clear . It 's the best I 've found .
 nessessary item.well this goes with the territory of nails . handy for alot other things for scrapbooking jewlry . but i like it to fix a torn nail .
 I think this is the BEST glue . I order 2 at a time to pay one shipping cost , but review it as you check out as that can change . I find the brand of nails you buy makes a difference as well - some adhere poorly and are so very thin , they chip off in chunks . If this glue did not work for you , try a different nail . I am wearing Kiss brand today , but I have also used them on self adhesive - used glue anyways , worked great ! If nail is going on sloshy from the get go , the nail glue and the nail are not compatible . I buy the flat pack from Kiss , which have regular and flatter nails in the box . I use some of each . I also only go with shorter nails , as few are available in the flat , I file them after the glue is solid . I also use my bondini for any super glue needs , it comes in brush on so you so not get the clogged tip of the squeeze on . Plastics are not ALL compatible , I think tht is the problem with the3 other reviews . I LOVE this glue - well worth my purchase . I do wish they had an option for Amazon Prime - the shipping club , but I have not found one that does it . Amazon Prime is free shipping for a set fee annually and when you add the price of the product with the shipping on the competing vendors , the Prime is always cheaper . I order a ton on Amazon , so I highly recommend the prime member ship as well . good luck ! This is worth a few misses , those pretty hands and nails are very economical if you have a good source of supply . I found my kiss nails on Amazon as well - they have a regular pack , a flat - regular pack and an extra curve pack . most of them are all the french manicure , but you can always paint over them for a change . I have bought some decorative nails here too ... I bought some polka dotted ones - they sloshed as they went on , not a good sign and then they broke in chips off the nail . If you are trying something new , may want to buy one to check quality of nail . The polka dotted ones were cute , but so thin , the chipping was really bad . Try this bondini !
 I applied this to full cover nails about 3 days ago and the nails are still holding strong ... very pleased and it came with fast shipping will order again good product
 This is the best brush on nail glue . I do my own nails and this is the best . They used to sell it at Sally 's , but unfortunely I was told they discontinued it . Luckily I found it here .
 Tried a lot of different types of `` super glue '' since I use it in hobby stuff as well as gluing splits , small cuts , or hangnails on my fingers when they become dry and crack during winter or when using strong soaps or solvents , or during winter.This is the ONLY one on which the top stays free enough of residue that it is always pretty easy to open , and it lasts far longer without thickening up like other super glues . My take , from years of using and doing development work with very similar plastics , is that there is far more glue , and far less acrylic , than all the other products.I keep a bottle in the medicine cabinet , another on my workbench , and one in my traveling case for trips.Tip
 and I 've used them all . But , if you apply it on top of nail polish , it will be difficult to remove the polish -- it adheres that well .
 Excellent glue , stays easy to open and does a great job . Less smell than most of the other ones I have tried .
 I too have been looking for this glue since Sally 's discontinued it ... it 's the best . I still do n't understand why Sally 's quit carrying it . I 'm so glad I found it here .
 Have tried all of the rest and they pale in comparison . Lately BONDINI is hard to find in many of the stores . So I was delighted to find it on Amazon . You will feel secure using this for your nails .
 This glue is the max . Makes everything else pale . I can not understand why Sally 's stopped carrying it . You will love it !
 I did n't know abont this glue untill I visited Amazon.I would recomend it to any one . it is very good and I will let my friends know about it . Thanks Gladys .
 This is exactly what I needed ! I needed glue that would not dry out over time . This stays nice and fluid . The glue is very strong and gets the job done well .
 I so so so love this glue right here its my second purchase and i stand by this glue i use it to glue my nail tips and rhinestones it holds great
 I have seriously sensitive skin , and I also am a tyrant when it comes to protecting my face from UV rays . I recently started using this product because of its price and because Oil Of Olays products are usually spot on when it comes to performance.Its been two weeks , and I absolutely love it . Light on fragrance , smooth as silk , spreads well and absorbs quickly . It doesnt interfere with my powdered mineral makeup in the slightest and It doesnt irritate my skin one bit . I would put it equal to the Korres wild rose moisturizer I ususually use when I am not so broke .
 I like this product and alternate some days using this as my day cream with foundation and serious skn care vitamin C skin day cream . Both are good with an SPF in them . It 's inexpensive a good .
 a good item . But it has a short using date . It will be expired soon . So you must use it up as soon as possible .
 For several years now I 've been fighting acne , the products that have helped me proactive , but the unfortunate part of using these products `` dry skin '' starts to appear and I also noticed my skin was n't looking healthy , so I decide to change it up and start using Olay complete moisture cream and I tell you within a week my skin has been looking healthy and acne has been under-control . And skeptic just give this cream a try it can improve your skin for the better . I will be trying out the night cream soon .
 I really liked the way this product made my skin feel after I used it for a while . The winter can be so hard on my skin , and this product seemed to help with dryness and flaking .
 I absolutely loved this product . I use to use the facial cream but it got to where the smell bothered me . I really miss it a lot . I 'm glad I tried the soap though . It hardly has an odor and does wonders for my face . I have not used soap on my face in years . I 'll be buying this product for myself on a regular basis . Thanks for offering it on your test-drive . I never would have tried it otherwise .
 This soap had a nice scent . It also had a nice amount of lather that helped to scrub away the dirt and grime from under my fingernails . I also liked that it did n't irritate my skin like other cleansing products do . I would definitely recommend this product to my family and friends .
 In the wintertime , dry , itchy skin is a particular problem for me so I was quite pleased with this product . It cleans and softens my skin without drying it . Its gentle , unscented formula is good for the whole family . I would recommend this product to my friends , particularly those who suffer from dry skin or allergies to scented soaps .
 Even though the soap is '' `` unscented '' '' , it has a very light , feminine scent that I liked very much . I do not usually use a bath bar on my face because my facial skin is very sensitive , especially around my eyes . However , this soap did not dry out my skin at all . It rinsed well and did not leave a residue like many moisturizing soaps do . A very nice product that I would recommend to anyone with sensitive skin .
 I would recommend this product to friends and family . It 's a great product from a well-known company . It left me feeling very clean , with soft skin . The scent was refreshing , and not overpowering . I am a regular user of Ivory because of my sensitive skin , and this product is a nice alternative .
 The Oil of Olay Sensitive Skin Bar has helped my skin tremendously . The soap lathers nicely and has no perfumes . I would recommend this product to anyone who 's looking for a light soap for sensitive skin .
 I loved this Oil of Olay Bath Bar for Sensitive Skin . I have dry , sensitive skin . Not only did this soap NOT sting or hurt , it felt good . When I finished using it , my skin felt soft and moisturized . My daughter just had a baby , and this soap did n't even irritate her stitches ! I am definitely going to recommend this product to friends and family . Now I 'll know which soap I 'll be buying in the future !
 I just got out of the shower after using this soap . I notice how especially soft and smooth my skin feels . I especially like that it 's unscented and does n't fight with my other scents . I think the best feature of this soap is that it does n't feel slimy in the shower and even though it lathers beautifully , it washes off quickly without leaving a coated feeling on my skin like other similar products do . I would definitely buy this soap !
 Oil of Olay Sensitive Skin Bath Bar works for people who are allergic to soap .
 I have very sensitive skin , so I was worried about trying a new product . But this was great . It did n't have a scent and it was very gentle on my skin . I would definitely buy this soap !
 The Oil of Olay Sensitive Skin Bath Bar is wonderful ! The lather is rich and thick . I felt very clean , yet my skin did not feel as dry as it does when I use a regular soap . It certainly does n't eliminate dry skin , but it softens your skin a bit and does n't irritate like other soaps can . I would definitely buy this product again .
 In general , I am a boutique soap user -- I buy soaps that are made with natural ingredients and scents . When I do buy drugstore or grocery store soap , I buy Ivory . So I was pleasantly surprised by the Oil of Olay Sensitive Skin Bath Bar . When I first opened the package , the soap seemed slightly scented . However , that quickly faded . This is a plus in my opinion . I like to smell like myself rather than like soap or deodorants . The Oil of Olay washed away cleanly , without leaving my skin feeling greasy , dry , or deodorized . I 'd have to give this product a soapy thumbs up !
 Overall , I think that this is a good product . It 's gentle , moisturizing and has no fragrance -LRB- although I think a little bit of refreshing fragrance in the soap would be nice -RRB- . It lathers well and cleans without stripping out natural oils . Since I do n't have very dry skin , I would alternate this soap with one that gives me a '' `` squeaky-clean '' '' feel .
 I have not used a bath bar in years because they dried out my skin . This bar did not . It had a light pleasant fragrance , but was not overpowering . It also left my skin soft , not dry and bumpy like it is after I use regular bar soap . This is the only bar soap that I would recommend .
 Had this travel shaver for about a month . I have a light beard and it does a good job , much better that the Panasonic rechargeable I had . It is compact and I do n't have to lug around a charger , which was always annoying to me . I ca n't say how long the batteries will last , but I think I will get 30 shaves on a set . Very convenient for travel as I can throw it in my toiletries kit , no case needed as the cap is secure . Does not have a trimmer , which some might find a drawback . Have n't seen anything out there that I believe would work better , especially at this price .
 This little shaver is very cool and does a great job anywhere and anytime . It would be even better if it came with a travel case .
 this is a durable close shaver that seems like it will last a while . i got one for home also , as the nimh batteries last a while , and i normally keep some charged up anyway.i have used these for about a year without problems .
 I bought this shaver specifically for travel . It does an excellent job , comparing well to a triple head Norelco that I 've been using for many years . My beard is fairly light and it does provide a close shave albiet , taking a bit longer to shave.I had been using a another Norelco travel shaver , but it just was n't doing the job anymore and I 'd been unable to find replacement blades . I also think that the cutters are much better than those on the older model -LRB- They are the same as on my triple header -RRB- . When I decided to get a new travel shaver , I originally went for the Braun because of its high ratings . As far as I 'm concerned it was money wasted . It would not pick up fine hairs and it took about three times as long to shave as does the 31db . It also did not provide a very close shave . I wish that the Braun had the same satisfaction guarantee as the Schick Norelco .
 I was so happy to find this product on-line as I have been unable to find it in any store . I have used this particular spray for many years and love it because it holds my hair , but without a `` stiffness '' that other sprays have . The stores carry the Finesse in a `` stronger '' hold , but not this lighter one .
 I have used this for about a year now . My beard has a variation of blondand brown and a bit of gray here and there . Works perfect and lasts for afew weeks . I can get 2 uses out of one kit . I recommend it . Oh and yes.USE THE GLOVE ! If you get any on your fingernails it will dye them as welland wont go away until your nail grows out . Yes , do n't ask how I knowthis ... ; -RRB-
 Sorry to read that so many have experienced such severe skin reactions after using this product . I 'm very allergy prone and have very sensitive skin that often reacts severely to sunscreens , shaving creams , etc. , but have been using this product on my beard and sideburns 2x/week for many years witout any indication of sensitivity . Find that careful , sparing application and exact timing produce a really natural look in a very short time . Here a few things that I have found helpful
 I 've been using this product for years , both the old formula and the new , with no problems . The new formula , which by now is pretty old , smells much better.There is an insert with clearly written instructions and cautions - read and follow them.What I like about this product is that it does n't turn your beard into some unicolor as if it was smeared with boot polish . I leave it on for four minutes which turns my beard from blotchy black/grey to salt & pepper , so it looks pretty much like the hair on my noggin .
 Sure amazes me how many guys do n't do as the directions say and ` test in one area to determine ... ' -LRB- etc. -RRB- . Of course some will be allergic to it - it has chemicals in it . Every woman that 's ever colored her hair knows that some chemicals work better than others and some she simply ca n't use . This product has been a stand-by for me , as I said in the title , for years . I 'm 50 and have a very gray beard/mustache but still fairly dark hair and I do n't want to have that much contrast . Just-For-Men M45 has worked flawlessly - as long as I followed the directions , mix exact portions , do n't leave it on more than 5 minutes , wash off and shampoo or soap the beard , etc. . You know - followed the directions we guys do n't like to read ! Go figure . Does it sometimes irritate my skin a little ? Yeah , but it 's not a big deal for me . I understand it is for some - use something else or go natural . Maybe your skin ca n't handle any chemicals.I keep a neat , trim beard and get about 4 applications out of each box - your mileage may vary depending on a lot of factors.Good luck gents .
 Very good product . Works well , just DO N'T leave on nearly as long as they say , you can always re-apply if needed . . DO use a shade lighter or it looks a bit aggressive ... I needed to use a product to remove/tone down the color ... Alls well that ends well , but if I had adhered to label `` admonishment '' ... Other than that , enjoy looking 10 years younger ...
 Use it every few weeks on my goatee to keep the sands of time at bay . Good price here compared to local stores . I need to stock up on more of this again soon !
 I have been using this product for many years , and it really is the best . I am a champ at it , and it takes so little time to achieve the results I am looking for . Very easy to mix the two ingredients and brush them on ... what a winner !!!
 just what i needed ... . fast delivery ... lived up to the reviews , and im glad i purchased this one ... very good price !!!! you ca n't go wrong with this product .
 I do n't know why Amazon thinks I purchase this product , my beard color is natural.PROS : Good color matchProvides more youthful appearanceEasy to applyCONS : Mildly irritates skin for a day or two
 This product is easy to use and works well . I like the control the viscosity of the mixture affords and use it not just on my beard but on my sideburns as well . The color could last a little longer but the method of application makes it easy to redo as necessary and there are several applications per box.I 've never experienced the ill effects which the negative commenters mentioned but then I am also very careful when using the dye medium brushing it lightly onto the hair while avoiding contact with the skin as it dyes skin quickly and is tough to remove . A little hand soap dabbed on areas of affected skin instantly stops the dye .
 mix a small amount brush it in i dont let it set for the 5 min only about 3 that way you have some gray in there looks more natural . . lol ...
 Have used this for several years with no problems , some are allergic to the chemicals , and as JFM tells you , test it first.But , for me it has always worked well .
 One thing about being blonde is that the carpet does match the drapes , at least in my case . I have always had light pubic hair , which matches the rest of my body hair . Not a bad look if you like it . However , I have always admired the look of dark pubic hair on other men in the locker room and have always wanted to have that look for myself . After trying this product , I have definitely found the look that I 've always wanted . I 'm in my early 30 's and have been using this product for almost a year now with incredible results.All you do is brush in the 2 part gel , let set , rinse out with warm water , then wash the area with soap as normal . For a darker brown , I usually leave the application on for a total of 8-10 minutes -LRB- the instructions recommend 5 -RRB- . The color lasts a while but does begin to fade at around 6 weeks . I usually reapply after 4 weeks to maintain a my ideal look . There is enough gel for multiple applications , usually around 3-4 total , depending on how much hair you have to cover.This is a great product despite the many people who experience an allergic reaction to hair dye products . If you do experience a severe reaction , stop using the product . If you do not experience a reaction , you 'll love the result . If you have always wanted darker pubic hair or if you have started to go gray , give this product a try . You wo n't be disappointed !
 This cologne is a truly wonderful scent ; far too many times we see colognes that all smell the same ; that overbearing musky scent that men think will make them feel better about themselves , when in reality , all its doing is making them just like everybody else . For the modern , daring , and individual man , Beyond Paradise truly quenches our thirst for something different . With its gentile , sweet , yet piercing aroma it takes a person gently into your true spirit to see what your really made of . Its the perfect scent to wear on a beautiful vacation somewhere far away from our conforming societies , with the wind blowing through your hair and the sun setting in a magnificent orange tone ... with the woman you love . the fantasy one will experience with this scent will indeed take us beyond paradise itself.I highly reccommend : -RRB-
 This was so easy . I just placed the order and within a week , the product was delivered to my door . No going out and fighting the crowds at the stores . The product looked just like if I had bought it in a store . Will definitely use this avenue again .
 I am still unsure of why they discontinued this fragrance , because I absolutely love it and receive many compliments on it . I recently learned that my best friend -LRB- we live far apart -RRB- wears it as well . I will keep buying this delicious vanilla-esque scent until I can not find it any longer . It 's nice to find it for less than retail .
 Thanks it was as the saker said new in box I would by again from saler and got it fast thanks a lot
 Product came in a timely fashion and was exactly what I ordered . I would do business with them again .
 I love this product so it 's great . The longer you leave it in your hair , the better you hair looks and feels . It is concentrated so you do n't have to use that much .
 A few years ago my hair was so burned by a perm that I had to go buy some wigs . A salon recommended this conditioner and it did help nurture my hair back to health . Had n't used it since then , but now that I live in the desert , I decided to try some again . Although I think it is a bit overpriced , it is very good conditioner for dry , fine hair such as mine .
 I have been using this on and off for over 5 years , i am a little bit of a hair product junkie . I always come back to this one ! I do think you should dry your hair a little before using and try to leave it in as long as possible : -RRB-
 I love this product and it came with a mirror -LRB- as a gift from the seller -RRB- . Quite q surprise , actually . The creme itself is almost magic .
 I first tried this hair product about 10 years ago and have n't used anything else until moving to the States . Since L'Oreal products are more expensive here , I decided to switch to something else that does n't cost as much . I tried dozens of different products and nothing worked for me as well as this hair masque.My hair is colored , plus I blow dry it and style it everyday . The L'Oreal professional is the only brand that keeps my hair super silky , shiny and manageable no matter what . It is a little expensive as I already mentioned , but worth every penny . Highly recommended !
 I use this as a daily conditioner on my very fine wavy hair and it works great for me ! It 's very concentrated , so you do n't need to use to much .
 Love this product - I previously purchased from my hairdresser but it 's a better bargain on Amazon . The longer you leave it it the better you hair looks and feels .
 I have thin color treated hair and have always battled with split ends . This product has dramatically changed my hair for the better without weighing it down ! I absolutely love this product line ! It is concentrated so you do not have to use that much making it well worth the price !
 This product is magic for your hair . It smells incredible , makes your hair feel so healthy , and it really is a good deal . I totally recommend this hair masque !
 This is the best conditioner I have used ! And I feel like I 've used them all . A friend turned me on to this line of products , and now I ca n't get enough !
 The mask was my first introduction to the L'Oreal Prefessional line and it got me hooked ! The jar itself is a good size even though it 's not huge but it has lasted me for a while now . This works really well when used once a week with a clarifying shampoo - I prefer the Neutrogena one - or with the matching moisturizing shampoo if the hair is very damaged . The mask is marvelous , it nourishes and keeps the hair moist and it makes the hair very soft - almost as if it 's still wet and it has that lush quality to it ; this product helps to keep it manageable and silky . I find that after using this for two months now my hair feels very slippery on the days when I apply it , sometimes I ca n't even have it up , it just unravels from any hair do unless I pin it down and use hair spray . The more I used it the better the results.I also adore the matching shampoo and conditioner because they really added a lot of moisture to the hair shaft . . I highly recommend this for anyone who needs a quality deep treatment for their thirsty hair.Amazon has n't carried this before and I am thrilled to find it here , in the stores I have never seen it for less then $ 37.00 which is what I paid for it , well not anymore
 I am hard on my hair like so many other women . I have spent so much money over the years on hair care products . When my hair stylist introduced me to the professional Loreal line I could n't believe how wonderful my hair felt and behaved . There is nothing out in the market place to compare . Their Professional line of shampoos , conditioners and other products our excellent ! I believe they are also a great value as well .
 This is the only conditioner I have found that tames the frizz in my hair , but does n't leave it flat like some of the other `` straightening '' conditioners . I love it and highly recommend it if you have semi-wavy hair prone to frizz .
 Since using the L'Oreal absolut repair masque , I 've gotten many compliments on my hair texture . It turns dry , coarse hair into smooth , healthy hair . It is especially beneficial to apply in the winter when hair becomes very dry . As you get older and color your hair more often , a product like absolut repair is necessary . It is a bit pricey , but well worth the cost .
 I 've been using this product for several years now and love it . I have tired other conditioners but keep coming back to this one since it definitely helps the frizziness that comes from coloring your hair ! My hair is very fine and it still works great !
 Absolut Repair Masque is awesome ! I used it last night along with the shampoo . Hair is soft and has a nice sheen . Great relief from my usually very dry hair . Recommend this for all African-American women with relaxers . Its worth is girls !
 Wonderful , wonderful stuff ! I have extremely dry and frizzy hair . So that you understand how dry , I did n't wash it for two weeks -LRB- once a week is my normal time -RRB- before I used L'Oreal Professional Series Expert Absolut Repair Neofibrine Repairing Shampoo for Very Damaged Hair for the first time . After two weeks , my hair was starting to get some oil in it but not enough that it looked or felt dirty . It was finally controllable after about a week and a half . When I used the shampoo , I immediately felt a difference . My hair felt softer than it normally does with other shampoos . It felt like I was conditioning it . I washed my hair twice and used the L'Oreal Professional Series Expert Absolut Repair Conditioner , rinsing it out immediately . Then I put on the L'Oreal Professional Series Expert Absolut Repair Masque and left it on while I finished showering about 10 minutes or so . I did put in a little leave-in conditioner I regularly use as well . I was going to put a chemical straightener on it after I used this shampoo but it was so soft and shiny , especially compared to normal , that I changed my mind and will use this shampoo and conditioners a few more times before I decide to use the straightener . A chemical straightener will take the frizz out and comes with such rich conditioners that your hair is soft and manageable and you do n't even have to use a flat iron with it . But , this shampoo and the conditioners are almost as good as a straightener without the chemicals . The new girl at work today said , `` Your hair looks different . What did you do to it ? '' . It was these products that I used for the first time yesterday . This is a real review by a real individual who has absolutely nothing to do with Loreal . I plan to post this same review for all three products . Everyone 's hair is different and what works for me may not be the thing for you but you will not know unless you try it .
 I have really thick hair and have a hard time with conditioners . But this one is awesome . It 's really thickens creamy butdoesnt weigh your hair down later . Love it !!
 Patiently awaited my new conditioner and it came on time ! Love this product . It 's a little pricey but only for the best !
 Bought this product for my wife , who first purchased the product from a salon . It arrived quickly and is the same high quality hair product but for 40 % less and without tax .
 I use this masque as a daily conditioner . It works wonders on my seriously over stressed hair !! Also because loreal makes kerastase , you know your getting a top notch product !
 My hair has become very dry from coloring and alot of sun exposure . My stylist recommeded this product , but I did not want to purchase at higher salon prices . I was happy to find it for this lower price at Amazon . It seems to really be working well . My hair feels very silky , much softer , and more managable after using the masque . I keep it in longer than a few minutes as well . I still wish it did n't cost as much as it did , but I guess if it continues to keep my hair healthy , it will be worth it .
 Great product for those with color treated hair . It repairs the ends and is a great deep conditioner .
 I got coerced by my hairdresser into buying this product and the repairing shampoo -LRB- which he insisted had to be used together -RRB- and I have been extremely impressed with the results . I damaged my hair by bleaching it and it was a big ole hot mess before using this deep conditioner . After I use it , which I do about 1-3 times a week , my hair always feels amazing and soft and looks and smells great . I have no complaints about the product itself , but I find the price ridiculous . This is the first deep conditioner I 've used so I ca n't really compare it to other , cheaper products . Considering you only need to use a small amount of product per use , I 'm pretty confident this jar will last me at LEAST 6 months of regular use . However , I ca n't say that I am likely to spend $ 30 again once I run out . So , if you do n't mind the price , I would highly recommend it . Otherwise , keep searching .
 I absolutely recommend this mask . I do n't know of a more efficient mask as a post chemical hair care . I recommend the shampoo and the Thermo repair as well .
 This product is the same quality as the one I have purchased at my local salon , only it was $ 11 cheaper . It smells great and adds a nice softness to my coarse Asian hair . I can feel a difference when I condition with this product .
 Due to a medical problem ... my hair broke off ... this stuff has restored and strengthened my hair . . :-RRB- try it you 'll love it !
 This works very well for my hair and my hair does n't get &#34; tired &#34; of it or causes any build-up . I use it daily .
 My wife is using it and it is perfectly fine , she has sensitive skin and has no problem about it .
 This product is perfect for my hair , it makes it shine , softness and volume ... 5 stars for it.For me Loreal is the best .
 This is great ! I absolutely love it . It truly repairs your hair ! Hair is soft and shiny ! I hope this product is ALWAYS available !
 Overall , the product is satisfactory . The delivery is very fast though the hurricane Sandy met here . The smell is good , and my hair is smoothy and soft after using it . I like the product .
 Leaves my hair silky and I can blow dry it straight without much effort . Does n't have too much more than a slight pleasant smell -LRB- I hate it when hair products smell strongly -RRB- and I think my hair looks a lot healthier since I 've been using it . My hairdresser even noticed . I use in conjunction with either the matching shampoo or the `` clear '' shampoo in this same line .
 This conditioner really says what says it does . My hair is soft , shiny , and manageable . Silky clean & beautiful . You only need a little bit to get the max results . Yes , I will be buying this product again .
 I have medium long hair that is colored every 6-7 weeks for the past 10 years . For regular maintenance , I use joico k-pak and that has kept my hair especially healthy and soft looking . For some reason , after my last coloring , my hair became really brittle , dry and frizzy looking at the ends and even the joico k-pak could n't fix it . So I tried L'oreal , because I used their coloring packages before and they contain a really great working conditioner . I tried this product after doing some searching , tried it out and wow , my hair looks beautiful and healthy again . Great stuff . At least for my hair . I am going to continue using this for extra conditioning every 2 weeks . I 've noticed that people love to touch my hair now because it looks so soft and bouncy : -RRB-
 This stuff really is like gold and it 's the only thing that gets my hair smooth and shiny and healthier after I 've had it colored . It literally nursed my hair back to health after a terrible perm ! I would strongly recommend this to anyone and everyone !
 I have dry hair naturally - and it is colored to boot.So I use this product once a week overnight -LRB- applying a good dollop to clean damp hair , and sleep with shower cap - rinse out in morning -RRB- . My stylist recommended doing this to strengthen my dry hair shafts and keep them moisturized with an extended treatment.For someone with dry hair , it works wonders ! Absolut Repair smells rich , makes my hair slicker and shinier , and even gives it a bit of body the next day upon blowdrying.I as well am glad to be able to find it on Amazon for less than exorbitant salon prices !
 I already knew the range of products and are very good.good price for the quantity . I am very pleased .
 I loved everything that Loreal Professional make . I liked the smell , the quality of the product ... I recommend to everyone .
 Salon used this on my hair 2 yrs ago to repair damage from perm n coloring to my hair n it works . So i use it twice a wk to maintain
 This item is not in any of the stores in my city . I went straight to Amazon.com . I ordered this item through Amazon.com . It arrived in a timely manner . Miss Ella
 I love Joop , I have always received compliments on how good I smell while wearing it . It has spicey amber notes to me . Want to get noticed , try a blast of Joop .
 I bought this Cologne for my husband . It 's been around for a long time , but it smells so good on him . It 's an oldey but a goodey.When he puts it on it makes me want to just kiss him all over . This is for the grown and sexy men only.Lol Lol LOl !!!!!!!
 This stuff smells great , one of my favorites . The deo version is not quite as potent as the Eau De Toiletseat , but it has the same qualtites . Quite a bit less expensive than the Eau De Toiletseat and still smells great . If you like JOOP !!!!!!!!!!!!!! you will find this just as pleasant , just a bit milder . Not wilder , but milder . JOOP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 I have been a working stylist for 40 years , since switching to the Solis dryer , I get an average of ten years performance out of this dryer . The turbo and cold shot buttons leave controls right under your fingertips . Sturdy , wont break if it gets dropped , and the heat element is a workhorse . A little heavier than most popular dryers , but then again , try and get ten years service out of any other brand , it wont happen . Great service , they will repair for me , even after ten years , but I just buy a new one and keep `` old faithful '' as a backup . So far , I have never needed `` backup '' I still have my dryer from 1994 , 2004 -LRB- just retired with this purchase -RRB- and both still work , just not as hot or quiet as the new guy .
 I 'm very pleased with product . It arrived within expected arrival date . No damage to product , and was just what I expected . Love it !
 I was so glad to have it . This is the best sent ever for me with my algeries . Its a clean sent . I wish I could get more .
 I love this product . I have very flat hair and this is the only product that will give me volume without making my hair greasy - at all ! I love the smell of it too . It 's the only volumizer that truly works for me !
 This product is awesome . It hydrates my hair and makes it very soft . I have damaged hair from highlighting and hairspray . With L'Oreal Professional , it restores my hair to become healthy again . I 've tried Matrix , Redken , and other great products , but this one is the best . If you want to hydrate your hair more , you should try the LOreal Professional Intense Repair . It comes in a yellow bottle and it 's more expensive , but it 's worth it . The L'Oreal Professional Series are the best hair products I 've ever tried . Definatly try L'Oreal Professional Series because it 's not like the usual over the counter L'Oreal products . You can only buy it in certain salons and online . It 's made my hair shiny and smooth and I 'll never switch hair products again .
 My stylist recommend the Absolut Repair products after my hair was extremely damaged from coloring and hot styling . Within a few weeks the condition of my hair was already improving and within a few months , along with regular trims , my hair was back to its healthy state . I would highly recommend this product for anyone with extemely damaged hair due to styling or coloring .
 This product is absolutly the BEST shampoo and conditioner for damaged , overtreated hair ! I have tried sooooo many hair remedies that would help give the luster and shine back to my hair as well as the softness even while I continue to color it and this product hands down wins bar far .
 Wonderful , wonderful stuff ! I have extremely dry and frizzy hair . So that you understand how dry , I did n't wash it for two weeks -LRB- once a week is my normal time -RRB- before I used L'Oreal Professional Series Expert Absolut Repair Neofibrine Repairing Shampoo for Very Damaged Hair for the first time . After two weeks , my hair was starting to get some oil in it but not enough that it looked or felt dirty . It was finally controllable after about a week and a half . When I used the shampoo , I immediately felt a difference . My hair felt softer than it normally does with other shampoos . It felt like I was conditioning it . I washed my hair twice and used the L'Oreal Professional Series Expert Absolut Repair Conditioner , rinsing it out immediately . Then I put on the L'Oreal Professional Series Expert Absolut Repair Masque and left it on while I finished showering about 10 minutes or so . I did put in a little leave-in conditioner I regularly use as well . I was going to put a chemical straightener on it after I used this shampoo but it was so soft and shiny , especially compared to normal , that I changed my mind and will use this shampoo and conditioners a few more times before I decide to use the straightener . A chemical straightener will take the frizz out and comes with such rich conditioners that your hair is soft and manageable and you do n't even have to use a flat iron with it . But , this shampoo and the conditioners are almost as good as a straightener without the chemicals . The new girl at work today said , `` Your hair looks different . What did you do to it ? '' . It was these products that I used for the first time yesterday . This is a real review by a real individual who has absolutely nothing to do with Loreal . I plan to post this same review for all three products . Everyone 's hair is different and what works for me may not be the thing for you but you will not know unless you try it .
 When I first received my 5 oz bottle , I was disappointed and thinking this stuff will last me about a week ! But I found I only had to use a fraction of the amount I had been using with my old conditioner to get amazing results . A small amount will go a long way for my over colored dry hair . Love this stuff .
 I 've been using this product withL ` Oreal Professional Series Expert Absolut Repair Shampoo , 8.45-Ounce Bottlefor over one year and I 'm very satisfied with them . Since my sister and my girl friend are very sensitive to their hair condition , they always wanted to try many products then gave THAT many leftovers to me :-LRB- . For more than three years , this situation make me try most of hair products which you can find easily in the market . Of them , this product was the best for hydrating my hair .
 This works wonders on very dry and/or damaged hair . May also be good for a deep conditioning of normal hair . One of the best conditioners I 've used . It smells great too !
 For a professional product , the cost is very reasonable and the product performs at the same level as those costly items . I was a long time pureology user and that actually did more damage than helped . This has repaired the damage caused and is easy on the pocket book .
 This product is the best I have ever found . I recommend it to all my family and friends . I have thin hair that damages easily and looks like straw even with other conditioners . THIS product is amazing . I take a small amount -LRB- less than the size of a dime -RRB- and work it into ALL my hair and LEAVE IT IN . My daughter has long hair and just works it into the ends . I can not say enough about this amazing product . My hair is shiny and healthy !
 Very happy with the results of using the Absolut Repair Conditioner paired with the Shampoo . Was recommended to me by a stylist - my hair feels softer and more manageable .
 This is the best conditioner I have ever used . Only a small amount each time I wash my hair , which is every day , is necessary to smooth my hair and give it body . After I shampoo , I apply about a dime size amount , working it into my hair for about 60 seconds . . Hope they keep making this product . I love it . My hairdresser does not carry this brand , so I rely on amazon . They always get it to me quickly . My hair is shoulder length or longer . 5 oz lasts me about 2 months .
 I 'm satisfied with my purchase , my hair feels very soft , light and healthy . I always love quality of L'Oreal products .
 I love this product ! It was shipped to my place in a few days and have been using it for a few weeks . I saw results within the first week . My hair has life again and all of my friends have been complimenting on my `` new '' hairdo ...
 My hairdressers had been complaining about my hair feeling thin and dry . I blonde my hair and into the bargain have fine , straight hair and also I am on a lot of medication . After using this product once a week for four weeks , I went back to my hairdressers and they could n't believe the difference in my hair.My hairdressers did not know that I had been using this product as in their salon they use a different brand of hair products . My hair feels so much more hydrated and thicker . I thoroughly recommend this product .
 I bought this because the last woman that cut my hair recommended it for me . I 'm so glad she did because my hair is smoother and healthier than it 's ever been . It definitely sucks that it 's so expensive , but I have found that a little goes a long way . I have medium length hair that I usually wash every other day . The same hairdresser told me to use a regular drug-store clarifying shampoon -LRB- I use neutrogena -RRB- and I have found the two work very well together . I alternate between the clarifying shampoo and just a regular store bought moisturizing shampoo . Totally recommend .
 This conditioner was recommended to me by my stylist due to dry ends . So far it has done the job well and I 'm very pleased .
 My hairdresser initially suggested this product because my hair is very dry , especially on the ends . I love it . It really works well . And amazon 's price is a little better than the salon price .
 you never send me the product , you sent me an email that you will credit de value to my credit card
 I have tried numerous brands of conditioners trying to get the `` just-left-the-salon '' feel and this does it ! I love the entire l'oreal professional series absolut repair line .
 I 've been using this supplement for about 3 months and I have noticed fine hair coming in on the sides and in the back where my hair has thinned . It has the B vitamins that are necessary to grow hair . I would recommend it for a start . It is not going to have your hair growing down your back over night . Since it is winter now and my hair is in a resting state , the spring will give more visable results . I will come back then and write another review . They have changed from a capsule to a large pill which takes some swallowing but it 's not bad .
 It is still a classic that smells excellent with the right body chemistry , just a light semi-sweet smell ... I like it and My ladies love it ! Try it you might like it ! I received it in excellent condition and in a timely manner ! I recommend Amazon for shopping and ordering all colognes !
 I like the scent . I first bought at Sefora for 90 + but bought my 2nd bottle here for a lot cheaper .
 I first got accquainted with this fragrence in a ` MensHealth ' magazine with Jamie Foxx/Adam Lamberg -LRB- if I 'm not mistaken -RRB- dual cover for the September 2008 edition . Ever since , I have wanted the fragrence . The sample insert smells great . However , the actual liquid has 10x time the range . The day it arrived February 1 , 2010 , my mother could not stop getting a whif of it . She even sprayed it on an index card . As a woman , she stated that this is the type of men 's cologne that draw women to men . Just like there are certain colognes that men like for women to wear.It 's GREAT !
 This is one of the sweetest , attractive to my nose colognes that I 've smelled or owned in the last 10 years . All I can say , wearing it on myself or smelling it on someone else , is WOW!Prada By Prada For Men . Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 oz
 Not much to say besides WOW ! I have over 100 bottles of top shelf cologne . Usually my ` new ' bottle is my favorite until I get sensitized after a couple of weeks . That has n't happened to me yet and it 's been a few months . I tend to pass up all the others to get to this . Sometimes I do it just because nobody else in my area is wearing it and I want to leave a lasting impression . Other times I wear it just because it is so damn sexy smelling ! Hard to describe but definitely worth the expense ! Buy the biggest bottle and get the best deal right out of the gate . Do n't make the mistake that I did and buy a small bottle only to come back later and get the economy size . I have yet to see a shower gel/kit for this but I would surely get that as well.Ladies
 I was worried this would be a fake Prada fragrance , or be diluted , still making it a fraud.But , I am delighted with the purchase of an authentic Prada fragrance which was exactly what I expected . Its a beautiful smell , a good product , a good sale .
 Smells awesome . A thing I like to do is get close to a female while I notice her head move up toward me as if trying to get a closer smell.Very fast shipping and in good packing .
 Prada By Prada For Men . Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 ozi used my gift certificate for this item from amazon.comthis is my first prada product ... the `` duft '' is somewhat sexy and young . . sweet smell ... too much applied . . and you will definitly get the audience attention ... i use it mostly for personal times with friends ... the scent tends tolinger for days in my sports clothing ...
 I shopped Macy 's . Nordy 's and a couple other high end department stores and they all sold Prada Classic for men . Buy it here at Amazon.com and get the 3.4 ounce bottle for the same price the department stores sell the 1.7 ounce bottle for !
 I was surprised to receive it at the earliest delivery and I was told to expect to get it approximately two or three days ahead but I got it unexpectedly . I was pleased . Prada smells so wonderful and kind of sweet and it last about 6 to 8 hours . I like that .
 I brought this item because I smell it in a store one day but i didnt purchase . So I bought the cologne a couple months later and it was way better that time . Once you spray it and it come in contact with you skin the smell changes and smells even better . Very light long lasting cologne and I recommend this to all my cologne junkies . THIS IS A MUST HAVE PEOPLE . And you cant beat the price . Great gift also .
 I find most men 's colognes smell like bug spray . So when a friend asked me to recommend a cologne for him , I approached the task with some trepidation . Do I choose something based on what I know of him ? Or what I like a man to smell like ? How many bottles will I have to sniff before I pick something that smells nice ? I went to a chain cosmetics place because I know that not only do they have a somewhat small collection of men 's colognes -LRB- which is better ; I had no intention of smelling too many brands -RRB- , I knew that if I found something that smelled nice , I 'd be able to get a sample . After testing a few scents out , I picked up the Prada for Men Eau de Toilette Spray -LRB- no matter how fancy it sounds in French , something needs to be done about using the words toilet water when it comes to defining fragrance . Really . -RRB- I spritzed some on the fragrance tester paper , and in doing so , some of it went onto my hand . I smelled the tester , and found the scent pleasant . As I lingered in front of the sample wall , I continued smelling the cologne as it continued to set . The more I inhaled , the more I liked the scent . It 's light , clean and fresh , not heavy . I asked for a sample , which I received . Now I hope that my friend will like the scent as well , and if he tries it , it 'll smell good on him !
 It took me a day or so to get used to this cologne . It especially smells dry and clean when you first spray it . It 's honestly much better after it 's been on you for an hour or so . It 's not like the fragrances I wear most of the time -LRB- mostly fresh , aqua scents , loving Hugo Element -RRB- , but that 's honestly why I got it . Really , what 's the point of having 10 colognes that all smell similar ? I 'm trying to keep my selection new and different , and this scent goes a long way in helping me do that .
 Complex and sophisticated fragrance - not your usual man 's cologne yet not feminine . Does last a long time and the bass note is pleasant in the afternoon . Great price at Amazon .
 THIS PRODUCT WAS SHIPPED IN A TIMELY FASHION AND WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION . THE QUALITY IS ORIGINAL AND FANTASTIC .
 It does have a strong soapy note , with a light powdery scent . You will smell very clean and fresh.This could easily be a unisex fragrance but it 's nothing that would make a man feel awkward wearing it .
 In terms of quality , Prada Amber is up there with the very best . Longevity and projection are excellent . As mentioned , this fragrance is quite `` soapy '' . But think of very * expensive * soap . I imagine the soapiness has a lot to do with why so many people describe it as very `` clean '' smelling.An hour or so in , Prada Amber takes on a slightly powdery dimension , which very nicely counterbalances the soapy aspect . The whole fragrance really mellows out at that point into one of the smoothest scents you 'll find . I should also note that some find it borderline unisex , but I personally could n't see a woman pulling this one off.All in all , Prada Amber is very unique . I 've smelled 100 's of fragrances , and this one definitely stands out . If you 're looking for a long-lasting , very high class and quality soapy scent that can go with everything from your work clothes to your best suit , check out Prada Amber Pour Homme .
 I can still faintly smell it in my room . I put it on on my porch about 2 maybe 3 days ago before I went to work . I can still smell it from across the room form the close hamper.I ca n't describe the smell very well . Its definately not common , i 'll tell you that . You wo n't run across it on a lot of people in a club and especially not in a bar.There is nothing woodsy or rustic about this smell . It is all modern . And so far as I know Axe nor Old Spice has come out with a deoderant emulating its smell .
 I hate colognes and this is my favorite scent . It 's delicate yet manly and almost has an aromatherpy effect to it for me .
 I just sprayed a sample on my hand and ca n't seem to stop smelling it . I probably looked weird smelling my hand in front of the sales guy at best buy . I 'm liking it a lot more once it settled into the skin . Just a little bit will probably go a long way . I think the ladies will be more crazy about it than I am , but is n't that what counts anyway ? I would n't doubt that there 's a perfume out there that smells exactly like it . That said I would n't say it necessarily smells feminine , it just smells good period . I also figured out what it smells like in lay terms . To me it has that fresh clean powdery baby smell . and who can argue with that , unless you 're a complete jerk . . So the question is , will the ladies be subconsciously thinking of me as baby making machine when they get a wiff of this . . ; 0 maybe I 'll update some day . .
 There are many colognes out there , many brands . Prada is one of those that feel a little more exclusive than others here in the USA , has more of class than some hip hop trend .
 This cologne is not `` over the top , '' and has a smell of sophistication ! The best cologne I have purchased to date .
 I 'm kind of torn with this frangrace . Do n't worry though this is def . a very good frangrance , but not sure if it 's me . This has a very sharp soapy smell to it . It 's not a bad thing . Powdery is a good word for it like everyone else who describes it . This fragrance def . ooozes class and sophistication.I 'm just having a hard time figuring out when and where to wear this fragrance . I use it mostly for work right now , but I have other ones better suited for that . This in my view is a year round fragrance . Day or Night . To me , this fragrance does n't invoke any sort of feeling or excitement.If you get this , do n't worry it 's a good buy , but more formal and maybe date wear . Good sillage and projection . This wo n't offend anyone .
 This is the cologne !! I wrote the review for the wrong product , but this also smells divine . I will be ordering this again , too .
 I luv this stuff ... . One of the best colognes out there for men . A great size & good size & price point .
 I 'm very selective about colognes and extremely loyal to a fragrance once I find one that works well for me . Since Spaziois going out of production , this will be my new fragrance .
 I 'm afraid this wo n't be a very helpful review since there is n't another fragrance I know of that I can say it smells similar to -LRB- I wish more fragrance reviews would do that so I can have an idea of what the fragrance being reviewed smells like -RRB- . So , for what it 's worth , I just simply love the unique -LRB- to me -RRB- refreshing smell that 's different from the typical `` hard '' fragrances for men ; in fact , as far as traditional men 's colognes go , I 'd definitely describe this as being more `` soft '' , if you know what I mean , but still masculine . It has staying power without being too strong and overpowering and just smells simply wonderful .
 This is one of the best smelling men 's colognes I have ever purchased . My husband loves it . It smells clean and fresh and seems to have a little lime with a lot of vetiver . If you ever liked Visit , you 'll love this one . Very nice .
 I can not tell me how many times women have asked me what I am wearing when I used Prada for Men . Honestly , I get embarassed when a beautiful woman asked me . The funny thing is my wife is n't crazy about it . It is always strangers .
 This scent took me back to a youthfull state of being , when I have the opprtunity to use it I do . There is only two fragrances I wear like a glove and the other is usher .
 This product works just as advertised . I would have given it 5 stars had the product description on Amazon been the exact same thing as what was on the box -LRB- the Amazon listing states Just for Men Color Gel for Mustache , Beard & Sideburns but the box I received just said Just for Men Color Gel for Mustache and Beard -RRB- . Regardless , the color gel is awesome ! It made my gray hairs disappear without giving my hair that obviously-dyed look .
 Great product have been using it for years without any issues . I have tried other brands , but this works best
 I love this product for coloring my eyebrows . I have naturally dark brown hair , but my eyebrows are sparse and super light brown . I 've gone to spas to get them professionally colored , which was fine , but expensive and time-consuming . Then a hairdresser told me that I could use this product.The thing I love is that one pack lasts FOREVER because you can just mix a little bit each time -LRB- unlike hair dye -RRB- and therefore I get many uses out of it . It also works quickly so I can do it before I get in the shower without it being a big ordeal . One tip though , if you get it on your skin , it 'll stay for a couple to a few days , so put a dab of conditioner around the eyebrow to prevent skin staining . And of course , do n't get it in your eyes . I 've been doing this for years with no problems.Skin staining is always a possibility of any dye so I would n't recommend doing it the morning of your wedding day .
 Have been using it for many years ! Still works for me and seems natural with my hair and will continue to use it and at a better value thru Amazon !
 a cool product that any male should buy to improve on the conditioning of the mustache and the dissapearance of that stubborn grey which appears right on you moustache
 Excellent price for this product ! I use this product all the time and I plan to purchase this product from the same source many more times in the future !
 This is my 3rd review for the same item . . The price is great . I use it to darken my light -LRB- not thick -RRB- mustache & sideburns . . There 's nothing I can do for the color lasting 3-5days . I wish it would last longer .
 I use this every 3 weeks to prevent myself from turning into Uncle Bens ! No more mascara brush to hide my rapidly greying beard hair . This stuff is so simple to use , goes on smoothly , STAYS on so no drips or splatters , and it leaves your hair looking like you were in High School again . I 've been using this for years now and could not imagine what I would do without it or what the heck I had been doing before it . No strong odors to violate your nose , does n't burn or sting , washes off the skin with mild soap , and lasts for a long time -LRB- depending on how fast your facial hair grows -RRB- . I totally recommend this product , it is perfect !
 Sometimes you read all the hype about a product , buy it , then it does not live up to all the buzz . This mirror does . I really enjoy being able to put on my eye make-up and the ability to tweeze my eyebrows , without my glasses . It 's a little pricey , but I am glad I purchased it .
 This mirror is a Godsend ! I used my sister 's when I was visiting her and I had to order one immediately for my home ! It 's the best for eyebrow maintenance and I love to use it for eye makeup as well . My husband even uses it ! The only bad thing is that I see all my wrinkles and lines - but that 's no fault of the mirror ! I would purchase again !
 Product works as advertised . Received on time and at a good price .
 I received this heavenly scent as a gift from someone special last Christmas and have worn it almost daily ever since.It 's an iridescent scent that works from day to night , from casual to elegant , from office to an evening out . I 'm finding , too , that its Asian light floral aura transitions nicely from the colder winter months to the heat of summer.People , mostly women , stop me all the time to ask what I 'm wearing and tell me how wonderful it smells.If what they say is true -- that it 's all about smell and timing -- this parfum will get you at least halfway .
 Found out about this scent from a co-worker who was wearing it in the cube next to me and had to have it IMMEDIATELY ! Never bought a fragrance without trying it on myself first , but it smelled so good I HAD to have it ... Well , I still love it and it smells great on me , too . Not at all heavy as some other reviewers have suggested if applied with a lighter hand . It does last a long time which I like .
 Was very pleased with my purchase . Got it on time with no worries . Package was very good . Tracking was very easy and worrie free .
 Very satisfied with the awesome deal i got.Giant bottle for super cheap.This is my go-to perfume & this is the best deal I 've ever gotten .
 I love this perfume . It 's light but the scent does n't disappear . I 've had a lot of compliments on it . The company shipped on time and everything was just as described . I will use them again .
 Item came as expected , very prompt delivery ! Ca n't go wrong with this burberry perfume ... i would definitely recommend it to anybody . This bottle is huge too !
 I 've been buying this for my wife for last 5 years . I adore smelling the powdery fresh scent on her . It 's subtle and lasts all day . to boot she also gets compliments at her work . She enjoys it but I enjoy it more . Better for me .
 Our daughter got the Burberry Touch in Paris for my wife . I am very glad I found a place that has it .
 I like that bottle it came in . The bottle was small abd come in a spray container which is imoportant wen trying on a new scent . but not the right scent for me .
 Bought this for my daughter for Christmas . She loved it & will reorder when out . Shipping was very fast . Very happy with amason.com
 LOVE the scent of this perfume and have had many people ask me what I 'm wearing when I go out with this on . I decided to go with the bigger bottle because I had smelled the perfume in a department store prior to this purchase and new how much I loved it ahead of time . I use perfume * almost * every time I go out , so in hopes that it would n't run out fast ... the bigger bottle was mandatory . GREAT purchase , and price !!
 I love burberry . I 've been trying to get a few samples to find the right one for me . This one is soft and great for everyday use .
 Amazon is less expensive than a department store . My wife and I like the scent , it is sweet without being overpowering .
 I 've been wearing this scent for years and I still love it . I still get compliments on it . Great price on Amazon versus other sites . Shipping was fast .2 / 3/2012Finally had to buy another bottle after receiving several for gifts . I still love this scent . It 's the day to day scent that I love .
 I got this item for a much cheaper price than it is sold in stores . It was a speedy delivery with free shipping , and came in only two days ! Amazing purchase !
 Excellent scent , very good price . This fragance smells awesome on girls between ages of 20 to 35 . I bought it for my wife and she loves it .
 I use the citrus scent to help wake me up in the morning -- it works like a cup of coffee but without the jitters . The citrus is blended with other light fragrances to give it an `` island '' scent that makes me feel like I 'm on vacation instead of getting ready for work .
 This product lathers really well and the Hawaiian scent keeps you fresh for hours . I 'll definitely be buying more .
 The smell of this shower gel is amazing and it feels so good on my skin . I highly recommend this product .
 Very happy with this wash , it has a decent lather and the smell is not overpowering . Makes your skin nice and soft ~
 I love this item . It is a great big 1 quart size container with a very handy must have hand pump . The soap lathers up nice and is a luscious pearly consistency . The `` English Lavender '' or French Lavender fragrance is pure , true and fresh . I highly recommend this product .
 great stuff - as is all of the Alba products that we have tried . A little goes a long way . The smell is wholly wonderful with no foreign or odd smells in the formulation
 It is my favorite bath gel ever . Hypo-allergenic . 100 % vegetarian ingredients . Not overpowering Lavender sent so it still makes you feel clean . Did you know that Lavender is a natural bug repellant ... although no proof that this works as a repellant ... living in FL I will try anything .
 This product is a great buy . Smells great and has a luxury feel .
 My husband & I both use this product and love the smell . It 's a citrus floral smell and it smells divine . A little of this product goes a long way ! Yes , it is very emollient and gently cleans your skin . This product rinses off easily .
 A light refreshing smell . Good lather . It lasts a very long time overall a very good buy for the money .
 This is a great product . Lathers well , has a pleasant scent and does not leave a residue or dry out skin . I have used this product for years and will continue to do so . Purchasing through Amazon is the best price value for the 32oz . of the Tuberose .
 I purchased this for my husband he has sensitive skin and its hard to find something that doesnt break him out this is a great product the smell is not over barring a light citrus with is good .
 My husband just loves this shower gel . I think it is great , too , for the price . It has a nice scent , cleans skin well without drying it out , rinses off well , and the pump always works without fail -LRB- we 've gone through at least a dozen of these in the last few years -RRB- . If I were crazy rich I would prefer a high-end shower gel with expensive ingredients like essential oils -- the kind that smell out of this world , but of course , that would cost four times as much money so I usually only purchase those shower gels in small bottles for an occasional splurge . This Alba gel , however , is a great everyday alternative to bar soap -LRB- which can be messy and inconvenient , and make it harder to clean your shower/tub due to soap scum -RRB- and it is also a nice alternative to less expensive grocery store shower gels -LRB- which generally smell icky and artificial -RRB- . The smell of this is clean and fresh , and it is good for both men and women.My only complaint is that the last couple bottles we bought did not have a clean/simple label with solely orange and white colors on it . It also had some silly looking lettering in pink which messes with the `` decor minimalism '' for those of us who care about that kind of thing . It is a minor infraction , to be sure , but something to take note of if you care about such things . : -RRB-
 I love Alba Botanica products . . natural and no animal testing . The lavender smells great . Love the bottle with a pump .
 This is a very fragrant shower gel that is also quite natural . It 's easy on skin and smells great -LRB- not artificial or chemical -RRB- . The large size is hard to find and it was worth ordering it online as it lasts really long .
 I have been using body washes/gels for a long time and this Alba shower gel is by far my favorite . I love the scent and how it does n't dry out my skin . It produces a good amount of latter without using a lot of the gel . This will be staying in my subscribe-and-save list for a long , long time .
 Alba Botanica 's Bath and Shower Gel lineup , especially in the 32-oz . pump container and in its French Lavender incarnation , is the bee 's knees.Okay , if that does n't float one 's botanical , how ` bout it being a supreme source of relaxation ? That it is , most of the time , and I generally need it on bath night.I suffer from the painful type of peripheral neuropathy -LRB- `` Google it '' to find out why it can be so horribly painful , but go to the Neuropathy Assn. web site , -LSB- ... -RSB- , to find out about numbing neuropathy vs. painful neuropathy , how to help those who suffer from it and how to help oneself if you 've got it -RRB- . To help control pain , my doc writes me an Rx for pain patches which are of incredible strength . But the patches only last for 3 days , and I ca n't shower with the patches applied to my side torso -LRB- which also means no swimming pool , beach swimming or other extended water dunking ; I know , I know , a BIG boo-hoo ! -RRB- . But every three nights , it 's bath night , something I thought I 'd never `` warm up '' to -LRB- I was more of a shower guy ; sorry , TMI ? -RRB- . And yet I now look forward to it most of the time . I even had a special soaking tub installed to replace the standard-size bathtub that was there for 40-some years . Since I live in a condo. , I was n't allowed to have a whirlpool tub installed as they cause a lot of noise for the neighbor below . But this tub is almost as good and certainly allows me to enjoy a relaxing , deep soak . I have other accessories which improve the experience , e.g. bath pillow and methods for enjoying a late meal . Alba Botanical 's Bath and Shower Gel provides a great overall product.I do wish I could purchase Alba Botanica in a larger container so I 'd help save on wasteful packaging . And yet the packaging used can be recycled and at 32 oz . is a very large unit compared with what so many stores sell . Again , I love the 32-oz . size since it is a pump canister.And I do not notice my eyes tearing over so much as they did when I had to substitute the brand for another shower gel -LRB- Avalon Organics -RRB- . NEVER AGAIN!Go with good faith that this Alba Botanical product SHOULD help provide a good or great soak !
 Love , love , love this body wash . One pump is all you need for your whole body . Very moisturizing and great scent .
 I love all of the Alba Botanica shower gels . I use them in lieu of soap and they work great for shaving as well . I 've used them for several years now !
 This makes my skin soft after a shower !! I notice a significant difference when i use it and when I do n't . I have pretty dry skin so this MATTERS
 Nice product but only used 2 weeks . Seems to do the job but long term use will determine if it is a keeper . Purchased because of the organics in it and for dry skin . I still notice my dry skin continues to be incredibly dry and scaly . Maybe that will improve long term but is why it gets only 4 stars.Likely to recommend . Price per size = good value .
 This is wonderful shower gel . Also is great for relaxing in the tub . Rinses clean and leaves skin soft and smooth . Best body wash I 've ever used .
 I love the product I actually prefer the tubular rose but I like the lavendar as well . What I did n't like was the packagaing . both times it came the bottle came open and there was body wash all over the box . Amazon needs to figure out a better way to ship it , they did however let me keep both bottles as opposed to shipping it back which would have been impossible .
 Wonderful scent and moisternizing qualities of the bath gel , nice lather.Alba Botanica Bath and Shower Gel , French Lavender , 32-Ounce Bottle
 I 've used another very nice shower gel for years , and I 'm still a fan . However , I saw this while browsing around the Alba section and figured I 'd give it a try . What great stuff ! It has a wonderful lavender scent -- perfect for a shower before bedtime -- and it cleans well without drying out my sensitive skin . I 'll be a repeat customer !
 I 'm 28 . My skin is oily in summer/combination in winter . I 've been using this as my night moisturizer for over 8 years . I have very sensitive acne-prone skin . I found in my late teens that anti-aging products were more effective since they 're gentle and promote cell turnover . I barely have any wrinkles starting , and people usually guess my age at early 20 's . Maybe it 's just good genes & oily skin , but using these products could be good preventative maintenance too ! I found that a water-based gel moisturizer would n't make my breakouts worse like a lotion or cream . H2O has many great products I 've tried over the years . Night Oasis is by far my favorite ! A little goes a long way . I use the overnight perfecting peel first , followed by this before I go to bed . I 'm trying Sea Buckthorn Seed Oil right now to help my breakouts , but I 'm wary about switching to a new moisturizer . I had a scare a couple months ago when an Ulta cashier told me this had been discontinued . Could n't believe they would discontinue one of their best sellers ! So I tried a gel moisturizer by Garnier that cost much less . Big mistake ! Made my breakouts so much worse & did n't have the healing properties or calming effect Night Oasis has on my skin . Relived to know it has n't been discontinued & I was able to find it on Amazon for about $ 10 less than retail .
 I have curly hair and am always looking for products that make my curls bouncy without making them sticky.I found my first bottle of this at a small store in Texas at a good price and decided to try it . That was the one and only bottle I have ever seen in the store . It works great ! An added bonus is the smell which is the intoxicating combination of lemongrass , oregano , and rosemary!I researched this product on the internet and found that the company changed the formula getting rid of the lovely combination mentioned above and adding orange peel . They were charging a higher price for a smaller bottle!Luckily , I found a new bottle on Amazon for a great price since it is no longer available anywhere else!As someone who has tried many products for my curly hair I highly recommend this tonic !
 I was visiting a spa in Bend -LRB- Sunriver -RRB- , Oregon and they had this in their bathroom and showers . The whole spa was filled with this great fragrance so I had to buy it . All of the Thymes products are very nice and would make a perfect gift . The Eucalyptus soap and lotion is just the most striking fragrance . It is very rich , clean , fresh ... not like flowers or not spicy ... it is herbal , refreshing !
 I used it in the bath tub and it really adds the spice to the bath . They slow desolve in the water and are very silky . Worth it
 I 've been using this for years . Great product to use for undereye discoloration before foundation .
 I love this stuff . I first got it years ago in walmart and now I ca n't find it , but on amazon . It is my must have makeup , I can go without all other makeup but have to have this on before I go anywhere . Last forever too
 I have used for years . Keeps nail polish on much longer No chiping lasts a good three weeks . recommend to anyone whoputs polish on thei nails
 It is made for natural nails . I ca n't do without it , which is why I always order more than one . BTW , it lasts a while .
 Daby Nail Hardner is the most amazing nail product I 've ever used . I 've used many nail hardners over the years but none with the results like this product .
 Daby keeps my manicure in great shape for at least a week , often longer . My nails are strong and they grow ! The only complaint is that when they do break it 's usually a big one -- no little dings or chips at the tips .
 I have never had nails this nice my whole life . I have been using this product for about 4 months and my nails are getting stronger every day . I have tried several products over the years , but Daby has them beat hands down !
 Daby is the best nail hardener I have every used . Not only does it make your nails harder , it stops nails from pealing , and keeps polish on for at least two weeks .
 There is nothing else to be said except that this stuff really works and I 've tried just about everything over the years . I 've actually had to file down my nails because they were getting too long !
 I 've been using this product for over 10 years . My manicurist applies it after my polish is on , before the topcoat . Then it 's 8 minutes under the uv light . I re-apply it later the same evening on freshly washed , completely dry nails . My polish will last for 1 week with absolutely no chipping , 2 weeks if I reapply it again on the 7th day . Since using this product , my nails are strong with no breaking or splitting . I highly recommend it and this sender as it arrived promptly and carefully packaged .
 This stuff is great . My friend recommended it because it consistently kept her manicure intact for 2 + weeks . I decided to try it and can not believe how much stronger my nails are and how they are growing . They used to get brittle and crack easily , but now they are in the best condition ever .
 I have tried many nail hardeners , and this is by far , one of the best that 's out there . My nails have been soft and brittle and I had all but given up on trying anything else until a friend of mine told me about Daby . It is easy to use , and within about three weeks my nails were absolutely fabulous . In fact , my nails have grown out so much that I am wearing a French manicure week after week.My only hesitation for this review was that demand may drive the price point up . Seriously , it 's truly agreat product .
 I 've been using this product for nearly two months and I 'm happy with the results . My nails are definitely growing much quicker and they seem a little stronger too .
 great product ... my nails are really weak ... this has allowed me to have pretty nails once again ... quick shipping
 Works great on Manicures & Pedicures ! My Polished lasted 3 weeks ! Great as a treatment for natural nails too !
 The product and service was great , however , if I had known that this product was affiliated with Ebay I would have accessed ebay with MYPoints account and earned points . I was disappointed .
 A manicurist made me buy this once when I went to get my nails done . It is awesome stuff !
 One of the best blushes I 've ever had - It is kinda hard to find gel blushes but I would recommend this .
 The product above was recommended by my plastic surgeon after his procedure for skin cancer on my face . I had a hard time finding it as it was not available in my local drug store . It has been great for my healing process . I use it to massage a large area on my face every day . My daughter had been using it back a few years ago until she could no longer locate it in the stores in her state . She loved it as do I. I would highly recommend it . I just hope Amazon will be able to obtain more of these products .
 I found this foundation to be realistic in color -LRB- copper sand -RRB- and provide light coverage without looking fake . It also provides a realistic glow .
 Thanks for providing this . I finally had found a makeup that looks good on ME and does n't feel like makeup , plus is good for my skin providing `` Active copper '' and sunscreen including zinc oxide . Then , 2 years later , I could n't find it in any store in my area -LRB- San Diego -RRB- ; fortunately , I was able to purchase it online . I do n't know what Neutrogena is doing , messing with a good thing like this.PS I have bought other things from `` Beautiful Perfumes '' with good results .
 This is the greatest product for applying makeup . I absolutely hate getting makeup on my hands and this product solves my problem . Using the sponge on a stick to apply makeup not only keeps your hands clean but allows for a smooth and easy application of base . I am really happy with this product and bought an extra for a girl friend who had never heard of it . Now she is hooked and loves it . Thank you
 I love this product ! I use it above my cheekbones to hide under eye puffiness !! It really helps enhance your cheekbones too ! I now use Maybelline Instant Rewind concealer in the `` brightner '' shade !!!! It is great - I really am so glad they make a brighner !!! I am 41 and I absolutely need something really light to highlight and this does the trick !
 I do n't know if it is still being made !! So I ordered 10 of them ! I use it every day ! It highlights my cheek bones . And really helps give my face definition !
 I 've used this product for a long time and it 's the best I 've found for those with thyroid issues . The price was better than most , the service prompt and courteous and all around a positive experience .
 I live at a high altitude , dry area and have very sensitive skin - and am constantly working in a commercial kitchen . My skin was a wreck - very dry - before I used Sothys at the local Beauty Spa . After 3 years of this cream , my skin is rehydrated and maintained . I used to use Lancome and Clarins , but will stick to this brand forever . Many of my friends have noticed the difference and they have gone to the same beauty spa and use it too - also with fantastic results . I prefer this thicker Comfort cream over the lighter one .
 I 've been using this cream for over 15 years -LRB- I am 55 -RRB- , and I constantly get comments about the beauty of my skin . The cream is thick -LRB- but not too thick -RRB- , creamy , a little goes a long way ; never sticky or greasy . Feels heavenly soft on the skin , weightless , long-lasting . I do n't like heavy creams or nasty odors ; this cream is perfect !
 I 'm another person who had been holding on to a great , really old brush because she could n't find anything decent to replace it . My old brush was over 30 years old . Even missing several rows of bristles on its leading edge it was far better than any of the brushes that I tried from time to time and discarded . The Phillips brush is very nearly as good as my old brush , being gentle to the hair -LRB- I have long hair several inches below the shoulder -RRB- and firm to the scalp .
 This is an excellent brush . It 's not too big so you can easily toss it in a bag when you 're traveling . It 's a lightweight but sturdy brush .
 I do n't feel like writing a long review but I must admit that this is the most powerful brush a person can ever get a hold of for sure . I never had such a legendary product that preserves that positive smile knowing it could do miracles as long as you have some hair left naturally ! ! ! Z
 I bought 2 of these for my 2 daughters . We received them yesterday and they are AMAZING . My girls have fine hair and very snarly . This brush does n't hurt them and gets the tangles out while making their hair shiny and gorgeous . I tried it on my fine hair and now I have to have one !
 hard to find brushes that feel good in thick hair . this is my second since i wore the first one out after many years . get one if you want your scalp to feel good and brushing to make a difference .
 I love this brush and use it everyday . Gentle on my hair . Gentle on my grandkids hair . I would recommend this brush .
 This is the exact brush I was looking for and could not find in the store anymore , I even bought it in the smaller size too .
 I was introduced to this hair brush about ten years ago , and I have not used any other hair brush since then .
 I have three of them so that I will not be without one -LRB- my son kept getting it and misplacing it -RRB- . It does n't tear my hair like the other brushes and it is soft on my scalp . I have bought them for friends and family . I will be looking for the small version for my purse .
 My original I bought many years ago -LRB- at least 10 , but it seams more like 20 -RRB- . I bought the small one for my Grand Daughter , but she wanted the same size as mine , so I bought the larger one for her . I keep the small one in my car now , and I love them both . They 're very usable , and they require no perfect skill to make them work very good on the hair .
 This brush comes closest to the firmness and bristle spacing of my 30-year old nylon bristle brush ... a replacement for which I 've searched for years . It has the close bristle spacing of a boar 's hair brush but about 50 % stiffer ... which if you 've got a decent head of hair is necessary .
 The Phillips Light Touch 6 Hair Brush is kind to my hair . It feels great to use and it shapes my hair just like the brushes I used 40 years ago . I recommend this brush and Bravofun ! , the company I bought it from . I , of course , bought it through Amazon .
 I was looking for a boars hair brush when I ran across this brush and read the reviews . I did buy a wonderful boars hair brush but also decided to give the Phillips a try since it 's been years since I 've found a decent brush . Well I could n't be happier . It goes through my long hair extremely easy whether it 's wet or dry and is stiff enough to reach my scalp . It also does n't create static in my hair . In fact I like it so much I 'm going to order a couple of the purse size models so I can have one in my car and at work .
 This is the best brush you could ever buy and it may be the last one you will ever need . I have one for each of my four children and they have used it for years . Many brushes come apart or break when you use them on tangled hair , not this brush , it is excellent . It also does not pull or break off hair . You will be glad you bought it !
 I ordered a Phillips Light Touch 8 after reading these reviews . It 's the same as the Light Touch 6 , except that the head is a little longer and the bristles are spaced a little farther apart . No latex cushion -LRB- I have a latex allergy -RRB- . When it arrived , I was worried that the bristles would be too soft to get through my hair -- long , dense , wavy/curly , and coarse . This brush does the best job of any brush I have ever used . It glides through tangles without tearing my hair or pulling it out , and it feels wonderful on my scalp . It seems very nicely made , too . Happy !
 My dad got me a used hairbrush from an estate sale when I was about 13 . I 've spent nearly 30 years on and off trying to replace it , because I disliked it so much -- it looked like a dog had chewed on it , which made the handle rough on my hand all those years -- but to no avail ... I could never find a better hairbrush.About 3 months ago , my son carried that funky old hairbrush to the public pool and lost it . I was livid , because I knew how hard it would be to find a brush to replace it . My search was on again , and I spent another $ 50 trying various $ 8 and $ 10 drug store brushes , nylon bristle , natural bristle , military style , round , etc. . Bleck ! Finally , I was in a salon one day , and I asked whether they had any hairbrushes they really liked . They let me try their Phillips Light Touch 6 . WOW ! The first hairbrush I 've used in 27 years that exceeded that strange old clunker my dad had gotten me ! I bought one from the salon immediately , and I love it ! The bristles penetrate my hair easily , are neither too stiff nor too flexible , they 're not sharp against my scalp , do n't cause my hair to clump or frizz , the size and weight is excellent in the hand , the contour of the bristle bed lays naturally against my scalp ... just a great hairbrush!Now I 'm buying them for each of my kids . I 'm debating buying a couple extras , just in case they go out of production and I lose mine again . Hopefully , I 'll never have to find a hair brush better than the Light Touch 6 , because I do n't think it exists !
 I read the reviews on this hair brush and ordered 2 of them . My hair is always tangled terribly . THIS BRUSH IS AMAZING to comb out or thru tangles w/o PAIN ... I am so pleased with this product and will never buy any other hair brush . I also returned to get one for my dog who does not like her long hair tugged at either . If this brush worked so brilliantly on my long tangled hair w/o any pain , no breaking off my hair , it will be the best thing you can have for any hair types . FANTASTIC PRODUCT !!! Thank you . It is gentle too and well made , easy to hold . -LRB- my tangles were to a severe stage from illness and being in bed so much . I have long hair and this was a life savor for me -RRB- Thank you AMAZON ! You 're the best for all my needs .
 I am always on the hunt for great new hair products . I have long -LRB- past bra line -RRB- hair that is medium bodied -LRB- my hairdresser says I have a lot of very fine hair -RRB- . This brush is gentle yet effective . It gives my hair some body , brushes through knots and is sturdy . When this brush breaks down , which I do n't anticipate for sometime , I will buy it again .
 I have traveled to many countries , many hotels and many hairdressing salons . This is THE BRUSH . Point . The smaller version is just as great for the handbag.A happy consumer . I will be back !
 This brush will meet all of your expectations !! I have owned this brush for 12 or 13 years . It get used every day and is still holding up wonderfully . It feels great to the scalp and does not dammage your hair .
 I had one of those for 10 years . Excelent quality and really pleacent to brush my hair . My wife use it to brush my daugther long hair , and it works very well . If you bend the brush by pushing it too long against something , it will return to normal after couple days without pressure . Unfurtunatelly I lost it on the hotel and I have to buy another one . I recomended 100 % .
 Love this brush , does not pull or hurt when brushing . Great for pets too , they love it !
 This shampoo is so rich that I do n't need to use a hair conditioner . And I only need to use a tiny bit , even though my hair is to my shoulder-blades . A little bit goes a very far way !
 This item was a gift for someone who used the product in the past . She loves it . My complaint is the way the item was packed for shipping . The bottle arrived completely wrapped in packing tape -LRB- taped directly to the bottle with no barrier between the tape & bottle -RRB- with a sealed bag over and then put in a box . Since this was a gift I had to painstakingly take off the tape which left a sticky residue . Very unhappy about this ! Will NOT be buying this product from this vendor again , even if they were the cheapest . I WILL be buying this product again but from someone else .
 This is a very pleasant hand lotion - the scent is noticeable but not too strong . The lotion works very well without being greasey .
 I have used Kimono Rose for years and I always get compliments . It is so refreshing with a bit of the oriental scent . My daughter always says that she knows where I am because she can smell that Kimono Rose . I have tried other Thyme products and always come back to Kimono Rose .
 This product keeps it 's true scent , and smells great ! It 's also a nice light lotion that 's great to use all the time .
 ThermaSilk Hairspray , heat style finisher is the best hair spraythat has ever been on the market , especially for fine thin hair.It need to be put back on the market . PLEASE
 I 've always used this hair spray and then they took it out of the stores because it was only 2.99 a 8.5 oz non aresol pump . I came on here where I bought my last 12 for 36.00 and people are wanting 22.00 to 60 dollars for 8.5 oz ! How in the world do some of you people sleep at night , this is nuts ! Rip off your fellow man that is what American is coming to , it 's so sad ! Pathetic . I will find another hair spray that is 2.99 and believe me they are still out there . You should be ashamed of yourselves for ripping people off at this pace!Wanny Lara-Bush
 For those who like a decidedly floral fragrance `` Sirene '' might be your choice . It 's a blend of jasmine , orangeflower , geranium , and violet.While the product page suggests daytime wear , I found it a bit heady and prefer it for evening.The packaging is lovely , contemporary yet timeless with an image of the Roman goddess of love modeled after the Venus statue on display at the Conservatory in Rome .
 Kama Sutra Treasures of the Sea is an intriguing bath salt with a warm sensuous room enveloping fragrance . One scoop of the salts in a tub of water and you transform everyday bathing into bubbles and water the color of the ocean.The color reminded me of the turquoise waters near the Aiya Napa white caves in Cyprus . The texture of the water turns silky and you may notice your skin is more moisturized from the natural oils , especially the Wheat Germ Oil.While many may see the color as `` Azure '' there is a definite green vs. purple color mingling in the depths of blue and this does contain Algae . The texture of the salt is more like a sand than a salt and the shimmering finely ground blue salt crystals mingle with what looks like tiny pieces of broken marble . Of course , this all dissolves quickly and the bubbles last through the entire bath . In fact , the more you move around , the more bubbles appear.The warm scent soothes the soul and the color is dreamy and the bubbles look like clouds floating across an open sky . A shell of salts is all you need and a beautiful shell is included.I had so much fun taking a bath with these salts , that I ran my husband a bath too . These salts seem to inspire sharing and recently inspired a poem : Bubble BathTurquoise mysteryOpalescent bubblesScent lingers in the airWater splashing over painted toesSinking into the soothing warmSoul comfort misplaces caresTroubles dissolvedSinking down the drainThe wisdom of silenceBliss of EscapeLiquid remedyImmersion in solitude ~ The Rebecca Review
 I love this brush ! I LOVE SMASHBOX ! This brush has completely made me change the way that I do my eye makeup ! This brush plus the definer brush makes eye makeup , especially , the smokey eye look , so easy ! I get so many more compliments on my eye makeup now . :-RRB- Very much worth the money !
 just perfect for blending . i am very pleased with it . quite large brush , looked smaller on the picture . still , i am happe with it .
 This is the only product I use to clean my face and take off make up and I would n't change it for the world . It 's a great product and leaves your face glowing . Would definitely recommend .
 After drastic thinning of my hair due to immune-suppression drugs , I bought a wig . It did n't seem right to keep hanging it on the arm of a kitchen chair . . so my search for a mannequin head began . This stand is stronger , and slightly heavier , than many of the others out there . It 's also a little longer than some -- long enough for my shoulder-length wig -- but is not top-heavy . This face is pleasant enough . Some of the other heads have scary faces or no face at all . It works well for me and I would recommend this stand to anyone that wants a sturdy stand and a face you can live with .
 I bought one of these styrofoam mannequin heads to use as an inexpensive jewelry display that shows relative life-size for photographs . Because of my intended use , the few dings and nicks the piece arrived with and the ghastly mold-line around the head were pretty disappointing.However , this head is stable and would be perfect for keeping wigs or hats in shape for storage or at the end of the day . It 's very lightweight , but the bottom is cut well so that it wo n't tip or roll over . A few weeks prior I had to return a more expensive display because it kept rolling over , even on a perfectly flat hard table ! No such trouble here!I would give it 5 stars if not for the thick line where the two halves of the mold came together during its manufacture . I 've tried removing them , but it makes it even uglier and scarred-looking , so I 've decided to just accept them.So , it 's not quite pretty enough for any photography uses unless you 'll be shooting from a distance and/or blurring , but it 's stable , inexpensive , and functional .
 I bought two of these heads to hold the wigs I got to use while I go through chemotherapy and grow my hair back . I was a little concerned they might overbalance , being taller than the usual wig head , but I wanted the taller style because my wigs are collarbone length and I did n't want them dragging and deforming on the shelf . The head bases are heavy enough to keep them upright -LRB- except possibly in the face of earthquakes or cats -RRB- , and I think I 'll use them as hat stands when I can pack the wigs away . They 're not high style display heads , but they 're a step above the usual styro heads , and as I said , great to protect the styling of longer wigs .
 I was looking for an inexpensive model to pose and photograph my wife 's handmade glass jewelry . In a table top light booth , Sally the Styrofoam photography assistant , silently performs perfectly without ever complaining . You should store her in a ziplock bag to have her remain spotlessly clean .
 I buy these for custom Halloween masks I make that have the wigs built in . If you 're looking for long neck manikins , this is very durable . I tried the slightly longer female head , but the neck snaps too easy . It 's just long enough too for a mask that extends to covering the upper part of the chest .
 Perfect for wig storage . They are high enough to get the wigs up and out of closet-shelf dust and prevent the bottom hair from flattening from contact with the shelf surface . They are stable and not prone to tipping over . They are the right size for all my wigs , which do not fall off as they did from some smaller heads I once had .
 I love this wig stand it is wonderful and perfect for my needs.I was given one at a beauty supply store.I asked to buy some -LRB- they were thrown in a box -RRB- I was told No , but that I could have one since I purchased a wig.Well I thought she -LRB- the wig head -RRB- was beautiful.I make Headwraps and jewelry-this would work perfectly ! So I ordered several , recieved them today , They look better than my free one -LRB- she 's a little banged up -RRB- However she is of better quality but not as smooth . The mold line is high-But I simply removed it with a nail file.I am very satisfied and it is an upgrade from the regular styro wig heads .
 I use the citrus scent to help wake me up in the morning -- it works like a cup of coffee but without the jitters . The citrus is blended with other light fragrances to give it an `` island '' scent that makes me feel like I 'm on vacation instead of getting ready for work .
 This product lathers really well and the Hawaiian scent keeps you fresh for hours . I 'll definitely be buying more .
 The smell of this shower gel is amazing and it feels so good on my skin . I highly recommend this product .
 Very happy with this wash , it has a decent lather and the smell is not overpowering . Makes your skin nice and soft ~
 I love this item . It is a great big 1 quart size container with a very handy must have hand pump . The soap lathers up nice and is a luscious pearly consistency . The `` English Lavender '' or French Lavender fragrance is pure , true and fresh . I highly recommend this product .
 great stuff - as is all of the Alba products that we have tried . A little goes a long way . The smell is wholly wonderful with no foreign or odd smells in the formulation
 It is my favorite bath gel ever . Hypo-allergenic . 100 % vegetarian ingredients . Not overpowering Lavender sent so it still makes you feel clean . Did you know that Lavender is a natural bug repellant ... although no proof that this works as a repellant ... living in FL I will try anything .
 This product is a great buy . Smells great and has a luxury feel .
 My husband & I both use this product and love the smell . It 's a citrus floral smell and it smells divine . A little of this product goes a long way ! Yes , it is very emollient and gently cleans your skin . This product rinses off easily .
 A light refreshing smell . Good lather . It lasts a very long time overall a very good buy for the money .
 This is a great product . Lathers well , has a pleasant scent and does not leave a residue or dry out skin . I have used this product for years and will continue to do so . Purchasing through Amazon is the best price value for the 32oz . of the Tuberose .
 I purchased this for my husband he has sensitive skin and its hard to find something that doesnt break him out this is a great product the smell is not over barring a light citrus with is good .
 My husband just loves this shower gel . I think it is great , too , for the price . It has a nice scent , cleans skin well without drying it out , rinses off well , and the pump always works without fail -LRB- we 've gone through at least a dozen of these in the last few years -RRB- . If I were crazy rich I would prefer a high-end shower gel with expensive ingredients like essential oils -- the kind that smell out of this world , but of course , that would cost four times as much money so I usually only purchase those shower gels in small bottles for an occasional splurge . This Alba gel , however , is a great everyday alternative to bar soap -LRB- which can be messy and inconvenient , and make it harder to clean your shower/tub due to soap scum -RRB- and it is also a nice alternative to less expensive grocery store shower gels -LRB- which generally smell icky and artificial -RRB- . The smell of this is clean and fresh , and it is good for both men and women.My only complaint is that the last couple bottles we bought did not have a clean/simple label with solely orange and white colors on it . It also had some silly looking lettering in pink which messes with the `` decor minimalism '' for those of us who care about that kind of thing . It is a minor infraction , to be sure , but something to take note of if you care about such things . : -RRB-
 I love Alba Botanica products . . natural and no animal testing . The lavender smells great . Love the bottle with a pump .
 This is a very fragrant shower gel that is also quite natural . It 's easy on skin and smells great -LRB- not artificial or chemical -RRB- . The large size is hard to find and it was worth ordering it online as it lasts really long .
 I have been using body washes/gels for a long time and this Alba shower gel is by far my favorite . I love the scent and how it does n't dry out my skin . It produces a good amount of latter without using a lot of the gel . This will be staying in my subscribe-and-save list for a long , long time .
 Alba Botanica 's Bath and Shower Gel lineup , especially in the 32-oz . pump container and in its French Lavender incarnation , is the bee 's knees.Okay , if that does n't float one 's botanical , how ` bout it being a supreme source of relaxation ? That it is , most of the time , and I generally need it on bath night.I suffer from the painful type of peripheral neuropathy -LRB- `` Google it '' to find out why it can be so horribly painful , but go to the Neuropathy Assn. web site , -LSB- ... -RSB- , to find out about numbing neuropathy vs. painful neuropathy , how to help those who suffer from it and how to help oneself if you 've got it -RRB- . To help control pain , my doc writes me an Rx for pain patches which are of incredible strength . But the patches only last for 3 days , and I ca n't shower with the patches applied to my side torso -LRB- which also means no swimming pool , beach swimming or other extended water dunking ; I know , I know , a BIG boo-hoo ! -RRB- . But every three nights , it 's bath night , something I thought I 'd never `` warm up '' to -LRB- I was more of a shower guy ; sorry , TMI ? -RRB- . And yet I now look forward to it most of the time . I even had a special soaking tub installed to replace the standard-size bathtub that was there for 40-some years . Since I live in a condo. , I was n't allowed to have a whirlpool tub installed as they cause a lot of noise for the neighbor below . But this tub is almost as good and certainly allows me to enjoy a relaxing , deep soak . I have other accessories which improve the experience , e.g. bath pillow and methods for enjoying a late meal . Alba Botanical 's Bath and Shower Gel provides a great overall product.I do wish I could purchase Alba Botanica in a larger container so I 'd help save on wasteful packaging . And yet the packaging used can be recycled and at 32 oz . is a very large unit compared with what so many stores sell . Again , I love the 32-oz . size since it is a pump canister.And I do not notice my eyes tearing over so much as they did when I had to substitute the brand for another shower gel -LRB- Avalon Organics -RRB- . NEVER AGAIN!Go with good faith that this Alba Botanical product SHOULD help provide a good or great soak !
 Love , love , love this body wash . One pump is all you need for your whole body . Very moisturizing and great scent .
 I love all of the Alba Botanica shower gels . I use them in lieu of soap and they work great for shaving as well . I 've used them for several years now !
 This makes my skin soft after a shower !! I notice a significant difference when i use it and when I do n't . I have pretty dry skin so this MATTERS
 Nice product but only used 2 weeks . Seems to do the job but long term use will determine if it is a keeper . Purchased because of the organics in it and for dry skin . I still notice my dry skin continues to be incredibly dry and scaly . Maybe that will improve long term but is why it gets only 4 stars.Likely to recommend . Price per size = good value .
 This is wonderful shower gel . Also is great for relaxing in the tub . Rinses clean and leaves skin soft and smooth . Best body wash I 've ever used .
 I love the product I actually prefer the tubular rose but I like the lavendar as well . What I did n't like was the packagaing . both times it came the bottle came open and there was body wash all over the box . Amazon needs to figure out a better way to ship it , they did however let me keep both bottles as opposed to shipping it back which would have been impossible .
 Wonderful scent and moisternizing qualities of the bath gel , nice lather.Alba Botanica Bath and Shower Gel , French Lavender , 32-Ounce Bottle
 I 've used another very nice shower gel for years , and I 'm still a fan . However , I saw this while browsing around the Alba section and figured I 'd give it a try . What great stuff ! It has a wonderful lavender scent -- perfect for a shower before bedtime -- and it cleans well without drying out my sensitive skin . I 'll be a repeat customer !
 This product opens eyes and diminishes any shadow from corners . Love product and the ease of applying is wonderful . Very gentle around eye area
 I am ordering my 2 . one . This pencil I use for right underneath the eyebrows . It gives the eyes a lift , it really works.I think the price is too high . . but then , are n't all cosmetics overpriced ?! Beauty just is expensive , but as for me , I love this pencil , would not like to be without it.It goes on with ease and is precize , no `` aiming or guessing '' it goes where it 's suppose to go every time . Highly recommanded.As to for some other products
 I usually use bare minerals bronzer , as i found it stayed well , and i had never come across this one before.However , after leaving my makeup somewhere , i sent my husband to get me some bronzer , because lack of sun in my life had left me looking like an ancestor of casper.I told him buy something cheap , as i only planned on using it once , but i havent been able to give this up.It is following the suit of the other CG products and is lightweight and naturally blended.I am so glad i accidentally found this , and if you are thinking of purchasing , i will say the amazon price , cant be beat , as i think we paid 4.99 in store
 I have only good things to say about this bronzer . I can use it everyday with any makeup combination and it looks great . I have used it when I was completely pale and when I have tanned everyday for two months straight and it looks amazing no matter what shade of skin you have . It is the perfect balance of bronze color and shimmer . It goes on great and is such a good price I would have to recommend to everyone !
 ... as a cool and soothing aftersun which also moisturises well without a greasy , heavy or cloggy feeling on the skin.This stuff is also the perfect carrier medium for a few drops of essential oil if you want to further enhance it 's medicinal properties , add a few drops of tea tree oil for spots , bites or grazes , or maybe a few drops of lavender oil to aid a feeling of relaxtion and sound sleep . Great also if you do happen to get a bit of sunburn , on really hot days put this in the fridge and then use it ! divine !
 This is my favorite floral . At least two other people are now wearing it after noticing the scent I was wearing .
 This style Ace comb is the best comb for my type of hair . I have very fine hair and this comb is the Greatest !! I have looked high and low to replace the one I had and Amazon.com was the only place I could find it . Love this Comb !!!
 I have been using Ace combs for decades . They are the best combs to use and last forever . The only reason I bought a new one is because I left mine on my last business trip in my hotel room . These combs last forever .
 This is an excellent comb . It 's durable so you do n't have to worry about it breaking or losing teeth when used on thick hair . The teeth spacing changes along the length of the comb for whatever width you need .
 product of excellent quality and arrived ahead of schedule in separate packages , very good , very good very good very good
 I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE PRODUCT AND THE PRICE . MY NAILS WERE IN ROUGH SHAPE AND WITH THIS PRODUCT I FEEL THEY ARE SRONGER THAN EVER .
 She is 2 and had n up-do with the bow on top . Most beautiful flower girl hair mostly because the bow !
 Bought this item last year and sported the best tan I have ever had without staying out all the time . Love the Glitter Look ! The store I bought it from last year is n't carring it this year , so I will be buying this online by the truck load.Tanned in Texas
 My 5 daughters and 4 grandaughters all use the glitter . We all love it plus my friends have also used it and are addicted to it . We can no longer get it . Why ?? It is the best stuff ever . My one daughter is allergic to anything with sunscreen and this is all that works . Please make it available to us.Girls in Montana
 My three adult daughters and I are true `` sun worshipers '' , and this stuff is the BEST !! Better than the expensive stuff , too . But , since about the middle of last summer until now -LRB- 5/2006 -RRB- we have searched high & low . As a last resort I have turned to the internet looking to buy it , and ca n't even find it here . If anyone knows where it is being sold , please let me know !! We have tried FL , LA , TN , VA , MD , NC , SC , GA etc , etc. . Thanking you in advance . Trish -LRB- longbeachgirl@comcast.net -RRB-
 The Glitter gel is an awesome conversation starter , and you look great with it on.It provides a rich dark tan , but does not have sunscreen , so if you are fair skinned this is not for you.The glitter is fun and everyone comments on it.It does wash off easily , so reapplying frequently is required when swiming .
 I love this stuff !! It does n't have any sunscreen so be careful but it makes your skin absolutely glow . It 's great for night time pool parties or just going out on the town .
 I began using All Terrain sunscreen lotion last year when I learned about the harmful chemicals that were in most other brands . I was a little skeptical at first , but it is a great product . My skin is fair and would burn left unprotected . I have n't had a burn in the 2 summers I used this product . It takes some rubbing in , but it was not a problem . It 's not greasy and I was diligent about applying at regular intervals . I have my entire family using it now . The best part is the price . There are other sunscreens out there that are also chemical free , but they were significantly more expensive .
 Beautiful light fragrance . Great price . Ca n't go wrong.Wish they sold powder in kimono rose and a gift set . Do n't people use powder anymore ?
 I have extremely sensitive skin and applying the water after washing my face and letting it dry naturally really calms my skin and gives it a natural glow ! I do it every day , twice a day -LRB- whenever I wash my face -RRB- . On a kore personal note , I am a huge fan of Vichy products , they are very effective for me -LRB- acqualia thermal , normaderm and etc -RRB- , and bear in mind that I am very selective with products .
 I absolutely love the thermal spa water ! Anytime my skin is feeling dry or tight I just pull my thermal water out of my purse and spray it on my face . It works great right after a shower , when I step out of the shower my skin starts getting tight and dry but just a little spray of the thermal water refreshes the moisture in my skin and leaves my skin feeling hydrated . After learning about this product and about Vichy in general I 've started recommending it to all my friends .
 The product is excellent , the smell great , if I liked it and would recommend it to a friend , THANK YOU , FOR SALE
 Me gusto mucho la colonia porque era para un regalo y para esa persona es una de sus preferidas , siempre que tengan la oportunidad se las voy a comprar .
 Perfume con aroma agradable , para mi es una fragancia para utilizarla a diario . La tienda que lo vend&iacute;a fue responsable con el env&iacute;o . Lleg&oacute; en el tiempo acordado . Los recomiendo .
 Excellent product i bought it to make a gift and my mom really like it . So if she likes it this is good . 100 % recommendd
 I received the perfume very fast at home it 's one of my favorites in the world . I love it , it 's perfect to use everyday .
 THE PRODUCT IS EXCELLENT THE PRICE WAS INCREDIBLE ... BOX AND PACKAGING THE PRODUCT IS GOOD CARE BEST ... PURCHASE AN EXCELLENT AND VERY GOOD SERVICETHANKS FOR YOUR EXCELLENT PRODUCTS
 I have been a loyal Aveda customer for ten years . Their products never fail me . The hand cream is a bit pricey , but it does just what it does just what the name says , `` RENEW '' ! Your hands will be feeling like a baby 's in no time !
 Excelente perfume huele muy rico , donde llego las personas me preguntan por el , llego a tiempo asi que lo recomiendo 100 %
 me gusto comprar en amazon , el producto fue entregado en el lapso establecido , todo me llego bien lo recomiendo , responsabilidad y calidad de los productos
 Thanks to Amazon and Perfumania!Delivery was before the scheduled date !! Very nicely packed by Amazon-i have ordered many things from Amazon , incl . watches , and they are simply perfect.Perfumania-i also received two vial samples from Swiss Army-very thoughtful!Hugo XX is very sensual and smooth-great for day as well as night use . It 's a gift for the wifey-bet she will love it!cheers !
 Apesar de me imagino tener una grancantidad de paquetes y depender de otros factores todo fue muy &aacute;gil y r&aacute;pido ...
 Although this hand cream is expensive it 's the only one that does the job for people with dry , sensitive skin . You only need to use a small amount , which makes it a little bit easier to swallow the high price .
 I luv this stuff ! My hands are always , always dry and a little of this goes a long ways . It is creamy and smooth on your hands and smells minty/rose fresh ! This lotion is especially good for winter or if your hands are constantly dry/chapped , like mine .
 I have extremely dry hands , and they get really bad in the winter . Hand relief is exactly that . Hands get better instantly thru applying the tiniest dab , without the greasiness of Neutrogena Norvegian formula -LRB- although when push comes to shove only Norwegian formula helps -RRB- . So sorry this item is not available thru Amazon , I would have added it to all the books I am ordering . .
 This perfume was a gift for my mother , she says that it is a nice perfume , she loved it and apparently everyone asks what perfume is she wearing.So if you like the fragances by Hugo Boss , you 'll probably would like this one .
 This product is a winner . The scent is gorgeous , subtle yet captivating . I 'm hooked on Hugo XX .
 myn ex boyfriend introduced me to this perfume and so i bought it . its good and smells really good all my friend s love it
 This perfume is very rich , CH 212 reminds me , I recommend it to all the girls who want to use it as long as they like fruity fragrances , rich perfume is original !
 muy serios con el env&iacute;o , todo lleg&oacute; al lugar de destino sin ninguna novedad , recomiendo este art&iacute;culo a todos , muy seria la tienda a la que le hice la compra
 Excelente producto , cumple totalmente con el requerimiento , escelente entrega , buen negocio , muy agradecido . Llego en buen estado y perfectas condiciones
 I love this perfume !!! Everything with the order was great ! Received Hugo Boss on time . The size and everything was as expected . Nothing to complain about !
 Fue Excelente , la compra y llego en el tiempo estimado de la entrega recomiendo el producto muy bueno 100 % recomendado
 I receive my items . 100 % new . good smell but i receive in more days that they estimated , but , i received . THANKS !
 These are wonderful I 'm so glad someone invented these , they never break or get caught in my hair . They are so comfortable I sometimes sleep in them forgetting my hair is even in a pony tail . This color is perfect for auburn hair also .
 I picked this up on a whim at a local coseout store . It 's not my regular brand but I got it for a buck so I decided to give it a try . I LOVE IT ! And wished I had bought more . My tube got empty and I found myself cutting it open with a pair of scissors to get every last drop I could.It went on so smooth & satiny like . My face actually glowed , if not from the makeup itself , then from the results I noticed in the mirror . It gave me confidence and it 's a rare makeup that does that . The coverage was not intense , but at least my face looked smooth and was all one color . I hate a base that leave streaks & lines and uneven tone . This was absolutely flawless in it 's coverage . I could n't tell if I ever had any trouble spots after putting it on . And my dark under-eye circles just dissappeared or were barely noticeable.And the icing on the cake was how people naturally assumed I was younger than I am with this makeup on . I was so complimented about my skin . So forget the expensive new name brand anti-aging or anti-wrinkle products out there . They do n't work like they claim anyway . This product makes no special claims , yet it does them all . And it only takes a small amount to get the effects you want or need . It 's works like a magnet searching out your face and knows exactly where coverage is needed . Just blends so well with your natural skin tone that you 'll never buy anything else .
 This foundation is wonderful if you have areas of enlarged pores . I use a 10x mirror to apply my makeup and this is the only foundation I have found that does everything I need . It does n't give a lot of coverage , but that is not my concern . I like that it does n't even appear that you have foundation on . It DOES self-adjust to your skin color -LRB- within reason -RRB- and I keep both light and medium on hand and mix them if I need to , depending on the level of my tan . It seems to `` blur '' imperfections and the pores just go away . I love it !
 Have used them all . Super expensive to drug store . This is my favorite . Goes on silky and smooth . Gives you coverage and color without looking like you have too much makeup on . It took 45 years to find the ONE . This is the ONE . My foundation searching days are done .
 I have been using this for a couple years . It is a very light coverage , unless you want to put it on in layers . I am an older woman and do n't want that old lady too much make up look . I try to stay away from anything that is heavy . I will keep using this for now .
 I received it quickly , item as described ... no problems . Would n't hesitate to order it again ... and probably will . My daughter thought it was her best xmas presesnt once again .
 I have a lot of severe sunscreen allergies and this is the only product I know for sure will not leave me looking like a red and swollen freak . The transaction was great , and shipping was very fast .
 NO-AD babies sunblock has been recommended to us by a dermatologist as having the least potentially harmful chemicals of any product he knew of currently on the market . Additionally , with an SPF rating of 45 it is among the most effective on the market . We have been using this product exclusively for several years and very well satisfied with it .
 This is the best sunscreen . Not greasy . No bad smells . Hypo-allergenic . Paba Free . Low , low cost.It 's better than any of the much more expensive sunscreen out there .
 This brand is about the only sunblock that applies well , rubs in , no residue . low fragrance . non irritating to our sensitive skin with eczema tendencies . lasts us a long time and we do use it liberally.liked it well enough to pay the shipping cost as i can not find it in the one store that used to stock it.it has been my brand of choice for several years . i have tried others , simply can not stand the fragrance on most and the higher spf 's have you greesy or white washed .
 I am extremely fair and have used No Ad products for years . I now use 60 on my body and 45 for babies on my face -LRB- I have dry skin so I 'm not concerned for the grease -RRB- . I think they are lifesavers . I do heed the warnings to use a lot , which means I am whitish for a few minutes until it drys . And if I 'm going to be sweating a lot , I skip my forehead and wear a sunproof hat to avoid it running into my eyes and stinging.I do n't go out and sunbathe in this stuff but it has been a real lifesaver for my many outdoor activities . I never burn .
 I had looked in vain for this comb in drug stores . I prefer an all fine hard rubber comb and was delighted to find these .
 I have used this comb for decades . The perfect comb with the exception they are no longer truly `` hard rubber '' , at least not like they used to be . Ends always break which is frustrating but it is still my desired comb . You just have to know if you carry it in your back pocket , the ends are gon na break !
 My favorite . Have used these ACE combs for years . Unable to locate them locally anymore . Found them here on Amazon at a fair price .
 Not the same as the old style combs of years past , but stuff has to be changed in manufacturing at some point in time . That being said they appear to be sturdy like the old models , I shall let you know if and when one bites the dust ...
 I got these for my husband , who is very fond of Ace combs and can not find them in our area any more . He is very happy with them .
 I have been using these combs for many years , and recently they have been hard to find in our local retail outlets . They have all changed over to a lesser quality comb which breaks very easily . These hard rubber combs are of the same high quality as always , and withstand the rough and tumble of carrying in the pocket . A superior product !
 Purchased for a man who wants the right tool for every job . The only pocket comb is the Genuine Ace Hard rubber comb . It comes with literature providing a written statement that these are the original ace hard rubber combs.Whe was well pleased.I am a happy girl.Thank you for the fast shipping too .
 Just the ticket ! Exactly what I wanted and the service was fantastic . Rec 'd the items within 6 days of ordering . Thanks for the prompt service . This is how ordering over the net should work all the time .
 My Dad bought this perfume for me as a gift when it was launched in 2002 . I LOVED it ! I 've been looking for it ever since and could n't find it anywhere until now . I was so excited to find it on Amazon , this is my favorite smell !!! I almost gave up hope , thank you so much , Amazon , for carrying this product . The smell is a bit on the sweet side , but not overwhelmingly sweet . It 's a bit hard to describe and there 's no other perfume to liken it to - the smell is like no other , I do n't think there 's a perfume out there that smells anything like it . I 'd describe it as oriental floral with hints of fruit . Here it says that fragrance notes are plum , balsam , musk and amber . Here 's the description of the smell I found on another site
 I use this on occasion when I experience thinning of my hair . After a few months , it always thickens my hair and prevents shedding . Then my hair gets used to it so I end up switching products .
 I love this product -- I used to be able to get it in my local drugstore but no one carries it anymore . I was thrilled when I found it on line . It gives me the best tan of any product I 've ever tried !
 SPF-4 NO-AD lotion is all I have used for years . Why ca n't I find it anywhwere ??? It is the best I 've ever used . I have fair skin and I have never burned , just tanned , with this lotion
 I tan very easily but still want to use some protection . This stays on well , keeps the skin soft and smooth with a healthy glow . My favorite !
 I used to buy this body butter at Borders -LRB- hey , alliteration ! -RRB- before they quit carrying it two years ago . Fortunately , they put it on clearance first , so I bought myself several tubs of it and stocked up . I 've finally almost used the last of it , so it 's time to start ordering it from Amazon.I * love * this stuff . The scent is fantastic -LRB- if you love citrusy scents , and sandalwood ; I love both -RRB- . It feels great on the skin , light and not too greasy . The scent hangs around for a while , too , without being overpowering.In the winter , like most people , I turn into a lizard due to the low humidity in heated homes ; thanks to this body butter , I can manage the winters now . I recommend this brand.To the reviewer who complained that Pacifica fig scented body butter went rancid ... all body butters will go rancid at some point , if they have natural ingredients -LRB- and these do -RRB- and do n't have a million unpronounceable preservatives which are good for the product , but bad for your skin and body . Maybe you should have considered keeping it in the refrigerator . However , that said , I live in a high heat area -LRB- in the summer -RRB- and I 've had tubs of this sandalwood be fine for many months . The tub I have right now has been open for over a year and a half . As for saying that Pacifica has bad customer service , well , I would love it if I could call up a company and demand a replacement for a product I could n't prove I owned or had purchased several months previously , but very few will allow that kind of actions . I do n't call that bad customer service ... I call it cautious business .
 I bought this from Sephora before it was discontinued and love it . I love the lime burst when it first goes on and then the lingering papaya dominance . It is a really smart combination . I also like how easy it glides on despite being a butter . It sinks into my arms right away and provides great moisture . Hope Amazon wo n't discontinue it because I 'd love to buy again .
 If you 've used other brands of body butters , you may have been drenched in a gloppy mess . The Pacifica body butters are very effective moisturizers , but the cream sinks in well , and the fragrance is so pleasant . Love the fig scent !
 I absolutely LOVE this skin cream . The fresh scent , the texture , the resultant soft skin . Excellent !
 I love this scent . My friends always ask me what I am wearing -LRB- when I use the perfume -RRB- . I think Oprah even commented on this scent as being one of her favorites . However , I cant use it because is makes my skin itch . It is very strong in scent and I would caution you if you have sensitive skin or allergies you may be like me and unable to wear it . If you dont have those issues , ENJOY because it does smell great . One of my friends will be very happy to get this from me !!
 A toenail clipper seems a very mundane item to review . However , I prefer good quality when I can afford it , and this clipper proved to be well designed and made . Actually , I also use it for my fingernails , which are thick enough to challenge a cheap drug store variety clipper .
 I went on Amazon for some new clippers and found these , which are about twice the price of some of the cheaper ones ... but they are gorgous . Brushed metal , very sharp , beautiful shape ... These make an excellent centerpiece for any bathroom ; just leave them out , let people see them and the Jones ' will be trying to keep up with you . More , they come with an emery board built onto a plastic tray the clippers slide into . The thing about this emery board is that it 's metal and very very aggressive , so if you want to use one on your toenails , or finger nails as I use this whole unit for , perfect ... you 'll be making them nice and smooth really fast , and NOT WEARING YOUR EMERY BOARD DOWN !!!!! In the end , great clippers , I recommend .
 It 's about time . I do n't know why I did n't get these years ago . I also do n't know how much money I 've wasted over the years with the standard style clippers from the local department stores . I 've had these for about a year now and they 're still as sharp as they were when they were new . They work great for my fingernails also . . `` Great buy ''
 That 's It - exfoliator/softener . I do n't like lotions with the greasy , slippery feeling and the water-based creams are useless . Dual Action with Alpha Hydroxy formula is the correct combination and the ticket to `` smooth '' and supple skin . I found the 4oz tube - loved it ; could not locate it in a larger size and now can not locate it in the 4oz tube either . I am going to Africa in 2 months - would love the opportunity to purchase 20 or more of the 4oz tube unless you have larger containers.Thank you - Cietta
 This cream is for people who truly have the driest of dry skin.It works especially well during the dry aired winter months which leave your skin feeling tight , itchy and looking cracked and flaky . It works best if applied within a few minutes after showering , while your skin is still moist . This formulation is very rich in moisturizers and leaves your skin smooth and moisturized all day after just one application . Another great thing about this cream is the clean scent it has , not heavy and perfumy like other creams . The richness of the cream is easily absorbed when applied to your skin without that greasy or oily look you get from other creams . It works great on my dry skin , and I love it !!!!!!!!
 theres nothing fancy about this product , just works fine everytime you use it , i never hesitate to purchase this for all dry skin needs
 The scent is rich 've always used . I bought it and came on the agreed date and the perfume is genuine . would buy another for the price you pay .
 I had a bottle of this before and it smells the exact same , and comes in the right bottle . I was a little sketch by it being almost half price , but it smells legit .
 I love this product . It is one of the only highlighters that is n't all glittery or overwhelming . Very subtle glow . Does not go on as pink as it looks .
 I do like this blush . It does not make you look like a cupie doll at the fair . You can build it to your desired effect . It looks more natural than all the blushes I have tried , has a very nice suttle effect on the cheeks , but also color . Blends very nice and has a lasting effect . I do recommend it .
 I love this ! I 've colored my hair for several years , and I 've used many products . This is , by far , the best I 've ever used ! The color is gorgeous and natural looking . The conditioner that 's included left my hair silky , soft , and manageable . The best thing , by far , is that with red coloring , my hair usually continues to bleed color for a few days -- but not with Hydrience ! Since the color is staying true , I wo n't have to color my hair as soon as I 've had to in the past , using other products .
 This product colored my hair great -- it 's been two weeks since I used it and I 'm not seeing any fading , which is a good thing . The only thing I was n't too thrilled about was that it seemed to dry out my hair and the conditioner in the box did n't seem to bring it back to a good condition . It took about a week to get it conditioned after using this product . Pros
 I love red . Mixed with my brown hair , the color came out WONDERFUL . Normally , when I buy haircolor , it never comes out the color I want . I 'd recommend this to everyone and buy it myself .
 I was very pleased with the Clairol Hydrience haircolor . It was easy to use and very gentle on my hair . The color was very close to the color shown on the box , which is n't always the case from my experience in using haircolor . It left my hair shiny and in good condition . I 'd definitely recommend this product .
 I think this product was great . The overall result was nice ; the only problem I had was the smell was a bit overwhelming . But the color turned out exactly how I 'd wanted , and I 'd definitely recommend this product to friends and family . Although it 's a bit expensive , it 's worth every penny . I do believe I 'll continue to use this kind when I decide to color my hair again . It did n't seem to damage my hair , as other haircolors have in the past -- my hair was even soft afterwards . And it has n't faded yet , which is also the sign of a good haircolor .
 I LOVE IT !! It did n't dry out my hair like other haircolor . The color is wonderful . It makes my hair vibrant , shiny , and SOFT !!
 Ca n't fault this product . Purchased from the states as it 's the only suncream that does not irritate my husband 's very sensitive skin . Soaks in immediately , non-greasy , non-perfumed . Delivered very quickly .
 My family has used only No-Ad for the past 10 years . It goes on thick and gives a really good protective coating for being outdoors in the sun . The quality of this sunscreen is unbeatable , I highly recommend this product !
 I bought this for my mum for Valentine 's Day , and she loved it . The bath salts are very fragrant , so one need n't use much at a time . The crock is lovely , but will chip easily , so be careful how you handle it . I would recommend this for any occasion - birthday , Valentine 's Day , Mother 's Day , or just a way to say `` I Love You '' .
 I must say I was skeptical when I saw the price I was getting this for , but this is a great product . It is FULL of salts and smells and looks just beautiful ! You can tell that the product - especially the crock is quality made . Full price would seem a bit much as it is only approx . 8 '' tall and about 5 '' wide ; but on sale it is a steal !!!!
 First off , this little ceramic pot is a great bargain for ten dollars . It comes with a gauze bag stuffed with fragrant lavender bath salts , a quaint little wooden scoop attached to the crock with a chiffon-esque ribbon , and did I mention it smells great ? Drop two scoops of the purple salts , and you 're set . I bought it for my mother , and now we have to fight to get her out of the tub . Myself also . But , be careful . The crock is ceramic , so it WILL break if it falls from an elevated height . And when you deplete your salt cache , you can either full it back with the salts , or use it as a decorative vase.Remember , keep away from heights.Buy this product if you like fragrant bargains .
 The vase that comes with the Wine Country Ceramic Bath Salt Gift Set is very beautiful . I gave this to my mother in law and she was very happy . She says the bath salt is great , truely relaxing , and a great buy on Amazon !
 I love the refreshed colors ! The only way to make this product easier to use is if somebody else performs the coloring process for me . This is the only product I have found that works successfully for me , as I have allergic reacts to most semi-permanent & permanent dyes . The gentle process does not bother my scalp or skin , and leaves behind a very mild & pleasant smell .
 The medium reddish brown Clairol Loving Care hair color is great . It covers my gray , for about three weeks it has a red cast to it , and gradually fades after about a month . It does n't completely wash out which for me is a good thing . My hair looks really natural with this product .
 I am having trouble finding my Clairol Natural Instincts color in stores locally . Having to order online to get color .
 I wrote to the manufacturer and they just said they changed the line and would n't reconsider . This is the perfect hair coloring product for me . It not only covers my gray , but makes it golden and lifts the color of the brown hair . My best friend , who is very snobbish about such things , said it always looks like it was professionally done . I am very chemically sensitive , and though this does have a smell to it , it is lacking some of the chemicals that really cause problems . Glad I can still get it through Amazon .
 I Love this product and have used it for years . I wish they had not stopped making this color . It had been hard finding a comparable product and color .
 Great to be able to continue to buy Loving Care.Don ' t know what Clairol was thinking.Easy & fast to order a supply .
 This is the only hair color that I can use . It works for me since I have no other option because I am allergic to other hair color . Unfortunately , Clairol has opted to discontinue this product because I was told it had a small market share . Shame on them , because there are other people like me that are allergic to hair color , and once the supply runs out - we are out of luck . I am very angry that the bottom line has once again become a priority and I hope they will reconsider taking the product off the market.I was able to purchase 6 packages on Amazon but many internet stores are either out of stock or much higher priced since it was discontinued by Clairol .
 i have been using this color/product for approximately 12 years , tried others , but like this best ... get many compliments on how `` natural '' it looks on me ... PLEASE do n't discontinue !!!!!! thanks amazon for the ability for many of us to buy this thru you , i can not find it in any of my town stores either ... frustrating !!!!!!
 Okay , we need to band together and notify Clairol that it is totally wrong to stop producing the temporary hair color , Loving Care . I was so excited when I found out I could subscribe to receive this hard to find product on Amazon and am aggravated now . Evidently there are enough of us that we can potentially make a difference by contacting Clairol at 1-800-CLAIROL to protest ! Like quite a few of you , I do not want to have roots and like how natural the temporary color blends in and gradually wears out . I would rather color every 3 weeks for 30 minutes than have the roots . Grrrrrrr ! Please , let 's inundate Clairol with our protests and maybe they will actually listen to their customers .
 I have been using Loving Care for years , but it 's been harder and harder to find . Walmart has stopped carrying it , and CVS only has one or two boxes at a time , if that . I Googled the product and was amazed and relieved to find that you carry it . Guess a lot of people do n't use it because it 's not permanent color , but that 's exactly why I like it . It fades as my roots grow out so they are not as noticeable , and it 's very easy to apply . I will buy this product as long as Clairol makes it . If they stop , I do n't know what I 'll do because I do n't want to switch to permanent color . Thanks so much , Amazon !
 My mother is allergic to both amonia and peroxide . She has been using this product for more than 6 months without any allergic reactions the color stays in longer than some of the similar products she previously used . We have had problems finding this product in stores so purchasing online is an excellent option and saves a whole bunch of time in trying to find it.The package was received before the estimated time stated on Amazon which I also think is excellent .
 This is the one color Clairol stopped carrying -LRB- and have since reformulated to a nice but much darker hue-I would have preferred it stay as it was . I was very happy to see it on line and the ordering process and product were perfect .
 I have been using this product for many years and suddenly it is no longer available . I found it with Amazon and am thrilled . Thank you so much Amazon .
 With this non-permanent , ammonia-free , gentle hair coloring product , I can avoid allergic reactions and let the gray grow in gracefully .
 -LSB- I 've posted this in the UK listing too - the info applies on both sides of the pond -RSB- I 'm a big fan of this product and I 've used several of the medium/dark browns from the same range . I like the Medium Ash Brown the best because I find that cooler browns look good with my green eyes , but the darker ones are nice too.I do n't have that many grey hairs , but I have enough that I want to colour my hair . For years , I used home dye kits that contained ammonia and peroxide -LRB- anything you have to mix with an accelerator will contain these -RRB- . They did a huge amount of damage to my hair , making it brittle and frizzy . A couple of years ago , I decided to only use products that would stain the hair rather than those that would lighten the hair . First I used henna based dye , but it was too messy and time consuming , and it smelled bad . Then I switched to Tints of Nature `` Changes '' in the Dianthus shade , which I loved , but it seems to have been discontinued.After much searching for a good compromise between more healthy/less permanent options and budget/availability issues , I 've found that Loving Care gives really great results . It 's easy to use , smells fine -LRB- which is important for me because I 'm asthmatic -RRB- , and rinses out easily . I find it does n't stain my pillows or sheets , even though most of them are white - just make sure your hair is totally dry when you go to bed . If any dye or tinted water drips onto your clothes or towels , I 've found that it comes out in the wash just fine because this is only a stain rather than a hardcore dye.Note
 I contacted Clairol expressing my deep disappointment about the discontinuing of Loving Care , the only temporary hair color product still available . They said it was not sufficiently popular to keep marketing . Everyone who loves this product as much as I do , please write and tell Clairol . They do n't seem to believe we 're out here .
 I find this product to be a savior . Too bad about the purple hue occasionally in the sun when it is washing out , that is fine with me . Last time I used the regular line of Natural Instincts most of the hair on the top of my head fell out in huge clumps , leaving oozing welts . Also all my other body hair fell out including my eyebrows , and most of my eyelashes . I did the allergy test as suggested , but after only five minutes the burning and swelling was apparent . My son who was 4 at the time was wailing as he watched me try to comb out my hair as it was dropping from me like I was on chemo . Had to wear a hat and wait for several months before a hairstylist would consider trying to cut it . This is safe and works well , but I leave it on for up to 60 minutes , no problems , and fabulous results . I hope they do n't discontinue it . I have been warned if I were stupid enough to try to use dye with the chemical in virtually all brown dyes in the USA -LRB- banned in Europe -RRB- I could die from an allergic reaction . Now ten years later they still sell it in their products . It took about six years for my hair to stabilize , and grow back in , but I still have bald patches on my legs and arms . I was told this related to my severe latex allergy . Look up black latex if you doubt my story . My hair grew back much finer , but I am glad to have it , and that it grows so fast . A safe product -- that should stay on the market for those of us who have no other choice . -LRB- No hair stylist will dye my hair either after hearing about the reaction , foil or no foil . -RRB-
 I have been using Medium Ash Brown 077 for at least ten years and think it is the best thing on the market . I hope my review will cause Clairol to reconsider . It will make me so happy to find it back on the market . Please Clairol !!!!!
 This is the only hair color I can use and I am glad I found it on Amazon . It seems to be getting harder to find in the stores . I am allergic to peroxide , so this is the only product that will work for me . Thank you Amazon !
 This is the best hair care color out there and unfortunately they 've taken it off the market and it is verrry difficult to find AND it 's more expensive now . But I was glad to be able to find it here at Amazon because it 's the only product that matches my hair color exactly , which is what I want.In addition , since it 's a rinse and not permanent , it gradually fades and looks more natural from start to finish ! The ash brown works best on grays that used to be lighter as in my case , then the rest of my hair .
 I have used this product for a number of years and find it very satisfactory . I especially appreciate the fact that the product has no damaging ingredients and that it gives the hair a very natural look . Mostly I have been disappointed by the fact that this product is no longer carried in the market so it means I will have to chose another product which is permanent and definitely not as easy to use . Recently I was able to purchase some of this product at Amazon .
 FOR SOME REASON ALL OF THE STORES IN SOUTHERN MAINE HAVE STOPPED SELLING THIS PRODUCT THAT I 'VE USED FOR YEARS , SO THANK HEAVENS I FOUND IT THROUGH AMAZON . . THIS HAIR COLOR IS SUCH AN EXCITING COLOR AND I ALWAYS GET COMPLIMENTS ON MY HAIR !! THANK YOU !!!
 My wife has been using this product well over 20 years . Thank you Amazon for having this product available . It can not be found in local markets.Clairol Natural Instincts Loving Care Color , 080 Auburn -LRB- Pack of 3 -RRB-
 Love this product . I have been using Loving Care for 10 years . I use it every 7 days or so and I never have to worry about my gray roots showing . It makes my hair more manageable and gives it lots of shine . I use a color that is 2 shades lighter than my own hair color so the gray looks like high lights . My hair dresser even asked me where I had gotten my hair high lighted . What I really like about this product is that it is not permanent . So it never damages my hair . Please put this product back on the market . You are missing a great opportunity to market to us graying baby boomers .
 This is the hair care product my wife really likes , but could n't locate in any stores in our city . Prompt delivery of our order which arrived in good condition .
 I have used this product for many years , and has become unavailable at most retail stores . -LRB- The only color still on the shelves are black - at limited quantities -RRB- I was happy when a salesclerk advised me that a friend of hers had ordered online , and needless to say , I ordered it when I saw it . The delivery time was great . I definetly would recommend this product if you want temporary color , good coverage of grey hair , and good conditioning . Thanks
 I have used Loving Care for 20 years and my graying hair was never allowed to surface because I colored it every month . Suddenly I could not find it anywhere , trying all the local stores I used to purchase from . I was delighted to discover it on Amazon and surprised to find that I was not the only one who was having this problem . I used a peroxide color on my hair one time and it felt like straw - plus the roots showed up just as quick . I will go gray before I will ever put peroxide on my hair again . I have very fine hair , and now thinning , and the Loving Care product really gives it the healthy moisture boost it needs . I do n't know why it is no longer available in stores , but please do n't stop making this product available . Thank you Amazon .
 This is a good product . It is gentle and has no offensive odor . My hair feels healthy and shiny . The color is much brighter and more flattering than my natural color which was becoming dull . The color looks incredibly natural . When applying it , I was worried it was going to be too dark but it is a very nice deep chestnut shade and is a close match to my natural color . The only problem is that it did n't cover my gray hairs 100 % -- I probably got about 90 % coverage . I am about 15-20 % gray and most of the hairs are covered but some are still visible . They are a lot less noticeable but not completely gone , especially around the temples . I took a lot of care to saturate that area with the dye so I am not sure what happened . Perhaps I did n't leave it on long enough -LRB- I left it on 20 minutes -RRB- . Next time I will leave it on longer.Overall , this is a great product and I would highly recommend it for people who are wary of permanent dyes with all their harsh chemicals .
 I was very disappointed when `` Loving Care '' stopped show up at the cosmetic departments , was I am grateful that it is still being sold on line . As usual I am very pleased at the results of this product .
 Great product . Easy to use . Go one shade lighter than what it calls for . Cheaper than salons . Does n't damage hair .
 I have used Clairol Natural Instincts Loving Care Color 079 for about 3 years . I have found it to be a very quick and easy hair color to use . I have also found out that the dark brown color 079 can only be purchased on Amazon , and not at many other places . The easy to use container that it comes in , makes it ideal to use only part of the hair color in the container , and save the rest for another day .
 On the positive the color is very naturalNegative
 This product is hard to find . I had looked many places . The price here is very good also . I love this product for covering gray hair but looking very natural and it is very easy to use . The condition of your hair is even better after you use it .
 Your hair will feel like you 've had a salon conditioning treatment ! Adds so much shine ! I love it !
 I have been Loving Care , medium brown mixed with reddish brown and sometimes auburn.The product does not have peroxide or ammonia and that 's why I 've used it all theseyears . Their new product has either ammonia or peroxide ... both of which I 'm allergicto . I 've been ordering Loving Care like crazy but I will run out of it because theydiscontinued it . I have no idea what I will use next but I do n't want gray hair toshow .
 This product is great for us that can not stand gray hair and have sensitive skin . It covers the gray and looks natural . Too bad that Clairol is discontinuing this product . I really do n't know what I am going to do . I have tried most of the products that claim to be safe , but this is the only one that worked for me .
 I just dyed my hair for the first time ever -LRB- except maybe some highlights in the past -RRB- . After discussing it with friends on Facebook and in e-mails , I opted for temporary color -- Clairol Loving Care Natural Instincts color 77 -LRB- medium ash brown -RRB- . The product was very easy to use . I opted not to do the 48-hour allergy test wait , but do n't have any other allergies , so I was n't too worried . I kept the color on for 30 minutes.It says it lasts 6-12 shampooings . I wash my hair just about every day -LRB- and at least 6 days a week -RRB- , so I guess this means every two weeks . So , I 'm going to purchase the 3-pack from Amazon so I can keep it up.I 've uploaded my before and after photos , if you want to see how it looked on my hair . But that will vary from person to person . The directions suggest snipping a bit of hair to do a test to see how long you will want to keep it on.If you have permed or previously colored hair , please be sure to note the special instructions on the directions .
 Thanks , Amazon for stocking this color . All retail stores -LRB- grocery/drug/discount -RRB- have eliminated color # 738 , and you can go on a wild goose chase all over any major city looking for it . It is only available online at Amazon and a handful of other sources . I just joined your subscription program for this product , and am very pleased with the program . You shipped my first order automatically at a 15 % discount . And you already have the best price over other online merchants . I highly recommend the subscription program for those who use this color and product regularly .
 First of all , thank you Amazon for offering the dark blonde shade . It is impossible to find in stores in my area , and even the Clairol website does n't list this color!This product gave me great color , exactly the shade I wanted . The first day it was a tiny bit too dark , albeit a rich and very pretty light brunette . This was probably because the instructions say not to wash your hair for 24 hours after coloring . After washing I got the dark blonde promised.The first time I used it , it lasted easily 2 weeks despite daily hair washing . I was very pleased.The second time I used it , I swam laps in the pool on days 3 and 4 and the color faded quickly . But I was n't particularly surprised as I think it 's logical that a half hour in a chlorinated pool will be equivalent to several shampoos.I found it very easy to use . The instructions say NOT to apply it to just-washed hair , and also not to apply it to hair with `` product build-up '' . Since I use mousse and hairspray every day , my solution is to wash my hair before bed and then color first thing in the morning.As recommended , I did a color test on a sample of my gray hairs , and found out that 15 minutes is sufficient for my hair.The box I have calls the product `` volumizing '' , but that is not true at all for me . Although my hair is wonderfully soft after coloring , it is also very limp . I assume the added pigment weighs down my hair . Since my natural hair is already on the limp side , I could do without this . My solution is to apply extra mousse and hairspray to my hair.This product is a great idea for people who have never colored their hair before or are otherwise wary of using longer-lasting products.Selling it in a 3-pack makes sense , because the color is temporary so you are going to be needing it often . You ca n't beat the price .
 With this product disappearing from shelves , it was important for me to find it somewhere ! Thank goodness for Amazon ! I love this product from Clairol , temporary haircolor , no ammonia , no peroxide , easy to do at home , the perfect touch up for someone who does n't want to spend hours in a salon and the outrageous money to boot . Finding this on Amazon made my day ! It arrived quickly and I can only hope it will still be around in the future .
 I have been using Loving Care since the 1960 's and loved this product for its lack of peroxide and amonia , making it extra gentle to my hair which is very fine . Yes , it does n't last as long as the Natural Instincts colorant that contains peroxide , but when I did attempt to try this , alot of my hair became brittle and broke off into a mass of split ends . It took quite awhile for my hair to recover from the harsh effects of using Natural Instincts and after that disturbing experience , I gratefully returned to using gentle Loving Care 's Medium Golden Brown # 078 . Recently , however , I also was finding it more and more difficult to find this product . All the major retail stores were no longer stocking this product . Well , I e-mailed Clairol directly , and , as I suspected , they informed me that due to a decline in sales of the Natural Instincts Loving Care line , they felt they now had to be more competitive with the other well-known haircolor companies by discontinuing Loving Care so they could focus more on their more `` permanent '' line of haircoloring . To this consumer , I received this information as a proverbial slap in the face to all we women who so desperately still require a no peroxide/amonia product in order to protect our hair.What it all comes down to is a `` strictly business '' decision on the part of Clairol -- unfortunately , profit , profit , profit is the name of the game ! I am still stunned that Clairol would simply eliminate Loving Care with a wave of their greedy hands when so many women have faithfully bought this product for decades ! So thank you so much Amazon for enabling us to continue purchasing Loving Care through you for as long as you can do this .
 I have skin allergies and this one does n't break me out . Thanks for carrying this hard to find color !
 Ordering this item was so easy ! i could n't find this after 3 attempts in 3 different stores . naturally , i go to amazon.com and they delivered it in good time . My hairdo and i thank you ! just in time ...
 Loving Care in the dark/med blond shades are becoming harder to find . The WalMart & Walgreens in my area do not carry them anymore . I need the no amonia , no peroxide formula because of skin rash with other products . Thank you for making this product available .
 I , too , am extremely allergic to ammonia and peroxide products . Loving Care , which does not have these harsh chemicals , has worked very well for me for over twenty years . Now , however , that Clairol has discontinued the wonderful product I will have no options but to go gray . The price of the remaining product found through Amazon continues to go up and up , and soon I am sure there will be no more left anywhere to be found . Once I can not find any more Loving Care , I will take stronger action.Because I feel abandoned by a company that I have supported very well these many years , I intend to boycott all clairol products , and my teenage daughters and my many students will also refuse to purchase any clairol products since the company seems only to understand and to care for the `` bottom line . `` With this message I call upon all disappointed and betrayed customers of Clairol to boycott all Clairol products and to spread the word to everyone you know , especially to the younger girls and women who seem to be now the company 's target market.My husband , a chemist , has suggested the possibility of contacting a company in China to duplicate the product . What do you all think ?
 I love this hair color because it has no ammonia or peroxide . I had problems with loss of hair with other hair color and found Clairol colored without side effects . When I found they were discontinuing the product I bought every bottle I could find through internet and drugstores .
 I 'm not the only Loving Care user who has been disappointed to find that this product has been discontinued and is no longer available in stores . Thanks to Amazon and Impossible Discounts for still offering it . And the price was a fraction of the usual retail . The three pace was factory sealed and also carefully shipped . This is a hair color withour ammonia or peroxide . It is much simpler and easier to use than its replacement . It is not permanent so it can be reapplied anytime to touch up . And it only takes a half hour . The bottle can hold up to three or four applications .
 Product is no longer available is stores so this was great for the wife , cheaper than in the store as well . Product performed as promised , did not seem to be outdated stock . Now I have to order more
 This is the hair color my wife uses . She likes it so much she looked in all the stores in our town of 90,000 and could n't find it . That 's why we turned to the internet and to Amazon . Thanks for carrying it !
 This does work really well to cover grey hairs if you have only a few greys . I use medium brown the most . If you leave it on too long it does tend to leave a coppery bluish tint to your hair but it 's only noticeable in the sun . I wash my hair everyday and this lasts me about 2 weeks -LRB- using a mild shampoo for colored hair -RRB- .
 Clairol # 76 is hard to find in stores but the perfect color for my hair . I finally found it on Amazon.com . I thought Amazon.com only sold books but found out they sell everything ! If you are looking to color your hair and do n't want permanent damaging color , this is the product for you . Thank you !
 Excellent product - colors the gray without changing the original hair color . I think it has been discontinued . I will miss it !
 I have used this product for many years . I can apply it in the morning to color my hair and sideburns . After an hour in place I wash it off . Generally I use it weekly.Some conditioners apparently interact with the produce to produce a purplish color . Since I live in Baltimore , I tell people that I am a fan of the Ravens . However , I can usually avoid this unwanted effect if I apply the product every 3 or 4 days .
 Great place to find this color ! This is a hard to find color , and I was very happy to find it here . My order was processed very quickly and shipped super fast . I was amazed how smooth this transaction was and the product is exactly what I was looking for . I will definately order this again and again !
 Use these salts in your next bath ... the greatest way to relax ! This was a very nice product and the company took good care of me despite some high shipping charges . It was worth the money .
 These lavender bath products smell just wonderful !
 I 've never colored my hair before so I was n't sure how it would turn out . The directions were so easy to follow that even a beginner like me could do it . I loved the way it made my hair look afterward and it did n't make my hair feel slimy or stiff like I thought might happen . Loved this product and so did my husband . I 'll buy this whenever I need to cover my roots .
 I 'd buy this again . The directions are easy to follow . And I liked the results I received with this hair color . And it leaves your hair soft and shiny .
 I really liked the color of my hair after using Clairol Hydrience Color , but better yet was the toll it did n't take on my hair . Normally , after dying my hair , it loses its luster and takes a few weeks to recuperate . This time , though , I did n't experience that . Another benefit was that the fumes were not too noxious while dying . I recommend it highly .
 This product did n't leave my hair feeling dry like other coloring products I 've used in the past . It was very easy to apply . I 'd definitely use this product again .
 I really enjoyed this product . I love the color . I also enjoyed how it made my hair feel so soft and manageable . I did n't like the smell , but hair color usually does n't smell good . I feel this product can be recommended to friends and family . I know they 'll like it as much as I do .
 I loved this product . The color was great . I was afraid to dye my hair that color but when I did it , it looked great . I liked how easy it was and it really did n't smell like hair dye . The color was exact to its color on the box -- I liked that too . I 'll tell my friends and family about this product because it 's great .
 This is a great hair coloring product . It left my hair soo soft and very well conditioned . It did n't feel like I colored my hair . Also the color looked great on me .
 I have been using this product for years . I love it . But what I really love is the conditioner that comes with the hair color kit . There is nothing like it on the market . I have tried every hair conditioner -LRB- including Clairol -RRB- that is sold on the shelves , but does not have the same effect as the one sold with the hair color kit . I wish this product was sold separately .
 This is a wonderful product for coarse , thin hair especially . I highly recommend . I received it timely and in good shape .
 I love this product . It is one of the only highlighters that is n't all glittery or overwhelming . Very subtle glow . Does not go on as pink as it looks .
 I do like this blush . It does not make you look like a cupie doll at the fair . You can build it to your desired effect . It looks more natural than all the blushes I have tried , has a very nice suttle effect on the cheeks , but also color . Blends very nice and has a lasting effect . I do recommend it .
 This is a great sunscreen and a good price . It contains Parasol 1789 -LRB- avobenzone -RRB- which protects against the upper UVA spectrum that many sunscreens dont , even if they say they are broad-spectrum . The only effective uva blockers that are FDA approved are avobenzone , titanium dioxide , and zinc oxide .
 Not heavy or gooey . Lasts as long as the label says . Does not feel like you have lotion on you -LRB- feels dry -RRB- .
 Great product . Great price . Does n't contain the ingredients that I seem to have an allergic reaction to . I have enjoyed all of the AD Free products taht I have ever used , and definitely recommend this product
 this was rated number 1 by scientists who tested 20 different sunblocks . apply every two hours especially if you perspire and after swimming .
 I do n't know why this product was discontinued . It is a wonderful base under foundation and creates an illuminating soft shimmer . Brightens the face with a natural look because it 's very sheer . A little goes along way . It can be used over the entire face , under foundation ... or just a tiny dab on the brow and cheek bones for highlighting . Buff love is a good neutral tone and compliments a variety of skin tones .
 I have tried many brighteners , both cheap and expensive and this one rates the highest with me . It blends over foundation very nicely -LRB- some sit right on top of the skin -RRB- , and adds a sheer layer of luminescence to the skin ... best thing about it ? COLOR . Not white , not neutral but a sheer sheer tinge of the most beautiful pinky/rose color ... looks like you 've been just kissed by the sun . Love it .
 So soft and shimmery . Great highlighter over a BB cream ! I have sensitive skin and this did n't make me break out !
 I just got this yesterday and I flipped :-RRB- It is exactly what I was looking for . It has a really great texture and the color is so smooth , just a very share sensation of sparkling , very natural . I got the peechy something shade and I love it . It work well on freshly tanned skin because it does give a slight bronzy touch to the skin . Hope you all love it if you get it : -RRB-
 Love this illuminating lotion as it makes my skin look expensive and heavenly . If you like a rosy radiant complexion this highlighter is for you . The lotion has a peachy pink undertone .
 The color is fabulous and my hair feels and looks healthier than it has in a long time ! I 'll definitely keep using this product .
 The color was rich and left my hair shiny . However , it was a bit dark for me . The smell was n't as bad as some other coloring products I 've used in the past . I 'd use this again but in another shade .

 Got the item very quick and it is 100 % the same thign you get at Cartier except you pay a whole lot less . Highly recommended !
 This fragrance 's creations dates back to 1994 ans is one of most successful creations alongside the Roma fragrance . Laura is classified as a gentle floral , not at all overwhelming her personality . Fresh top
 I color my hair with the Nice N Easy Grey Solutions and use this 3-4 weeks after I color to cover the roots . It does not cover the gray as completely as the Gray Solutions , but it does work and keeps my color even and my roots hidden until I can do the full color again . It works really fast - I have 2 young kids and work full-time , so I appreciate that I can put this on for 10 extra minutes before I shower in the morning and I 'm out the door !
 Clairol Nice n Easy Touch Up is the best when you need a touch up fast . It is true in color and for me lasts about 3 weeks . Do n't know what I would do without it .
 this products is so easy to use , you can color your roots & be out the door somewhere in a short time
 easy to use , and really blended with my current color that i get at the salon . so easy that my boyfriend helped put it on !!
 Not sure how people are saying that this does n't cover . Maybe they are using a lighter color ? I have bright pink and black hair and my stylist mistakenly went over one of my black roots with bleach and made it pink . So i had hot pink roots and the rest was black . I made the color from the directions in the box , applied it to the root and BAM . . i have a full chunk of jet black hair now . I did n't have to mess with a HUGE bottle of black dye to do about 2 inches worth of hair .
 I use this product about every 2-3 weeks . My hair is colored auburn red and this root touch up kit works perfectly . Red hair color does n't last all that long but with this kit my color last substantially longer than with out it . For the price and convenience , it is perfect !
 Worked fast and well . Not sure if it will make my hair fall out yet as I have just used it today . No burning , easy directions , overall good coverage and color . I will still have to use some toner to get to platinum -LRB- Take the yellow out -RRB- . Trying punky color toner in a few days . Wish me luck !
 I never use all-hair color anymore as this product is permanent and I use it at least every two weeks . It does n't drip or make a mess . I leave it on longer than suggested ... maybe 20 minutes . There are coupons out there and I never pay over $ 6.00 for it in local stores .
 I had been looking for Nice & Easy 's Medium Auburn to touch up my hair . Unfortunately , you folks did not have the Medium Auburn , so I did the next best thing . I ordered a dark auburn and a light auburn and mixed them . It worked out well , even though it cost twice as much . At least I now know what to do if I ca n't find my regular shade . Thank you ever so much .
 Just used it last night . Looks natural as can be . Shiny and healthy . I thought it best to use a darker than normal shade since my roots are very dark brown with alot of gray and the longer hair is reddish brown naturally .
 I am very very careful about products that I use for my hair . I chose this item because it is not harmful to the hair . I have waist-length hair , so this is extremely important to me since I need my hair to hold its quality throughout the entire life of each strand . I have dirty blonde natural colored hair which is tinted and highlighted to about as natural-a-looking color as possible without looking bleached blonde -LRB- think Reese Witherspoon -RRB- , so i use this product in between my expensive colorings to save $ . Anyway , I special order this discontinued color because the 9 is not quite light enough & ends up looking a little brassy , but the 9.5 is perfect ! I also really like that it 's not really permanent , so by the time i make it in to my hair stylist , she can do her thing without any `` lines '' showing through from the different colorings . My hair is done by Michelle Pfeiffer 's old hair stylist , so u know I am a perfectionist !
 First , the service from Amazon.com , as always , is excellent . As for the No-Ad sunscreen , it works great . It stays on and I do n't get burnt . SPF 30 is just about right for me as I spend a lot of time in the sun , at the beach . Buy the way , do you think that No-Ad will send me a free bottle of their product for such a glowing review ? LOL , just kidding.NO-AD Sunblock Lotion , SPF 30 16 fl oz -LRB- 475 ml -RRB-
 I was a bit skeptical at first . I did n't think this product could produce the results it promised . But after using this product , my hair looks healthier and is easier to manage . No more frizzies . Now my naturally curly hair stays put and looks so shiny . I 'd definitely recommend this product to anyone who has problems with split ends and/or flyaway hair .
 I 've been growing out a permanent haircolor treatment , and the ends of my hair have been dry and tangle-prone . This product helped restore a healthier look to my hair , helped my hair tangle less when I combed it after washing , and gave it extra body . My hair is fine , and I did n't feel that this weighed down my hair at all , which can happen with some conditioners .
 I loved the Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Reconstructor . When it arrived , I could smell it through the box . I have very curly hair , so I 'm very picky about my hair products . It 's hard for me to find a conditioner that I can use , then run my fingers through my hair . Now I can say I 've found the perfect conditioner . It 's even perfect for everyday use . I 'd definitely recommend this product to a friend .
 Having naturally curly hair , I have been through all brands and kinds of conditioner , and I keep coming back to this one . Salon brands tend to build up on my hair , and drugstore brands mostly just do n't work . But with Aussie 3 Minute Miracle , I found a nice balance . It leaves my hair soft and fluffy , but still conditions it so that it curls and does not get fly-away or frizzy . I 'd definitely recommend it .
 After trying this product , I love it and plan to continue using it . I have long , permed hair that gets frizzy and this Aussie product really helped with that problem . It 's a great conditioner and smells wonderful . I had to use only a small amount of the product , even though my hair is long . A little bit goes a long way , and it does n't weigh my hair down . I 'd recommend it to anyone .
 This product leaves my hair feeling soft and healthy . I 've tried other conditioners and none leave my hair in such good condition . I also like Paul Mitchel products . But I love Aussie . I died my hair and it became dry and lifeless was splitting and dull . This product made my hair healthy looking and feeling again . Highly recommend it .
 I have very long , very thick hair . This is the only conditioner I have ever found that lets me brush out my hair without making tangles . It leaves my hair smooth and shiny without split ends .
 I have been using 3 Minute Miracle for several years and have found it gives body and improves the texture of thin hair . It is simple to use when showering - shampoo first , then apply 3 Minute Miracle , and by the time washing the body is done , it 's time to rinse out the body builder - simple !
 I loved this product !!! It 's so fabulous ! I color treat my hair quite regularly so the luster is often missing . This product renewed my hair with the luster it had lost . It did n't weigh my hair down . I 'd recommend this product to all people with lifeless hair . It takes the dry out and replaces it with moisture !!
 Overall , I think this product was very nice . I was n't too fond of the smell , but that 's how all Aussie products smell . I think after using it for a week , my hair has gotten softer and the ends look nicer . I think it does work better than other products , but I would n't use this as a daily conditioner . I 'd recommend it to friends and family who have slightly damaged hair they 'd like to replenish .
 I 've used a lot of different hair-repair conditioners in the past . I have long hair and had it permed about seven months ago . I used this every time I washed my hair , and could tell a difference in the ends of my hair after the second time I used it . I 'd recommend it to anyone -- I think it 's a great product . I think the price may be a little steep , but I 'd still buy it .
 I tried this product because I blow-dry and curl my hair every day , which does plenty of damage to the outer layer of my hair . The first time I tried it , it made my hair seem heavy and bland . But after letting it '' `` soak in , '' '' my hair looked great for the next few days ! I 'd recommend this product be used every couple of days , not every single day . I also like the '' `` Aussie-grape '' '' smell of their products . I 'd recommend it to family and friends with damaged hair , although I 'd like to see it sold in a smaller bottle for people who would n't use it every day .
 I ADORE this leave-in conditioner ! It smells nice , it works great , and it does n't leave a nasty feeling residue in my hair ! I have very curly hair , and live in a humid climate . This stuff was GREAT for humid days . I use it EVERY day after showering , before I put in any other products , and it helps keep my hair from damage due to styling products . If I use just the conditioner , it leaves my hair soft and less frizzy . It 's WONDERFUL stuff , and Amazon has a GREAT price !
 I 've used this for years , and it 's a must-have for helping to keep my heap of curls controlled and conditioned . I use a little every night after I shower and occasionally in the morning , and it really helps to keep my curly hair from tangling and the ends from splitting/frizzing . It also has a pleasant , light scent , and it 's a good deal price-wise compared to other leave-in conditioners -LRB- many of which I 've tried and not been nearly as impressed with -RRB- . The only drawback is that I have very thick hair and thus go through a bottle of this in a month -- I wish it went a little further . Still , for the price it 's hard to beat .
 it does make your hair feel silky soft but it has a very strong aroma and stays with you all day.initially i really really hated it so i sparingly use it but you do get used to the smell ... but it is very overpowering.i wish they would make unscented ones next time
 this is a great product for my hair ! it makes my hair smooth and i have very thick and tangley hair ! so i would have to cindition and put in so much more product for it just to comb with still some tangles ! this was my savor this produt is the one and only product i use and will ever go to again ! and it is perfect fot my budget !
 I have not been able to find this conditioner anywhere until I spotted it on Amazon . Because it 's a spray mist , it 's much easier to control where and how much I want to apply , which I like because my hair is fine and most bottled conditioners weigh it down , even after ample rinsing . This spray also enhances the highlights in my hair - I do n't know why since it 's not meant to do that , but I do n't mind . The scent is wonderful and light . I purchased a 3/pk for about $ 11 with free Prime shipping so for now , I 'm a happy camper ! Thanks again Amazon ...
 I just subscribed to the three pack here on Amazon . I 've been using this for the past three months , and I must say , it really helps protect my hair . My hair is the longest it has ever been -LRB- mid back -RRB- . It 's naturally wavy , and I like to let it air dry most of the time . Even though I do n't use much heat on my hair , it still gets a little dry and tangled . I 've gone through two bottles of this already and it has helped greatly with protecting my hair and detangling it . I flat ironed my hair the other day and it was nice and healthy looking . The ingredients are minimal -LRB- yay for the aloe -RRB- , and the smell is one of my all time favorites . I 'm a sucker for blue coconut sno cones : -RRB-
 This is a very good product to use during summer time . It leaves my hair smelling great without any sticky residue on my hair . Great product to use before going swimming .
 I have been buying this product for a couple years now and it has since been discontinued at the store I was getting it from . I found it online and it 's exactly like what I have been getting in the store and at a better price ! Turns out the store did me a favor by getting rid of it so I could find it cheaper elsewhere ! Arrived on time and as described . Very Pleased with this experience .
 I 've been using this product for years and am very satisfied with the results . My hair is naturally curly and a little dry , so a leave-in conditioner is practically a necessity . Aussie Leave-In was the first leave-in conditioner I ever had good results with . I 've tried many other brands from stores and salons , but none so far have given as much non-greasy shine , plus moderate frizz control , as the Aussie Leave-In . It 's very light , so you can use a little or a lot depending on your hair , and it does n't leave a `` waxy '' feeling like some other leave-in 's can . I know some people with kind of oily hair who do n't like this product , but it 's fantastic for my hair type ! My only complaint is that stores in my area run out of it a lot , so it 's great that Amazon carries it now . It 's also great for bringing my order total to $ 25 for `` Super Saver '' free shipping !
 The best smelling and most effective leave in conditioner for the price.At least out of all the ones I 've used.Only thing is that if you have really thick hair you have to use a lot , but otherwise it 's great .
 I 've tried both Aussie Hair Insurance and also Aussie Sun-Touched Shine . Here 's what I found ... Aussie ` Sun-Touched Shine ' : Positives :1 -RRB- Smells great ! Sort of grape-y .2 -RRB- Excellent detangler .3 -RRB- Hair feels super soft , even after it is blow-dried . Negatives :1 -RRB- I have a perm , and it seems ` weighty ' and seems to flatten my curls , especially the longer layers in the back . -LRB- Shorter layers on the sides seem to have more defined curls after using this product , however . -RRB- 2 -RRB- Hair can feel almost too soft , especially on high-humidity days . On high-humidity days it can actually make hair feel greasy , almost dirty .3 -RRB- Hair takes FOREVER to blow-dry . I can spend twice as long blow-drying it , and 2 or 3 hours later it is still damp.Aussie ` Hair Insurance ' : Positives :1 -RRB- Smells great ! Sort of grape-y .2 -RRB- Helps somewhat with detangling -LRB- though not as good as the Sun-Touched Shine -RRB- .3 -RRB- Hair feels softer -LRB- though again , not as good as the Sun-Touched Shine -RRB- . Negatives :1 -RRB- Slightly less effective detangler than the Sun-Touched Shine .2 -RRB- Slightly less effective at softening hair than the Sun-Touched Shine.Because I have a perm , I prefer the Aussie Hair Insurance . But perhaps if I had straight hair , I 'd prefer the Aussie Sun-Touched Shine ? I still plan on alternating both , however , since sometimes my hair needs a good softening .
 I have color balanced my hair twice and have used plenty of products . When I was recently in Thailand my sister-in-law recommended Aussie leave-in products for my burnt , fine hair . Bought this last night and saw great results asap . After years of torturing my hair , I forgot it was wavy and could be soft . I do not use a regular conditioner only leave-ins , so if you have thicker hair you might want to do some experimenting .
 i usually spend about 20 $ on my name brand `` curly '' moouse that i put on my hair after my shower . it was OK but my hair felt too light and frizzy . i saw this on the 2011 summer must haves . . it was around TWO $ so i was iffy about it . . but i saw on the reviews that every loves it ! i finally got to try it out -LSB- im obsessed with the smell of it ! -RSB- i sprayed it in my hair after my shower and combed it through and i scrunched it a little ... let it air dry . . my hair is SO curly ... this allowed my natural curls to come out . . it smell AWESOME . . hair isnt sticky or anything ! feels SO natural and it controlled my frizz 99.9 % . . i LOVE IT ! i 'm so glad that its only a few dollars because i 'd pay SO much more for it !
 Smells good holds well is easier to apply and I can take it with me and spray it when I need it . I 'm sticking with this one it makes hair soft shiny smooth silky and it smells amazing . Really good for long curly hair . :D Im buying more tomorrow .
 I have the older bottle , with the sheild on it . Not the new one with the green circle background thing . I do n't know if the new bottle has a new formula , I am still using the sheild one . This is the first leave in cond . I 've owned since I was little . It smells really good , like the Aussie moist line . -LRB- Coconuts -RRB- I comb this through my hair after I get out of the shower and towel dry my hair a bit . I ca n't really tell if it 's working after the shower . I know it 's doing something though because I wet my hair and comb this through after I go swimming . It makes my knotty hair after swimming easy to comb through . If i want extra smoothness though , I will have to apply a cream leave in . I feel like this is a better detangler than a conditioner . Probably wo n't repurchase , because I like to try new products .
 I have used this product for years and there is nothing like it . You do n't have to use any other conditioner . About a month ago I was having a hard time finding it in the stores so when I found it on Amazon.com I was thrilled and ordered it immediately . Having it delivered directly to my house was a lot better than driving all over town looking for it . If you want a great product give it a try and do n't worry about it coming in packages of 3 you will love it enough to use that much .
 Aussie conditioner is the only product i will use , i will buy again , its worth the money , excellent , more expensive in store
 I have been using this product for several months and it has helped tremendously . My hair used to have lots of fly-aways every time I would blow dry it , and would feel rather dry . After using this it is much silkier and smoother . I went without it the other day and could see a huge difference . I only spray it about 8-9 times on my hair , and have had no trouble with it looking greasy.Also , I LOVE the smell ! Spraying a little on a brush and then brushing your hair is a great way to freshen it up .
 My hair is long and naturally curly . This is the best leave in that I have ever used for my hair . It leaves my hair with a nice ringlet curl and very soft and manageable . I have used most every product out there for curly , dry and brittle hair and I have used other products which say they help people who have naturally curly hair to regain moisture and curl but nothing compares to this one . I used to clear the shelves off when I could find it in grocery stores but have not seen this product for several years . I am elated to have found it again at Amazon . I ca n't wait to receive it . My hair is down to my waist and it 's been almost impossible to manage without this product - I have been contemplating a short hair cut cuz I could not find anything that works for my hair like this product does . If you have natural curl to your hair you have to at least give this a try . For curly hair it is a must ... And the smell ? Is UN-speak able , nothing compares to the smell of this product , it smells so good nothing can compare to it . THANK YOU AMAZON
 i love this product . it moisturizes , scents , conditions , and is cheap . what more can you ask for !
 I use the leave in to comb through my hair and it is excellent.It is not heavy on the hair . After finishing my hair withAussie Sprunch Hairspray I then use the leave in conditionerto finish my hairstyle . I have frizzy , dry , fine hair . I nowhave smooth , soft , shiny hair with no flyaways . My hair isfull of body . It is amazing . It is a miracle . I use thevolume shampoo and conditioner of Aussie 's too . I finallyfound a product that delivers . LOVE IT ...
 I tried this product a few years ago , before they added a special new ingredient
 I really enjoyed the convenience of this product . It was quicker than regular types -- great for those days when you do n't have time for the '' `` leave-in for three minute '' '' types of conditioners . Worked great as a detangler and conditioner .
 I use this product every two days and love it . I have long color-processed hair and this product made it feel fantastic . It left my hair soft and bouncy without the flyaway look . My hair did not feel heavy after use and never looked greasy . As a bonus , the shampoo gave a really nice shine to my hair . I will definitely continue to use this product . There was n't anything I did n't like about it !
 I found that with the Aussie Hair Insurance leave-in conditioner , my hair was much easier to manage after using it . It works as a detangler as well as a conditioner . My hair was very shiny and had a lot more bounce and volume than usual . I would recommend this . But not just to certain people -- I would recommend it to anyone who has hair .
 LOVE IT CAME ENOUGH FOR THE REST OF YEAR , AS I BUY FOR THE WHOLE YEAR AND CAME BEFORE EXPECTED ARRIVAL TIME
 Item arrived quickly and in good condition . Just what I was looking for , and smells pretty damn good . Would definitely order again .
 I was very happy with this product . I have naturally frizzy and course hair and I also straighten it a lot , but this product makes it so much softer and shinier after just one use and virtually all of my dead ends disappeared . I also like that it does n't weigh my hair down or make it oily . The scent is quite pleasant as well . Also , the directions say to use on wet hair , but I use it on my dry hair all the time prior to styling . It seems to give my hair added manageability and softness . I would definitely recommend this product .
 Great for the price . Keeps my curls curly and flyaways at bay . Cheaper than at the drugstore . Smells delicious . Pleased .
 Even if this product changed a little bit , it still works great ! Untangles my hair like no other ! Highly recommended
 This is a good leave-in conditioner . The scent is great . I just wish it was a tad bit thicker because it 's very watery and runny and I prefer leave-ins that have a silkier , thicker feel . But I would definitely buy again .
 THIS leave in conditioner has made my dry hair soo moisturised and soft !! very hight quality like most of aussies products ! i really recommend this to anyone who has dry hair and doesnt wan na spend a a lot of money!LOVE IT !
 I was using It 's a 10 miracle leave-in spray but found that over time it was making my hair dry . I believe the reason is the alcohol.The Aussie product has no alcohol -LRB- and is about 1/6 the price of It 's a 10 -RRB- and it leaves my hair nice and soft . Note that the price on Amazon is for 3 bottles , so it 's a bargain .
 I always use leave in conditioner and have for the past 10 years . I could n't find my regular brand so I tried this one.It works well , but I feel like I have to use more squirts than I did with my other brand , but my hairs also longer so I 'm really not sure . It is not heavy and leaves my hair light and flowing . I often spritz my hair at bedtime and twist my hair up into a bun with a scrunchee . I can usually style my hair in the morning without having to wash it.The scent is much less `` feminine '' and now my husband is using it also , though I do n't know why . His hair is thick and gorgeous.I would purchase this again , very good for the $ $ . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 I bought a bottle of this a few years ago and it had tea tree in it and it was absolutely amazing stuff and really great for my itchy scalp . My hair never looked better . Now , they 've replaced the tea tree with aloe and it now has a better pina colada type smell . Delicious , summery smell , by the way . Without the tea tree , the product is not as good as it used to be , but I will continue using it because the ingredient list is top notch and the smell is so yummy . There 's really no need to spend more money buying salon products when you can get stuff that 's just as good or better for a fraction of the cost . One bottle of this is $ 2.50 at my local Wal-mart . You ca n't beat that !
 This is a very nice leave-in that wo n't weight your hair down or leave it greasy -- that said , I think for people with dry hair -LRB- myself included -RRB- , I do n't feel it 's enough to totally moisturize our hair like it needs to be . But this is a very good , every day leave-in that smells soooo good ! I use it on my ends when I 'm putting up my hair at night , and it works great !
 I have used conditioning sprays by dove , loreal -LRB- costs $ 9 a bottle ! -RRB- and frizz ease . This stuff is by far the best and only $ 3 a bottle at the store . I have n't gotten my hair cut since FEB and it is now NOV and I dont ' have any split ends . I use it on my son too because he gets `` crib head '' or whatever it is called where their hair is all nappy in the back from how they lay on it , even though he is 2 . This is the best priced and best working spray . I use sulfate free shampoo , skip the conditioner and just use this . I have naturally curly hair if that makes a difference , it is a tiny bit coarse , it is n't thick or thin . This stuff does n't weigh my hair down either or make it oily , I still only wash my hair every other day .
 I really enjoyed using the Aussie Leave-In Conditioner . It proved much easier to use than traditional conditioner , because I could just spray it on my wet hair after I hopped out of the shower and then comb through . No wasting time by applying traditional conditioner in the shower and then having to rinse it out before getting out of the shower . I definitely would recommend this to family and friends and am tempted to purchase it for myself in the future .
 I 'm becoming obsessed with hair products so now I always like to have something in my hair even when I 'm not styling it . I love this product because it 's a spray , and it 's quick to use . It does n't leave my hands sticky , and I can put it in my hair as soon as I get out of the shower . I use it before I use other hair products too . Plus , it smells really good!I mostly love it because it 's a spray and not a cream . It 's cheap , and I will definitely be buying this again when I run out .
 That 's right - that 's how much I spend on haircuts every 2 months . That would be $ 14 for a cut and a $ 5-6 dollar tip . That 's about $ 120 per year . So if you do the same and your want your Supercuts cut -LRB- anything but Super ! -RRB- to stretch for 2 months without it looking completely awful , this is the product to use . I tried other leave-ins and the Aussie mousse/leave-in conditioner combination and do n't like them . They make my hair stringy and mousey around the 1-1/2 - month mark , whereas this product gives me more of the mad scientist or disheveled drunk look at that point - much more appealing for the masses.And for some reason no stores carry Aussie Hair Insurance where I live anymore ... go Amazon.com !
 I first bought this leave in conditioner for my hair . It has a very nice scent , and it does n't linger . I have a very sensitive sence of smell , and get migraines easily . I have a hard time going into the perfume or candle isle in the store . I 've had to leave stores , Dr 's offices , movies , and even had to leave work early because of migraines from perfumes and such . I do n't have to worry about this product at all ! I am also a smoker , and my sister is very allergic to smoke . I have to take a shower or completely change my clothes to go over her house . She is so sensitive to it , she can smell the smoke on me , if I wear the same bra I had on when smoking . I realized , about a year ago , that when I had sprayed my hair with this product , my sister could not smell the smoke , at all . I started slowly testing it , and it was magic ! I can smoke right before I go to her house , not change my clothes , spray my clothes and hair with this , and she does n't smell a thing . Not even a little bit . I use it all of the time . I know how bad smokers smell , and with using this spray , noone has to smell my nasty smoke . I see my sister a lot more now , and that makes me happy .
 what is wrong with the prices on Amazon ? everything is a lot more expensive than everywhere else ! this leave in conditioner costs around 4 dollars in Walmart , why would anybody want to pay 14 ????? I love this conditioner , but not going to get it from here .
 I used this during my pregnancy for my growing belly bump . I know that getting stretch marks may or may not be genetic , but I did not have any stretch marks . : -RRB-
 My aunt in Germany told me about this oil . She used it during her pregnancy and did n't get any stretch marks . I found it on Amazon and decided to give it a try.I love the way it smells , it absorbs quickly and it did help with stretch marks . I love this product and would highly recommend it .
 I 've used this product for as long as I can remember lightening my hair , and without fail , my hairdressers have asked `` who does your color ? '' and been amazed that the answer is `` Me ! `` The thing the other reviewers seem to be forgetting is that a -RRB- this is a chemical product that requires all of the standard tests you would do for any other hair color -LRB- allergy test , etc. -RRB- and b -RRB- that it lightens your own color , rather than applying a particular color to your hair . So you 'll get a lightened version of your hair color , including reddish tones , if you have a reddish tone hair to start off with . The color test -LRB- snipping a * SMALL * lock of hair and testing to see how long to leave the product on -RRB- lets you see the results in advance.If you 're looking for something more like the spray-in product ? I 'd recommend sticking with the spray-in product .
 This was my first time I 've used hair coloring and I 'm very pleased with my experience . The instructions in the package were clear and I was able to follow them without any problems . A friend helped with the application and it worked very well . My hair is naturally brown , so the box said that it should lighten it and give it red tones . The color was fairly close to that on the picture . I 'd have liked it to be a bit lighter , so I guess I 'll have to get a lighter blonde shade next time . Also , I was warned that my hair may become dry after coloring , so I used lots of conditioner -- even though the box said there was conditioner built in . My hair did n't become dried out at all .
 This product was wonderful ! I have medium brown hair with red highlights and have never been able to go blonde without getting some serious orange mixed in . Clairol Summer Blonde Shampoo-In Lightener is the first product I 've used that did exactly what it said it would -- it lightened my hair ! It 's a very natural look . There 's no hideous orange color . It just took my natural color and highlights and lightened them up . It looks like I spent some time in the sun ! The coloring also left my hair soft and shiny . I 'm extremely pleased with the results and will not only use it again , but also recommend it to friends !
 I experienced some problems with this product . First , to have any idea what the results will be , I 'm required to perform a test on hair by snipping it off . This is n't mentioned on the box . Second , the instructions strongly recommend and allergy test . So strongly that I expected to change into a toad if I did n't do that first . After all that , test results are only an estimate , at best , about what color I 'd end up with . This product is n't something I 'd suggest to any friend of mine .
 If you enjoy light fragrances of pineapple and coconut , then you 'll love this . My friends always compliment me whenever I put this on . The only downside , -LRB- and I find myself not really caring -RRB- is that you do have to reapply because it does n't last all day . I do wish the price was cheaper as well since I purchase at least two but it last at least five months before I even need to use the other so again I feel that I 'm getting my money 's worth .
 I use very strong hair spray that can easily build up , and regular shampoos simply do n't do a good job of removing it . Clearifier removes the build up easily and does not strip the luster from my hair .
 I love this product ! Started using it a year ago and now my daughter uses it too . I would highly recommend it .
 I used this color and although it was n't as dark red as it is in the photo , I love how my hair came out . It was a mix of brownish red , like a real chocolate cherry , not burgundy . I love this color so much . Every one wo n't get the same results , but mines was perfect for me . By the way , before I used this , my hair was a medium honey blonde , but my natural color is dark brown
 It was exactly what I wanted . You ca n't find them in the stores any more and the price was great
 I really loved this dye . Looks great , especially in sunlight . You can really see all the highlights.One of the better hair dyes I 've used .
 this item not only arrived on time it was in perfect condition and worked just as i was told it would .
 With an SPF of 50 , you could probably sit in a microwave oven and not get burned ! Works well in the Colorado sun , my freckled skin needs all the protection it can get . Lasts for hours while riding my bike , do n't know how it works on the beach .
 This sunblock is the best . Why ? 1 -RRB- NO bad smell . . as a matter of fact , NO SMELL AT ALL .2 -RRB- Doesnt leave your skin with that weird `` I have sunblock on '' feeling on it . . as a matter of fact , it goes on and feels just like moisturizer on your skin ; you dont feel a heavy , plastic-y film sitting on top of your skin .3 -RRB- Price -- all of the other sunblocks cost WAY more than this . . why ? Well , I guess its because THEY advertise , and `` NO AD '' doesnt , hence the name ! 4 -RRB- Lasting power
 This brand has gotten very good ratings with consumer testing organizations , albeit the 45 SPF version . But this formulation is the exact same besides increased levels of 2 of the 4 active ingredients , namely Oxybenzone and Octisalate.I got it at Wally World for $ 6.94 though ! Boooo , seller !
 This stuff is the lowest cost '' effective '' sunblock I have ever used . At the beach I use it everywhere on my body except my face . My experience has been that after being in the water , it really starts to burn my eyes . I use `` Bullfrog Face '' for my face and No Add everywhere else . I have been using this product for five years .
 There are many reasons to use this product : SPF 50 is one of the best -LRB- it protects up to 98 % UV radiation -RRB- bottle size + product quantity -LRB- enough to be used all summer - every single day - for UV protection -RRB- prize -LRB- cheap , cheaper , cheapest -RRB- lower than other brands even with the same product quality but not quantity -LRB- one friend of mine got one La Roche-Posay sunblocker 50 ml -LRB- 1.69 fl oz . -RRB- for $ 27.00 -RRB- Please note for best protection you need to apply the product at least 30 minutes before sun exposure .
 Sunscreens are all the same , work the same , have the same ingredients etc. . Buying brand names is for chumps , this works great and comes in big quantity so you can slather it on if you want .
 I have been using this product for years . It makes your hair shiney , healthy and cleans all the debri from the environment from your hair . I recommend it highly . Anyone that uses it will be satisfied .
 This flat iron is holding up very well overseas where I am required to use a 220 volt service . It came with an adapter so I will still be able to use it when I return to the U.S.
 I bought this because I could n't go to Europe with curly hair ! I had read that converters did n't work well with American flat irons , so I bought this one because it is dual voltage . There is no switch on the flat iron , but it definitely works in Europe . It was great ! It comes with an adaptor and provided me with nice straight hair the entire trip !
 i love my new flat iron & especially ca n't wait to use it in Europe . I 've burned my hair too many times on products not made for use in Europe , even though I 've used converters on the right setting !
 I took this with me for a 2 week trip to Italy . It worked great !
 I have naturally curly hair so I need a decent flat iron that gets hot . I own a Chi and it works fine . I bought this one to take to Europe because my Chi was not dual-voltage . On previous trips to Europe , my flat irons never seem to get as hot as the ones we use in the states . For the money , I think this flat iron was a good investment for someone with curly , but not kinky , hair .
 The flat iron works great for overseas , it 's not as hot as my ` Chi ' , but it does the job . I have soft hair and I do n't get perms often so I rely on my flat-iron in between the perms . The Black Pearl does get my hair straight just not as straight as I like it . I would recommend it as an alternate iron .
 great iron , itworks allover world . . comes w converter plug . . i recommend it ... since traveling a lot , normally i use chi , but i have burnt many , since i tried to use it w expensive converters ... finally i found one which s good for travelling .
 This works great in Europe . Had a different flat iron last year in Germany and it exploded ! Nice job .
 Works very well . I particularly bought it to take it to Europe and Great Britain . Previously , other flat irons I had purchased did not work there even with a converter . The Black Pearl was great .
 The product arrived in just a few days , exactly as ordered . The price was far below any of the competitors ' . I 'd definitely go back and recommend this merchant to friends .
 Ladies-I love this eyeliner ! Stays on all day-does not smear or melt off-Also easy to put on-does not tug your eyelid !
 I 've been wearing the black/brown color one nearly everyday now , for office wear and love it . Without any needs to put shadow on top , it stays throughout the day . I absolutely love it and even gave the second of the pair to my mom .
 I have been using this body wash for more then a few years . Found that it does a great job . I use it with a body brush and it go 's a long way . A hand full to the brush will do the job . Looks like you just ca n't satisfy everyone
 I soooo loved this conditioner . I cut off nearly all of my hair once I decided to take up swimming this past summer . I was looking for a conditioner that would protect my hair and keep it moisturized , soft and tangle-free . This was perfect for me .
 Prior I used Aussie Slip . I could not find it any more so I ordered this Knot Forgotten . I thought the old product made your hair feel silkier , but this product does detangle and it conditions too .
 I used this product extensively in the past as it was easily found in stores . Then ... it disappeared from my life without a trace , and I have been searching for it ever since . It is the Australian Calendula that led me to realize that `` Slip '' conditioner and `` Knot Forgotten Detanger '' are the same product under different names . I believe the recipe has changed a bit since I fist used this product back in 2002 , but this is the best detangler I have ever tried . I have been looking for this product in stores for YEARS , but could not find it . I actually ordered the `` Knott Forgotten , but it came in a bottle as Aussie `` Slip '' conditioner . I still have never seen the `` Knot Forgotten '' bottle , except in the add here on Amazon . Even this last batch I bought was labled `` Slip '' conditioner . It is a wonderful product . I am SO glad I found this . This product will smooth out even the roughest of knots and tangles and leaves your hair feeling soft and silky . I highly recommend this product . It 's a love afair re-kindled ... I just wish it was n't so expensive , but it 's worth the money . It only takes a little to go a long way when rinsed with water . HINT - Try leaving a small amount in your hair during your final rinse as a leave-in conditioner effect ... supple silkiness without weighing down your hair . HIGHLY RECOMMEND !!
 This was a FANTASTIC product !!! WHY is it that companies ALWAYS discontinue , change their products or change the ingredience ? I am SO disappointed that I can no longer get this product . I contacted the company because I also use their 3 Minute Conditioner and noticed the fragrance changed ... duh , if it smells different , is n't it obvious the ingredience were changed ? The representative that replied to my email stated nothing changed ... well , that is very poor servicing since she obviously does not use the product and just assumed rather than tried to do any type of research ! Well , for discontinuing Knot Forgotten -LRB- which obviously it WAS forgotten -RRB- and changing the fragrance of the latter , I am very disappointed in this company . The product was WONDERFUL .
 Aussie Conditioner for volume is lightwieght , with no build-upthat you can comb through leaving your hair feeling healthy andfull of volume . Finally a product that delivers what it says.So many products out there that do not but this one really does.Love it . I can now grow my hair long because it is healthy.Feeling good about my good hair days . Try it . Believe meyou will love it too .
 While the Comodyne Self-Tanning Towels work beautifully , this particular seller overcharged me . Nation Supply , the seller , lists the item as `` Comodynes Self-Tanning -LRB- Sunless Tan -RRB- Body Towels '' -LRB- towels being plural -RRB- for $ 10.04 plus $ 5.95 shipping , and I received 1 towel -LRB- singular -RRB- in the mail . I was misled , I certainly thought I was buying more than 1 towel . Other sellers list the same product with a count of 8 towels for $ 13.04 . I thought I was getting a bargain but instead I was ripped-off .
 as Poison is a scent of seriousness , hardly playful or silly . It 's smell suggests a sweet sort of musk , not flowery , and a little lasts all day . It is one of the few fragrances left that is unique and ca n't be confused with any other fragrance . I 've gone through them all , and always come back to Poison . Women feel sexy with it on and men are hypnotized by the women who wear it . I have tried all the Poisons and still believe the original to be the most magical . Change to the Poison lotions in the summer , as they are softer . The perfume creats a most seductive mood in the night . I 've worn Poison since the time it first was invented , and it still is my favorite . It is a scent any age can wear .
 I love this fragrance . I have been wearing it for over 20 years , and I never get tired of it . It is very hard to find in the area where I live , so please , Amazon , keep selling it !
 I 'm not just talking about the price , either . I ca n't stand Channel or pretty much any other perfume , but I like Poison . It is more floral than alcohol .
 Excellent gift , was just what my wife wanted . It smells great on her and I would definitly order this again .
 This was a Christmas present for my wife . Of course , She loved it . She gave me enough hints ! I like it too !
 This perfume my wife has loved since it first came out . We like the fruity grape essence . I have bought her a bottle every time she runs out . If I do n't she reminds me every day .
 I love this perfume and have been using it for years . I ordered it from Amazon.com for the first time , but , unfortunately , it never showed up ! Now I have to find another place that sells it .
 I have loved this cologne for 20 years . Whenever I wear it I get many compliments . I have tried to duplicate it with something else , and it never works . There is only one poison !
 DIOR IS A WONDERFUL HOUSE OF LUXURIES . MY FAVORITE FRAGRANCE FOE A DESCENT PRICE . PERFUMES AND COLOGNES PRICES CONTINUE TO RISEBUT AMAZON CHARGES A FAIR PRICE FOR THIS PRODUCT111
 I 've been searching the stores to find this product for years , thank God I finally found it !!! LOVE it !!!
 I LOVE THIS STUFF !!!! I 've even bought the body soap , moisturizer cream , and the purse-size spray -LRB- not a sampler though , hmmm -RRB- . I only wear four scents now , and this is numero - uno!Try one of them , there is Poison , PURE POISON , HYPNOTIC POISON , Midnight Poison , Tendre Poison , and I 'm sure there 's another one coming out soon !
 I bought this cologne for my mom and the purchase and delivery of the product was pretty smoth . I received the package at home before the estimated delivery date and I 'm very satisfied with the purchase -- and so is my mom !
 I have used this product for 30 years . I have tried many , even $ 40.00 conditioner that does not hold a candle to this . I always go back . I am Native/African American and have stopped chemically treating my hair and nothing compares to this !
 This is a really , really good conditioner . I do not use it with the shampoo . I sometimes use this to `` co-wash '' my hair , and in shower my hair feels silky smooth and healthy . I have chemically damaged , rexlaxed curly hair by the way . I choose to also use this as a leave-in and it works wonderfully .
 I live in the UK and until recently we could purchase this item . I have used it when it 's humid in the summer months and when it rains -LRB- the rest of the year ! -RRB- and it holds my fine hair in place , regardless of weather conditions . I have used other hairsprays and they just do n't do the job . But I can totally rely on this spray to hold my style in place for the duration . As this is no longer available in this country , I am having to find other ways of getting it shipped to me .
 The packaging is attractive , and the pump distributes the product easily , in a controlled spray . There 's a bit more alcohol than I would prefer , as evidenced by the scent and its listing as the primary ingredient . I have waist-length curly hair that has significantly thinned recently due to thyroid disease and yet the product adhered to my wet hair without dripping . Scrunching curls into place created well-defined curls . I used the product daily following a shampoo and conditioning . When I dried my hair with a diffuser , the change in volume was dramatic and lasted into the next day . When I air-dried my hair , the defined curls had staying power . This product dramatically improves the appearance of my hair , allowing it to appear healthier , more voluminous , curlier , and baby soft -- without stickiness or build-up .
 I did like this product . It held real nice , did n't feel sticky , and did n't flake . I would recommend it to my friends . The only thing I did n't like was the smell ; it smelled like hairspray at first then it started to smell like grapes . I do n't care too much for grapes but some people might like it .
 It smells great ; my male friend even knew what kind of hair spray I had in my hair . It holds well . I used it once a day while my hair was in a ponytail . It does n't take much spray to keep your hair in place . The bottle representation is slightly plain , but I would highly recommend Aussie Sprunch Spray .
 I really liked this product . It was n't sticky and it did n't make my hair feel like I had anything on it . My only problem was that I have long thick hair and it did n't last all day . It had a very nice scent that was n't overpowering . I would recommend this product .
 I have very thick heavy hair and this was great for keeping it in line . I did find it was easy to over spray , which made my hair look dirty sometimes , but with a lighter touch it worked great . The scent was pleasant , but I like Aussie stuff already . It did have a very strong alcohol smell but that went away after a bit . I look forward to using it to the end of the bottle .
 I liked the Spray Sprunch . It has a wonderful scent ! My hair is short and can be stiff -- with a mind of its own -- but I brushed it through , and it held my hair in place all day . I also tried spraying it on after I 'd styled my hair . Then I hand styled it , and it held that too !! I 've used it every day , and would recommend it very much !
 I was on what seemed to be an endless hunt for a product to help my completely unmanageable hair . i tried scrunching spray , gel , mousse , pomade , and something called glue . -LSB- i would n't recommend it -RSB- but when i finally picked up a bottle of this inexpensive ` sprunch ' spray , the hunt was over ! this stuff smells great , for one thing . and when it comes out , it 's short even bursts that do n't leave disgusting flakes on your hair . and the best part is-NO CRUNCHINESS ! it 's perfectly soft-even softer than how i started . my hair is a thick , wavy/curly frizzy mess . a few squirts of this stuff is all i need , and my waves become more defined curls , it 's soft , and it loses the frizziness ! it 's my miracle product : P
 Finally a hairspray that really works . I have tried every hair-spray and nothing worked . I have fine hair and this productholds my hair all day . It gives it body that lasts all day.I wanted something that held all day and yes this really does.It washes out easily . It makes my hair feel healthy . I do nothave flyaway and yes it even gives me shiny hair . I am veryhappy with this product and would recommend everyone use it.Take it from someone who has been searching for a long time fora product that really works . Use it ...
 I absolutely love this product . Hairstyles change now with all the natural looks it 's nice to see a company with a product that still holds very well . This is a great styling product it allows you to make wonderful hairstyles without fear of them falling or having a lot of fly aways.Also with this product it has that wonderful Aussie scent . I 've used this product or another of their line since I was a teenager and I 'm 32 now . Aussie makes quality hair care products at very reasonable prices and I do n't feel as if they are any less than the salons products . In my opinion I find them higher quality because they not only have quality , scent , but a great price . Which adds up to a great product deal !
 Good product . It smells good , but for extra hold , I would suggest maximum strength .
 The Aussie Scrunch Spray is wonderful . My daughters love it . It is n't heavy on their hair and it smells just like grapes . If you like Aussie products , you 'll love this product . It 's definitely worth buying . I intend to buy it on a regular basis . I would recommend this to everyone .
 I would recommend this product to everyone . Aussie Sprunch Spray does not get all stiff when you walk outside in the rain . It does n't leave your hair feeling all hard and brittle . Aussie Sprunch Spray has a great smell to it , like cherries . That 's a plus with my husband . He could n't stand the smell of my other hair products but this one he loved . This product is definitely a plus !!! Everyone should try this and see for themselves . From now on , this is my hair care product .
 This is a very effective product . It works great but do n't overuse it , or it will become too stiff . It takes just a few sprays for great results . One bottle will last a long time . I would recommend to my friends
 My hair is fairly hard to manage . When I used the spray I felt that it helped a great deal in taming stray hairs . It did n't seem too sticky on my hair and held the style well . I would recommend it to others , especially if other products do n't work well for you .
 The first thing I noticed was the nice fragrance . It has a fruity smell . I have long , thick hair , and most hair spray I have to spray on , and on ? but this Aussie Sprunch Spray works with just a couple sprays and my hair is set for the entire day . Another thing I like is that it does n't leave your hair looking like you have dandruff . -LRB- You know all those hair sprays that cause flaking ? -RRB- Best of all , it 's not sticky . Give this product an A + !!!!
 I have been using the pads for 3 weeks , and my skin has drastically cleared up -LRB- adult acne -RRB- and has never felt so soft . I feel like my fine lines are less noticeable -LRB- I 'm 36 -RRB- , but I am unsure of that at only 3 weeks -LRB- could be wishful thinking -RRB- . I DO KNOW that my acne has cleared in only 3 weeks . I really , really , really like this product . I can not stress enough how much I enjoy looking in the mirror and not seeing acne . I really , really , really like that -LRB- really -RRB- .
 You HAVE to try this if your issue is enlarged pores . I have seen a reduction in pore size so much that my make up goes on smoother . I also rub the excess left on the pad on my arms and the brown spots are lighter . i am ordering more . thx amazon for this connection .
 This is strong , and even though it made me break out a little bit , I am going to stick with it . Lotions make me break out more , so having an astringent formula really helped me a lot . I ca n't stand using this product every single day , but I am able to use it at least twice a week and enjoying good results .
 I 've lived with acne and combination skin since I was teenager , I thought when I reached adulthood this would all change ... nope ! Thank goodness for at home glycolic peels . The great thing about these pads is their added vitamins and minerals
 I started using this product after reading up on how glycolic acid is supposed to promote collagen production . I 've used these pads for a couple of years now ; I had fairly pronounced ice-pick acne scars on my cheeks , and -- along with the natural healing afforded by my mostly acne-free 20s -- this has done wonders in smoothing out my complexion and making these scars less noticeable . I 'm amazed . Outside of scarring , these pads smooth and even skin tone , keep small bumps down , and reduce discoloration without having to use any sort of bleaching product . I use right before bed followed by a dab of moisturizer , though you may not need it.The 20 % is strong at first , so if you 're new to these or have sensitive skin , I 'd recommend starting with the 10 % and then graduating up once you get through those . And , as these are a bit pricey -LRB- though certainly not as much as a professional peel ! -RRB- , you 'll still see effects if you only use every couple of days . I usually alternate every other night with a cheap salicylic acid toner.Love these !
 I started wih the glycolix 5-2 -LRB- 5 % glycolix acid and 2 % salicylic acid -RRB- which was given to me by my dermatologist . Used that for 2 wks and it helped a lot but it was clear I needed something a little stronger so tried the 20 % and i LOVE IT . acne cleared right up in a couple days -LRB- granted the 5-2 got it started -RRB- , smoother , much much smaller pores , fine lines diminishing . I did not think it was greasy AT ALL and it did n't sting unlike the 5-2 . This stuff is great . Ca n't beat the price . Will last two mos easily if not more as I probably wo n't need it every day now that things have cleared up .
 excellent ! I used to buy mine only from my dermatologist < but he is 30 min away from where i live . Sooo i thought i would check out amazon , as i have an acct with them and they always seem to have everything i am looking for :-RRB- . and they did > this one in particulatr makes my face feel and look like a newborns > it is excellant without burning , yet strong enough to exfoliate my face .
 I started using this a year ago after my doctor recommended it for my discoloration on my thigh from being exposed to the sun so much , it took about 7 months until my skin tone became even , i also use this on my face and it works miracles . Ill never buy anything else for my face . i use glycolic everything , a lil expensive with the facial cream , toner , pads , peel and etc but SOOOOOOOOOOOOO worth it !
 I 've been using these for about 2 weeks or so and I 've already seen my skin even out -LRB- I have red marks from acne and sun damage -RRB- and I 've had ZERO pimples since using them . I will continue to buy this product FOREVER ... it has been a God send so far . My skin has not looked this good for years ! I pray they are never discontinued .
 Recommend the seller ... product arrived before I expected & in good shape . I 've used the pads twice & the `` stuff '' that came off my face was unreal . I am going to stick with it ... this is a keeper !
 this cleans my pores very well . I like something that stings my face a little so I know its working and this does just that . too expensive tho .
 These treatment pads work really well on my skin . My skin is n't super dry after using them . I apply moisturizer after using them and have noticed an improvement in my skin texture .
 This product is fantastic for the price ! These glyco products are usually so spendy . I have used Patricia Wexlers Glyco pads in the past and they are like $ 60 !! This product is also much stronger I thinkthe AHA content is higher so you do have to be careful for overdrying but overall its fantastic helps get rid of blackheads and other blemishes as well as used as an anti-aging product !!
 This product used at night has gotten rid of my 20 year blackheads ... amazing !!! Groce but true : -RRB-
 I love this stuff - It makes my face fresh and smooth - I 'm 66 years young , and this product erases my wrinkles ! Well , you ca n't see them anyway :D - my only complaint is delivery - It took longer than my other vendors to arrive , but I do n't suppose that is the fault of the store or the manufacturer . I will buy again . .
 I use to use the 10 % pad and saw smoothness in the texture of skin , so I went up 20 % . I feel the tingling sensation and I have noticed the fine wrinkles diminishing and skin texture is smooth and even .
 I do n't review a lot of products , but this product has really improved my skin . I 'm in my early 30 's and have started seeing sun damage on my cheeks that I hate . So , I was desperate to find something . My sister had the same thing and her dermatologist recommended hydroquinone . Looking on amazon I found this and AHA lightening gel . I use the pads everyday and the gel at night just on the dark spots . I have had mild-moderate acne for most of my life , usually depending on the climate I live in . I feel that I 'm always battling my skin , and never win . I 've used almost everything there is . I do n't have horrible skin or deep cystic acne , but it 's still traumatic . This product has given me the smoothest skin I think I ever have had , honestly . It 's much more even-toned also . It 's not completely clear , but for me , it 's like heaven . Not having to worry about my skin is a huge relief . I go out without makeup now , and feel more confident getting closer to people when I talk . I 've been using it for about a month and 1/2 , so I hope it continues . It 's definitely worth a try ! Traveling ALWAYS makes me break out and on my recent trip , no breakouts !
 As a daily user of glycolic acid treatment pads I was very delighted to see Glycolixs pads with 20 % glycolic acid.I was thinking of stopping pad usage as I was unsure how much they were really working to keep my dull , shallow complexion at bay . Then I saw this product at 20 % -LRB- the ones I had been using were 10 % -RRB- and figured I would give it a try and have been really happy with it.PROS
 For years , i have had problems with sun spots on my forehead , which is pretty natural for an older person -LRB- I am 79 -RRB- . i read in a consumer magazine that this product might be helpful in ridding scabby patches . I 've used this product for about two weeks , and now my forehead is as smooth as a baby 's behind . i see my dermatologist in two weeks , and i am thinking he is going to be rather surprised to see the improvement.Glycolix Elite Treatment Pads 20 Percent 60 count
 This is an easy way to peel I still use the peels in the bottles as it seems you get more but I still like this . it will change the condition of your face for the better .
 I never use all-hair color anymore as this product is permanent and I use it at least every two weeks . It does n't drip or make a mess . I leave it on longer than suggested ... maybe 20 minutes . There are coupons out there and I never pay over $ 6.00 for it in local stores .
 I had been looking for Nice & Easy 's Medium Auburn to touch up my hair . Unfortunately , you folks did not have the Medium Auburn , so I did the next best thing . I ordered a dark auburn and a light auburn and mixed them . It worked out well , even though it cost twice as much . At least I now know what to do if I ca n't find my regular shade . Thank you ever so much .
 Just used it last night . Looks natural as can be . Shiny and healthy . I thought it best to use a darker than normal shade since my roots are very dark brown with alot of gray and the longer hair is reddish brown naturally .
 I am very very careful about products that I use for my hair . I chose this item because it is not harmful to the hair . I have waist-length hair , so this is extremely important to me since I need my hair to hold its quality throughout the entire life of each strand . I have dirty blonde natural colored hair which is tinted and highlighted to about as natural-a-looking color as possible without looking bleached blonde -LRB- think Reese Witherspoon -RRB- , so i use this product in between my expensive colorings to save $ . Anyway , I special order this discontinued color because the 9 is not quite light enough & ends up looking a little brassy , but the 9.5 is perfect ! I also really like that it 's not really permanent , so by the time i make it in to my hair stylist , she can do her thing without any `` lines '' showing through from the different colorings . My hair is done by Michelle Pfeiffer 's old hair stylist , so u know I am a perfectionist !
 I color my hair with the Nice N Easy Grey Solutions and use this 3-4 weeks after I color to cover the roots . It does not cover the gray as completely as the Gray Solutions , but it does work and keeps my color even and my roots hidden until I can do the full color again . It works really fast - I have 2 young kids and work full-time , so I appreciate that I can put this on for 10 extra minutes before I shower in the morning and I 'm out the door !
 Clairol Nice n Easy Touch Up is the best when you need a touch up fast . It is true in color and for me lasts about 3 weeks . Do n't know what I would do without it .
 this products is so easy to use , you can color your roots & be out the door somewhere in a short time
 easy to use , and really blended with my current color that i get at the salon . so easy that my boyfriend helped put it on !!
 Not sure how people are saying that this does n't cover . Maybe they are using a lighter color ? I have bright pink and black hair and my stylist mistakenly went over one of my black roots with bleach and made it pink . So i had hot pink roots and the rest was black . I made the color from the directions in the box , applied it to the root and BAM . . i have a full chunk of jet black hair now . I did n't have to mess with a HUGE bottle of black dye to do about 2 inches worth of hair .
 I use this product about every 2-3 weeks . My hair is colored auburn red and this root touch up kit works perfectly . Red hair color does n't last all that long but with this kit my color last substantially longer than with out it . For the price and convenience , it is perfect !
 Worked fast and well . Not sure if it will make my hair fall out yet as I have just used it today . No burning , easy directions , overall good coverage and color . I will still have to use some toner to get to platinum -LRB- Take the yellow out -RRB- . Trying punky color toner in a few days . Wish me luck !
 Jell consistancy was easy to work with . Relieved itchy dry skin caused by healing of a serious leg infection better than many other products .
 I have very very naturally dry hair even though I drink tons of water . I normally use this conditioner while i shower after a workout . I do n't wash my hair after every time I work out as that will strip my hair of natural oils . I simply rinse enough to get the sweat -LRB- salt -RRB- out of my hair and put the conditioner in my hair . My hair is so silky during and after I rinse the conditioner out . I put a promade in and let my hair air dry . The bonus is that this product is dirt cheap . Also the shea butter formula smells divine and works like a charm also . You will not be dissapointed with this at all ! It also can be used as a deep conditioner as well in my opinion .
 When I was young my mother never used a conditioner on my hair . My hair would get so tangled in knots that I 'd literally have to have it cut off . It was only when I discovered conditioners that I could finally grow my hair long . The conditioner is necessary for me to keep my hair tangle free.The problem I have with many conditioners is that the chemicals in them are n't great for my skin . My skin tingles or even gets sensitive after I use the conditioner . This is especially noticeable after I sleep for a night , since my hair gets on my pillow , the conditioner rubs off onto the pillow and then my face lays in that.I 'm really pleased with the Suave Humectant Conditioner . It is one of the least reactant conditioners I have tried . I can use it daily without any problems . It does a great job with my hair , too . It definitely makes it easier to brush through . What 's interesting is that it 's labeled as a `` for dry or damaged hair '' conditioner . I would normally consider my hair to be on the oily side , but the conditioner does quite well for me . It does n't make my hair oily.Well recommended .
 This is a great moisturizing conditioner . . If you are looking for a conditioner that will leave your hair soft and full of moisture you should definately give this product a try . The price you can not beat !
 Love this inexpensive humectant conditioner . I have thick , fine , long straight hair and I only use it on the ends when I need it . Works as advertised - just go easy on the amount !
 * I liked the conditioner , but still think the shampoo is drying or not so moisturizing . * A great find for the price .
 I was in search of a moisturizing conditioner because my hair is super dry -LRB- and color treated -RRB- , so I bought this conditioner thinking that if I did not like it , I would have lost only a little under $ 2 . However , I was pleasantly surprised at the results ! Plus it smells amazing , too ! -LRB- I also bought the Humectant Shampoo and really like that , too . Smells wonderful and lathers up into a very nice moisturizing ; whipped consistency . -RRB- The conditioner leaves my hair very silky , shiny , and ... a little secret ... I also squirt the size of a dime into my hand and run it all through my hair after shampooing and conditioning for a nice leave-in conditioner . Yes ... my hair is that dry ! And by the way , it does not make my hair feel greasy or weighed down at all . I spray a little bit of my usual styling spray in my hair and blow it dry . My hair turns out silky , shiny , and just overall LOVELY !! I am so surprised . This stuff is really amazing , and for the price ... you just ca n't go wrong . Obviously its not for everyone , but you wo n't know unless you give it a try ! I will definitely buy this again , and will tell everyone about how great it is !
 Was n't sure if I would like this product since it is a lower priced hair care product and I wanted the salon feel I get when my hair is washed , but I was wrong . I love the silky feel my hair had after blow drying , forget the expensive hair care products , this was wonderful !!!
 I used to spend a fortune on salon brand shampoos and conditioners , thinking they were much better for my hair than the `` grocery store '' brands . Then when traveling and not being able to find my conditioner in an `` under 4 oz . '' size that I could carry on the plane I decided to wait until I reached my destination to buy some . I bought this one because I like the name brand that it is comparable to , but also because it was cheap and I would n't feel bad about leaving a good portion of it behind at the end of the trip . -LRB- I gave the remaining conditioner to the person at the hotel front desk -RRB- . I was so surprised to find that this conditioner left my fine , flyaway hair just as soft and manageable as the more expensive brand . My hair is a tangled mess after I wash it and I have to use a conditioner . It also keeps away dryness . I could n't tell the difference between this conditioner and my much more expensive salon brand ! Still , I thought maybe it was just the difference in water or the weather at the place I was staying on the trip . I bought the shampoo again at home when I ran out of my salon brand and found that it performed just as well with the local water , weather , etc. . That was 4 years ago and I have been using Suave shampoos and conditioners ever since . I have n't found a single one that I do n't like and I 've saved a bundle on shampoos and conditioners . Two thumbs up for this product !
 Suave Conditioner works like it should - conditions hair and rinses out cleanly with no residue . It 's also priced reasonably , so it 's a winner in our household .
 I love this product completely ! I will purchase it again from Amazon.com since it works very well and it is a great product . I love Suave products -- and this Suave Professionals Series is great ! It is better than the regular Suave Shampoo sold at Walmart or Target . This is a great product -- a must have product for your hair .
 ... for new parents . My wife and I got one of these when our first child was born . Ever since we have given one to all of our friends/family as a newborn gift , that 's how much we have enjoyed all of the products .
 Fast delivery . The zipper was broken on the plastic pouch and i had to cut it open to get out the products , however , fortunately I was using it for a diaper cake and did n't need the pouch itself .
 This spray is great for strong hold of your shape . When it says freeze spray it means it . It can be very stiff if you use too much because it is meant to hold particular styles well.Depending on how much product you use you can have a light spray or if you like that stiff look just keep applying and eventually it will get there , but really these products are n't made for that . They hold without being stiff or sticky which is what I like about them.I absolutely love this product . Hairstyles change now with all the natural looks it 's nice to see a company with a product that still holds very well . This is a great styling product it allows you to make wonderful hairstyles without fear of them falling or having a lot of fly aways.Also with this product it has that wonderful Aussie scent . I 've used this product or another of their line since I was a teenager and I 'm 32 now . Aussie makes quality hair care products at very reasonable prices and I do n't feel as if they are any less than the salons products . In my opinion I find them higher quality because they not only have quality , scent , but a great price . Which adds up to a great product deal !
 This is the BEST hairspray I have ever used in my life ! It is EXTREME hold ! I have super straight hair and this hairspray allows me to curl , tease , whatever I want .

 Most cuticle creams I 've tried are only moisturizers , but this one also includes an exfoliant . This means that some of the dead/dying/dry cuticle tissue will actually be removed , thus letting the moisturizing elements of the cream get down to new skin that can actually be helped . It takes only a tiny bit of this product to cover all 10 cuticles , and within several days I saw a big improvement . Will definitely continue using this product !
 I used the No-Ad SPF 15 in conjunction with their SPF 8 and got a beautiful tan without any burning , peeling or dry skin . The price/quantity ration ca n't be beat and in the future , I 'll certainly buy more of both the No-Ad SPF 15 and 8 .
 Excellent sunscreen . I have used it for years . It absorbs really well , does n't leave any white residue , and smells pleasant . It is very mild ; I use it on my face , mostly . Sometimes a little difficult to find , but I have found it in Walmart in the past .
 I 've used No-Ad since I was a little girl . It 's the only sunblock/sunscreen that I can use without breaking out in a rash . Sadly the stores in my area do n't carry it anymore so I had to buy it online . The reason I chose to buy this one was because there was not an outrageous shipping fee . The others charged like 5-6 bucks to ship this 16 oz bottle . The product itself is fine but the bottle does not look taken care of . It 's dinged and the labels are pealing off so that is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 . So over all product is excellent but I wish the seller would make sure his products are being taken better care of .
 As a scuba diver , No-Ad Sunblock 45 provides me with protection from sun rays without being greasy . I love it and must use it all the time , even though I have dark skin .
 I have been using No-Ad sunscreen for years , and have recommended it to other discerning sun-lovers . The cream rubs in smoothly , absorbs completely and feels great ; not heavy or greasy and no weird residue crumbles off . Compares to the quality of lotions several times the price . The scent is light , hardly-can-tell-its-there . I 've used the SPF 8 and 15 almost all my sun-life . Because the bottle is so generous and the price so affordable , there 's no excuse not to use the amounts recommended for complete coverage -LRB- golf-ball size for the entire body , dime-size for the face -RRB- . I ca n't recommend it enough .
 this stuff rocks ! I 'm outdoors a lot , and often on the water . This sunscreen does n't have that waxy feeling that others have , so you can re-apply all day and even add it to your face lotion in the morning and not have to scrape it off at night . And it works ! Other sunscreens make my face break out if I use them every day , so this one is a winner . The downside is their `` no advertising '' strategy , which is admirable , somehow makes it quite difficult to find in retail stores . Now that REI has dropped it from their stock the only place I can find it is on Amazon .
 NO-AD products sell themselves on not bothering to advertise a good product , they sell on the word of mouth that the products are as good as any other sun/skin care , which smell good , soak into skin well , do n't stain clothing and work well doing exactly what they claim to do on the bottle.Incidently the bottle 's are basic with simple pump action dispensers and are made from easily recylable hard plastics.The fact that there is no hype , no nonsense and no false claim along with no attempt to waste money on hype , seem to have served this company well and has worked better than any glossy ads of perfect bronzed bodies from piz buin or ambre solaire , fair play to them ! They are far more honest than any other skin care company I can think of !
 Due to my sun sensative skin about 15 years ago my Dermitologist told me to apply sunscreen everyday for the rest of my life . He said I should get SPF 15 strength and that higher strength does not offer any more protection . So , I have been doing so ever since , rain or shine , summer or winter . After an exhaustive search I found No-Ad SPF 15 to be ideal for me . It applied evenly , did not sting my eyes , did not stink , reasonably priced and did the job . This year , 2007 , I was unable to find No-Ad SPF 15 in any of my usual retail outlets - Walmart , Longs Drug , grocery stores , etc. . Nowhere to be found . Only the higher SPF numbers that were not as good . Finally I looked on line at Amazon and behold there it is , so I ordered a bunch . Thanks Amazon for being my sunscreen savior.David J.Blomquist
 Did a lot of research before opting for this product . Take it with us on our vacation to Mexico every year and feel the product has done everything expected of it .
 We use to use No-Ad in Colorado.Unable to find now in TX in locals stores . Thank goodness it is at Amazon ! Love this sunblock for years .
 The only sunscreen I ever use . No smell , not sticky or greasy and works well . I am a man and do n't want to be shiny or smell like a pina colada .
 I am so grateful that Amazon carries this brand since I ca n't find it in stores anywhere ! I bought a bottle a long time ago and it has lasted me for many years -LRB- not out in the sun an excessive amount -RRB- and when I was looking for more , I realized stores do n't have it.I originally bought SPF 8 and this has worked in all situations -LRB- beach , pool , working in the yard , etc. -RRB- . I am fairly light skinned and if I 'm out in the sun a lot , I burn first and then tan for the remainder of the season . So , in using this SPF correctly , I avoid the burn and go straight to tan . My husband is light-skinned and only burns , so he wanted a higher SPF , so I ordered this one ... He actually goes between 8 and 15 and never gets burned.There is n't any smell , it 's not sticky and I even put it on my face without any problems . It 's an awesome sunscreen and when I saw there were different SPF 's , I bought those too !!
 Stumbled across this a few years ago but then it sat in my cupboard . Started using it again this summer -- the summer of sunshine . Fabulous ! Times when I still expected to burn , I did n't . Completely sold on NO-AD !
 I have been using NO-AD for over 20 years . It goes on well and never feels sticky , never stings my eyes when I perspire , and does n't make me have hot flashes like some of the other thicker solutions . It was always the best bargain out there , but lately fewer and fewer stores carry it , probably because it was so reasonable . It is a big container that lasts quite a good long time -LRB- We lived in Egypt for 10 years , and were able to carry it in ; it worked great in the desert . -RRB- Do n't hesitate to use this product ! Kudos to the non-greedy company that makes it .
 i have curly hair that I perm and it gets very dry . this product is just WONDERFUL - it keeps my hair soft
 i only use this product on my hair . if you have frizzy or permed hair this is a MUST - use it with the moistureclenz shampoo
 Suave shampoo is one of those products that I 've used for most of my life . I 've tried more expensive shampoo over the years but keep coming back to Suave simply because it works very well and it costs very little . Usually I 'm a huge proponent of the ` you get what you pay for ' way of thinking . However , there are exceptions that prove the rule , and this is one of them ! I usually switch the variety each time I buy more just to keep things interesting , but aside from that , I 've been pretty much using Suave for 15 + years.That said , I have short , uncomplicated hair that 's only dislike is conditioner -LRB- it makes parts of my hair stand on end for no apparent reason -RRB- . I do n't do much styling aside from a littleFiber Molding Cremeto spike the front a little bit , so my shampoo needs are probably not as complicated as someone with long , curly hair . For a guy -LRB- or woman with short hair -RRB- this stuff is perfect and does exactly what I need it to
 I am an Asian guy with short hair . I do not care about my hair looking shiny , or feeling soft , or being bouncy , or whatever . I just want a shampoo that is cheap and can get the oils and stinky smell out of my hair . This shampoo does just that . And for being about $ 2.00 , I can not complain . The bottle lasts me a few months before I need to stock up again . I will continue buying this brand as long as it is cheap and it works . Highly recommended !
 Gentle , wonderful shampoo ! Great for scalp , smells great . non-color-treated hair.Best comment : hairdresser/stylist said - `` what are you doing to your hair-are you using a special shampoo ?? It 's never looked better & feels great . `` I said - `` You really want to know ??? Suave Aloe Vera '' ... end of story .
 Really like GPB Shampoo . I have my hair permed and tinted so I am careful about the shampoo I use.GPB Shampoo works great . My hair is clean , manageable and shiny . What I do not like isthe color -LRB- brownish color -RRB- and scent -LRB- can not describe the scent -RRB- . However , I will continue using this shampoo.Aubrey Organics GBP Glycogen Protein Balancing Shampoo -- 11 fl oz
 I got my order in a short amount of time & the product so far is working out well . No complaints here !
 This stuff is an oldie but goody . I have cologne that has cost me a fortune . But this is still my favorite . Not bad for the price either .
 I remember this scent because my dad used to wear it when I was a little girl . I 'm 43 years old -- so old that I remember when it was popular back then -- the first time ! The cologne has a fresh , clean scent that I enjoy . My dad used it , my husband uses it , and I 'm sure my boys will use it when they 're old enough to shave . If it was n't good , I do n't think it would 've been around all these years .
 My grandfather found a vial of Old Spice in his Navy kit when he joined in 1943 . He continued using it after the war and my father picked it up when he himself came of age . I began shaving about ten years ago and choice was obvious
 Old Spice cologne smells great . I 'll buy this cologne on a regular basis . It 's very masculine and refreshing . The fragrance also blends well with my aftershave lotion . I like the fact that the bottle looks very different from other colognes . I 'd certainly recommend it to my friends and family members .
 My husband Test Drove this cologne . The cologne has a nice clean scent . Not really heavy , and according to my husband , '' `` manly . '' '' The price is right . I like it much better than some of the overpriced designer colognes . My husband has sensitive skin and this cologne did n't cause any breakouts or irritation .

 My hubby has kinda wiry wavy soft hair and we had samples of this from a local spa . They quit selling it so I had to hunt for it and it has been very hard to find to purchase in North America ! My airline stewardess friend finally go some for me in Paris so I saw the new packaging and naming convention . That helped me find it here . He loves this shampoo and recently I was able to find it on the Smallflower website as well.Anyhoo , he says it keeps the frizz down and it is softer . He uses nothing else on his hair ... he 's very caveman like !
 I 've been using NO-AD products for years . And they are the best combination of quality suntan products and reasonable prices.I 've used the previous generation of their Sunless Tanning lotions for years , clear ones without a color that would show where you 're applying it . This new version WITH a color makes application even easier ... and makes it harder to make `` mistakes '' in application , e.g. , getting it in your hair or around your finger nails.I ca n't say enough for this line of products . Just found the NO-AD SPF45 stick , which is a great way to apply local block .
 One of the best colognes ever . No complaint from me about this product . I really like the smell of it , too . Some colognes smell bad after several hours , but this one lasted a long time . It also feels refreshing . I will definitely recommend this product to everybody who is looking for a new cologne .
 I do n't usually use cologne because my wife and I find most scents too strong and often overpowering . However , the Brut is very subtle . You and someone close to you know that it is on but not everyone in the room is aware of it . I would definitely recommend this cologne to friends and family . The cost seems reasonable . Also it arrived well packaged and very quickly -- a credit to your site .
 What I liked the most was the size of the sample , I mean wow , usually a sample or trial size is really kind of little . This was a full size and I loved it . My wife liked the smell and said she was also surprised to see such a large trial product . Easy to say that I was quite pleased with the Brut and would also considering buying it if my regular cologne was n't available or just for a change .
 I feel the fragrance of the Brut cologne was very nice . It was n't too strong . It had just enough to put off a nice smell . Also , I feel it has a big advantage over men 's colognes because of its great price . I would recommend this to my friends , as well as using it again myself .
 I do n't usually wear cologne because of asthma and allergies , but if I was to wear one , this one would probably be it . It is n't too overpowering and did n't seem to bother me much . I would recommend it to others !
 Brut is a classic men 's scent . What I liked about it most was that I could put it on in the morning before leaving for the day , and the scent was still there at night when I got home . Brut has a woodsy smell that is n't too overpowering . It 's refreshing and the girls like it too !
 This is a really good-smelling cologne . It 's not too strong , and it does n't smell cheap . My wife liked the way it smelled on me . If you want a nice smelling cologne that wo n't overpower you , this is the one to get . I would highly recommend Brut to anyone -- especially if you do n't want to spend a whole lot of money .
 This is a great product . I 've been using it for about two years , and it holds shape better than any other similar product I 've ever used .
 This product removed every bit of my dark red nail polish rather quickly and left no residue . For the price , it 's definitely worth having as a staple . My only complaint is that the scent is n't that great . But other than that , I definitely recommend this product .
 I like this product . It works well and does n't have the terrible smell that makes you go outside to take your old polish off . Also , my nails do n't feel dry after using this polish remover . I 'd recommend this product to anybody , especially someone who uses polish remover frequently .
 this product is really good at removing nail polish cuz it 's fast and clean . the only thing is it 's so smelly .
 This is very similar to other polish removers , but with a few exceptions . This product is a lot gentler to my cuticles . Other removers leave my cuticles feeling dry and unhealthy . This product really does a good job removing nail polish from hard to reach places . Also , it does n't dye my skin like the other products . I 'd definitely buy this product in the future .
 It 's in an easy-to-use bottle , with a good grip , so there 's no fear of dropping the bottle on your clothing . The opening at the top is wide enough to saturate a cotton ball . The remover works quickly and neatly without drying out my nail bed . My nails felt moist -- as if I 'd put lotion on them . I like the product and I 'd recommend it .
 The Cutex Polish Remover worked wonderfully . It 's easy and quick . Also , my nails feel much stronger and healthier after using this product . It still does n't smell as good as some other brands , but it works great . I 'd definitely recommend this product to my friends and family .
 You can now remove nail polish without ruining your skin AND without getting `` high '' off the fumes . Gentle and even moisturizing , it does a great job of removing polish from your fingertips -LRB- or anywhere else it may have splashed onto ! -RRB- and has a mild scent .
 no.ad sun cream is very good . BUT the cost to get to uk is too expensive .
 I have used this product for may years and lately I had trouble finding the # 4 or # 8 SPF rating it in our local stores . Living in Arizona good lasting sun screen is very important . The no Ad brand goes on easily and lasts a long time even when swimming . . The purchase on line was the first time I tried on line shopping . it was a fast and easy way to get the merchandise I needed .
 I have been using No-Ad sunscreen for years , and have recommended it to other discerning sun-lovers .

 My hair has a tiny wave to it . Just enough to keep my fine thin hair from being completely straight . This Aussie product makes it possible for me to enhance the wave and give it almost a natural looking scrunch or curl to it depending on the humidity here.This product works great and smells wonderful . Friends always comment on how wonderful the scent is when I use this product.This mega spray is great for strong hold of your shape . Depending on how much product you use you can have a light spray or if you like that stiff look just keep applying and eventually it will get there , but really these products are n't made for that . They hold without being stiff or sticky which is what I like about them.I absolutely love this product . Hairstyles change now with all the natural looks it 's nice to see a company with a product that still holds very well . This is a great styling product it allows you to make wonderful hairstyles without fear of them falling or having a lot of fly aways.Also with this product it has that wonderful Aussie scent . I 've used this product or another of their line since I was a teenager and I 'm 32 now . Aussie makes quality hair care products at very reasonable prices and I do n't feel as if they are any less than the salons products . In my opinion I find them higher quality because they not only have quality , scent , but a great price . Which adds up to a great product deal !
 I have used Aussie products off and on for years , and I never get tired of that certain scent they use.You do n't need a lot of this product to get good styling results . Hold lasts all day , too . Smells great . What else can I say ...
 Delivers what it saids . Volume and healthy hair . Works excellent with the Real Volume Shampoo and Conditioner andthe Sprunch Hairspray . I love that it has no alcohol in itand that it washes out easily . All of Aussie products areexcellent . Even better then the salon brands . I have triedmany products , I mean many and Yes this is an excellentproduct .
 Kerastase in the best product for thick hair that is now living out in Palm Springs ! The dry air made it feel like straw . This Super K Stuff made is soft and shiney . I love it !
 I have moderately wavy hair that blow-dries straight , and this mousse is great for when I want to enhance the waves . I just work a little through my damp hair and scrunch it , and it holds waves pretty well . I 've had one product that worked absolutely perfectly - CitreShine mousse - that I found in London , but I was unable to find it anymore and so I bought this . It 's not perfect -LRB- hair will fall flatter after a period -RRB- , but I 've tried a lot of similar products and I really like this one .
 I have been using this mousse for over 10 years . It 's hard to find in my area now , so I buy it on Amazon . It does n't leave my hair crunch feeling . It 's soft and not frizzy . Love it !
 I used to straighten my hair every day until I noticed how dead my hair was and how lifeless my natural curls were . I started leaving it curly again , but it obviously was n't the same as it was pre-straightening . I picked up this moussee and it makes my hair look amazing ! It does n't have a crunchy feel , but holds my curls and makes them look gorgeous . I use it with Redken 's Ringlet and Garnier 's Curl Cream/Gel .
 I have naturally curly and frizzy hair in humid weather . The Scruples enforce sculpting glaze does wonders for my hair . It is light weight and does not make my hair sticky or heavy , just clean , nice shine , and bouncy . I apply to damp hair , let air dry a little , then blow dry , and style .
 I have been using Enforce sculpting glaze since the 1980s . For fine hair , you need something strong but not greasy , because oil and grease will only weigh your hair down and make it fall . Most waxes have lots of lanolin and petroleum , and so end up defeating the purpose of trying to get your hair to go in a different direction than it might naturally like . Gels are similarly heavy and goopy , and really do not have the strength and lightness needed to accomplish the job most elegantly.Enforce is a hair glaze with seems to have no grease or weight . It 's a very light but strong liquid which , once applied , will either leave your hair exactly where you want it , or , if brushed out after drying , will hold it more or less in the direction you intended without being stiff . My fine , thin hair grows forward , but my face looks better without a hunk of hair coming down and cutting it in half . Even if cut very short , it will only go in the other direction with the help of Enforce.Works great with very short hair , and as my hair gets longer , keeps it manageable until the next cut . I have not been able to find this locally for many years , and can not recommend it highly enough.When traveling , you only need to carry a small amount as a little goes a very long way . Dries quickly and pretty much invisibly , leaving no residue or flakiness.I am pleased Amazon makes such fine products available nationally . Long live Enforce !
 Have been on chemo for 18 months-luckily did not lose hair but very badly affected . Hairdresser said use Scruples everytime I wash hair . In 3 weeks my hair became alive , rich , thick and shiny . Many people thought I had started using a wig ! Scruples saved my hair and dignity-Amazon search came through again .
 I have used the product before and like it a great deal . It does a fine job with my thin hair .
 I love this product.I put it on my hair while it is damp and it gives my hair body for the whole day.Delivery was very fast too ...
 Great hold without feeling overly stiff . Used this for years . Still the best ! Item arrived quickly and at an excellent price . Would highly recommend .
 I had found this product a few years ago but changed hair styles and did n't use it . Was using a different product but when back to Scruples when I was running out of a different product and found the Scruples Sculpting Glaze to work better for me . Unforutnately I could not find it anywhere locally and was glad to be able to purchase it on line through Amazon .
 It was worth ordering and waiting for . It 's the best hair product for the unruly hair i have . It also reached me during the time alotted . I was pleased .
 I love this perfume ; thanks so much for scrounging some up somehow ! I 'm probably going to purchase some more soon , as I 'm pretty sure this product is an endangered species.Not only does this remind me of when I was in high school , but I have just literally always loved this scent . It 's crisp and sweet , but also has notes of musk . The scent is just as good now as it was when I was a kid , kinda like day to night .
 I 've been using Old Spice for 40 years off and on but it 's hard to find a spray bottle . It was a qiuck find on Amazon
 Old Spice is a pleasant scent , although there are more contemporary colognes that I prefer , like `` Realm '' and `` Altitude . '' This is a good choice for travelers , though , as the bottle is small and is long-lasting . I keep this in my travel bag as it takes up almost no room , lasts quite a while , and is offered at a bargain basement price . Smelling good on the go never was so easy or cheap !
 My husband is very pleased with the order . He has used Old Spice Spray Original since it first came out and will not use any other kind . He wo n't even try any other kind . We can not buy it where we live so he was very happy when I found it on the Internet . Thank you
 This is a very good product and works good . I have been using this product since last 4 years .
 This is a great product . It works on both hair and beard . Several touchup applications can be made with a single package.Previously the kit contained a real good application brush but not anymore . If the kit had the brush I would have rated the product higher.Autoship on multiple packages is great . Effective , convenient to purchase , and a better price than on sale at the local store .
 I 've tried several products
 This product seemed to have everything I needed . It came with gloves , brush for mustache and beard , little dish for mustache and beard and such -- very easy to use . The color seemed to take very well even on the gray hairs . I liked the ease of application . I 've noticed that Clairol seems to have nice conditioning products in their hair color as my hair was nice and soft afterwards . Overall , an excellent product .
 The packaging was nice but a little crowded on the front . It was very easy to use and did n't leave a mess . WE LOVED THE NO-DRIP GEL . We liked that it was an all-in-one kit . We 'd recommend this product . It was easy to use and turned out nice .
 This hair color was easy to use and looked natural . It covered my husband 's gray well . It 's similar to other men 's hair color , but comes in more colors . He liked being able to use the same product for his hair , beard , and mustache instead of using different products for each . This is a product my husband will use again . He 'd recommend it to others .
 I liked this product because of the no-drip gel . The brush made the gel easy to apply to facial hair and the color blended well with my own natural color hair . I also liked the product because it was fast and easy to use . It also made my hair feel fuller . Nice product . I 'll probably buy it .
 Este producto es genial , es lo mejor que est&aacute; en el mercado , lastima que ya no est&aacute; siendo fabricado por clairol .
 This is the only product I ever use to color my hair . It is easy-to-use and the results are always very natural . With Amazon Subscribe and Save it is an exceptional value since you get a 15 % discount and free shipping .
 This was a good purchase from ordering the product to receiving it at home . I 've previously used the product and trust in its quality . I will definitely order it again as long as the price is competitive . Thank you .
 I have been using this for years . Love it ! I have color treated fine hair but lots of it . I normally put this on after my hair is dry but if I 'm in a hurry and running out of the house with wet hair I will put it on wet . It gives my hair great shine without a greasy look . I do n't apply to the roots of my hair . I try to stay at least an inch away . It also makes it easy to run my fingers through my hair ... it does n't seem to tangle as easily.I regularly get compliments on the condition of my hair . I know it is thanks to Recovery Complex . I can see the difference when I run out ... UPDATE ... . I had an old bottle I was finishing before I started using this Amazon purchase so I did not notice they had changed more than the bottle ... -LRB- it now has a pump that is nice -RRB- but they have also added a scent . I think its nice but it was n't there before . All and all it seems as if it still works the same on my hair .
 I 've used Bain de Terre Recovery Complex for many , many years now . I keep trying other products , but keep returning to this one - it makes my long , fine hair shinier , less frizzy , and stronger . One of the reasons I love it so much is that it does NOT have a strong scent -LRB- most folks would probably say it has none at all , but I can detect a very light , pleasant one -RRB- - I tried both Biosilk and Chi Silk infusion and could not stand the strong scents . The product says to use 3-4 drops , but I usually use about a nickel-size amount on my hair -LRB- and I even use B&B de-frizz on top of that sometimes -RRB- . Since I color my hair , and I 'm getting older -LRB- 51 years now -RRB- , and like to wear my hair long , I do whatever I can to make it comb without breaking and stronger . This product helps ALOT !
 This is simply the best serum I 've ever used . No matter how much I use , my hair is not greasy , and it ends up extremely shiny and silky , no frizz at all , even in the most humid weather . Skip the drugstore brands , and try this ! I 've gone from using several products on my hair to only this !
 Why you should consider to buy this :1 . Its relatively inexpensive2 . It smells wonderful3 . Its not incredibly thickWhere you should keep a bottle of this :1 . Your desk drawer at work - mid morning or mid afternoon pick up2 . Your gym bagThis is best used on dry hair . Nice alternative to oil sheen.Highly recommended for dry , damaged , ethnic hair , frizzy , curly hair , etc. . . This product soaks into the hair folicule , and does n't leave a oily residue -LRB- and I use over a quarter size in my hair -RRB- ! I have dry , frizzy , damaged hair.Very nice product .
 I used this product for many years , but had difficulty finding it after I moved to Maine . On a hunch , I tried Amazon , and two days later I looked good again .
 I am someone who used to always say that I hate my hair . I am in the process of growing out a lot of layers . I used this product everyday for about a week . It was amazing even on the first day . Now I use it every few days as a kind of maintenance . It totally changed my hair . I have also found some new favorite conditioners and shampoos but I know that this product had a great part in turning my hair around . A little goes a long way in the amount you use and how much you use it too .
 My hair tends to be dry no matter how much I condition it . My wife told me to try the Bain de Terre product -LRB- she was n't using it very much -RRB- . WOW an immediate improvement that leaves my hair smooth , not oily , and no frizz or dryness ! Now I catch my wife swiping my bottle to apply on her hair after getting out of the pool to help detangle and comb her hair without any struggle or breaking . This stuff is the bomb .
 My family has searched for years for a product that would take care of our frizzy hair without leaving it greasy and weighted down . We found this product and our search has now ended . If you want manageable , soft , and non-greasy hair without frizz , this is the product for you .
 I 've used this for many years . It makes your hair feel great . It is fantastic after a hair color or perm . It 's a little hard to find . I was trilled when I found out you could buy it on Amazon !
 This leave in treatment -LRB- for me -RRB- does more than the other shine serums that just make your hair shiny & smooth , this actually reconditions your hair . The name `` Recovery Complex '' is accurate for this product . I have been using this for 15 years . It used to be called just `` recovery complex . `` It was recommended to me by my hairdresser when my hair was 36 '' long and bleached . I was seriously considering chopping it all off at that point , and this reconditioned my hair and made it possible for me to keep my very long , bleached hair for many more years.Since then I have cut my hair and dyed it over and over again looking for a color I like . After all the damage from the dyes , this product , again , saved my hair . Like other reviewers I have tried several other brands , including salon brands , and I keep coming back to this.Also , it works very well with many differenct product lines - I have used it with Sebastian , Biolage and Paul Mitchell , when I used it with cheaper shampoos like Pantene I had to use more recovery complex . I actually use this to gauge how harsh my shampoo is.Overall - excellent product - 4oz . lasts several months for me - worth full price at the salon , this lower price is a great deal !
 This Bain de Terre Recovery Complex Anti-Frizz Silky Shampoo is TERRIFIC AND SO ARE THE SELLERS !! Very prompt shipping and no problems .
 Authenticly helps repair split ends and smooths frizzy dry hair . this product is healthy for youe hair not damaging like some other glosses . I 've been using it for years now and highly reccomend it ! towel dry and apply a few drops before blow drying ! Worth every penny !
 I love this product . Gives my hair shine and manageability without being stiff or sticky . Been using it for ten years .
 have used for several years -- my hair is fine , dry and wavy -- accentuates the curl , also like that I can use it on dry hair , with just a little water , to pep it up , too . I also use a foam gel most of the time , but no other conditioner .
 Terrific product . Takes dry looking hair and gives it shine and re-newed color . Not too heavy or greasy . Highly recommend it if you have struggles with flat or dry looking hair . Helps calm frizzies , too .
 This recovery complex is wonderful . I 'm sorry to see it recieved a bad review . I have course , natural curley hair that frizzes also and I find this makes my hair soft and not frizzy at all . I 'm sure it works differently on everyone-glad it worked for me . Worth the price as far as I 'm concerned .
 This is a wonderful product . Makes your hair feel so good and removes all the tangles after washing . Overall , I am very happy with it . Very quick shipment . I got it in a few days .
 I have been using this hair product for about 10 years and it continues to be the best for my hair.I have thick , curly hair and this serum keeps the curls curly and the frizz away , even on rainy days .
 I love this product , it delivers a great experience and is the only one I use , I have been using this product for many years , I love it .
 This product maintains my hair silky and smooth even during winter time . I love this product and I 'm going to order again .
 I have used this product before and like it very much . I was not sure it was the same product since I was not purchasing it from a beauty supply house . But I am very pleased to say it is the same and I am very satisfied with the ease of ordering this product .
 My husband has been using this product for quite some time . It is an excellent product , however , the packing of the product for shipping was very poor and we lost over 1/3 of the product . I had ordered 2 bottles and both were opened on arrival and the packing was wet from the product . It was a mess . I contact Amazon with my compliant and have not received any response . Very unhappy and will not be ordering this product again from Amazon .
 Bain de Terre Recovery Complex is amazing . I 've used it in the past when a hair stylist 's efforts went awry and my hair was burned from a permanent solution . This product saved and restored my hair . My hair dresser has told me in the past I have the strongest hair she 's ever worked on , thanks to this product ! I stopped using it when I could n't get it locally and recently discovered my bangs were breaking from using my straightening rod . So I started looking as the local guy told me it had been discontinued . I can not tell you how thrilled I was to find it on Amazon.com ! I 'm hoping it will save my bangs and they will stop their breakage soon as it 's getting a tad serious now ! I highly recommend you use this product on a daily basis , no matter your hair type , but especially if you have any damage to your hair . It will leave your hair feeling silky and soft too ! Hubby loves that !
 Great company , did not receive product and they immediately shipped another . Eventually received 1st order as welll and was told to keep it for inconvenience . Really above and beyond .
 This stuff is great for that static you get in your hair in the winter . Beware , a little bit goes a long way . Do n't use too much at one time .
 I have been buying Bain de Terre Recovery from my hair dresser and always really liked it.However , when I found I could get it online at less than half the price I was delighted . It camein perfect shape in short time .
 My hairdresser told me about this product ... this serum has no alcohol which is better for your hair . I was using a name brand product but have now switched to Bain de Terre . I even had my daughter change to this product . Researching the web to locate the best deal was with Amazon ... larger quantity , lower price with free shipping ... Amazon outdid them all . So if your are using serum , this is the product for you !
 Have been using this for years and it makes a huge difference in keeping my hair styled even in high humidity -LRB- and my hair is naturally curly , and easily frizzes ! -RRB- .
 I have frizzy , curly , course hair . I have bought numerous products to tame the beast . Bain de Terre Recovery anti frizz , leaves my hair shiny and smooth always . It protects when a flat iron is used and leaves it soft , shiny , and smooth . It does n't leave a heavy reside like other products . I love it . No more wasting money on inferior products . A must try .
 This is an excellent hair serum for dry curly hair . It seems tomoisturize as it adds sheen to the hair .
 I 've been using this stuff for years . I have thin hair that is often hard to manage and can get easily dried out . I was getting the recovery complex from my hairdresser . Since I have moved I have been looking for it in several salons in the area with no success . I was happy to be able to find and order it online . Because I use it regularly , it was an extra bonus to be able to `` subscribe '' to receiving the order and not have to manually order it each time I got low .
 I usually use organic or natural products without chemicals . However , there is no denying how amazing my hair looks after applying a small quarter sized application of this product . Although it has a light scent , I wish this product had no added scent .
 My hair is like the hair of Camila Alves , the model - just to have an idea of the texture of my hair . I use the flat iron frequently and I needed a product that would give me some protection from the heat without leaving my hair oily , heavy and dull . '' Bain de Terre - recovery complex anti-frizz '' is wonderful !!! It leaves my hair silky , shiny and easy to take care.I am impressed with this product . Usually I use the flat iron after blow drying my hair . I have long hair , and I use 3x a drop of the size of a dime on my damp hair ; I spread it from the top to the ends . I leave my hair to dry naturally until it is almost dry . Then I blow dry my hair and I use right after the flat iron . Since I started using this product I notice that it was completely different than the other product I was using before . It makes my hair beautiful and soft for several days . After the flat iron I finish the look with 2 drops - dime size of Biosilk Therapy , another great product . These combination let my hair really nice ! I do n't know how it would work on other types of hair . By the way , like Camila , my hair is long , curly and dry . This product make it very smooth . I hope it helps .
 Love this product - hard to find in stores !! Just a small amount calms frizz and gives hair a fuller appearance !!
 I love this serum . I used some olive oil crap and it made my hair heavy and smelling nasty . This makes my hair smooth and alive . SHINY too .
 My hair is very straight , thick , but very fine . Other products have weighed it down so even with a shine it lacked body . You only use a drop of Bain de Terre Recovery Complex and your hair will shine .
 Just the best . I 've been using for years . My granddaughter -LRB- 9 -RRB- also says it 's the best detangler there is . And it never makes your hair greasy . Because so little is needed , a bottle lasts for a really long time .
 I have used his product for years - I have just enough wave in my hair to be irritating . I hate waxy , heavy products and this one is perfect ! Light , effective , not greasy and works well on medium thick , color-treated hair .
 Have a child with super curly hair that cries each time we brush or comb . This works great and leaves a hair silky soft .
 I love this stuff ... great for taming the fly aways and frizz on dry hair ! And never makes hair greasy ! I ca n't do without it !!
 I have been using this oil for about 15 years and I find it to be better than any other . My Mom used it and it just made sense for me to as well ! Great price and I am happy to now know where to purchase it !
 Wonderful on my hair . Light weight product . Antifrizz + increased shine . Have used it for years and love it . Seems to leave my hair in better condition without making it greasy or weighing it down .
 I 've used this product for several years based on stylist recommendation . I think it does a great job keeping my hair frizz free and has a lovely natural shine without feeling you 've put anything in your hair . Apply to wet hair before you blow dry . Great stuff !
 I 've tried everything to help with my daughters ' tangled hair and nothing else has seemed to work . I tried this serum and it is AMAZING ! I put a dime-sized amount in my palm and rub it around in my hands then streak it through their dry hair . Tangles just slip right out with NO MORE CRYING ! I was just about to chop their hair short so we would n't have any more crying battles with getting their hair done every morning , but a friend suggested I try this and gave me her bottle to try . I was amazed at how well it worked and even left my girls ' hair shiny and smooth . I 'm so happy I never have to saturate their heads with detangling spray again !
 I am a red-head and it is hard to find a good sunless tanner that does n't leave me looking orange - this stuff works great , smells descent and I can see where I 'm putting it !
 Used in our showers at the PD . Seems to be liked by all users .
 Since this product is no longer available locally , it was a relief to find it at a good price . Delivered as advertised . Recommended .
 This product is excellent . The hold time is excellent , and it does n't wear off if my hair is blown about by the wind . I 'd definitely recommend it to my friends and family . The only thing I did n't like was the amount I get for the price . Although for the extra hold that it gives my hair , it 's worth the extra dollars .
 First off , before explaining my use of this product , I want to tell you that I have really thin hair . It 's almost unmanageable and only certain products make my hair manageable . I 'm constantly searching for new and improved hair products to get my hair looking the way I like it . It seems like everything new I try does n't work as well as this product did . Well , with Brylcreem , after I jumped out of the shower , I put a little bit -LRB- about the size of a dime -RRB- in my hand and worked it into my hair and scalp . After styling my hair , I let the product air dry and then I brushed my hair out . Believe it or not , my hair looked great ! I was very impressed with the product and I 'll continue using it even after my current supply is depleted . I want to thank the makers of Brylcreem for making my hair manageable again without having a crewcut .
 In a few words , this Power Gel is very good stuff . It 's not the BEST I 've tried , but it 's close . I usually have a lot of problems getting my hair to stay in position because it tends to spike up . But with Brylcreem , my hair stays put almost every time I use it . I 'm very interested in purchasing this .
 I really liked the Brylcreem Power Gel . It did n't make my hair feel stiff and it gave it good control , which is what I look for in a product like this . I 'd definitely recommend using it and give it a thumbs up .
 I have difficult to style hair , to say the least , so there 's no way I can leave the house on any given day without using some kind of product to tame it . When I 've gone out of my way to make the extra effort to curl or straighten my hair on humid days I need something a little extra to keep my flyaways in place . I 've tried several different brands of salon hairsprays , but living on a budget has eliminated those as an option . I 'd had previous good luck with Tresemme 's Heat Tamer spray and their Ultra Shine mist , so I thought I 'd give them another shot.I picked this giant aerosol can of hairspray for $ 4 , which was the first thing that made me happy . Although Tresemme has several different offerings in the hairspray department , I picked the Ultra Fine Mist because of it 's claim of flexible hold . I liked the idea that my hair would n't look wet or crunchy and that there would still be some movement in it . And I 'm pleased to say that this spray does exactly what the can claims it does . The mist is fine and the hold is strong while still being flexible . It tames what I need it to without looking like I have a ton of product in my hair . This is the first drug store hairspray I 've found that does just as good a job as the salon brands at a third the price.However!There is one fairly significant downfall . The smell.This stuff smells absolutely AWFUL . Just terrible . It 's a pungent kind of musky scent . I was surprised since Tresemme 's other products always had a nice light fragrance about them , but something in the chemical makeup of this spray is different . So when you first spray and style , you 're going to smell off-putting . The flip-side of that is that the scent fades to nothing fairly quickly -LRB- in less than 10 minutes -RRB- , so as long as you can bear it for a little while , the odor can be gone by the time you leave the house . People with allergies or sensitive noses , however , might not be willing to put up with that.I love this and until I find something with a better -LRB- or non-existent ! -RRB- fragrance , I 'll keep rebuying this .

 This is an excellent ultra fine hairspray . The mist is a very fine and even spray great for shaping your hair . It does n't spit out chunks of wet hairspray like cheaper products do and as a result does not leave your hair wet feeling.The hold is good and can last all day as long as it is n't windy outside . Obviously do n't buy this for ultra hold or windy days . This is meant to be a very good shaping spray , one that you can spray on your hair and be able to run your fingers through it or brush or comb to shape it and spray again to lock in place.I used to buy the expensive paul mitchell and sebastian hairsprays that used to cost me $ 10-12 years ago and was very happy with them until I was on a tight budget . I shopped around for cheaper alternatives , but budget hairsprays like aquanet and suave and many others just are just plain horrible . They leave your hair wet , the hold does n't last , and tend to flake at the end of the day . Then I found tresemme , it was just as good as the paul mitchells and sebastian hairsprays . The ultra fine mist was equal to the expensive salon brands . Tresemme has better hold than the sebastian hairspray . With sebastian , I had to spray my hair with a lot of it to get decent hold and with tresemme I do n't have to use as much . The hold is about equal to paul mitchell . All of this said at a price point of just under $ 4 dollars at the current time of review .
 I have tried many different hair spray products and Tresemme is the BEST !!! It is n't heavy and sticky , but very light while keeping the style in your hair . I wo n't use anything else .
 Hair spray was received promptly . My husband has used this product for many years . Appreciate being able to order on Amazon.com .
 This hair spray works as advertized . As opposed to some of the other reviewers , I like the aerosol version of this product , as the non aerosol sprayer does get stuck frequently and then will spray a stream in a random direction such as my wall instead of my hair , when that happens I can not get the sprayer to stop sticking , even using hot water , so I have to throw the bottle in the trash . I would prefer if Consort added some healthy ingredients that would nourish the hair follicle such as biotin , if they do that my rating of this product would become a 5 rating . Overall I like the aerosol version of this product and will contine to use , but may switch over to one of the other mens versions that include biotin after they lower their prices .
 First - I do not like the Consort aerosol hair spray at all . But the pump-spray bottle of the Consort hair spray works great . I do n't know why the aerosol version is so bad ????
 I endorse this product for men and women alike . This is a wonderful hair spray and the price is right too . Good service too !!! Ralph and Marian Umhoefer
 Purchased this item here on Amazon because my local drug stores do n't seem to carry it.I use to use the aerosol version of consort years ago when i had alot of hair to hold in place.Now i just use it to hold what 's left of my hair in place.Good product with strong holding power with little fragrance ...
 The Consort For Men of old always smelled so bad . It got to you after four or five hours and you wondered if people are smelling the same stench you did . The Consort , unscented , extra hold is good for holding and has no smell . It works great for me .
 I 've tried many hair sprays over the years . My hair is wispy fine so it needs something to keep it in place . Most sprays have way too much `` hold '' for me . Consort used conservatively can look like you 're not using a spray at all . I prefer this non-aerosol version because it allows control over how much is applied . Just a light push on the spray head is generally all that 's needed .
 Consort For Men Non-Aerosol Hair Spray is a good product for those of you who use spray instead of mousse or gel . There is no stiffness , no stickiness , no aerosol , no scent , and no hassle . It holds hair in place very well . This `` extra hold '' product ranks third best as far as hold capability in the Consort line of hair spray products , behind the `` mega hold '' and `` extreme hold '' hair sprays . I highly recommend this product .
 Since I have very thin blonde hair , gel or wax do n't do any good ; they just make my hair look greasy and dim . That 's why I was looking for a hairspray which would fit my wants . I tried numerous different types of hairspray and neither of them did a very good job
 i guess this was around during his time ... I had never heard of it . Found it here & bought it for him . He is super pleased with it & doesnt smell like a girl when he uses it .
 It does what it is supposed to . The spray nozzle is a little coarse . With a better nozzle , fit would be better .
 I have been using this product for over 20 years and have been very satisfied with it . It was introduced to me by a barber in California and I have been using it since.The thing I like most about the product is that it dos n't get stickey . I prefer the non-aerosol spray to the aerosol type even though I have used both .
 I love it , no more gunk on my lip brush from the bottom of my purse . I could n't be happier .
 Awesome lip brush . I have had it a couple of years and I think it will last me a lifetime ! Fits easily anywhere and puts lip color on easily .
 I really enjoyed test driving this product . I especially liked the fact that it was an unscented hair spray . It does n't clash with my cologne ! My whole family tried it out and liked it . I 'd definitely recommend this product to my friends , and my mother 's already bought her own bottle .
 I liked the Vitalis Super Hold Hairspray for Men . It held quite well and it was n't sticky . It also did n't cause build-up or flaking . I do n't like to use scented hairsprays and liked that this one is unscented . I 'd purchase it again and I 'd recommend it to others also .
 The Vitalis Hairspray does a good job of keeping hair in place without looking stiff . This unscented spray has a slight fragrance . I 'd describe the scent as musk . I 'd purchase this product again .
 Good product . It did n't feel stiff or sticky , like a lot of other hairsprays . And it really was unscented -- a lot of times I get an unscented product , and there 's still some scent . This is a product that I 'd recommend to my friends and family .
 It 's not too heavy -- does n't weigh my hair down like a heavy spray . No strong odor or smell , and holds my hair in place nicely !
 Great product . This hairspray holds well but is n't too stiff . It has no odor . I 'll buy it again when needed .
 What I liked best about this product was that it was n't heavy and did n't make my hair look wet after using it . I liked that it was unscented . I also liked that it worked all day long . Because it 's in a pump bottle instead of an aerosol can , it was easier to use and to control how much I put on my hair . - Mickey -LRB- Marcy 's husband -RRB-
 I 'm not kidding , it 's worth every penny -LRB- though I must admit that I get it at a lower price from a secret supplier in Asia -RRB- . After using this , you 'll swear that you just got a hot oil/deep treatment done from a professional salon.I have chemically treated hair -LRB- relaxed , double process - colored & fine hair equals damaged hair -RRB- , and this is the only conditioner that works for me . Another plus is , this is the only conditioner that elicits `` your hair smells sooooo good '' reaction from my boyfriend & daughter.Surprisingly , even if it moisturizes my hair excellently , it still leaves it bouncy & with enough volume.This lasts about 6 months if you use it once a week , so it 's really not that expensive , especially if you substitute this for your regular deep conditioning treatment at the salon.If you 're still wary , try a smaller bottle .
 I 'm revising this review because , although I do n't like what it does for my hair , I used it on my 4 pound Yorkshire Terrier and her hair became instantly silky & shiny ! It is 5 stars for any Yorkie owner.For me -LRB- the human -RRB- it 's only OK but not as good as Pantene . The other products in the Kerastase brand are better .
 I had used this perfume before and was completely satisfied with the fragrance . i would recommend it to anyone looking for a long last fragrance . I tried to find it in the UK , but ended up buying it from the US as i could not find it here . Was a bit disappointed with the seller would communicate but it has nothing to do with the quality of the product .
 Phenomenon is a very pleasant perfume for men . It has a sweet yet manly flavor that is noticed by ladies and gentlemen . I first bought it in Paris years ago and have been using it since then . All men should try it .
 Smells good and it works well , enhance your tan by contuining to use this after your holiday as a day to day moisturiser.Smells of cocoa butter and helps repell horrid insects by night too !
 first bought this product on holiday in Tenerife & have continued to use it ever since . It works really well , I never peeled and my tan remained for ages . I 'm very disappointed that it 's currently unavailable . I 'd have bought loads as i 've not found it in any local shops .
 I have been using the Atra blades for many years . I find that they are dependable and give a good shave . I did try the 3 bladed razors and suffered a lot of irritation . I also am able to manuever the Atra blades to trim my goatee and now use them to shave my head . By the way , Amazon offers a great price .
 Another reviewer states that these blades are pretty bad . I DO N'T AGREE . I shave my head with Headblade and these things work great !! At a price of $ 5.99 for 15 blades they are a steal !! If you buy them through any normal retail outlet they will run about $ 1 per blade or $ 15-16 for the 15 ct. package . If you shave your head with Headblade do n't let this deal pass you by !! Thanks Amazon , you have just saved me over $ 60 to shave my head for the next year !!
 I was so happy to find these ! And at such a great price ! I am very disappointed at Gillette for not making these anymore as I 've been using these blades for over 20 years !
 I know the Atra / Atra Plus have been around for over 20 years . In retail stores , the price tends to be about $ 0.80 - $ 1.00 per blade . I have tried the 3 and 4 bladed razors from Gillette and Schick , and even disposables from time to time , but keep coming back to the old reliable Atra Plus . The closeness of the shave , rarity of nicks , etc. are the main attributes . The blades last for 5-6 shaves , so overall it works fine for me . The only problem is that I want to find another heavy handle , but the only ones I seem to find are the lightweight platic ones.I buy a few packs of these here at Amazon when the price is on sale , and have never been dissapointed .
 I received this as a gift from a relative while in Las Vegas -LRB- I believe they have an outlet in the Venetian -RRB- . Never having heard about this , I was a bit apprehensive , and almost wanting to return it for credit . However , a single whiff , and I was hooked . The Acca Kappa scent is cleaner than the Polo Green , and unlike the latter , it does n't degrade over time . I do experiment a fair bit with my perfumes , but this one is going to be a mainstay .
 I am definitely a Beauty Junkie . I have tried probably every Volumizing product on the market -LRB- including the much lauded Phyto Volumizer -RRB- but I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this Kerastase product so much ! It is by far the best ! It leaves your hair silky smooth and with TONS of volume -LRB- even after blowdrying it for 15 minutes -RRB- . It does n't leave behind a gummy or sticky residue . It is a little expensive but it has a lot of bang for its buck and I would even pay more for it if I had to . I will never use anything else again !
 I used this shampoo with Nexxus conditioner and just dried my hair without adding additional products . I am amazed at the results , so much so that I felt compelled to write a review . Running my hands through my hair , I notice that it feels like warm butter ... my husband touched my hair and said it felt like he was running his hands through strands of air . It looks lovely , too . My hair is bouncy and light and not at all over-moisturized like I originally feared it might be . Frankly , I bought it for the wonderful fragrance . What I got was sooo much more . I 'll definitely be returning to the store to buy the conditioner .
 I absolutely love this product . I 've been using it for 50 years ... thank God Revelon has not taken it off the market like so many manufacturers do . Some just ca n't seem to leave a good thing alone.I noticed two other reviews that questioned the fragrance . Either their smellers are busted or mine is because I noticed the same wonderful fragrance that I have been using for 50 years .
 I buy this every year as a gift for my Aunt-in-law since her husband died and no longer is there to get it for her for her birthday .
 i have been looking for this many years because the last one I run outabout 6 years ago , I love it , its just grateMy mum love it
 Smells great not overwhelming . Even sprinkle it on you bed at night for a romantic evening.Great stuff . Good for entire family .
 I HAVE BEEN USING JEAN NATE FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS . IT SATISFIES WHAT I EXPECT IN A FRAGRANCE - NOT TOO PUNGENT OR TOO SPICY .
 I have been using Jean Nate for many years and have been very satified with this product and intent to be using it for many years to come .
 I have been using Jean Nate after bath splash since I was 18 years old ... and that is over 40 years now !!!! Use it daily and absolutely love the fresh fragrance . So happy that i can now get the 30oz size thru Amazon.com !!!!!
 I ordered this product 1 day and it seemed like it was here the next.It came packed beautifully and I will certainly order it again .
 This is -- or WAS -- an absolutely great shampoo for all the right reasons . I have used it for many , many years . I ran out and could not find this MEGA Shampoo anywhere , in any store , and I am in the `` city of stores '' -- NY . I called the number on the shampoo bottle . To my dismay
 Great product , especially for the price ! I found it almost as good as Redkin , Aveeda , Joico , Biologe , and better than Paul Mitchel . I 've been using this as my `` old stand-by '' for 7 yrs . I keep trying new shampoo 's and conditioners but I always come back to this one because of the quality and the price.It leaves your hair soft and very manageable . I use a flat iron and blow dryer on a regular basis and I hardly ever get split ends . When I 've used other products in the same price range , I get split ends a lot.I do use this shampoo with Aussie 's 3 minute miracle on a daily basis .
 I use hairspray and Aussie shampoo really washes my hair clean.It is wonderful to have a shampoo do this . It feels clean.I have tried every Shampoo on the market and nothing made my hairfeel clean . This shampoo does . I get really excited about thisso I wanted to share it with everyone . I do use the volumeconditioner and mousse along with the Sprunch Hairspray . Yesall of these Aussie products work . I have hair pass my shouldersand finally my hair feels healthy so I know I can grow it long.I am telling everyone I LOVE this shampoo .
 Aussie 's Moist shampoo is made with Australian Queensland Macadamia Nut and Guava that make the hair strong and shiny . I love the fragrance and softness it gives my mane and I appreciate all the natural ingredients and years of research that crafted this amazing product.Aussie Moist shampoo is a luxurious and fragrant wash , leaving the hair slick and smooth . I love the super moisturizing properties with not heaviness and no oily roots few hours after washing . In fast it makes the hair fresh and bouncy . I will stick to this brand for a while , since I ca n't get enough . Even the scent of it takes me to a lush island settled in mist with rich fruits and plants . I ca n't recommend it enough to my friends who I know will love it too . I match it up with the Moist Conditioner , which doubles the moisturizing properties of this magical potion . - Kasia S.
 Oh how I wish I discovered this shampoo looong time ago . My hair is really hard to manage . It gets easily frizzy , staticky , dry and tangled . I 've tried EVERYTHING and most shampoos usually ruin my hair , causing it to be more difficult to damage and leaving lots of strands in the drain . Yuck!I saw this on sale at a local drugstore and gave it a try . Let me tell you this , it did wonders for my hair ! After showering , I kept smelling my hair over and over . I love the scent ! It also left my hair feeling super clean , shiny , soft , TANGLE-FREE ! and easily manageable . It 's so gentle on my hair . The pump also makes it easier to use . I definitely recommend this to all who have been trying to find the perfect shampoo . No more guessing which shampoo is the right one for me , because I think I found mine and this one is a keeper .
 The Aussie Mega Shampoo was very good . I was a little leery using it at first since I have colored hair . But it left my hair very soft and manageable . The smell was very good , too . I 'm very pleased with this shampoo and now I 'm going to buy it when I 'm finished with what I received . And I 've already recommended it to family .
 I liked this shampoo very much . First of all , the bottle is huge and it has a handy pump on it . Secondly , it has a very nice clean smell to it -- not feminine or flowery like a lot of other shampoos . It made my hair feel soft and manageable and squeaky-clean . I 'd recommend this to others as well as purchase this product in the future .
 When I received the Aussie shampoo , I was first impressed with the handy pump that came with the bottle . With a couple of small children in the house , a big bottle without a pump can be very messy and end up being a waste of money . Not to mention if it got dropped on a little toe ! As for the cleaning performance of this shampoo , I rate it as excellent ! It left my hair soft , shiny and with all the bounce and fluff that I had n't noticed was missing from my bargain shampoos . Will I buy it again ? YES ! YES ! YES !
 The Aussie Mega Shampoo that I tried is an excellent product . It 's a deep cleansing product that lathers well even with my extremely hard water . The scent is pleasant and everyone in my family likes this product and the other products they manufacture . This product is just as good as more expensive brands and in some comparisons better . I will continue to use this product and recommend to friends and family .
 My hair has never felt so great . Clean and soft . People want to know what I did different . My husband loves it too
 I immediately liked the smell of this shampoo . It does n't overpower . I have very thick curly hair and noticed results after my first use . My hair feels lighter and seems softer as well . I would definitely recommend this product and will purchase it in the future .
 I really like Aussia Mega Shampoo for everyday cleansing . I wash my hair every day and a lot of shampoos either dry my hair out or make it look greasy because of all the buildup . And I loved the smell of it . The big bottle is great . It will last a long time and the whole family can use it too . I have a family of five and we all used it and all of us like it . I really could n't find anything I did n't like about it
 First of all , everyone in my household really loved this shampoo . It has a fresh , clean smell . One feature I especially liked was that it cleaned my hair of the residue left by other shampoos . Many times , even after shampooing two or three times , I still have residue from hair spray , but Aussie Mega left my hair really clean with no buildup . Plus , my hair was extra manageable , too !
 I really enjoyed the Aussie Everyday Shampoo . I have naturally curly hair , and I tend to have a hard time finding shampoo that works well with my hair type . This shampoo was great ! It did n't dry out my hair , which is usually what happens with most shampoos . My hair was shiny and soft . My hair feels cleaner and less tangled . Another big advantage is the packaging . The pump makes it easy to use in the shower . I will definitely recommend this to all of my friends and family .
 I am one who usually buys cheap shampoo . I have waist-length hair and I generally go through a lot of it . Not this stuff ! I just needed a little to get a good lather and very clean feeling hair . The pump on the bottle is helpful for squirting out a minimal amount of shampoo . The shampoo rinsed out of my hair extremely fast . Pleasant and lightly scented , I would definitely buy this product . While it 's more expensive than what I usually buy , it lasts much longer , and therefore is cheaper overall .
 I thought this was a really good product . It did a great job of cleaning my hair . I did n't notice any build-up of other hair products , and my hair was very manageable . All in all , I would definitely buy this product again .
 There were several wonderful things about this product . Aussie left my hair feeling very clean and fresh . It was n't heavy on my hair , yet left it very full . My hair looked better than it has in a long time . It smelled good , too . The value for the money is great . The bottle was huge and very professional looking . I would definitely recommend this to others and buy it again .
 I love this dmae serum . It is very light and smooth . You can feel the firmness in your skin after the first application . I have been using this product for months now and I have sensitive skin . This dmae serum works very well .
 I love this product ! in fact I am about to place an order for my second bottle . Although I am 60 years young I am very fortunate to have very few wrinkles . I have some fine lines close to my jowls and smokers lines above my upper lip . This product has smoothed out all of my problems . I use it in the AM and in the PM as a component of my daily skin care routine . I read several of the reviews prior to my first purchase and followed the advice that the product be `` patted '' on the skin rather that massaged into the skin . I have extremely sensitive skin that is prone to react to almost anything I put on it . I have not had any negative reactions with this product . Needless to say , I am hooked !
 i dont know exactly what is in this stuff or why it works but it does !!! I have sensitive skin , prone to redness and breakouts , and this stuff has that under control as well as my `` smile lines '' . I will absolutely buy this product again .
 This product is the Holy Grail of beauty products ! No joke ! My husband 's cousin came by last night -LRB- I have not seen him in months -RRB- and as we were talking he kept staring at me when I asked why he was staring at me he actually asked me if I had a face lift ! Lol I am 43 years old ! A little young for that do n't you think ! The only thing I have been using for months is this serum . It is amazing , it leaves your face fresh and tight looking . The bottle is small and you only need a few drops , I put that on my face after I have washed it and then put a moisturizer on top -LRB- I use any moisturizer handy -RRB- . Ladies it works - try it . I am going to order five bottles after I write this review in case you all order a bottle and there is none left for me lol . I wonder why none of my dermatologists have ever recommended this ... good luck : -RRB-
 I have purchased this product twice.It firms without flaking or getting scaly and works smoothly under makeup or foundation.Not a waste of money like so many even more expensive products , unscented , and has n't caused any breakouts or irritation of my skin as many other products do .5 vehement stars.Woman / Vain / 30s barely .
 I have been using this product for about two weeks . I love it . I have noticed my jawline area has definitely firmed up . I will definitely order again . If you having issues with sagging skin , this product is for you . I woke up one morning and noticed my skin around my jaw line was droopy . I panic , because I have never ever had problems with wrinkles or crows feet . Saggy skin is much worst than any wrinkles . I had order everything off the market and nothing would work . I decided to try this product and wow ... a dramatic differnce . Combined with my homemade vitamin c serum , I look normal again . This product is now my life long product for sure . A great addition to any skin care regimine . It shipped very fast and for that I would order anything from this seller . One of my greatest purchases on Amazon thus far
 I bought this product because I heard all the praise about DMAE . I thought a lightweight serum would be a smart choice for me because I tend to break out , even at 40 years old . I thought this product would help firm my skin , and it did - and then some ! I 've been using it for about 3 weeks now , and every time I look in the mirror , I 'm startled by the transformation in my skin ; not only is it softer and firmer , but it 's also brighter ! Since I 've been applying it to my neck also , I 've noticed that my thyroid surgery scar has lightened dramatically . I was amazed by this , as I had previously spent a few months religiously applying Bio Oil to that scar , which only irritated it and made it bright red . So , I gave up trying to treat my scar purposely , and was pleasantly surprised that this DMAE product did the job without me trying . I bought my second bottle today because I never want to run out of this `` miracle in a bottle ! ''
 I bought this because I saw it on Dr. Oz . A dermalogist said it was the best product you can use for actually firming the skin.I really like it and I think I see a difference . If it keeps my face and neck just the way they are now , I 'll be happy . I intend to purchase it again .
 Worked wonders for me ! Since recently having a baby I 've had small , puffy bags under my eyes and I just look tired all the time even when I 'm well rested . I got this in the mail the other day and tried it ... woke up this morning and I 'm very impressed with the results ! Just one use and I look well rested , refreshed and my skin looked visibly brighter ! The bags are gone and my eyes look amazing ! I 'm so happy with this product that I ended up buying one for my mom as a gift ! FYI ... the reason I bought this is I saw a segment on the Dr. OZ show and he featured anti-aging products with DMEA in them spoke very highly of them . Hence this amazon purchase ! Way to go Dr. OZ !
 Have been using this product for a few years and this is the best price I 've seen it . Really helps save on your moisturizer , as it helps it to `` glide '' on .
 I bought my first bottle of this serum , and ordered the second bottle after about three weeks because I did n't want to run out ! I 'm 41 , my skin is oily and breakout prone , with dark spots from old acne scars and sun damage . I wanted a product with DMAE that did n't have a bunch of other stuff in it that would make my face break out . This is it ! No breakouts , and my skin just looks brighter , refreshed . The dark spots are fading with this more than with anything else I 've ever used ; it seems to be increasing exfoliation so that some spots are disappearing and others are revealed - like we 're going through layers of skin . I hope that means we 'll eventually get to a point where I 'm mostly free of spots . :-RRB- Makes my skin beautifully smooth ; I 'm proactively using it on my neck and decollette as well .
 I highly recommend this product . I use it everyday after I wash my face . Then I put on my moisturizer . It does keep me looking younger . I 'm 57 years old and I have already recommend it to several of my friends , and they are using it too . Do n't buy it at Whole Foods like I did the first bottle ... it cost much more . Just a drop on your finger is all you need , a little goes a long ways . This small bottle will last about two months .
 I love this serum , it absorbs well and defiantly helps with the appearance of ones skin . This can easily be worn under you day or night cream , it is not greasy . Reviva makes really great skin care products that are not tested on animals and do n't contain animal ingredients .
 This is an incredible serum which not only assists in firming the skin , it also attracts moisture into your skin keeping it plumped , hydrated , and radiant looking . A few drops -LRB- 2-4 -RRB- is all you need at a time . Wonderful product .
 I originally discovered this product at a GNC store . After using it about 3 weeks , I eagerly went in search of more ... no luck ! GNC has decided not to carry this particular DMAE product . Thanks Amazon for coming to the rescue again . I would recommend this to anyone looking for a boost to their appearace and complexion . My sensitive skin loves this product and it does smooth out fine lines over time with no harsh peeling ! This is a `` keeper '' in my house !
 I 've been using this for about a month now , and am getting compliments and being asked `` what have you done , you look wonderful '' . It just gives your face a little lift . I use a moisturizer over it or it would be much too dry on my skin .
 I have sensitive skin and must state that it does not cause any irritation whatsoever . Unfortunately , for my case of deep set wrinkles in my neck , I did not notice much of a difference . The price here , however , is quite competitive , as I saw it being marked up considerably at the stores in the area . Did not do much for me , but for this price , might as well try it !
 I 've used this product for quite some time now . I think it really does help the skin appear more firm .
 I am pleased with the way this product ubsorbs . I could notice a difference in my skin tone within days . My skin feels soft .
 This is one of the first eye creams I have ever enjoyed using without getting red eyes , itching , or discomfort . I had stopped using any eye creams due to unpleasant red eyes.It goes on and disappears , does not migrate into the eye . The small bottle with a pump is great for not contaminating the product and also getting out just a bit at a time . Light and without any perfumes . I have used it as an over all face moisturizer under make up while traveling -LRB- reduce the number of things I need to take with me -RRB- . It works well for that also.I would recommend it as a good product at a rational price .
 This is a great affordable product , love putting it on my neck and chest area as well . And it is great to use under foundations or foundation sticks -LRB- recommend Bobbie Brown -RRB- .
 The Reviva DMAE firming fluid really helps to firm facial skin . The texture is non greasy and perfect for all skin types . I really like this product . I would recommend this product to Amazon 's customers . Great price and fast shipping !
 I live in a humid climat , am mid 40 and have very dry skin , except on my forehead at times ?? About 2 years ago I started getting adult acne , and it would not clear up no matter what I used.This is now my routineEvening
 I 'm a product junkie . I 'm always searching for the magic potion that will make my skin look like it did 20 years ago . This product may not be magic , but it is a great product . It immediately tightened the skin under & around my eyes and firmed my upper lip . My make-up goes on smoothly over it even without an additional moisturizer and the fine eye wrinkles seemed to diminish . It does n't leave a greasy or heavy feeling on my skin ... it just feels smooth and supple . Hopefully the results get even better with continued use .
 Reviva _ Dmae Firming Fluid goes on smoothly and is aborbed quickly into your skin . This product is light enough so you can add an additional SPF for added protection . Dmae Firming Fluid leaves your face smooth and soft . I like this product and will order it again .
 I have the RVS 1102 . It works real well , just put in the stated amount of water turn it on and voila ! It 's great , the only downfall is that if you wanted to put in a Facial Tea Bag -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- -RRB- you ca n't ... the water section is too small and the cone wo n't fit on top of it once it is placed inside.Otherwise , I have no complaints . ~ Ms Ebon&eacute;e

 I was very pleased with the Aussie Moist Shampoo for Dry Damaged Hair . I have long hair with very dry ends . This shampoo made my hair much softer and manageable than others of its type have . I was amazed when I did n't have to use an extra detangler after shampooing . There were several other things that would make me recommend this shampoo . It had a nice grape scent , wonderful lather , a no-mess pump top , and it is n't tested on animals . If you have dry hair , you should try this shampoo . I will definitely buy this in the future .
 This reminded me how much I loved this product . In the early 90 's , I used the Aussie Mega line for years . But lately , I have n't thought about buying it . Most hair products contain scents that I 'm unable to use because they trigger migraines , but I 've never had that problem with this product . I love the scent , and also the way it conditions my daughter 's curly hair and makes it more manageable . Also , the pump dispenser is a great added bonus !
 Aussie Moist Shampoo is definitely a salon product at a very reasonable price . I 've always had dry hair -- it runs in my family . I told my family members about Aussie , and the miracle it did for my hair . I do n't think my hair has ever been this soft . I 'd definitely recommend this product if you have the same problem . Ca n't beat the name , quality , or price .
 I really enjoyed the Aussie Moist Shampoo for Dry Damaged hair . My hair is so soft after I use it . I do n't even need to use a creme rinse . It feels like I 've used a deep conditioner . I would highly recommend using this product .
 I should say it 's really a big bottle , and it saves time to combine shampoo and conditioner together . However , I do n't like the smell too much -- I think it could be improved .
 I was skeptical about this product before trying it . I could n't imagine such an inexpensive product could produce such good results . My hair is a challenge . I have very long , naturally curly hair , and it 's very dry and temperamental . When I opened the bottle of Aussie Moist , I was greeted with a pleasant smell , which reminded me of cherries . I found the product lathered quite well , and rinsed clean , without the feeling of leftover '' `` gunk . '' '' I recommend this product if you have dry or over-processed hair .
 I have been searching for products that will straighten my hair for as long as I can remember and this is the only appliance that works on my super thick , curly hair . I take small segments at a time and instantly have straight , manageable hair that lasts until I wash my hair again . I absolutely love this appliance and strongly recommend it to those with similar hair . PS-For those who live in areas with high humidity in the summer and extreme dryness in the winter , this product make your hair much more manageable in both climates .
 I purchased this flat iron a few months ago , and I love it ! I have curly hair , and it is not thick or too frizzy , but it is awesome on my hair . My results are super straight . I also have sisters that have curly hair and theirs is much thicker and more coarse than mine . At first I thought it was not good on their hair , and maybe they needed Hot Tools -LRB- which is the hottest , but the plates are NOT smooth - a lot of hair pulling ! -RRB- . The trick to this one is to take SMALL sections of hair if yours is thick or coarse , and do n't use ANY hair products until you are done - the moisture is curly hairs worst enemy in this process . Follow my advise , and this is a great product . Oh , and the time it takes to heat up ... hello - turn it on 5 min before you plan on fixing your hair !!
 I tried the more expensive straighteners -LRB- I bought a Jilbere one for 80 bucks ! -RRB- and I was ulimately more pleased with this one . The handle is easy to grip -LRB- not so with most straighteners which feature clunky , thick handles -RRB- and it really does straighten . I have super thick , super curly hair and this is the only iron that provided LASTING results ; it lasted until I washed my hair -LRB- a full week -RRB- without any touch-ups . Definitely a must for girls with thick , frizzy hair that 's a pain to blow dry .
 this iron is good and it works for my frizzy and wavy hair it takes a little while to get hot but it works well and i would recomand a V5 one instead of this but this one works : -RRB-
 I recently got this item from Target in hopes of having straighter hair . When my hair dries it is very curly and very frizzy . I have a previous straightener i 've used but my hair doesnt seem as straight . So when i got this , I was excited to try it to see if it worked . And to my surprise it really did . I have had my hair relaxed before and it looks just about the same !! I add some gel and hair oil , dry it and then straighten it . The whole process of doing my hair seems to take a long time but the iron gets very hot in like 5 mins and its super hot which saves me some time . My hair looks so great and It makes me very happy that its straight and managable . The comb attachment will cause a problem if you dont brush through your hair first . The comb is easy to remove but I have n't used it without the comb so far . I ca n't think of a problem I have had yet with it so I highly recommend this product !!!
 This iron is just great . It is light weight , fast , and heats up very quickly . I got all of my hair straight in less than 1/2 hour ! The comb on the top is a great idea because it combs your hair through right before the heat touches it which assures smooth straight hair with no frizz . Considering the low price and the results for my hair which is medium thick and wavy I would recomend this product to anyone .
 I bought the flat iron about a month ago and i just love it . I had used one before and it made my hair so fine . This one just makes my hair straight but it still has body to it . I bought another one about a week ago and sent one to my sister and she loves it too . I think that for the money it is a great product and you should try this one .
 I have wave in my hair and this product takes it right out ! It not only straightens my hair but it also makes it shinier and takes 99 % of the friz away . The comb on the side really helps with straightening the hair so if you are in the market for a flat iron , I would definitly pick this one , or one with a comb attatched . I would n't suggest this product for someone with a lot of wave or curl because like someone else said , it does n't get REAL hot unless it 's on for a good while .
 THIS IS A OK PRODUCT . BUT IT COULD BE BETTER ! I BROUGHT THIS ITEM AT WALMART FOR 13 DOLLARS BECAUSE I NEEDED A BIG STRAIGHTNER FOR MY HAIR . ALL MY OTHER ONES WERE TO SMALL SO I BOUGHT THIS ONE . IT 'S OK BUT IT DOES N'T REALLY MAKE YOUR HAIR FEEL FLAT ALL THE WAY . I REALLY BOUGHT IT BECAUSE MY HAIR SWEATS ALOT , AND JUS INCASE WHEN I GET MY HAIR DONE I COULD MAKE IT FLAT WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS . BUT I GOT MY HAIR DONE AND USED IT AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS AND IT WAS NOT ALL RIGHT . I WAS MAD !!! I WAS GOING TO GET THE OTHER LARGE STRAIGHTNER BY CONAIR BUT THEY HAD SOLD OUT SO I SEEN THAT 1 AND GRAB IT B4 IT SOLD OUT COMPLETELY . DONT GET THIS PRODUCT SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET ANOTHER CONAIR STRAIGHTNER !!!!! BECAUSE NOW I HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER 1 AND WAIST TIME.MONEY.AND MORE SPACE AND I ALREADY HAVE 3 PRODUCTS-2 STRAIGHTNERS THAT ARE LITTLE AND A CURLING IRON THEY WORK EXCELLENT BUT JUS NEEDED A BIGGER 1 .
 Forget the brand name stuff . The No-Ad sunblock lotion works the best . Apply it 20 mins before going in the water and it will not wash off . Excellent protection against the sun , and does not have a greasy feel to it .
 this product was shipped on time and arrived without any problems . I love this sunblock because it protects from all of the damaging sunlight . It is not greasy and soaks in after a few minutes .
 I purchased this product for my 10-year-old daughter last year . She has enjoyed using it off and on since then , and is able to load and use the twisting tool by herself . She and her friends like to use this tool to do each other 's hair . I am NOT a mechanical person , yet I found the instructions easy to understand and the tool very easy to use . Kids as young as 8 could manage it . My daughter has very long hair and it has never become stuck or tangled in her hair . The only difficult part is getting the string OUT of your hair . It takes patience because it needs to be unwound all the way up . We would definitely recommend this product , and in fact , my daughter has given it as a gift at a couple of birthday parties since she likes hers so much .
 my friend brought this to a sleepover once and it was AWESOME ! we had loads of fun hair wrapping each other 's hair and my hair wrap lasted for 3 days ! They also look really pretty and are a nice colorful accessory . Perfect for any occasion . The thread is re-usable so you can make an unlimited amount of wraps ! They are very easy and quick to make . But i do not own this product -LRB- though i want to !! -RRB- and so I do n't really know how durable it is , but I 'm sure it 's quite durable . This product used to be much more expensive earlier but now it is at a very reasonable price . definetely buyable !!
 I had seen this advertised on tv , and thought it was just another gimmick to get kids ' attention . Well , my daughter , who just turned 11 , thought that it looked `` awesome '' . So , we purchased it for her birthday . Boy , did we score big . We are having so much fun with it . We do her hair now at least twice a week . All of her girlfreinds ca n't wait to come over and try it . It does take some getting used to . If you want the hair strand completely covered with the colorful string , you really have to move slow , but not too slow as it will be bumpy . Other than a steady hand , you do n't need anything else -LRB- except a pair of scissors -RRB- . It is a simple product , but for me , it turns into a little more Mother-Daughter time , which I cherish so much .
 Last year I received this item as a gift . I have had a few of these wraps professionally done . They costed about twenty dollars each . This holds the wraps tight as long as you get a good knot at the bottom . It takes a lot of practice to get them to come out evenly . Definetly a fun product . You can buy some colored thread and use it match your outfit !! Totally cute !!
 I bought this product for my daughter and after putting it all together it was so simple to use . We have had the best time wrapping her hair . She is only 12 and has no trouble using it . We highly recommend this product .
 I bought this item for my daughter 's 9th birthday . She loved it ! We used it at her party to wrap her friends ' hair . It is very easy and quick -- the best part is that you can use regular embroidery floss -LRB- like DMC for cross-stitching -RRB- to refill the spools . It was the hit of the party and many little girls wanted one . Good buy for only $ 13 .
 The Conair Quick Wrap is a great Hair tool ! I wraps very easily ! I also think that the beads are really cool and that the colors of string are neat ! I have a suggestion after you wrap some of your hair then you can take a pen or pencil and wrap the just wrapped hair around that and then take the pencil out and you have spiral hair wrap ! GET THIS ITEM !
 This Item was given to my daughter for her birthday ... I love it . We ended up doing every female in my family with it . I used to do hair wraps professionally and this is very easy to use . You can do some damage with it if you are not careful though , pulling out hair and such . However with some adult supervision and a little bit of determination you can have really good results with a minimum of effort and it does n't cost an arm and a leg to do more than one person which I like . And it was well worth the 20 or so dollars my M-I-L paid for it . I just wish I could find replacement parts .
 I bought the Conair Quick Wrap to use at my daughter 's birthday party . It was a big hit ! There was more than enough colorful string to make hair wraps for all 16 girls , and it was very easy to use . An incredible bargain for $ 8.99 !
 Each time we go to Disneyworld my daughter wants to get her hair braided but we do n't do it because she has long hair and it would be quite expensive . She was thrilled when the Quick Wrap arrived in the mail . The instructions say it takes two people but she has been doing it by herself -LRB- she is 9 -RRB- . She loves it . I 'm thinking of buying a few to keep on hand for birthday party gifts . I do wish that it came with some empty spools so we could have more colors available at a time .
 my daughters -LRB- ages 10 & 7 -RRB- love this , especially the red . be sure to hold tightly to the end of the hair strand when applying the color or hair will get caught in the machine - not pleasant . works as advertised and a good amount of color provided .
 I love this product . It works great ! After you get it set up it is really easy to use . Make sure you tie a tight double knot at the end of the string or it might unravel . * It takes a long time to take the string out of your hair .
 Got this for my daughter 's 8th birthday based on the rave reviews here . I was a bit skeptical but everyone is right -- it works great and is so easy . It will take you one or 2 tries to get a nice even flow of wrapping on the hair but even if it gets bunched up a little , it still looks good -- hence , even the kids can do it themselves on their friends . My daughter has shorter , very fine hair and it even works on her . And the wraps stay in tact for at least a few days . I got a good deal on them and bought about 5 to give to her friends as birthday presents.Conair was in the doghouse with me because I also bought the temporary color accents applicator for her and that was a complete rip-off , big disappointment -- did n't work AT ALL . But then we opened this and ... Conair 's back on our good side again ! Definitely get it if you have a little girl into these sorts of things . My 11 year old had little interest in it -- she 's past it but I think you have to gauge your own child 's interest . The maximum limit is probably 12-13 years old . Certainly , however , my 8 year old friends were swarming it !
 I like using this shampoo after I 've been in a pool with clorine or when I 've used hairspray or other gel products on my hair . This really seems to do the job of cleaning my hair and leaving it soft and manageable.I used to spend a fortune on salon brand shampoos and conditioners , thinking they were much better for my hair than the `` grocery store '' brands . Then when traveling and not being able to find my shampoo in an `` under 4 oz . '' size that I could carry on the plane I decided to wait until I reached my destination to buy some . I bought this one because I was traveling in a smoggy area and could almost feel the smog in my hair , but also because it was cheap and I would n't feel bad about leaving a good portion of it behind at the end of the trip . -LRB- I gave the remaining shampoo to the person at the hotel front desk -RRB- . I was so surprised to find that this shampoo left my fine , flyaway hair just as clean and soft as as the more expensive brands . I could n't tell the difference between this shampoo and my much more expensive salon brand ! Still , I thought maybe it was just the difference in water or the weather at the place I was staying on the trip . I bought the shampoo again at home when I ran out of my salon brand and found that it performed just as well with the local water , weather , etc. . That was 4 years ago and I have been using Suave shampoos and conditioners ever since . I have n't found a single one that I do n't like and I 've saved a bundle on shampoos and conditioners . Two thumbs up for this product !
 Suave Daily Clarifying shampoo is great for removing build up . I use it weekly because my dandruff shampoo builds up after a while ; my friend uses it daily because the many styling products she uses leave her hair looking dull.The bottle says for `` normal to oily '' hair , but my hair is dry and I 've never had an issue with it drying out my scalp.This has to be the best bargain shampoo in the world . If I did n't suffer from dandruff I would use it only a daily basis .
 This is the same clarifying shampoo that my drugstore no longer carries . The sellers sent it promptly and made the experience hassle free . The seller was called Odzo or something like that . Glad you had it.They no longer carry Pantene clarifying shampoo either . I think the Suave is a little easier on the scalp .
 Wash my short hair with this , build up a nice lather , rapidly rinse in the shower , style with pomade while wet and I 'm good to go ! Shampoo is unscented , or close to it , though not necessarily hypoallergenic .
 Suave is good value for a quality product . When I use the strawberry shampoo together with Suave strawberry conditioner , my hair smells luscious , and people tell me so . I try other brands every now and then , but I always go back to Suave .
 My daughters use this and the conditioner to match . They are 5 & 6 years old . They love the strawberry smell ! I love that it gets their hair squeaky clean ! The bathroom always smells great when they are done too ~ like fresh mountain strawberries!This product is very inexpensive and works like a charm !
 About the time my son turned four Johnson 's baby shampoo - a household staple - began to fail us . It was n't getting his and his older sister 's hair clean and so I set about to find a replacement . Suave 's Strawberry shampoo was it.This shampoo gets their hair clean and leaves it smelling nice . In addition it works fine as a body wash , which means that I can clean the entirety of their sweaty , mud splattered little bodies with one product . After using it for over a year , I can say that I 've found no downside . It does n't dry out their skin or hair , and it 's affordable.Four Stars . Very Good Shampoo . Smells nice and cleans well . We use it as a body wash and it does n't dry out or irritate my children 's sensitive skin.Pam T ~
 Suave shampoo is one of those products that I 've used for most of my life . I 've tried more expensive shampoo over the years but keep coming back to Suave simply because it works very well and it costs very little . Usually I 'm a huge proponent of the ` you get what you pay for ' way of thinking . However , there are exceptions that prove the rule , and this is one of them ! I usually switch the variety each time I buy more just to keep things interesting , but aside from that , I 've been pretty much using Suave for 15 + years.That said , I have short , uncomplicated hair that 's only dislike is conditioner -LRB- it makes parts of my hair stand on end for no apparent reason -RRB- . I do n't do much styling aside from a littleFiber Molding Cremeto spike the front a little bit , so my shampoo needs are probably not as complicated as someone with long , curly hair . For a guy -LRB- or woman with short hair -RRB- this stuff is perfect and does exactly what I need it to
 I bought this for my 7 year old who has super thick hair . We 've tried all the kids shampoos and none of them got her hair squeaky clean . I wanted to get something that would get her hair super clean . She wanted something that smelled like the other girls . The smell is way better than kids shampoos . It 's strawberry without being super fruity or overly sweet smelling . Well , this did it !! Her hair is clean , soft , silky , & does n't smell like mommy 's . This is a product we 'll definitely buy again .
 I finally found the perfect shampoo for my hair . I currently do not have dyed hair , but in the past I 've had to use special shampoos to maintain the hue of the dye . I just bought whatever my stylist recommended and never had to really pick the right shampoo for myself . Now that I 'm back to my natural color , I 've tried so many shampoos that made my hair just feel lifeless . Even the `` top-of-the-line '' brands still left my hair feeling oily and did n't give it much volume at all.With Suave in my ideal scent , I actually enjoy washing my hair . The shampoo does n't go on with a slimy feeling -- it 's easy to wash my hair now . I do n't even have to blow-dry my hair or brush it for it to look good . As a bonus , the Strawberry smell lingers for hours afterwards . I no longer have to use Herbal Essences -LRB- which I did n't like ! -RRB- to have my hair smell nice.I love this shampoo !
 I love this stuff , but you really ca n't experiment with the proportions ... use a half dollar for long -LRB- below shoulder length -RRB- , and proportionally less for shorter lengths . You can repeat if you were super oily , but use half your starting amount so you do n't strip your hair . Use the companion conditioner , but if your hair tends towards dryness , do n't rinse it out . Trust me ... it really works wonders .
 The Awapuhi Suave Shampoo is a great product . I have long , dark auburn hair , and this shampoo gave my hair a nice , clean shine . Sometimes I have to blow dry my hair and it can feel brittle afterwards . With this shampoo , it stayed soft . I will definitely put this on my shopping list in the future . The top is easy to unscrew , though , so those with curious toddlers would probably need to put the bottle out of reach .
 I have tried several different Suave products and have always been satisfied with their price and product . I have used Paul Mitchell 's product and see no difference between theirs and Suave 's . It left my hair feeling soft and silky and did not weigh my hair down . It had a slightly aromatic fragrance that was n't overpowering like some shampoos . For the difference in price , I would definitely say to go with Suave . I would also recommend it to my friends .
 This shampoo made my hair feel like silk . It was a very noticeable difference . I needed to use only a small amount of shampoo . I have shoulder length , fine , oily hair . The shampoo does n't decrease any oiliness in my hair , but most other shampoos do n't either -LRB- even expensive ones -RRB- . I have used many Suave products and would definitely recommend this one . It 's a great product at a good price . Try it and see how fabulous your hair feels .
 I do n't splurge much on shampoo , so it 's very nice to find an economical alternative to the expensive shampoos . This shampoo smells great ... just like the expensive brands ! My hair felt clean and was very shiny . I really like this shampoo .
 I really liked this product . It left my hair squeaky-clean and gave it a nice shine . My husband , who swims daily and has chlorine damaged hair , found it great for re-hydrating his dry hair . I have used the Paul Mitchell Awapuhi shampoo and find this product to be just as good , and its price in my opinion makes it even better !
 This Suave shampoo had kind of an odd scent -- sort of medicinal but with an underlying scent of ginger . After shampooing , I was n't sure my hair would look really clean , even though I washed it twice . I really liked the final effect , however . My hair looked very clean and full . I have fine , oily hair which is a difficult combination , since I have to wash it daily . I would recommend this product to anyone with fine hair .
 My 5 year old daughter 's very long blond hair was very green from daily swimming . The last 3-4 inches of her hair had become very dry , straw-like , and felt rough and sticky . The whole lengh of her hair had become brassy . Last year we had to cut 6 inches off her hair after swim season ended , because nothing would remove the green . This year we found the Agree shampoo . I used the shampoo as directed , and saw immediate improvement , but still pretty green . I washed her hair a second time , both times leaving the product in for 5 minutes as directed , and was amazed at the improvement . While wet , her hair seems a tiny bit green on the ends , but when dry , no more green visible , and the whole length of her hair is back to light yellow blond again ! We did use conditioner after , but always do anyway due to the lenght of her hair . The ends are soft again , and do n't look like bristles anymore . We are going to continue using this shampoo throughout the swimming season .
 I like this shampoo a lot and it does a good job at cleaning my hair as well as the whole body after a lap swim session . As long as I use a silicone swim cap I can get away without using a seperate conditioner -LRB- I have long , black , fine , slightly oily straight hair -RRB- . It kept my hair very soft after washing , but if I swim daily in the winter it would still get dried out . After shampooing my hair I would lather it all over my face and body to remove any chlorine smell on my skin . Since most body washes have similar ingredients as shampoos I figured why not , and it worked for me . I have very sensitive skin and can only tolerate few products on the market , but luckily this is the one that I have n't reacted upon after 2 tubes of regular use .
 I loved this product . I never tried a shampoo just for swimmers . We do a lot of swimming . I must confess -- I dye my hair and the bottoms have a green tint to them ! This shampoo helps to get the green out . Yahoo! I would recommend it to people who do a lot of swimming .
 I live in L.A. , and my long , light blonde hair started to develop an unsightly green cast from the tap water , -LRB- too much copper in the water I `` m afraid -RRB- , so I tried a few unsuccessful methods before I happened to stumble upon Agree Swimmer 's Solution in the drugstore . I used it as directed , and really applied a generous amount , leaving it in for 5-6 minutes . When I rinsed it out a bit and caught some of the water in the palm of my hand , the water was dark grey . I could n't believe all the junk that had just gotten washed out of my hair ! As soon as I got out of the shower I could tell immediately that my hair looked blonde and buttery-light again . It was awesome . Now I keep the green/dark brassiness out by using this shampoo every ten days or so . Thanks Agree , for helping end the frustration .
 I liked this product a lot . My three kids go swimming every day in an indoor pool . The level of chlorine is very high . My son is blond and his hair always turns green . Not only did this shampoo take out the green , but it did very well as a conditioner . Even my daughters ' long hair was conditioned well . I will use this product everyday .
 This product worked great in removing the chlorine smell from my kids ' hair after swimming in a public pool . It got rid of the green color as well . Great product .
 This shampoo works great on my kids ' hair -- all three swim at the local YMCA year-round . The chlorine can be very hard on my youngest child 's dry , curly blond hair , but this swimmer 's shampoo left her hair looking great ! The shampoo comes in a unbreakable tube , which is great to tote along to the pool and safe if dropped on the shower floor tile . The only improvement I 'd like to see on this product is a loop or hook to hang the tube with while showering . I 'll buy this one again !
 I really did like this product and it did as it claimed . My hair was soft and easy to manage . I would recommend this to anyone who swims in chlorinated water .
 I use this on my VERY long hair -LRB- touches my hips ! -RRB- . My hair is hassle-free every day . Great , affordable product .
 This 2 in 1 is excellent . I have used Suave products all my life . The products are cheaper than most and smell great . I will continue to use them . I love them .
 Honestamente la razon pq compre este shampoo fue pq no queria gastar mucho dinero ... Pero el resultado que he obtenido es extraordinario . Todas mis amigas me dicen que mi pelo luce mas sedoso que antes.No tengo palabras necesarias para describir este producto.Comprenlo no se arrepentiran .
 I was looking for a good cheap shampoo that smelled good . This one hit the mark . This will be my new go to shampoo from now on ! One note , check local grocery store , mine is cheaper at HEB than it is on Amazon .
 If you like coconut , this is for you . It has a nice scent of coconut . It does lather up really well and gives my thick hair a nice washing . It also rinses out well . I really enjoy using it .
 Love the smell , really , there is nothing spectacular about this , i just needed some large shampoo that had a tropical smell for my travels .
 The advertisement are true . You do n't have to spend a lot on a shampoo for your hair to look good . This is affordable . This smells amazing . My hair looks healthy and shiny .
 I started using Palmer 's lotion in the early 90 's , and I ca n't imagine using anything else . Palmer 's is thick and rich and has a subtle , natural , and delicious scent that reminds me of Vanilla Wafers . I keep a tube in my purse , and have a bottle at work and at home . I ca n't recommend it highly enough .
 The product is outstanding , have been using it through my pregnancy , I am 38 wks now and had made my skin very soft and toned , I am using it mostly on my hands and feet , for belly I love the 13.2 jar . I have to agree with other customers regarding strech marks , they are genetic.There is no such cream or herb or product that will make them go away or stop them from appearing.I am an RN and work with ante / post partum patients and some moms have tried everything , still have stretch marks and some do n't put anything on their skin and have no stretch marks.So you are either destined to get them or not get them .
 I love the smell and it leaves my skin very soft and smooth . I still have n't seen any changes in my stretch marks but it 's too soon to tell . However I do know a fair amount of people that have improved the look of their stretch marks with this lotion .
 This is a very nice product and it makes your skin really soft . I would recommend it to somebody else .
 This is a thick and creamy lotion . It goes on very smooth and feels nice . I hear cocoa butter is supposedly good for reducing scars and stretch marks but I 've only been using it for several days so we shall see . As I mentioned this stuff is thick , creamy , and would be great in the winter . For the warmer months this may be a little too rich but I 'm going to use it regardless . It absorbs fairly well but I do need to put in a little more effort in rubbing it into my skin . It does leave my skin slightly oily immediately after applying but it 's not too noticeable . It has a sweet , chocolate smell to it which I personally like , however , I would n't be comfortable going out after putting this on . The scent is moderately strong and lingers for awhile . I usually use it at night after I take my shower . It leaves my skin moisturized , smelling good , and looking good . I would recommend this product .
 I saw an advertisement for Palmer 's Cocoa Butter lotion in Teen Vogue and decided to give it a try . My hands are constantly dry so I 'm always looking for deep moisturizing lotion . I am very satisfied with this product ! You do n't have to use very much of the lotion because it spreads very well . It rubs all the way in without feeling greasy . And the best part is that it smells like CHOCOLATE ! It leaves skin baby soft . This lotion claims that it can even skintone and diminish blemishes , but I can not attest to those claims because I have mostly been using this lotion on my hands . All in all , I would recommend this product !
 I have always had problems with dry skin , and I now work a job where my hands get dirty and wet frequently throughout the day . It can be agony . Palmers is , hands-down the best thing ever . Putting it on is instantly relieving . It absorbs quickly , is never sticky , smells great and is like no other lotion I 've ever tried , regardless of price .
 This lotion is absorbed quickly into the skin , has just a subtle smell of cocoa , and makes your skin feel smooth and moisturized . I ca n't comment on the longterm effects yet , but I am optimistic that I 'll see some permanent change in the future .
 This cream is wonderful , and helped with some visible stretch marks on my thighs . I usually use right after I shower , and the smell is chocolatey and smells so good . I also apply at night to my face , and my face is is so soft in the morning ! Totally recommend this product .
 This is GREAT for dry skin , I like the smell , I 'm super soft and I THINK my stretchmarks are disappearing a bit . My reason for no 5th star is it 's NOT non-comedogenic and I occasionally break out from it . Good for winter months , though .
 I have been using Palmers Cocoa Butter for over 20 years . It was first recommended to me by a doctor after I was left with some ugly scars from an accident . After using it consistently for a few weeks the scars completely faded.I continue to use this product for overall body moisterizing . It helps heal scabs and prevents scarring or dark spots left over from breakouts , cuts or scrapes . I use it on the bikini area and legs after shaving to prevent razor burn . And it 's great after a day in the sun to soothe a sunburn and stop peeling . It has a pleasant , light cocoa scent.This product is great and I do n't know what I would do without it !
 Great lotion and perfect for my dry yet sensitive skin . Does n't leave me feeling greasy and sticky like other lotions . I apply it at night and wake up with butter soft skin . Also great for maintaining a tan . Downfall is the scent . . at first I was put off by it and could n't place what it smelled like . After some continual using and sniffing , the scent grew on me and I discovered it smells just like hot chocolate ! Not a bad scent but not something I want to smell like everyday . So , I usually wear it at night before bed . It states it will diminish stretch marks , but unfortunately , I have n't seen those results yet ! All in all a great lotion that has been around for years !
 I first tried Palmers a few years ago when I had some scars I wanted to fade . Until then I had just sort of ignored it because of the ugly packaging . Boy what a fool I had been ! This stuff is the best!It smells lovely - very soft vanilla/honey/chocolate . I 've even gotten compliments on how good I smell . It makes your skin feel so soft & supple - and over time it actually does fade unsightly marks . You know , old mosquito bites that wo n't fade , acne marks , that sort of thing . I have sensitive skin and it does not irritate it - in fact , I put it on my zits sometimes to prevent excess dryness . Moreover , it 's reasonably priced and a little goes a long way.I have used other cocoa-butter products and none of them hold a candle to Palmers . I even tried the generic/target brand version of this product and hated it . Do not be fooled by the ugly packaging , Palmers rules ! I even got my mom to try it and her first reaction was `` Wow ! ''
 Two of my children have terrible eczema and I suffer from it as well , this cream is truly wonderful for us . It helps moisturize and soaks into our skin right away . It hardly stings like other creams and we 've tried just about everything . Every cream we 've tried has caused different degrees of sting including ones from our dermatologist ; however , this one is the only one that my children complain the least about . They are still small and I feel terrible when it hurts them . We 've tried ointments such as Aquaphor but we are allergic to an ingredient in Aquaphor and decided to go back to Palmer 's . I even put this on my smallest child who is blessed with no eczema and he loves the smell . The only warning I do have is that if you have an open cut it does sting a little but for us it quickly goes away and I have yet to find any product that works for stretch marks including this one .
 I 've been using the Palmer brand of Cocoa Butter for years and love it as my daily moisturizer . I 've occasionally tried other brands , but nothing works as well as Palmers . It smells wonderful , is incredibly rich , and it absorbs into my skin quickly . I 've tried lots of other drugstore brands -LRB- and a few pricier brands as well -RRB- and Palmers continues to be my favorite choice .
 This Cocoa Butter is really great for the skin . I use it on stretch marks and on my neck and chest , it tightens and tones the skin and also moisturizes . Also what I really love is that it is NOT greasy at all . It also has a slight wonderful chocolate scent !
 This lotion is a classic and is always a great choice . I LOVE Palmer 's lotion , especially on the dry , brutal winters .
 I love the smell and feel of cocoa butter products . This was a great price for stocking up on something I 'll be putting to good use : - -RRB-
 This stuff smells so good . I bought it to see if it would get rid of some scars i have and its working really well . i 've been using it for about a month and a lot of them are fading . i 've been using it with the palmers cocoa butter skin therapy oil and its working wonders . its also very moisturizing and is a great base for body sprays : -RRB-
 First off , I am second to no one in my love of Palmer 's Cocoa Butter Formula . That wonderful slightly chocolate scent sends me into orbit every time I apply the lotion to my hands . The thickness and richness of the lotion , even the color -- I love everything about it.But the design of the 13.5-oz . pump dispenser bottle is the pits . I 've read a few reviews here on Amazon where people complain that they ca n't get lotion out of the darn bottle . Folks , there is a SECRET to getting the lotion out and I 'm going to share it with you , but I 'd like to pause a moment to ask the folks at Palmer 's why they have n't printed instructions for the pump dispenser ON THE FLIPPING BOTTLE.The secret to dispensing the incredibly rich , fragrant Palmer 's Cocoa Butter Formula is that you have to rotate the pump in a clockwise manner every time you want to dispense some of the lotion . This is an irritating design and it means that I have to pick up the flipping bottle every time I want to pump some into my hands , I ca n't just sit the bottle on my bedside table in one position to dispense the product . There is a little circular arrow graphic at the top of the pump which I believe the folks at Palmer 's believe are adequate `` instructions '' for how to use the pump dispenser , but the complaints here in the Amazon.com review section testify to its inadequacy.Bottom line
 I found this stuff on the bottom shelf at Target , beneath all of the more famous brands ... and I 'm so glad I took the risk and bought it . I use it everywhere , including on my face , which is incredible to me since I 've always had sensitive skin . When I hit 40 I came down with rosacea , and Palmers cocoa butter has seemed to `` cure '' it . My dry skin glows now , and people comment on how young I look at 43 . I will never ever buy any other lotion . Why on earth would I ?
 No , it does n't taste like chocolate . . -LRB- do n't ask me how i know this -RRB- . . But it has a nice cocoa smell.This is my new favorite lotion , and i can even use it on my face without irritation or breakout . Feels great after a shower or after being in the sun . Makes my skin very soft but not greasy.Finally , a way to enjoy chocolate that does n't make my butt big !
 I purchased this last year ; I actually purchased the one that is a stick . I loved it so much that I decided to buy the cream . I 'm not much into creams really , but this one is so AMAZING !!! I put it all over my body and makes skin feel very smooth and nice . Blemishes were gone as well as scars . And on me , it also prevented future breakouts . I do n't mind the stretch marks , and yes , it says those will fade also . Like someone else reviewed , I have n't seen that part yet , but again I do n't mind the stretch marks . I 'm really concerned about my blemishes and the scars those leave on my skin . Within just some days on some , on some weeks on older ones , the scars faded . The product has a nice sweet smell , but I do n't want to smell like candy either . I usually use it at bedtime after I exfoliate , and then , in the morning , skin looks amazing !! I totally love it !! Here 's a hint
 The lotion is great . I 've been using it for my stretch marks that developed during my pregnancy . It 's non - greasy and seems to be doing the trick . The stretch marks have n't faded yet since I 've only been using it for several weeks . However , I HATE the smell . The cocoa-flavor smell is very very strong and I just do n't like sweet smells on body lotions . If you can stand the smell , I say go for it .
 I 've been using Palmer 's for years , and I do n't think I would be very happy if they ever changed the formula . I 'm not kidding here -- I 've purchased expensive lotions from Sephora and been gifted fancy `` body butters '' before but Palmer 's is the least greasy and most moisturizing . When winter makes my skin incredibly dry , I take a bath and slather on the cocoa butter oil before rinsing , drying and applying a little extra lotion on my elbows , knees , feet , etc. . Become a fan of Palmer 's . You will NEVER be sorry .
 This lotion has this wonderful and very soft cocoa smell . It heals and soothes super dry skin the first time you use it . It is not oily or sticky , and it dries right away . I highly recommend it !!!!!!
 Is it bad that I 'm a guy that is using this product ? From the description it seems like this product was made primarily for women . Well guess what , I LOVE THIS LOTION !!! This is the best I 've ever used . Does this mean that women get all the good stuff ? lol . Well , I love the stuff and it is the best I have used . The fact that it smells like my favorite sweet -LRB- chocolate -RRB- does n't hurt either . I highly recommend this for ANYONE . Male , female , young , or old .
 This is a great lotion . So far , it has seemed to help me with my stretch marks that are rapidly forming across my pregnant tummy . Some people report having no luck with this , but I have seen success . Every time I see stretch marks , I use this for a day or two and the stretch marks seem to disappear . While some may love its very strong chocolate scent , I found it a little too much sometimes and was wishing I would have gotten a scent-free one -LRB- and I never think like that -RRB- . Also , this lotion appears to be packed with vitamins which is great , but I also found it slightly greasy which may or may not be good under clothing . Luckily , it did n't stain any of my clothes , so perhaps it was just feeling greasy . Regardless , it 's a great product and I 'm glad I bought it .
 i love this stuff ! it works really well to fade my stretch marks , i noticed a difference really fast . even though i noticed a difference , it was small , so it does take some time to work on your stretch marks . i would say the only downsides are the price and the smell . i cant stand the smell but i want a beautiful tummy : -RRB-
 I understand this stuff is really with a mind to scarred and problem skin , it has heaps of Vitamin E which is good for helping scar tissue to heal . It smells so completely delicious it could fool you into tasting it ! Excellent moisturisier and long lasting effects . Great as an aftersun !
 I 've been using this product for a few moths and I really like it . I use it primary for hands , is good because it lasts a long time and maintain your skin soft and healthy .
 I found this out at a Target store as a tester . My skin felt so smooth after I applied and rubbed it on my rough elbows . But what I really loved about this is the smell . Btw , I forgot to mention that I 'm a chocoholic . Smoothes and moisturizes my skin and the scent is to die for . I 'm in cocoa heaven .
 This product is definitely a good moisturizer and helps to treat even eczema . I have used it earlier and highly recommend it
 I had a terrible reaction to A&D Ointment after using it on my tattoo . I had 40 or more dark spots all around my tattoo they made my leg look horrible . I started using Palmer 's Cocoa Butter and after 2 months every single dark spot is gone !! I my skin is so smooth and feels great ! I love the scent as I love everything coconut !! This is the only lotion I will use from now on , I get tons of compliments on how great my skin looks , and now I can wear dresses and shorts tos how off my tattoo , without worrying about dark spots . Best product on the market !!
 Been getting DARK for an upcoming cruise at the tanning and salon and use Palmers Cocoa Butter w / VIT E as an after tan moisturizer . It works very well . Seems like it really penetrates deep to lock in moisture . The smell is also very delicious ... like another reviewer stated ... it really does smell like Vanilla Wafers .
 I love this lotion . My hands were extremely dry , and it took care of it after one use . It seems a little thick , but absorbs in less than a minute and keeps hands soft for hours . Just a hint of fragrance , nothing overpowering . Works better than anything else I have used .
 Palmers Cocoa Butter . . I 've been using it since six years now , it was perfect for preventing stretch marks during my pregnancy and reducing old ones , you only have to know where to apply it , I love it . .
 I have been using Palmer 's Cocoa Butter in just about every form from oils to the solid for almost 10 years . I love it , especially after I had my children . I will just say it has worked wonders for my self image .
 I have used many . . hand lotions . . this one suprised me . . it been around so long ... It doesnt leave you hands greasy . .
 My wife loved it and would like to buy more if we have a chance to go to USA again .
 This cream was recommended to me by a dermatologist . I liked it because it was thick and creamy and kept my skin soft . It is a bit pricey , so I wo n't be buying again .
 I am a religious palmers user . I lotion immediately after a shower and in the morning , I even put this on my face . . i have skin that is super oily in the T-zone and dry else where but the lotion evens out everything . I also use it a lot after i go tanning , and my tan takes months to fade . This product is also extremely cheaper on amazon than at your local drug store .
 I bought this to try to prevent stretch marks during my pregnancy and it worked for me . I am 6 months Post baby now and feel great about the fact that I got this and used it on a daily basis . It smells so good and makes your skin really soft . Great product . I will get it again whenever I need it .
 I love this product ! My skin is not only becoming even -LRB- all-over -RRB- , but it is soft ; and I have noticed that the skin around my ankles is looking much smoother . It 's like the aging process is being reversed . How great it that -LRB- ! -RRB- ?
 Loved this purchase and loved the product it smells great makes your skin feel super smooth and helps remove any marks its worth every penny you get more than what you paid for
 I wanted smoother skin and this is wonderful . What I found is when I go back to some of the products I re-discovered on Amazon that my mother used , I 've received great effect . Such is this product . Will order again however , a little works .
 My wife has been using this pump version in this pregnancy & is very happy with the product . We previously had the bottle top version and could n't get through almost 1/4 of the cream which stays due to its thick consistency .
 Finding the pump in Palmer 's is not all that easy . I was so happy to find it here . I LOVE Palmer 's ! I works great all over for me . I have rosacea and it has done wonders for that area on my face . My body skin looks amazing with Palmer 's . Plus , you smell yummy like cocoa .
 This is a great product to enhanse and define curls . It 's work perfectly with very curly hair without any stifness . The only reason i do n't give it five stars is because if you have long hair and want to define your curls but hav some volume as well , this mousse as a tendancy to reduce the volume of very long hair . So great for curls , but without volumizing effect . The price too is kind of expensive . This product is cheaper in france
 I 've really enjoyed this product . My hair is soft and full of body . My curls , which can be left stringy and lank with some shampoos , are bouncy and attractive .
 I liked the Finesse Bodifying Shampoo . My hair is fine and thinning . The shampoo gave my hair volume , body , and made it feel thicker . The only thing that could be improved upon is to add a conditioner that would leave the hair shiny . I 'd recommend this product to anyone who has fine or thinning hair .
 The shampoo works well . I have very fine thin hair and need some help adding volume without having to use tons of styling products . My wife has gotten more benefit from the shampoo -LRB- so she says -RRB- . I 'd recommend this product for women , but men just need to use the styling products .
 Finesse is great ! I 'm so happy with this product . Not only does it smell great , but it added body to my fine hair . It rinses out thoroughly , without leaving any residue , so your hair does n't feel greasy or weighed down . I would recommend this product for fine hair .
 This is a great shampoo . It smells REALLY good and it made my fine hair seem to have more substance . I was skeptical that it would be any different than any other shampoo I 've tried , but I was pleasantly surprised .
 I love this product . It has a great scent that lingers and leaves your hair shiny and full of bounce . The reason I did n't give it a perfect score is that I prefer a shampoo and conditioner in one . It saves me time . But all in all , I 'd highly recommend this product !
 Suave shampoo is one of those products that I 've used for most of my life . I 've tried more expensive shampoo over the years but keep coming back to Suave simply because it works very well and it costs very little . Usually I 'm a huge proponent of the ` you get what you pay for ' way of thinking . However , there are exceptions that prove the rule , and this is one of them!That said , I have short , uncomplicated hair that 's only dislike is conditioner -LRB- it makes parts of my hair stand on end for no apparent reason -RRB- . I do n't do much styling aside from a littleFiber Molding Cremeto spike the front a little bit , so my shampoo needs are probably not as complicated as someone with long , curly hair . For a guy -LRB- or woman with short hair -RRB- this stuff is perfect and does exactly what I need it to
 I have very long , thin , straight -LRB- and oily ! -RRB- hair and I use this as a secondary shampoo toHead & Shoulders Dandruff Shampoo , Citrus Breeze , 23.7 fl oz -LRB- 700 ml -RRB- -LRB- Pack of 2 -RRB- . I use my other shampoo first on my scalp , and then I use this shampoo on my ends -LRB- and a little on top for good measure -RRB- . I like it because it 's effective , cheap , and it does n't smell girly -- just clean like a waterfall -LRB- corny but true -RRB- . It does n't weigh my hair down , either , which is a must because my thin hair ca n't even handle conditioner . If I had to , I 'd pay a lot more than the dollar I pay at the store , and it lasts for a long time .
 I am an African American woman with palm-rolled locs . I was looking for a good clarifying shampoo ... I work out several days a week and because of the locs I try not to `` overwash '' my hair to avoid unraveling . I normally wash my hair once a week but noticed that my scalp started to become itchy and dry lately . I bought this yesterday -LRB- on sale at the grocery store for 99 cents ! -RRB- and used it last night and it worked great ! My hair was literally squeaky clean . I contemplated getting the Neutrogena clarifying shampoo , but wanted to try this first because the N product indicated that it could only be used once a week and I was afraid it would leave my hair dull and lifeless . Since this is a `` daily '' clarifying shampoo I 'm sure I can use it every other wash or so to remove build up without issue . I strongly recommend this product and you ca n't beat the price !
 I always feel that this gets any residue from my hair that products have left behind . I do n't use it daily , even though it says you can . I have curly hair and use product to tame it , but it gets weighed down . I use this a couple times a week .
 very good quality and affordable price . this product is outstanding and the price is amazing . you will not find a better price or quality in product such as this one anywhere else . I reccommmend to everybody to please purchase all your needs and wants here , you wont go wrong .
 Good : cheap . 85 cents a bottle , god damngreat for oily hairsmell is alrightBad : none , but guys are n't that picky with this stuff .
 This shampoo cleans very well and thoroughly . It really does get the hair gels and oils cleaned off your hair quickly.I think a clarifying shampoo is good to use once a week as it creates a very clean base to use your other shampoos and creme rinse . Usually people use a specific type of shampoo and rinse to create body or moisturize but it is good to get any residues left over from these to start over again.I think I paid $ 1.47 for the bottle , a good size . It had a super saver shipping option so I just bundled it with another item I needed .
 Suave Daily Clarifying Shampoo cleans my oily hair well . I use it every day with only a tiny bit of conditioner on the ends . If you have oily hair try this shampoo - it ca n't be beat for the money .
 Boy was I surprised ! My hair is fine and color treated - it did not strip the color , it clarified the strands leaving a healthy unweighed clean ready to be styled/set , YAY ! What a great find . I will defiantly keep this on hand . Bottle says longer lasting fragrance , but in my opinion I found it to be non-offensive light and pleasant does n't over power or linger , lathers up great -LRB- used a small amt and I have a lot of hair ! -RRB-
 If you use a lot of styling product in your hair , a small amount of this shampoo will cut right through it , and do exactly what it says
 At the beginning of the year I noticed a nasty residue on my hair . Even after 10 minutes of rinsing my hair did not feel clean . My hair air-dried into a dirty-looking , oily texture , especially at the back of my head . I figured that my city 's hard water had finally caught up to my hair and decided that a clarifying treatment was in order . My normal shampoo at this time was Kiehls Sunflower shampoo.First I tried the natural route and used apple cider vinegar . This tingled my scalp but did not make my hair any cleaner.Then I tried white vinegar . Over a period of about a week I doused my hair and scalp , let it sit for a few minutes , and rinsed . This made my hair soft but the dirty appearance remained.Then I tried Bumble and Bumble 's Sunday shampoo . This improved the appearance - my hair did n't look AS greasy - but did not cure it , particularly in the worst patch at the back of my head.Finally I found this shampoo in a drugstore for under $ 3 . It worked beautifully . My hair is normal again . I am so glad the bottle is huge , since I 'll probably be using this stuff exclusively from now on . I am so happy !
 My doctor recommended I try this shampoo ... I would say it 's my favorite now , it does n't cost much , it does a good job , it does n't strip my hair -LRB- I have &#34; Einstein &#34; hair when I let it get longer than a few inches -RRB- or dry my scalp . Smells nice , but not &#34; pretty &#34; .
 For the past few years I have been searching for numerous of shampoos that can clean my greasy hair . After lots of trials , I finally discovered a method how to keep my hair clean for 2 days without looking like I dipped my head into deep fryer . For each wash , I alternate between 5-6 different brands and continually add or subtract different products every few months . Suave has proven to effectively clean my hair and leave no residue behind . It even washes out the dry shampoo I use in my hair to keep the grease at bay on days I do n't have time to wash . For the price I paid , only 1.99 , was well worth it and will be keep this as part of the haircare regimen I created .
 I was searching and searching for a shampoo that would n't make my hair flat , dull , and greasy etc. . I was also looking for a shampoo that wouldnt give me breathing attacks because i have very severe asthma and sinus problems . I found this shampoo and , it works great ! . Unlike Wen , Tresseme , Garnier , and Matrix , which made my hair flat , dull , and greasy while also giving me suffocating breathing attacks , Suave Naturals Daily Clarifying made my hair thick , smooth , and shinier than I expected . I have been using this product for 3 months and , it works every time . I have gotten countless compliments on how sleek and healthy my hair looks , and even my best friend -LRB- who uses Wen -RRB- was astonished when I told her `` I use Suave , nothing more '' And , on top of it all , my breathing is now better in the shower -LRB- I literally used to suffocate and wheeze , espically when I used Wen and Garnier -RRB- I would recommend this for everyone . It is certainly worth the price , compared to a $ 60.00 9 ounce bottle of Wen . The good thing about this is that it actually works !! : D
 great ! would order thru them again . item arrived very quickly and without any damage . thanks again for the wonderful service
 i love this shampoo . it takes all the gunk out of my hair , leaving it soft and clean . also , a great value.this is one of my staples on my list , so i buy this regurlarly . a definate great product .
 I have used a loads of brands like Redken , Biolage , John Frieda , Garnier etc. . This shampoo has been the best I have used so far . It really cleans the scalp and hair without any residue . Pair it with any good conditioner and results are fabulous . This is cheapest and yet the best shampoo I have ever used ! Highly recommend .
 Granted , it is the industrial ingredient standard , but What Suave has done for the knockoff is what Armani has done for the couture industry . Suave Daily Clarifying Shampoo -LRB- comes in clear-Blue or clear-White -RRB- washes away the daily grime of product use and can also be used to treat swimmer 's hair in a pinch . For just under $ 2.00 it is a real gem , and if I was n't such a die-hard Aubrey Organics fan , I 'd use it every shampoo ... Like I said , it 's a real keeper -LRB- and great for all hair types -RRB- ! A + / A -
 I am in love with this shampoo !! I ca n't believe it , because so many folks now say that sulfates dry your hair . This shampoo truly does everything it claims to . I have curly frizzy very hard to manage hair . My hair is moisturized , very silky , and clean , and very shiny from using this shampoo . I was reading about treatments to straighten my hair , but now I can have my pretty curls -LRB- which also are n't as tight so I get these pretty thick ringlets , and gorgeous waves ! and silky hair.Another plus is it calmed my hair down so well , and now no more puffy hair . I however braided my hair to help this along after my shower . I also use lots of Shea Moisture products -LRB- condition my hair before I shampoo -RRB- and this might help help too . I use the cherry blossom conditioner by Suave after I shampoo with this . I also try to wash and rinse this out very quickly after washing my hair to cut down on a possible drying effect from the shampoo . The curly girl method never gave me hair this pretty . I 'm so happy I tried this and did n't get scared away from all the hype about sulfates . To be fair I also live in an area with very hard water that a filter ca n't even remedy so this could be why curly girl method did n't work as well for me . Anyway , I feel this formula is brilliant to say the least , and I am truly amazed . I think that having a PH balanced shampoo is the secret and saying yes to sulfates because it cleans so well . If your hair is not coated with product just a little on the scalp and rinsing through the hair works great , because using the right amount may be the secret too .
 For all you guys that hate to use conditioner after you shampoo in the shower , and for those who have tried the 2-in-1 stuff to no avail except to plaster down your hair , this is for you . It cleans gently , but thoroughly , ending those `` flyaways '' with no slickin ' down . The price is right , as well . You ca n't beat $ 1/bottle . I just reordered two more .
 I have been a fan of Edge Advanced Gel Extra Moisturizing shaving cream for years . It has cooling conditioners and vitamin E that hydrates my skin while reducing irritation , giving me a close , smooth shave , and on top of that it smells great -LRB- my wife likes the scent , too -RRB- . It is a tried and true product and a `` must have '' item for me.FYI - It is manufactured and distributed by Eveready Battery Company , Inc. -LRB- owner of the registered trademark Edge -RRB- PRODUCT LABEL DIRECTIONS
 I really liked this shaving gel . It had a nice thick consistency that easily adhered to my beard . My skin was also very smooth after shaving . My wife must have liked it too , because I could n't ever find it -- it was always in her shower !
 I like this product because it does a very good job at moisturizing my face . I also have very sensitive skin and it does a wonderful job of protecting it . I would gladly pay up to $ 2.00 for this product , but no more than that !! Some stores charge outrageous prices for Edge Pro Gel , and I tend to buy another brand .
 Excellent Product !! I 've tried several shaving creams and this has to be one of the BEST ! I would recommend it to anyone wanting a close shave .
 The Edge Pro Gel is the best shaving gel I 've ever used . It goes on great and provides a comfortable shave , protecting me from nicks and cuts . Listen -- shaving 's a chore that reminds me everyday just how imperfect the human body really is . So anything that makes it less of hassle is A-OK in my book . And this is , simply put , the easiest product I 've found .
 I liked the coolness of the product as I applied it to my face . I felt complete as I started to shave , and I did n't experience numerous cuts as I have in the past with other gel shaving products . I 'm recommending this gel to anyone who must shave at least twice a day , because it leaves my skin feeling very smooth .
 I liked the Edge Gel . I only had to use a little bit when shaving . The shaving gel has a nice smell , which my wife loved , and really helps the razor glide smoothly . I liked this product and will buy it in the future .
 Very soothing to the skin , doesnt cause irritation like some others . Also smells good . Cant complain
 Head & Shoulders works wonderful on dandruff . It leaves behind a tingly , clean feeling without drying-out hair or irritating the scalp further . Flaking slows down after just a few uses and eventually stops . The only unpleasant aspect about this shampoo is its scent . It just does n't smell good . I 'd buy this product if it had a pleasanter smell to it -- there are perfumes in it anyway , could n't they just be reformulated ?
 I use Head and Shoulders on a daily basis and I love it . It does n't dry out my scalp at all like some other dandruff products do . It has also prevented my scalp from flaking and itching . I recommend it to anyone experiencing such problems .
 I used this shampoo everyday and I 've been very pleased with it . It lathers really well and my hair is clean and soft . My scalp does n't feel dry , either . I was surprised at how well my hair managed after using Head and Shoulders , because I have n't used a dandruff shampoo in a long time . I 'd say that I would buy this in the future and that I 'd recommend this to my friends .
 Head & Shoulders `` Classic Clean '' dandruff shampoo is very effective at controlling my dandruff but good enough that everyone in my family -LRB- except my daughter -RRB- uses it . I also like the scent is mild and not really noticeable after getting out of the shower.Highly Recommended!CFH
 What more could you ask for ? Shampoo at your doorstep !
 This has to be the best dandruff shampoo on the market . It not only controls flakes very well , but it leaves your hair shiny and soft . I would recommend this for people that do n't have dandruff as well . My wife used it and loved it .
 Every day of my married life since August 1975 , my husband has used Head & Shoulders to control his dandruff . He loves it , uses ONLY it and does n't have a flake anywhere , ever . This product is reasonably priced compared to other dandruff products and it really works . Hubby 's hair is always shiny and soft and DANDRUFF FREE -- what more could you ask for !!
 This shampoo was a big help for my dandruff problem . Just a day or two of use , and the flakes are gone . Head and Shoulders is a brand I trust . I really liked this product , and would recommend it to anyone who wants to get rid of their dandruff .
 It 's been years since I used this product , and I found that it has a very favorable smell . With the dry winter air , I 've had some flakes , but since I started using this product , I can wear my dark clothes again !! This is a product that I would recommend to others . A + product .
 I did n't have dandruff , but I did have an itchy scalp . I decided to try the Head & Shoulders shampoo to see if it would take care of my problem . I wash my hair every day , and use conditioner , but the back of my head still itched . I tried all different types of shampoo , thinking that the perfumes in them were making my head itch . I used the Head & Shoulders shampoo and I must say , it has worked FABULOUSLY !! I no longer have an itchy scalp , and I 'm thrilled beyond imagination .
 Head & Shoulders Dandruff Shampoo is a wonderful product to use . My family and I have been using this product for over a week now , and we found not only did our dandruff vanish , but our hair now has a nice clean shine to it . I would recommend this shampoo to all . It helps if you have dandruff , plus it gives your hair a wonderful shine . This product is an A + .
 I love this shampoo ! My hair has always been on the dry side , and this shampoo adds shine . My hair looks and feels so much better . It 's gentle enough to use everyday ! Head and Shoulders gets a top rating from me on controlling dandruff and dry scalps !
 I would recommend this dandruff shampoo over many others , particularly because of its scent . It smells nice , which is not typical of this type of shampoo . And it really works ! Also , I did n't have to use conditioner with it , because it left my hair untangled .
 I have extremely dry skin and scalp during the winter months , and I found the Head and Shoulders shampoo to be very effective . It allowed me to not have to wash my hair that often and to still be able to control the flaking . As the warmer months come along , I 'm still able to use the product on a daily basis as I would any other product . It controls the flaking and I do n't worry that the daily use will have an adverse effect on my hair .
 This was the first time that I 've used this product and must say I was pleasantly surprised . It has a light , pleasant scent and did n't leave my hair feeling dried out . It controlled flaking better than the other brands I 've tried . I 'd recommend this product to anyone who has a problem with flaking due to dry scalp .
 Head & Shoulders 2-in-1 Dry Scalp Dandruff Shampoo is a good product . It 's effective in the purpose for which it was intended . I was n't especially fond of the particular smell , but what can you expect from dandruff shampoo ? I 'd recommend it to anyone having problems with dry scalp or dandruff .
 I feel that this product is very helpful to those people with dry scalp and to those trying to prevent it . It 's helped me already and I 'd recommend it to everyone considering buying it . I also like the 2-in-1 aspect -- it saves me a lot of time !
 I loved this product . The convenience of having the shampoo plus the conditioner in one helps me save time in the morning . Great smell , too . It also helps control my dandruff problem without drying out my hair . I 'll definitely buy this again !
 I was surprisingly pleased with this product . Most 2 in 1 products either leave your hair under-conditioned or over conditioned . Head & Shoulders 2-in-1 Dry Scalp Dandruff Shampoo Plus Conditioner left my hair feeling perfectly cleaned and conditioned . It lathers up very well and has a nice gentle scent , not a perfumed scent . A little goes a long way and I believe that makes this product a very good value as well .
 I was surprised on how quickly it worked ! The next day all the flaking was gone . There was no odd smell and it worked terrific . The only thing I had a problem with was that it said it was shampoo and conditioner in one . I found that there was n't enough conditioner to work effectively and I had to use my old conditioner . Other than that , it worked like a charm !
 My husband and I both tried out the Head & Shoulders Dry Scalp 2 in 1 . His hair is very thick and wavy , mine is baby fine and bone straight . He absolutely loved this shampoo . He raved after every shower that his hair smelled great , had body , felt clean and did n't need a separate conditioner . On the other hand , it did n't work so well for mine . No 2 in 1 ever has . Like I mentioned , my hair is very fine . I agree that it smelled great and my hair was clean , but it was just too much conditioner for me . After it was dry , my hair was flat and fly-away from being so soft . Which I suppose , in most cases , is a good thing , considering how other 2 in 1 shampoos are usually lacking in conditioner . Perhaps , if there were different formulas for different hair types that would make a difference . -LRB- There may very well be , though I am not certain . -RRB- The price is reasonable , and the bottle size is quite large , and it does what it says it does . All in all it 's a good product for the money .
 I like the shampoo very much since I have dandruff . It works great .
 Having fine , color-treated hair -LRB- but also dry scalp in the winter -RRB- I would never have dreamed of using a dandruff shampoo because I thought it would be too harsh . However , after using Head & Shoulders Dry Scalp 2 in 1 Shampoo for the first time , I was sold ! I could n't believe how manageable and full my hair was . It also really conditioned my scalp . I could actually feel the difference . I 've been using it every day for about a week and it 's still working as well now as it did the very first day . I am so glad that I chose this particular product to Test Drive , and I will definitely go out and buy some when this bottle is gone .
 This shampoo/conditioner in one was excellent . Its scent was nice but not overpowering , and I appreciated that it looked natural -LRB- unlike the blue dandruff shampoo that looked so medicated ! -RRB- . It had a nice lather and though I only used it twice a week , I saw no signs of dandruff . It also did n't dry out my hair or take away its shine . I highly recommend it .
 My scalp rebelled against the Chicago winter
 I really got great benefits from using this shampoo ! It 's a wonderful product and it got rid of my ugly and embarrassing dandruff . I really would recommend this product to anyone with dandruff . It 's not a drying shampoo . It leaves my hair smelling great , very manageable , and quite healthy ! I 'm not a professional hair stylist , but I go around recommending the product on a daily basis ! A great cure for dandruff !
 An excellent product . It does n't make my hair feel oily . And within two days , it controlled my flaking scalp . It does n't smell especially great , but it does n't make my hair smell bad either . It has a thick consistency and gives a nice amount of lather . It also comes in a very large bottle , so it 's a good value .
 Overall , I liked this dandruff shampoo for fine , oily hair . It was good for dandruff prevention . Although , I had to wash my hair more often with this product than I have to with regular Head & Shoulders -- normally , my hair is clean for two days . Also , this shampoo made my hair too soft . I liked the way it made my hair feel , but I did n't like the way my hair acted .
 I love the Head & Shoulders Dandruff Shampoo . The smell is wonderful and lasts longer than other shampoos . I was surprised to find that it helped with my dry scalp and made my hair feel lighter . I would HIGHLY recommend this product to friends and family . Also , I 'd suggest that if you have n't tried it , you should -- because you , too , will be delighted with the outcome .
 This product is GREAT . It had a pleasant smell and was great for controlling dandruff . There was NOTHING I did n't like about this product and I 'd recommend it to anyone who has a dandruff/flaking problem . It was very gentle on my hair and left it clean and refreshing-smelling !!
 This shampoo changes the way I appear life . I have nothing to be ashamed about my hair anymore . It gets big huge flakes that makes your hair grow back faster , it keeps it away for about a week . As far as getting all of the dandruff out well it does n't . It may not be perfect but it 's the best I can fine . I hides this in my dresser from my sister .
 I tried this product a few years ago , and was n't impressed . After receiving the product again , I must say -- they 've made some big improvements ! My hair is very soft and shiny after using Pert Plus , and I have also had my 8-year-old daughter use it as well . Her hair is shoulder length and tends to get tangled easily . After using Pert Plus , I noticed a significant difference in the reduced amount of tangles in her hair . Having shampoo and conditioner built into one shampoo is also a plus . Her hair is very shiny and soft after using it . I would definitely recommend Pert Plus to my family and friends .
 I really liked this shampoo . It has a wonderful fragrance and cleans hair very well . It did n't leave my hair dull or flat . My husband used it and he liked it a lot also . I would recommend this shampoo to my entire family and all my friends , because it 's a very good shampoo .
 I have n't used Pert Plus for years and I do n't know why ! It 's convenient , saves time , comes in a generous 32-oz size , and leaves my hair clean and manageable without the feeling of waxy build-up that I get from other two in one hair products . It has a pleasant scent , not overly strong and appropriate for men or women .
 This is a great shampoo/conditioner in one if that 's what you need . However , I do n't normally use conditioner every time I shampoo . It makes my hair too flat . On the days that I do want to use conditioner , though , it 's much easier to use this one product instead of two . It has a pleasant smell and good lather .
 I usually stay away from shampoos like Pert Plus because my hair needs extra conditioning , but this worked great on my hair . My whole family loved it ! My six-year-old daughter , who also needs conditioner , liked the idea that I did n't have to rinse her hair twice . I would recommend this to anyone . Oh , and it smells great too !
 The Shampoo and Conditioner in one is very convenient and easy to use . Perfect if you are on the run and in rush to get out the door . I wish it did condition alittle bit more , because my hair tends to be fly-away . But for a quick shampoo , this is a great product .
 The Pert Plus performed well . Personally , I need a little more conditioner than this offered , but my ten-year-old son used it and it worked great on his hair . It left his hair clean , shiny , and he only had to use one product . He is very pleased with the product , as was I. I would definitely purchase it again .
 This is the best shampoo I 've ever tried ... and I 've tried a lot of them ! It 's the one I use when I need to be sure my hair will look really good . It leaves my fine , straight hair all fluffy and shiny , silky smooth , and smelling fabulous . Most shampoos smell like flowers or chemicals , which make me sneeze , but this balsam scent is great and I often get compliments on it . Also , I like the fact that Flex is made by Revlon , a company that does n't test its products on animals . Why is n't this shampoo available in stores anymore ? It just does n't make sense . I 'm glad it 's still available online , at least .
 I too am disappointed that I can not find this product in any local stores . I have been using this shampoo since 1990 and as long as I can get it on line I will continue to use it , it ` s the best shampoo I have ever experienced and agree that Revlon should put it back in the stores !
 I love Flex and have used it for years . I am sure that is why my hair is in such good shape and it is to my bra and I am in the ocean almost daily surfing . Guys love the smell .
 I 've been using this for decades , and have tried others . But , as a reasonably priced everyday shampoo , there is none better ! the only problem now is that some mass merchandisers are no longer carrying it . It is easier to get it online . Hair comes out clean and shiney and smells great . What else do you want from a shampoo ?
 Do n't know why but this item can not be purchased in any stores in my community . I think it 's great and I 've been using it for years .
 I , too , am disappointed that you ca n't find this in the stores anymore . I 've used it for years and years and I love the way it smells and works on my hair . Nothing like it . I say we start a campaign or something to get it back in the stores !
 It 's great for my limp fine hair and it smells great !! I have used it for decades and hate I ca n't find in stores anymore . I heard they pulled it off the shelf because when using it , they ca n't detect drug use in the hair . Oh well , it 's a shame because it really is a great product for the hair . Obviously in more ways than one . : - -RRB-
 Have used this product for years and really like the way it is so friendly to my hair . Will continue to use it , as longas I can find it.Satisfied customer.Flex Shampoo , Extra Body 15 fl oz -LRB- 443 ml -RRB-
 I have never had any problems with items mail to me but recently I have had a lot of problems with UPS not leaving my order and sending them to the post office . This has happen twice when we were home . They did not knock , call , leave a note anything . The Fairweather Forge was very helpful and made sure I received my item . Not only did they make sure I got my package I ended up with 2 bottles of flex shampoo , which I love on the same day . After I contacted the store and let them know what happen they were very helpful and I had a quick reply and understanding from them . I greatly appreciate all the effort they showed me.I looked forward to doing business with this seller again.Thank again , Cindy
 This shampoo is really good at preserving hair color and strengthening my hair . I have baby thin hair so I needed something strong yet soft on my texture . I definitely recommend this product !
 My first requirement for lipgloss is sunscreen . A lot of them do n't have any and I would n't buy one without it . Skin cancer of the lips is a real risk , but there 's also some type of damage you can get that is n't cancer but causes the lips to get a rough surface and look unattractive.My second criteria is that the gloss be glossy , but not sticky . This Revlon product passes that test.I do n't like `` glitter '' in my lip glosses . Some of the colors of Revlon gloss have it , but this one does n't . I also like a deep color as opposed to pinks as the deep colors look more natural to me.The only thing I 'd change about this product is for it to last longer . However , it may be that only the stickier glosses last longer . If so , then I 'm happy with the tradeoff.If you have read any of Paula Begoun 's books or subscribe to her newsletter you know that the primary difference between most drugstore cosmetics and department store cosmetics is the packaging , not the quality inside . If you can find a color you like in the Revlon lip gloss line there is no reason to spend more and buy gloss from a department store . The only makeup I buy in a department store is YSL concealer , because I have yet to find a drugstore brand that I like as well .
 I was pleased the order arrived within three days of ordering . I am happy to have found a source for this Lipgloss .
 Pros : Several Color Choices - New Shades every couple of monthsLow to high coverage shadesNice clear window to view shadeGood PriceHigh Shine - -LRB- Similar to MAc Lipglass -RRB- Several MAC shades are duplicated for 1/3 of the price!Not tacky !!! Cons : Horrible perfumey fragranceOut dated packageSome shades do not spread evenlySummary
 I got this lip gloss as a stocking stuffer last Christmas and sort of smiled and put it aside since it 's not really a color I would have picked -LRB- I usually go more for plum and wines -RRB- but somehow it ended up in my bag and quickly became my favorite gloss . The color in the container is kind of deceptive -- on my lips it has a very nice light pink and apricot tint to it . It 's subtle enough to wear with anything and always gives my lips a nice glow .
 Probably my favorite lip gloss ever . Very sparkly . I put it on my daughters ' lips every day and they feel very grown up without having garish makeup on . In fact , I first bought it for them , but now I use it just as often .
 I used to spend a fortune on salon brand shampoos and conditioners , thinking they were much better for my hair than the `` grocery store '' brands . Then when traveling and not being able to find my shampoo in an `` under 4 oz . '' size that I could carry on the plane I decided to wait until I reached my destination to buy some shampoo . I bought this one because I like the name brand that it is comparable to , but also because it was cheap and I would n't feel bad about leaving a good portion of it behind at the end of the trip . -LRB- I gave the remaining shampoo to the person at the hotel front desk -RRB- . I was so surprised to find that this shampoo left my hair just as soft and manageable as the more expensive brand . I could n't tell the difference ! Still , I thought maybe it was just the difference in water or the weather at the place I was staying on the trip . I bought the shampoo again at home when I ran out of my salon brand and found that it performed just as well with the local water , weather , etc. . That was 4 years ago and I have been using Suave shampoos and conditioners ever since . I have n't found a single one that I do n't like and I 've saved a bundle on shampoos and conditioners . Two thumbs up for this product !
 I randomly got this conditioner when I saw it was only a 1.50 on sale . I was throughly surprised the first time I used it . The scent is quite enjoyable and nice . The texture feels wonderful on your hair and leaves my hair feeling soft and definitely not dried out . I would recommend this conditioner to those trying to keep their hair healthy but may be on a budget and want drug store brands .
 this shampoo is one of the best shampoos out there for a great price . also a great selection of products
 I love this shampoo ! Makes my dry hair shiny and more smooth . My 18 yr old daughter loves it , also . Right now I 'm using this shampoo with Pantene Smoothing Conditioner for Dry Hair , which also works well for me . Next , I 'll try Suave Professional Humectant Conditioner , ca n't wait !
 It is ok shampoo , but a great value for the price . I recommend it for people who are on a budget .
 I absolutely would purchase this product again and again . I love this product from Suave . It is my very favorite product that I ever bought for my hair . I love the way that it makes my hair feel and the way that my hair looks after using this product . It is excellent ! A must-have for everybody !
 The shampoo works great . The only dissapointment was that I did n't read the title correctly , so I thought I was getting 3 bottles at the $ 5.99 price . Bummer for me .
 I purchased several bottles of Suave Professionals Humectant Moisture Shampoo when Amazon had it on sale for $ 1.24 . At that price , it was a real bargain . It is a decent shampoo , that did n't dry out or leave my `` normal '' hair greasy . The shampoo is a poor man 's Nexxus or Paul Mitchell formula . Having used both of those over the years , the Suave version is n't as good . If you have dry or damaged hair , you may want to look elsewhere . Also , the current Amazon price is $ 5.99 . There is no way I 'd pay this for a Suave product . If you can get it on sale , and have `` normal '' hair though , I can recommend Suave Professionals Humectant Moisture Shampoo .
 Product arrived earlier than expected , and was in brand new condition like stated . I highly recommend the product and I would most definately buy again .
 I am a guy , I generally do n't bother with conditioner . So I really like how this shampoo leave my hair feeling amazingly smooth and clean . I have a `` fade '' haircut , so the results may be different for people with longer hair .
 I have used Flex Balsam and Protein shampoo for decades and will continue to do so . As a man , I want to smell like wood , leather or spice . Not an assortment of fruit and floral fragrances currently in fashion . This shampoo is gentle on my skin and adds shine to my hair . The fragrance blends without adding a noticeable scent .
 Revlon 's Flex hair care products should NEVER have been discontinued ! My wife and I have tried many shampoos and conditioners , but always came back to these ... for almost 40 years !
 I requested an alert when this `` best for less '' product was once again available , and received a note from Amazon that it was back in stock . Not on my screen .
 The cost is pretty high compared to what it used to sell for on the shelf .
 Hi , I noticed a couple of folks said that Flex Shampoo was not available in their area . I know how frustrating that can be ! I found Flex at Kerr Drug in Raleigh , at Tower Shopping Center . It was only $ 1.99 a bottle!Take care everyone ! : - -RRB- Beth WilsonRaleigh , NC
 I was please to be able to find this product online because it is no longer available in most stores.I have been using Flex shampoo since 1975 and am a very satisfied customer .
 I wish this was still on the market at stores but at least I can find it online . Kind of expensive but worth it !
 I have used this shampoo for 40 years and have found it to be the best for me . BUT ... Flex / P&G no longer makes it and I have not found anything that works as well for me - some stock still exists but at $ 15 a bottle plus shipping it 's very difficult to justify . Wish I could buy a case for a reasonable price - it could last me for as long as I have hair .
 My wife and I have been using this for years and we like it . Has a good smell to it and our hair has good body after using it .
 Revlon 's Flex Shampoo is the best product on the market ! I 've used the expensive shampoos -- the ones that cost $ 15/bottle and they 're not worth it ! They make my fine hair , greasy , oily and nasty!Flex is great for those of you out there , who want great-looking hair , at a reasonable cost!So , throw out the designer shampoos and buy Flex today and say good-bye to bad-looking hair !
 Great product but the shipping is hiway robbery . Will never order this product from this site again until the shipping is more reasonable
 This is the best Mascara that I have ever used ! I use the waterproof version and it makes my lashes Thick , Long , Dark and Gorgeous . I look like a super model in a mascara ad . It does n't straightend out my lashes after curling them like all other mascaras do . Now that I found this mascara , I ca n't live without it .
 This is a good mascara for fast thick and long lashes . It does last pretty well , but if you get it too thick , it will flake a bit . Mabeline XXL Volume + legnth mascara takes a little longer to apply , but you get fabulous lashes and no flakes even if you go to sleep with it on .
 Was looking for this item for years and was so happy to finally find it ! It is great stuff for hair that is very damaged and ca n't get a comb through it ! Nothing out there is like this miracle stuff and I have tried it all !!!!!!!! Could not find it in any stores for a very long time ! St Ives has always made great products !
 I have been looking for this product for years . I used to use it all the time and it is the best for restoring hair to good health . Then I could not find it in the stores or online . So pleased to be able to purchase it again .
 This toner is amazing - works better than any other toner I 've tried and the low price is an added bonus . I would still buy it if it were more expensive -LRB- not that I want that . -RRB- I will not use anything else . It 's even gentle enough for my 8 year old daughter to use .
 This is my favorite toner . Cleans and refreshes . Love it and highly recommend this product .
 I TRYED AT LEAST TWO TONERS BEFORE AND NOTHING COMPARES TO THIS !! IT MAKES YOUR FACE SO REFRESHING AND CALM AFTER YOU WASH YOUR FACE . IT FEELS LIKE COLD WATER WITH SOOTHING ELEMENTS IN . PLUS IT 'S NOT OILY LIKE MOST TONERS AS WELL . AND IT 'S GREAT FOR ACNE PRONE SKIN.AND DRY OR COMBINATION AS WELL . I USE THIS WITH MY OLAY FOAMING FACE WASH FOR SENSITIVE SKIN . THEN MY ZAYPT ZIT GREAT TRIO . BUT I HAVE ACNE PRONE AND THIS CALMS THE ACNE DOWN PERFECT . AND NOT OILY SO YOU DO N'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT YOUR FACE GETTING LIKE A OIL BUCKET . IT 'S ALSO VERY CHEAP THEN LOTS OF TONERS SO DO N'T THINK THE PRICE IS LOW CAUSE THE PRODUCT IS BAD . THE BEST OF THINGS COME IN LOW PRICES AND PACKAGES !! LOL THANKS AGAIN OLAY !!
 A lot of people was telling me that i shouldnt use toners for diffrent reasons but im hard headed so you know I brought one ! lol anyway i liked the way this toner made my face feel it didnt burn on my sensitive skin it didnt even really dry out and when I woke up the next day it seemed like the toner helped my moisturizer worj beter throught the night ! This one is a keeper
 Perfect product . It is good on my face and neck . Fast delivery , and will recommend to my friends . I give five stars .
 this is a nice product , suits my skin and i am very happy to buy it easily online for a nice price ...
 I always use this product but was unable to find it in stores anymore . Glad you had it . Now I know where I can buy it .
 I used the toner today after doing an at home facial and OMG it smells good first of all . I did n't expect that because I never thought to smell it once it arrived . It goes on soothingly and refreshes the skin . I 'm glad I purchased this product .
 I have used this toner for a year . It 's great , gentle on the skin , and CHEAP compared to other name brand toners . A great buy !
 I bought this because my mom had wanted to try it . She liked it so I guess it is OK .
 I once stuck to this lipstick when ` long lasting lip color ' was just beginning and it does stay on the lips.It is nice not to run to the powder room so often to reapply lipstick.It does feel a bit heavy on the lips and does n't make lips feel moisturized , thus I gave it 4 stars .
 Jergens Lotion is always my lotion since when I was young , now that I 'm getting older I started using Jergens Skin Firming Lotion when I turned 40 to keep my skin from sagging and to keep the cellulites from appearing on my tighs and it works even when I only use Jergens Skin Firming during the warm months of the year . I 'm 45 now and I recommend this to those who want to avoid the appearance of cellulites on their tighs and to those who want to avoid the sagging skin as one gets older .
 I have used the Jergen 's Firming Lotion product for more than 8 years . Recently I found the local stores not carrying this product & had to try other name brand firming lotions , which I found watery & not as efficient . Luckily I checked out Amazon.com & they had a vendor who carried the Jergen 's brand . I am a happy & smooth again.Jergen 's user in Portland .
 I 've had 2 kids , my first I gained A LOT of weight from and lost my weight really fast after so I had a lot of loose skin , my 2nd was born 4 months ago and I 'm to my normal weight again but again have loose skin . I have n't used this long enough to see if my skin is tightening up but it moisturized amazingly so I have hope this will help work along with my workouts .
 St. Ives is a great brand of lotion and this one here works really well ! So if your looking for a brand of lotion buy this one . This lotion gets 5stars !
 I have kidney problems and my skin tends to day out quite a bit from dehydration . I have tried many creams and lotions - incuding some of St. Ives ' other great lotions - but this one is the best!It contains both Vitamins E and A - so it is great for the skin also . It is not greasy or leaves a film on the skin and it nourishes my skin - while soothing it from the extreme dryness I have struggled with for quite a while . It smells relatively mild compared to other lotions . And I have had less skin pain from the dryness since using it.I highly recommend this hypoallergenic moisturizing lotion with Both vitamins E and A by St. Ives . I just hope they never stop making this one - because it has greatly improved my quality of life !
 St. Ives Advanced Therapy Lotion with Vitamins E and A is extremely useful during cold winter weather ; I need it once or sometimes even twice a day even though I have a humidifier . Over time my skin has become more and more dry ; but it does n't take too much effort to get this out and rub some into that dry skin of mine!This works very well even if your skin has already become very red and/or flaky . Just rub more into your skin ; that 's really all it takes . Keep rubbing it in as if you were massaging your dry skin with the cream ; and the skin gradually absorbs the cream over a minute or two without it feeling too gooey or excessively moist . It 's well worth the price as any dermatologist will tell you . Excessively dry or red , flaky skin that is `` shedding '' does n't always look too hot , either.I also really like that this lotion contains liquid vitamins E and A . This vitamin combination is particularly effective for fighting even the worst cases of dry skin -- and mine can get pretty bad on my hands and forehead in the wintertime . Of course , it 's good any time of the year when your skin is dry.To keep this cream staying fresh as long as possible , store this bottle in a dry place away from heat and too much humidity.I highly recommend this hypoallergenic moisturizing cream with vitamins E and A by St. Ives . This company has been around for quite a few years ; and if they continue to make good quality products like this one they 'll be in business regardless of the harsh economic times !
 I recently started using St Ives Moisturizer at bedtime . I really started to notice younger looking skin with less wrinkles . And a very smooth appearance.Then a friend who had n't seen me in a while wanted to know what I was doing for my skin , because it looked great . I told him about my new moisturizer . What a nice compliment.St Ives Moisturizer really does alot for the price . I would compare the excellant results to higher priced cosmetics at department stores - at a fraction of the cost .
 This is by far my fave cleanser/scrub . I was so upset that I ca n't find it in the drugstores anymore but look , here it is .
 I used to buy this stuff at the drug store and at target ... ca n't find it anywhere anymore , so you should buy it here ! It is great stuff ... do n't let the other face soaps like it try to fool you . This actually makes your face tingle in the morning and keeps it clear , and it smells great !
 I suffer from Ichthyosis , a genetically inherited dry skin disease that is treatable but not curable . I have tried almost every possible lotion and cream on the market to treat this disease and St Ives Collagen Elastin for Severely Dry Skin is the best treatment I have come across thus far . I have been using this lotion for about 8 years now . In comparison to other `` non-scented '' lotions St Ives has the most pleasant scent of all and it is NOT overpowering at all . It blends into your skin almost immediately after putting in on and will leave your body moisturized over a 24hr period . If you suffer from extremely dry skin or chapped skin during the winter time this lotion will give you a mild tingling/burning sensation but that 's how you know this lotion works . It 's not any different than using a strong toothpaste or mouthwash that really cleans your teeth . I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone who uses lotion regularly . You will notice a difference in it 's application and the way your skin looks and feels .
 I 'm not sure what happened with the reviewer that unfortunately ended up with burned skin , but this product is excellent and makes my skin very smooth and hydrated . I workout and remove most of my body hair . Applying this cream after shaving or waxing makes a world of a difference . It smells great and does n't feel greasy at all . Great product !
 This is a great moisturizer , if you have dry skin issues . I reccomend it , especially if you have cracked , wind-burnt hands . It really absorbs and moisturizes painfully dry skin , leaving it soft , but not greasy . This is a wintertime must-have ...
 This lotion is great just after you 've shaved , especially those typically coarse areas on your throat , chin and armpits . It is water-soluble , so it does n't linger like oily lotions , and it smells pretty good . It reminds me of LSA -LRB- lubricant - small arms -RRB- from the US military , but please know it is not effective in that capacity .
 This lotion really works for me.It makes my skin very soft and silky without that oily and shining look . Its one of the best lotions I have used so far and the price is right . I am going to try some of their other product as well . I have tried other collegan Elastin lotions with retinol which always irratate my skin and leaves me with more lines than ever.Ever since I switched to St.Ives my skin has been in great shape and looks even more younger now .
 This thing really gets the moisturizing job done . And this big bottle lasted at least a year for me . The scent is neutral . Highly recommended .
 Yes , there is a new scent in all the supposedly unscented St. Ives lotions . It 's not a bad scent , it 's just annoying that the scent is n't advertised , and it 's almost impossible to find a simple unscented lotion anymore . If I want scent , I 'll wear perfume.But the lotion itself is great , as are all the St. Ives lotions . Very moisturizing without being greasy or goopy . I highly recommend the pump tops , because the squeeze tops tend to be clumsy and spill-prone . The Amazon price is rather high , though - $ 5.25 for a bottle of basic lotion ? I can get the same product at my local drugstore for $ 3.99 , or even less if there is a sale .
 Taking kenalog and using dmso I needed a lotion . This lotion seems to be helping . Its no miracle cream but it does help where other products did n't . Would highly recommend .
 Really good cleanser . Do not listen to the one bad review -- sounds like he may have had an allergic reaction . This stuff is not harsh at all .
 This is the best stuff ! My boyfriend has VERY sensitive skin & my own is normal . This product does beautifully on both . I recommend this to everyone I can . Buy it ; you wo n't be disappointed !
 FEELS GREAT AFTER USING.mAKES FACE LOOK VERY HEALTHY
 This is a very good face scrub . I really like the energizing feeling and the scrub bubbles . I use it day and night and it 's not a problem and is n't too abrasive for my skin . I think it definitely clears any acne up , too , by the micro-dermabrasion function that it performs.My only gripe is that at 4.4 oz , it is a very small amount of scrub . So far it has lasted me a good amount of time , however , and for the price it 's still pretty good.Recommend for sure .
 I 'm assuming that what they tell you is true and you need to occasionally run sandpaper over your face to strip a small layer off . In that case , I 'd recommend this to do it.I only use this once a week or once a fortnight . But when I feel particularly that there 's too much skin on my face and I need to strip a layer off I use this . The good thing about it is that it cleans quite well yet does not leave your skin dry . It smells nice without being overpowering . And I only use it before sleep and never after shaving because I think that shaving already strips a layer off your skin.So , cleans nicely , does not leave the skin raw , I recommend it !
 During my teenage years , i went through a number of products , and medications to clear up my acne . Toward the end i found Nivea for men 's Deep Cleaning Face Scrub . And lucky for me i did.I use the product daily . It is the only thing that keeps my face feeling soft , and clean , and pimple free.It 's also great to use before shaving . Scrubbing away layers of dead skin , smooths the shaving proccess and saves your razors from dulling too fast . It also allows for a closer shave.I recomend it .
 I loved the scrub . This was my first one ever but I loved it . I just wish it could have had a nice fragrance added to it . It really cleans your face and its great before shaving
 Use this face scrub pretty much every other day before bed and also use the nivea for men face wash on the other days . i 've been using this routine for about a year now and my skin has never looked better . after using the face scrub my face felt comletely clean and soft . i highly recommend this product .
 I 've been using this scrub for a while - it greatly improved the quality of the shave that I get . I get a lot less irritation.I 've also used a similar product from Lancome -LRB- more expensive -RRB- and actually prefer Nivea better .
 This face scrub is great to use before shaving . The scrubby balls within the soap effectively break down tough facial hair letting the razor get closer to the skin for a cleaner shave . I 've been using the stuff since it came out , must be about 1 years now ... simply the best . Every man should have it .
 Face never felt so clean and invigorating . Regular cleaning seems to take off those black dots too . Whoever invented this , a genius in facial cleaning products.I compliment this with Facial refreshing cleaner to keeps face invigorating and rejuvenating . Another amazing product from Nivea !
 The way to keep handsome is not to just wash with a darn soap bar and stuff ... here this does what only ladies are doing ... come on guys ... it works for us too ! Exfoliating Scrubs are great for anyone ... ya dudes ... us too . gets rid of ... on your face ... and really clears it up ... a great scent too ... not overpowering or musky ... fresh instead . Try the facewash too ... great combo .
 This was my first pre-scrubber . I had been getting bumps and just not getting a good shave with some of the creams and lotions in the past . After a hot shower , rub this on , and then the cream and go for it . You 'll be surprised the difference it makes in shaving .
 Ok , having had the whole macho image going for me hadnt worked out so well . So i said what the heck , took the plunge and bought this as well as the daily wash.The feeling you get after using this amazing product is just fantastic . I havent used it long enough to notice the long term effects , but from the way my face feels , it 's removed alot of gunk and dirt that i didnt actually notice.Leaves you fresh and tingly . On with the facial care products ! Bravo !
 This lotion is great ! It keeps me from being itchy in the winter , soothes my sunburn in the summer , and cured my dad 's cracked hands when nothing else did . Plus , it is extremely affordable !!!!!!
 You can just feel that it moisturizes a lot better than `` Suave '' brand moisturizers when you put it on . The bottle size is also good for its price , although it 's more expensive than the less effective Suave brand moisturizers . Has a nice , though slight aroma as well . Compliments the St. Ives Apricot Scrub product very well .
 The St.Ives Swiss Formula Aloe Vera is absolutely wonderful but the lotion has been discontinued . When I found it online I was very happy . The advertisement clearly said Aloe Vera with a photograph of the bottle but I was sent another totally different lotion and had to return it . I received a credit for my purchase including postage but I was not reimbursed for return postage .
 I keep it by the sink and use often . It helps me get through the day with soft and smooth.hands .
 After checking at many stores and several other websites I decided to see if amazon.com had &#34; my &#34; lotion . They did ! It is my favorite of the St. Ives lotions or any lotion I have tried . I use it every day . I hope St. Ives will continue to make this specific lotion with aloe vera -- they seem to always be &#34; improving &#34; products and making different ones . I hope that I 'll be able to find it in the future .
 I 've been using this particular lotion for years and it does such a good job of keeping my hands from drying up . My finger tips in winter will always dry and crack which makes them very sensitive to touch anything . This St. Ives advanced therapy lotion when used regularly keeps them soft and moist so they do n't give me any problems at all .
 Not much to say about this article , except that I think it is the best body moisturizer on the market .
 I love this stuff and have bought it from you before ! Leaves my skin so soft and smooth ... But at 49.00 $ $ $ $ Seriously
 This moisturizer was recommended by my dermatologist as the best for hypersensitive skin . I love it and use it throughout the year .
 This product along with Neutrogena 's foot cream are the best on the market for this gal 's dry skin and I 've tried them all . From Alpha Keri to Eucerin to Lubriderm and everything in between . If it 's on the shelf at the drug store , I 've tried it and this is the only product that keeps my skin feeling soft and smooth . DO N'T CHANGE IT !!!!
 Wonderful moisturizer ! It softens and is absorbed quickly and I love the way it makes my skin feel . The scent is not at all unpleasant to me , but it is a bit strong and long lasting . I 'm guessing I wo n't notice with continued use but will see if unscented is available .
 I am sensitive to many products , but this is the only one that does not bother me . I use it daily , when I shower or wash my hands . It has given me a great skin over time , and I am 75 years old!My only complaint is that sometimes I have difficulty opening the container.For these occasions I save the old one and switch bottoms .
 This is the only lotion I will ever use for my dry skin . . it is wonderful and moisterizes skin for at least 24 hours !
 I liked this product . If you use more than a tiny amount , it will leave your hair feeling greasy . When I used a very small amount and rubbed it all through my hair , it did give it shine and hold . I will keep using this .
 I enjoyed using this product . It suited my needs very well . I was using mousse and when I received this product I switched over . It does the job better . I like the fact that it 's not heavy on my hair . I also like how easy it is to use . It has replaced my other styling products for good . I would recommend this product to friends and family .
 This product did a good job keeping my extremely thick hair under control , especially after I had just washed it . Most of the other products I have used in the past controlled pretty well but left my hair looking wet all day or feeling very stiff . With the VO5 , my hair stayed in place while looking like nothing was on it . I am very pleased with this product and will purchase it in the future .
 It seems to hold my husband 's hair in place , and it also seems to have helped his dry scalp .
 i love this scent ... just watch out for something that i did n't . the mist is different from the toilette . the mist is a milky kind of moisturiser and the other would be the ` perfume ' type .
 The scent of this product is wonderful especially for summer . It is light and refreshing . However , I have to admit I love many of the fragrances by Oscar de la Renta !
 I had a dermatologist recommend this stuff and I 'm so thankful he did . I used to have really dry skin and hands , but after using this stuff once , my hands are already softer and smoother . It 's awesome . It 's the only cream I will use !!!
 Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Body Moisturizer Daily Therapeutic Lotion - Fragrance Free -LRB- 15.2 oz -RRB- in the white bottle with the red and blue lettering has been DISCONTINUED by Neutrogena . Those sold online are all from the last lots produced . The product was officially discontinued by Neutrogena in June 2009 . A great product done in by the marketing types or whoever made the `` business decision '' to discontinue the product . What in the world were they thinking ? They 've successfully found a way to lose a lot of customers .
 This neutrogena product was reccommended to me and I have to say , I am so happy I took their advice on buying this lotion . I like to use it right after a shower , my skin stays unbelievably soft all the way until the next day . Yes , it 's that good . If you have any rough skin parts , -LRB- ie ; elbows , knees , etc -RRB- then you should give this lotion a go , you wo n't be disappointed . The only con I can think of , is when you 're applying it to your entire body your hands eventually get a little `` build up '' of lotion on them , but all you do is just run your hands under the faucet and you 're good to go !
 This moisturizer lives up to all of it 's claims , delivering a supple skin for the dryest rough skin . Service was prompt when needed most .
 Goes on smooth and oily left over feeling , absorbs into the skin , but the price is just to much I hate this was discontinued so everyone that have some is charging over the top prices .
 This is the best I have ever found , No fragerance and does not come off on your clothes . VERY hard to get , however . Has the company stopped making this ??
 I have found that this product works well for me - i tried many different products out there but this does the trick for me
 This is the best hand cream for the winter . At 1st it feels a little greasy but then it soaks into my skin and makes my hands feel soft again .
 Excellent product ! I do n't usually like gel because it appears sticky and unnatural in my hair , but this product really changed my mind . It 's a very light hold , but enough to style your hair . Works especially well with a hair dryer for added volume and style .
 This gel smells great . It also holds your hair without making it feel stiff . Actually , it made my hair very soft , but it still held its style . I would recommend it -LRB- and have -RRB- to anyone who uses a hair gel , as it has everything you want and more .
 I have used gels on my hair before and this one is better than average . It did n't say on the tube exactly how much to use , but I found out less is better because it weighs your hair down . My hair is naturally curly and I did like the results .
 I loved this gel . It 's versatile in that all the members of my family can use it without any problems . My 12-year-old son , who just started caring more about how his hair looks , tried it and it helps to keep his hair from '' `` popping up '' '' in the morning . My 21-year-old daughter has used it regularly for some time . I like that it gives some hold but is not stiff like some gels . I put it in after showering , then blow dry my hair . Then when I use my curling iron , the curl will stay longer than if I did n't use anything . Yet my hair feels natural , not crunchy . I do n't even need to add hair spray !
 I was very surprised to see this product work on my hair , which is very fine and dry . I usually do n't buy natural-hold get , because I thought I needed more hold , but I was very surprised . It left my hair with a lot of body . The curl was perfect every time . It washed out well , and I have used it every day for a week and always got the same results
 When I got the product , and discovered its great smell , I knew then it would be a good product . It 's good overall , and I liked way it helps put body back in your hair . My wife used it and she ca n't get over how soft her hair is now . I would recommend you try it . It wo n't take long to figure out that this is a great product . Wash your hair just a few times and you will see what I mean . This is a winner -- go get you some today !! .
 I absolutely love this gel ! There 's a lot of humidity where I live , so I have to get my straight , flat hair permed every six months
 I liked this product because it was strong enough to hold my hair back the way I like to wear it , but it did n't look sticky or stiff . The gel was clear and did n't have an odor , which is important to me as well . I 'll definitely buy this product in the future .
 I discovered this gel a few months ago . It 's really great for keeping those dry fly-aways and frizzies under control . Most stores do n't carry it and I forgot where I had gotten it so I came to Amazon and there it was - and at a great price - about $ 16 - that 's $ 4 a tube . Sure , it 's going to take me a while to work through four tubes , but I 've got a nice supply for a hard to find object .
 My daughters and I use this gel everyday . It is a light weight gel and help your hair with fly aways . I would recommend this gel .
 I wish my local stores still stocked this product , but since they do n't I 'm glad I could find it online . .
 This gel works well as an anti-frizz gel but seems to dull my hair a little . Probably just my perception but I use a different gel that does as well with the anti-frizz but does n't seem to dull my hair . One note about all the anti-frizz gels I have used is that if your hair is frizzy and you are in a damp wind -LRB- as in Texas gulf coast -RRB- , nothing will keep your hair from frizzing except wearing some kind of head cover .
 I have used Aussie Products for many many years , and the products thatAussie comes out with , they change their names but not the ingredientsUsing this product , gives your hair alot of definition , and keeps yourhair neat and smooth . No frizz either.I bought 4 bottles of it , just in case , I ca n't find it in the stores .
 I have long , curly hair and have always preferred mousse over gel . This seemed to hold much better than other gels and did n't leave my hair feeling '' `` crunchy '' '' .
 The product was very light , as it indicated on the package . My style held longer than usual , apparently due to the Aussie Gel . I liked the smell , which was fresh and not overly strong . I liked that this product did n't make my hair stiff or sticky . I could n't really tell that I 'd put it on my hair , except that my style held up longer . I 'd recommend it to my family and friends .
 Crystals make your hair feel so soft and beautiful and the fragrance is also pleasing ! I recommend this product ! A little expensive but it lasts a long time because you use so little .
 A few drops in one 's hair is all that 's needed to calm dry fly-away hair and add shine.Faipa 's Liquid Crystals is a very good leave-in conditioner . At first glance the product seems expensive , but only a few drops are applied after shampooing . The bottle I have now will easily last a month 's worth of shamoos and the conditioning effect means I can get by without hair sray or gel on those laid back/casual days.Faipa Sicura Professional Post Color Shampoo , 300 ml
 My hands are pretty dry . Got beautiful hands when I use it and lasts a while . Have to reapply later just like any other brands .
 This cream may not prevent stretch marks but , it feels great on dry cracked winter skin . And , it smells good too !
 The packaging is attractive , and the pump distributes the product easily , in a controlled spray . There 's a bit more alcohol than I would prefer , as evidenced by the scent and its listing as the primary ingredient . I have waist-length curly hair that has significantly thinned recently due to thyroid disease and yet the product adhered to my wet hair without dripping . Scrunching curls into place created well-defined curls . I used the product daily following a shampoo and conditioning . When I dried my hair with a diffuser , the change in volume was dramatic and lasted into the next day . When I air-dried my hair , the defined curls had staying power . This product dramatically improves the appearance of my hair , allowing it to appear healthier , more voluminous , curlier , and baby soft -- without stickiness or build-up .
 I did like this product . It held real nice , did n't feel sticky , and did n't flake . I would recommend it to my friends . The only thing I did n't like was the smell ; it smelled like hairspray at first then it started to smell like grapes . I do n't care too much for grapes but some people might like it .
 It smells great ; my male friend even knew what kind of hair spray I had in my hair . It holds well . I used it once a day while my hair was in a ponytail . It does n't take much spray to keep your hair in place . The bottle representation is slightly plain , but I would highly recommend Aussie Sprunch Spray .
 I really liked this product . It was n't sticky and it did n't make my hair feel like I had anything on it . My only problem was that I have long thick hair and it did n't last all day . It had a very nice scent that was n't overpowering . I would recommend this product .
 I have very thick heavy hair and this was great for keeping it in line . I did find it was easy to over spray , which made my hair look dirty sometimes , but with a lighter touch it worked great . The scent was pleasant , but I like Aussie stuff already . It did have a very strong alcohol smell but that went away after a bit . I look forward to using it to the end of the bottle .
 I liked the Spray Sprunch . It has a wonderful scent ! My hair is short and can be stiff -- with a mind of its own -- but I brushed it through , and it held my hair in place all day . I also tried spraying it on after I 'd styled my hair . Then I hand styled it , and it held that too !! I 've used it every day , and would recommend it very much !
 I was on what seemed to be an endless hunt for a product to help my completely unmanageable hair . i tried scrunching spray , gel , mousse , pomade , and something called glue . -LSB- i would n't recommend it -RSB- but when i finally picked up a bottle of this inexpensive ` sprunch ' spray , the hunt was over ! this stuff smells great , for one thing . and when it comes out , it 's short even bursts that do n't leave disgusting flakes on your hair . and the best part is-NO CRUNCHINESS ! it 's perfectly soft-even softer than how i started . my hair is a thick , wavy/curly frizzy mess . a few squirts of this stuff is all i need , and my waves become more defined curls , it 's soft , and it loses the frizziness ! it 's my miracle product : P
 Finally a hairspray that really works . I have tried every hair-spray and nothing worked . I have fine hair and this productholds my hair all day . It gives it body that lasts all day.I wanted something that held all day and yes this really does.It washes out easily . It makes my hair feel healthy . I do nothave flyaway and yes it even gives me shiny hair . I am veryhappy with this product and would recommend everyone use it.Take it from someone who has been searching for a long time fora product that really works . Use it ...
 I absolutely love this product . Hairstyles change now with all the natural looks it 's nice to see a company with a product that still holds very well . This is a great styling product it allows you to make wonderful hairstyles without fear of them falling or having a lot of fly aways.Also with this product it has that wonderful Aussie scent . I 've used this product or another of their line since I was a teenager and I 'm 32 now . Aussie makes quality hair care products at very reasonable prices and I do n't feel as if they are any less than the salons products . In my opinion I find them higher quality because they not only have quality , scent , but a great price . Which adds up to a great product deal !
 Good product . It smells good , but for extra hold , I would suggest maximum strength .
 The Aussie Scrunch Spray is wonderful . My daughters love it . It is n't heavy on their hair and it smells just like grapes . If you like Aussie products , you 'll love this product . It 's definitely worth buying . I intend to buy it on a regular basis . I would recommend this to everyone .
 I would recommend this product to everyone . Aussie Sprunch Spray does not get all stiff when you walk outside in the rain . It does n't leave your hair feeling all hard and brittle . Aussie Sprunch Spray has a great smell to it , like cherries . That 's a plus with my husband . He could n't stand the smell of my other hair products but this one he loved . This product is definitely a plus !!! Everyone should try this and see for themselves . From now on , this is my hair care product .
 This is a very effective product . It works great but do n't overuse it , or it will become too stiff . It takes just a few sprays for great results . One bottle will last a long time . I would recommend to my friends
 My hair is fairly hard to manage . When I used the spray I felt that it helped a great deal in taming stray hairs . It did n't seem too sticky on my hair and held the style well . I would recommend it to others , especially if other products do n't work well for you .
 The first thing I noticed was the nice fragrance . It has a fruity smell . I have long , thick hair , and most hair spray I have to spray on , and on ? but this Aussie Sprunch Spray works with just a couple sprays and my hair is set for the entire day . Another thing I like is that it does n't leave your hair looking like you have dandruff . -LRB- You know all those hair sprays that cause flaking ? -RRB- Best of all , it 's not sticky . Give this product an A + !!!!

 I have used this product for a couple of years now and it is the only thing that works keeping control of my frizz with my natural curl.Now it is not being sold in stores at all so the only way I found it is on AMAZONThanks
 I have been using Orange dep gel in my hair for at least 10 years ! They have slowly stopped selling it in all the stores in my area . Recently the last store I knew that carried it have discontinued it , therefore I have to now buy in online . It works great for my naturally curly hair and holds the curl . It does get a little crunchy but not so bad if you diffuse it . Thanks for selling it on Amazon !
 The product is very good and so was the service ! The product arrived quickly , very impressive . I had used this product before , so I knew I was going to like it .
 helps with the dark circles and the puffiness ... if used daily it also seems to tighten the skin under the eyes .
 I like this eye gel a lot . I do n't have wrinkles yet but decided since I 'm in my early 30 's that it 's time to start using eye cream sooner than later . This gel makes goes on cool and makes the skin tingle . For an added treat , put it in the fridge for an extra refreshing feel . The skin under my eyes does feel baby soft and moist but I do n't know for sure if it 's erasing any fine lines . The price was right and It came pretty quickly too . I will order again in the future .
 I thought that this was a product that would be enjoyed by many women who , like me , are in their early 40 's and are starting to combat the aging process in the eye area . Those little lines and wrinkles snuck up on me before I knew it . I had tried a few other products before , but I actually noticed that in one week 's use , this Oil of Olay eye gel had actually made some progress ! The feel of it is wonderful -- the witch hazel and cucumber extract gives it a nice smell and a little zing . I would definitely recommend this product to any woman who is starting to see the signs of aging like I did ! Oil of Olay is a well-known brand that I have usually not been disappointed with , either .
 I started to use the Oil of Olay eye gel right away , and I noticed that my fine lines were diminished . It could n't have come at a better time because I 'd just suffered a loss in my family and by using this product , I was able to reduce the puffiness under my eyes from crying . I would recommend the product to all women who have puffiness and fine lines due to the ravages of environment and age .
 I do n't think using this product changed my appearance at all , but my skin does seem smoother after using it . It works very well under make-up . It seems to be a pretty good value and I would recommend it to my friends .
 This is so great . I love it . After just 2 days of use you could n't even see any fine lines around my eyes . My eyes feels great too . This really tightens and firms . I keep mine in the fridge for a really good cooling effect . Love it !
 thats all you need -- best for the price on the market
 I like the Oil of Olay Revitalizing Eye Gel . I have noticed a difference around my eyes since I started using the eye gel . I 'm sure I will continue to purchase this product .
 This product will last a long time . Each application takes only a small amount of eye gel . I would like to think that I notice a difference in lines around my eyes . I have few lines and I seem to notice them less . The product is easy to use . I would have liked to have received detailed instructions . I did n't know if I should use it just in the evenings or morning and evening . I would buy this product .
 I am 42 and this product works great for getting rid of puffiness and dry skin under my eyes and my eyelids . My skin is totally smooth when I wake up after it being dry and itchy before going to sleep .
 I 'm not able to use creams on my eyelids due to severe itching and sensitivity and this is the only product I have found that does not cause problems . Its not oily , very lightweight and no perfumy smell . I just use a dab over each eyelid up to my eyebrow . I feel that is reduces the wrinkles and dryness.It works perfectly for me and I will continue to use !
 I did n't notice any results after using the product for 10 days . It did give me a cool , soothing feeling to the area underneath my eyes . I will continue to use the product and would recommend it to my friends and family . I have n't used a similar product before , so I do n't have anything with which to compare it .
 I have been using this oil for more than 20 years . I was extremely disappointed when Garrett Wade quit carrying it , and I was elated when my wife found it on Amazon . This is far and away the absolute best oil I have ever used . It is not only great for honing , cleaning , and keeping tools rust-free , it works incredibly well for getting off the inadvertent rust on bench and floor tool milled surfaces . A little camelia , a little 000 steel wool , and voila ! Back in business . You ca n't go wrong with this stuff .
 My dad knew about this stuff since before I was born , and that was quite a while ago . Japanese craftsmen have used it for centuries to protect their metal tools . IT WORKS.I inherited tools that he protected with this stuff , -LRB- some of which are over 100 years old -RRB- , and the metal still looks like new.It 's easy to use , is not messy and a little goes a LONG way . That 's why this atomizer spray bottle is so convenient.If he were alive , my father would be incredulous at this price , but it is still the best price I have found for a quality product . Also sold under the ubiquitous moniker `` tea-tree oil '' , or with fanciful exotic names like , `` oshima '' or `` tsubaki '' , other products are not as pure and often have extraneous ingredients for scent , color or thinning / extenders . This is the real deal.It is food-grade and non-toxic . Some folks cook with it ! ... and although I never intended to use it as such , it really does help smooth your skin ! Last week , after wiping down all my tools with this stuff and a cloth , my callouses were noticeably softer . My hands can get pretty rough at work . My wife has commented on the softer touch and responded favorably ! -LRB- wink ;--RRB- It makes a fabulous massage oil ! For those reasons alone , i suspect many users will want two bottles . Of course , women like to use this for their hair , elbows and feet . I can not reliably recomend any medicinal or `` other '' use.With this bottle , some silica gel-packs and some camphor , you can economically prevent rust or corrosion or tarnish on most metals . Eight-ounces of the stuff is enough to do a shop full of tools for a couple of years.TEN STARS ! Highly recommended !
 This is simply the best gel I have used . Simply squirt it on your hand and rub it in your hair , and you are ready to style your hair any way you want . This gel accomodates the slicked down nerd look as well as more hip styles such as the `` SPIKE '' . Hair sculptures are nearly undestroyable . Other green gels might look the same but they are simply not as good .
 Great hold without leaving my hair feeling heavy or greasy . I 've tried other L'Oreal Studio Line hair products and prefer this one over the rest .
 I used this product on my daughter 's very fine hair to help hold her hair when I style it . It worked very well on her fine hair and did n't make it look sticky or greasy . Super easy to distribute into her hair .
 Overall , I was satisfied with this gel . It had a pleasant smell and was n't too sticky . It washed off easily of both my hands and my hair . And it held my hair well . I 'd definitely use this product again .
 I 've tried L'Oreal before in the past , but I 'd never tried Total Control Clean Gel before . I really like it , because it works for me . I have really straight hair and most hair gel products are n't strong enough for it . But this product manages to hold my hair and keep its style . It also does n't have a really strong perfume smell like other products I 've tried . Overall , I really like this product .
 I liked this gel because it is n't sticky , it 's easy to apply to wet or dry hair , and there 's no buildup . It leaves my hair shiny and styles it just the way I want it . I 'd recommend this product to others who are looking for a great hair-styling product .
 This hair gel is great stuff ! First of all , you use only half the amount of gel that you 'd normally use with another gel product -- which saves you money . Secondly , and more important , this gel not only has vitamins in it , but it 's also a far-superior gel to most other gels I 've used . My hair now has staying power without looking stiff . GREAT stuff !
 When I first received this product , I thought it would be mainly for people with straight hair . I have a body wave and medium to long hair that falls past my shoulders . I curl it every morning with a large barrel curling iron . I 'd been using one particular mousse because it made my hair look healthier and made it more manageable . This product actually worked better for me . It makes my hair FEEL thicker , yet does n't weigh it down . I like body and can still style my hair with body throughout .
 One of the reasons I chose to test drive this product was because it was from L'Oreal . And once again , L'Oreal came through . This product left my extremely curly hair manageable and soft . There was no stickiness or stiffness . And it held up in the wind and the rain and it 's alcohol free . I 'd recommend it highly . I give it a 10 !
 This is just excellent . I was using hairspray from various companies , but this what I had been looking for . Looks like I 'll be a permanent user of this product . My hair is dry , and gel is very helpful in keeping it shiny throughout the day . I also have thin hair , so a gel helps keep it well groomed the way I like it . Also , unlike other gels , it does n't thicken or make my hair brittle . Excellent , excellent .
 I enjoyed using this hair gel very much . It did n't leave a greasy feeling in my hair when I was using it , and it had enough control to last all day . It 's easy to wash out and did n't leave a residue . I 'd recommend this product to all my friends and family .
 This product was well tested by all three members of my family -LRB- 9-year-old boy , 32-year-old male , 34-year-old female -RRB- I -LRB- being the female -RRB- have permed hair and like the wet look . I apply the gel when my hair is wet and then style it and let it dry naturally . It 's very light and does n't weigh your hair down . My hubby has a short haircut and uses it to add a bit of style to his hair . He liked it because it did n't have a perfume smell . My 9-year-old will actually do something with his hair now . All in all , I would recommend it to my friends and family .
 This product was very good . The hold was superb and it was n't a '' `` heavy '' '' feeling on my hair . I liked the texture and feel of this product also . It comes in a very appealing-to-the-eye package and in a very nice size . I would recommend it to all my friends and family if they 're looking for a product of this type .
 The gel certainly does hold your hair , or those flyaway ends in place . However I personally felt that it was too thick . L'Oreal makes a similar product called Melting Gel , which I much prefer , and which is a much thinner gel .
 I really liked this product . I use gels and mousses to give my hair height at the crown . A lot of times a product will weigh it down and it will feel stiff and '' `` yucky '' '' . Other products do n't have enough staying power . But this one was just right . When you first put it on , it feels like it 's going to be really stiff , but when it dries , it does just what I wanted it to do . It added height without a lot of buildup and stickiness . I would definitely buy this product and recommend it to a friend .
 This stuff is great ! I have very fine , poker-straight hair and this product , along with my curling iron , enables me to hold the curl I want . My husband tried it too and he likes it as well !
 This was a very good product , in my opinion . It did a very nice job of styling hair without making it look plastered down . It had a nice smell too . The gel was the right consistency and did n't feel sticky . Also , not a lot is needed to control the hairstyle . Would definitely consider purchasing .
 I like the L'Oreal Studio Line gel . It has a nice clean scent and , for my needs , the hold was just perfect . The tube made for easy dispensing and allowed the product to stay at the opening of the tube . I 'd recommend this product to anyone who wants to achieve the slicked-back look , or for those who need extra hold -LRB- for spiked hair -RRB- . I also found it worked well when applied to wet hair , then dried and styled via curling iron or hot rollers .
 I put it to good use when we went on vacation . This Sunblock Lotion is creamy , goes on smooth , and does n't feel really heavy . And , with SPF 45 , I did n't have to worry about burning . However , the bottle states it wo n't clog pores -- but just like with any other sunblock , I experienced a small breakout on my chin while using it . Overall , a good product and I would use it again .
 Non-greasy , non-irritating , and lightweight , this is the best sunscreen I 've used thus far.I 'll write another review in a couple of weeks to see if this product is actually non-comedogenic -LRB- wo n't clog pores -RRB- , which can lead to breakouts.If it does n't , this is really the ultimate sunscreen , as it provides COMPLETE UV protection -LRB- many sunscreens do n't -RRB- .
 I was impressed with how smoothly this product went on . Sometimes sunscreen is too thick , but this was n't . I would recommend this product because it has a high SPF -LRB- 45 -RRB- and it also blocks both UVA and UVB rays . This product is also sweat-proof for athletes who are in the sun a lot . On the downside , however , the product is supposed to be fragrance free , but I did n't care for the scent
 I tried this item in 2003 . Then I was at another country where I could not find this item . Now I am back to USA , and I buy one of this sun cream . I am planning to bring some to my relatives too . It is great on my face . I love it . The only thing to consider maybe its fragrance . If you do not want the smell , there is another Neutrogena sun cream with citrus fragrance . I will always use Neutrogena , I never change my sun cream .
 Excellent sunscreen ! If you are sensitive to the sun , or just caution , give this product a try ! I have very fair skin , and have to be especially careful . This sunscreen provided wonderful protection . It goes on very smoothly , and not too greasy . The scent is n't overwhelming , like some other sunscreens . Neutrogena Sunblock gets an A + from me !
 This sunscreen went on smoothly over my skin . It was easy to blend in and left no white streak marks . I used it on my young children 's sensitive skin and they showed no signs of irritation . The sunblock lasted even while the children were playing in the water . Great quality product .
 I was very excited about the chance to use the Neutrogena Sunblock SPF 45 . First of all , I was familiar with Neutrogena and their reputation for skincare products , so I immediately knew it would be worth trying . I usually buy 30 + in SPF protection because I 'm fair-skinned and burn easily . It 's hard to find SPF 45 not geared toward children , that goes on without feeling very thick and sticky for the rest of the day . Once I rubbed this one into my skin , my hands did n't feel greasy . And , I did n't need a face lotion , since this could be used on my face without worrying it might run into my eyes . I also liked the easy-to-use flip top -- all the lotion comes toward the cap , the way it 's most likely to be stored . And , I did n't burn while using this product according to the directions . Although , I hope it will come in larger sizes . After 5 days in the sun , using the 4-oz size , I used just about the whole bottle .
 As a fair , sensitive-skinned redhead , I recommend this sunblock ! It 's perfect . It has a high SPF , which I use all over , but it 's also great for protecting just my face . Not only is it oil free , PABA free , and fragrance free , it even has antioxidant vitamins in it to help my skin . I 've never heard this about other sunscreens . I 'll definitely keep this product on hand . Neutrogena products are generally excellent for my skin .
 I really liked the fact that it gave UVA and UVB coverage . It went on smoothly , and did n't stay greasy or sticky . I applied it every morning to my two children and myself . The only thing I did n't care for was the smell . It really smells bad , and the scent tends to linger for a little while . My kids did n't like the scent either .
 There are two features I like most . One is that it 's oil-free . My skin is oily and this sunblock 's oil-free characteristic make me feel good . It also has a refreshing function and makes me feel energized . Another thing I like is that it has little scent , and seems to be fragrance-free . On hot days , it 's perfect . As for the protection from UVA/UVB , I 'm not sure because the weather here is n't hot enough !
 I tried the Neutrogena Sunblock before I played golf , and before an all-day deep-sea fishing trip . Because it was SPF 45 , I thought it would be thick and greasy -- but it was n't at all . Also , there was no cosmetic smell to it , which my husband loved . The only thing I 'd have to complain about was that it took a while for the product to absorb , and it left my face feeling a little sticky until it did .
 Neutrogena Sunblock Lotion SPF 45 is the best of any of the Sunblock products I 've used . I have sensitive skin , but I had no reaction from using it , such as a rash or itching . The fragrance is pleasant , and not overpowering . I 'd recommend this product to my family and friends . I use it in the winter months , for the extra protection I need due to medications I take .
 IMO one of the best mens colognes that Coty ever made but discontinued for some reason ... Not available in stores anymore and hard to find on the internet ... My purchase was fast and efficient ...
 My favorite mens cologne and very rare to find some available ... so when I find it I buy as many as I can . Gets sent to my address in steller time and very happy until it is gone !
 I have used sunless tanning sprays in the past and have always had bad luck with them . Usually they were very orange in color and hard to apply . Well , that is n't so with this product . It 's very easy to apply and my hands did n't turn orange after rubbing it in . It also has a nice fragrance . The bottle says that the color takes about two hours to develop but it took longer -LRB- more like 4-5 hours -RRB- . The downside to the product is that I hardly noticed a color change in my skin . It was very vague . It definitely did n't make me look like I had been at the beach all day . I 'd recommend this product if you want to look like you have a hint of color but not if you want to look like a sun-drenched beach babe .
 I did n't want a dark tan , just some nice color . So my wife and I both tried it . My skin turned out nicely , almost a natural tan color . My wife found the same results , she 's fairer than I am , and it was fine except that when she washed her hands some water must have dripped onto her leg and it left a smear-drip mark . That is n't Neutrogena 's fault ... just be careful until it is dry.Other than that I 'm pleased . Not perfect , of course , but worth 4 stars .
 This product worked great -- better than expensive department store brands , I might add . The tan looks real and you can put on more for a darker shade . I absolutely recommend this product for a beautiful and safe tanning !!
 This sunless tanning spray is the first product I 've tried that left a natural color and no splotchy streaks after it dried . I can only recommend this product going by my skin tone which is a fair shade of pasty whiteness that would border close to albino if not for the freckles and years of exposure to the hot sun . If you fit in my category , do n't even bother with the darker shades , because they wo n't look as natural as the medium or light shades . When picking the shade , always go with what you know your body is capable of . The darkest shades wo n't look natural unless you know you are capable of achieving that type of tan . My recommendation on application of this stuff is to stick to easy-to-access body parts if you 're putting it on yourself , and try for the harder to reach parts if you have help from a partner . I also recommend you rub this in with a moderate dose of skin lotion to help give it an equal spread over your skin . Rub thoroughly until there is friction on your skin because of reduced lotion . Then repeat once more to make sure you get everything . You can achieve the tan in four hours , but I always put it on the night before , and let it dry over night . As long as you wait an hour before touching your sheets , it wo n't leave a stain . Also , do n't worry about staining your hands like past inferior products used to because you can have this on your hands for at least twenty minutes before you wash it off , and not have to worry about it staining them . It 's a quality product that I have used for years and would recommend to anyone . It 's expensive and only comes in small doses , but you get what you pay for in the world of sunless tanning .
 I would definitely recommend this product ! I 've tried other sunless tanning products in the past that have turned my skin orange . That 's not the case with this one . The tan looked natural . It was easy to apply , and I saw results in three hours . I only did one leg at first so I could clearly see the difference , and there was a drastic improvement . I used to be so embarrassed of my ghost-white skin that I refused to wear shorts in the summer . Now I will be able to !
 I love the way it sprays on and the overall look of the product . I 'd recommend this product to all my friends and family .
 The Neutrogena Sunless Tanning Spray was much easier to apply than a squeeze tube tanning lotion . I got a good , even tan cover , especially on my legs . If I miss a spot the spray makes it much easier to re-apply to that area . It 's great to look like you 've just come from the beach -- in the dreary winter !
 Great stuff . Went on evenly with a bit of hand smoothing and actually made my skin look naturally tan , not orange and fake looking . I 'm a gardener and had really tan legs and white feet from wearing sneakers in the garden all summer . Time to dress up in fancy sandals caused me to carefully rub some of this tanner on my feet and they looked fine .
 The Neutrogena Sunless Tanning Spray is an excellent product . Currently , it 's winter in Indiana , and the Neutrogena Sunless Tanning Spray gives my skin an excellent glow . It 's a pleasure to use because it has a wonderful fragrance , and it dries fast on my skin . It makes my skin look natural , and there 's no horrible streak . The Neutrogena Sunless Tanning Spray is an excellent product to use , especially for people who live in freezing weather .
 I 've been using this product for over 10 years . It is the only product that works on my long curly hair . Last week I found out that it has been discontinued.Shame on L'Oreal . A few months ago I noticed that two of our local stores stopped carrying this gel and contacted L'Oreal Customer Service to find out if they were discontinuing this product . The answer was `` no '' . Had I known that they were not being truthful , I would have purchased a lifetime supply of it ... It is a rare find for $ 8.99 ... It goes for $ 10 a pop on Ebay ... Regular price - $ 3.49 ...
 L'Oreal has really messed up by discontinuing the lasting curl product . Now people are selling this $ 3.49 product for triple the amount . L'oreal could have raised their price several dollars and would not have lost customers . This is the ONLY product that works on my curly hair . Over 10 years I have bought this product . L'OREAL PLEASE LISTEN TO YOUR CUSTOMERS . Bring this product back Quick . I refuse to pay $ 10 plus to use this product ... you will know me when you see me . I am the women with uncontrolled curly hair .
 As all of the reviewers mentioned , I too have been a fan of this gel for over 10 years . The ONLY product that works for my spiral curls , I 've tried to find a substitute for it since L'Oreal went ahead & discontinued it -LRB- without letting thier customers know about it -RRB- . I 've since purchased from the most expensive curl gel to the cheapest ... NOTHING compares to this product . It 's ridiculous that I have to pay $ 10 for a bottle of gel I used to buy at CVS for $ 3.49 . But I have to do what I have to do to keep my curls in shape ! Boo to L'Oreal and all I can say is STOCK up while you can !!
 I agree with all the other reviews . I have used Springing Curls for many years . I have very long hair and get spiral perms , and the gel holds the curls , but with no build-up or sticky feeling on my hair . Why in the world do they stop making the best products ?
 I , too , have been using this product for over ten years . I have tried too many other products to keep count of ; nothing else works so well on my hair type . I do not have curly hair , but very coarse and frizzy hair that only this product keeps under control without making my hair either stiff or heavy with oils . I hope that L'Oreal puts this product back out on the market . Their new line has nothing comparable , and I 've tried all of their new items .
 Why did Loreal discontinue this miracle product ?? I ca n't find anything else that works on my curly hair ... I have made a lot of friends fall in love with this product as well . Buy it all while you can !
 I 've been having bad hair days ever since I ran out of this stuff . I have tried everything else for my curls , this was the only product that could make me feel good about my hair for the past 6 years .
 I completely agree with everyone - This is the best product on the market for curly hair . Since I have stopped using the product , my hair looks terrible . I had to scrape the bottom of my purse to purchase this gel for $ 10 - Unbelievable !! I decided to write a letter of complaint to Loreal -LRB- address below -RRB- . If everyone takes some time to address a complaint to the President , perhaps they will consider bringing the product back . Those of us with curly hair are consistently overlooked in the haircare market.L ` OREAL USA , INC. , Carol Hamilton , President575 Fifth AvenueNew York , New York 10017 ,
 Thank you for stocking an item that 's no longer available in the stores/discontinued , and at a price lower than offered elsewhere . Bought 4 of them , to hold me over for a year or so , until I can find another replacement . -LRB- From what I 've read of the other review feedback , there is n't another product like it yet ! -RRB-
 LOVE this curling gel . I used it for years and then could no longer find it in stores . It does not weight the hair down , is not a heavy gel . So glad to have found it on Amazon.com . I will continue to order it as long as it is available . Love their curling mousse too and it is also hard to find in stores . L'oreal just makes great products
 This is the product I 've been searching for !!! I read many of the reviews on Amazon for this product before purchasing and all the wonderful things written about it are so true . This product does the following : enhances curls , Keeps frizz away all day without making curls look stiff or crunchy feeling , does NOT give you the `` wet '' hair look like some products do ... I absolutely love this product and you ca n't beat the price ! I did n't know until I read the reviews that L'Oreal no longer sells this item in stores . I am so thankful to Amazon for making it available though ! I plan to order several bottles and stock up !
 I think this is the perfect curling gel I have ever tried . It 's the first time I try that thing , but it just made my hair awsome . I have just ordered some more of it and the spray that goes with it . I love it .
 Its the best product i have ever used for curly hair :-RRB- I have been using for years : -RRB-
 I had my first Denman brush in the mid-1970s , and I 'm so pleased to have one again . This goes through very thick , straight hair easily , and the cushioned bristles make it feel heavenly . Best brush I 've ever used !
 I have long straight , black , non-treated Asian hair and bought the 9-row one -LRB- not heavyweight -RRB- . It 's like any other brush but the best part is that it can be taken apart easily , cleaned and put together again.You 'd think that quality -LRB- being able to be cleaned easily -RRB- would be something all manufacturers would do , but nobody really cares about making a quality product anymore . I highly recommend this product .
 My favorite hairbrush -LRB- Vidal Sasoon , very simialr to the Denman -RRB- finally gave up the ghost after about 15 + years . I was happy to find the Denman brush on Amazon . It looks and feels just like my old brush . It is nice to know that you can still find quality out there if you look for it . Thanks for making an excellent product .
 This brush is sturdy . The bristles are thick and do not have that extra plastic ball on the tip -LRB- which eventually falls off -RRB- . It glides through my 4a type hair , after washing , making detangling a breeze . It is easy to clean as well . I am very satisfied with this product .
 I have searched high and low for the perfect hair brush for years . One day I stumbled on a blog written by a hairdresser that was trained at the Vidal Sassoon Academy and exclusively recommended Denman . Soon after I saw this brush in a beauty supply store and had to try it . I have to say it is the best . My number one complaint about other brushes is the little balls on the end of the bristles . They eventually break off and then the bristles are sharp and scratch my scalp . Not this brush ! This brush is high quality and I wo n't ever buy anything else !
 I like the idea that base can be separated from the brush for cleaning . Nylon is very good -LRB- first plastic , my grand-mom 's kinda days -RRB- material . It can withstand any chemical abuse . The nylon bristles are sitting in rubber very tight , but they are still flexible . Made in England for over 5 decades !!! You can remove few rows of bristles & reset again later.The only thing that electrostatic still present , a bit .
 Mom had this brush in the 70 's ... little did I know I would be searching for this same brush in 2011 ... I have natural hair and read that when blow-drying my hair , this was the brush to use . It is perfect , feels good on my hair and does n't break by hair off when I 'm blow-drying ... and my hair is thick ! It works perfectly and is a good investment . My length is just below the bottom of my ears ...
 I just recieved my Denman brush . The brush massages the scalp without causing irritation and I have not lost but one hair thus far -LRB- which is perfectly normal -RRB- . I have wavy hair which I have relaxed -LRB- mildly -RRB- and my daughters ' hair is much thicker -LRB- 4b -RRB- . I am currently growing their hair as well as my own and believe that this is a wonderful product for any hair type , natural or relaxed . The delivery came quickly as well ... I would definately order from this company as the gentleman called prior to delivering and explained that he never leaves deliveries at the door . . job well done . Get the brush !!!
 This is the best brush I have ever purchased !! It brushes down to the scalp . Perfect for thick hair .
 This brush is heavy duty , and does a great job in detangling my natural kinky curly hair . First time I have ever paid this amount for a brush but I will say its worth the price . No complaints .
 Sturdy handle and the bristle are firm yet do not feel rough when brushing through my hair . The brush does not break my hair much with proper care .
 I 've been looking for a really good brush for my manly hair . This is it . I ca n't describe why . The bristles are just perfect and I love that it kind of rolls around the brush , instead of being a flat panel on the brush .
 Well I have really short hair and I was looking for a good brush to use for Guys . Although this specifically says for long hair it works great on short hair as well . The bristles are great for styling and are n't too hard . The bristles are very sturdy and will not fall off . The brush is overall a great brush to own and is made with good quality.Quality5 out of 5Functionality5 out of 5Materials Used4 out of 5Overall I rate this brush a 5 out of 5 on Amazon and a 14/15 on the Default Product Rating
 My hair technician recommended the Denman brush . I am so very pleased with the choice . It is excellent and is very durable and sturdy .
 This is one of those rare products that does what it 's supposed to do . It 's reasonably priced and made of durable materials .
 I really love this brush . It massages my scalp and feels so good . It works good on naturally curly hair when it 's wet . The hair is n't torn . Recommended by Teri LaFlesh , author of Curly Like Me .
 VERY NICE BRUSH BEFORE I NEVER USED BRUSH BECAUSE THEY WOULD HURT MY HAIR BUT THIS ONE IS BEEN GREAT FO FAR AM VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE !
 This brush is great for my 3c hair type , I highly recommend it ... I use it multiple times daily ! Very happy with purchase
 Great brush ! Does n't break my hair . Very happy with my purchase and I received it quickly . My teasing comb just was n't cutting it anymore !
 Awesome product !! I bought it because of my African textured hair it really helps to define and separate my curls . I heard about this brush per YouTube videos and it proved reliable buy it !!
 My mom had a Denman hairbrush before I was born that she , my sister , and I used daily until it finally wore out when I was about 10 years old . She was excited to find another Denman a couple of years later through a hairdresser friend . I took that brush when I moved out and used it on mine and my two daughter 's hair until it wore out . Now I am excited to have a brand new Denman brush for our family ! As all the Denman 's we have had have lasted 15-20 years , I expect to have this brush until my daughters leave the house . So far it is as good as I remember the others being - leaves my hair and head feeling healthy and beautiful !
 This brush is the business !!!! I have very coily curly natural hair and this brush helps me detangle my hair so easily . I do n't know what took me so long to buy one but now that I have it I 'm sold !!! I even ordered a spare just in case .
 My stylist recommended this brush . I like the brush alot . I recently cut my hair and wanted a smaller brush and this is what I wanted . It feels natural , does not pull the hair excessively and is gentle on tender scalps . It 's also easy to clean.Good at giving volume to my fine hair .
 I am an african american woman with natural hair and I purchased this brush with hopes of making the detangling process a little easier . The product has lived up to it 's expectations . The only small complaint I have is that it does n't work well unless the hair is saturated with conditioner . Otherwise you risk pulling out a significant amount of strands . Once the hair has conditioner and has a good slip the brush glides through the hair easily . You may have to remove a few rows of bristles to help so it does n't tangle your hair but in my process I enjoy the product . The shipping was SUPER fast .
 I love this brush for detangling and defining my curly hair . I do n't use it unless my hair is fully loaded with conditioner and then the brush just glides right through . The rubber base allows the brush to give so it does n't tug my hair unlike regular brushes . Also , you can remove some of the teeth in the brush for different effects .
 I just bought this brush last week and it has become my favorite brush . . EVER ! It easily detangles my 3c hair with no problem and makes detangling my crown area a breeze . This is really a wonderful brush to have .
 I love the denman brush ! It really has helped with detangling . I love it !
 I have used this type of brush for many years . This brush is superior in my opinion because it does not break my hair . The brush can be used on wet hair without damaging it as well .
 Eureka ! I finally found the brush that works on very thick hair . It 's a little weighty to use , which helps when massaging the scalp to stimulate circulation . I also like to use the brush for holistic , detox massage . It 's a win-win for me .
 This is a well made brush . My hair loves it . I had no idea that the brush was detachable . All the bristles come out making it very easy to clean .
 I borrowed -LRB- took -RRB- my mom 's Denman in about 1986 and it has been my only hairbrush since then . Now , in 2011 , it 's still going strong , but I decided to replace it with another of the same model . I 'll be back in another 25 .
 Works wonders on me and my daughter 's natural hair . Would have never thought that it would work so well on African-American hair . Must-have !
 This brush glides through my daughter 's 3C/4A hair without those cringe-worthy hair-snapping sounds you get when you use other types of brushes . It smooths and detangles her hair very nicely . I am very , very pleased with it .
 My old Denman hairbrush lasted twenty-five years before giving up the ghost . Obviously I replaced it with a new one that is the same model and I love it . You just ca n't buy a brush like this at most stores . Denman brushes have firm nylon bristles that do n't create static electricity when doing your hair and glide smoothly without clumping the hair . Try it you 'll like it !
 I am an AA female hair type 4A/fine and have been trasitioning for almost 7 months now from relaxed to natural and this brush has helped me tremendously during this time . I would most definitely recommend it to others for purchase .
 My hair is relaxed , but my sister 's hair is natural -LRB- she 's a C3 on the hair scale -RRB- . It distributes products evenly and detangles curls like a breeze . I thought it a bit expensive for a brush but it 's worth the money .
 Outstanding product in a professional grade . They last years and are well worth their price .
 Great brush , as usual . Needed to replace my pricey Denman after the puppy chewed it . The seller had a bit of trouble with an initially lost shipment , but made it all good by communication with me . They immediately reshipped the brush and I got it the next day after my email .
 I purchased this brush because my hair is half way down my back and I needed a good brush to just give it a good brushing and bring down all the natural oil . It works really nice . It gets completely down into the scalp for a nice kind of massage while brushing . Very satisfied .
 About 23 year 's ago we moved from Brooklyn , NY to NJ . Our family hairdresser traveled to our home to give my family haircuts . The brush he gave us finally wore out . We loved the brush so much that we glued the rubber together . After a while this did n't work . I found the exact brush at Amazon and purchased it . Now there is happines once again in our household . Love this brush .
 I purchased one for myself and one for my niece . I use mine when I blow dry to ensure a straight blow out . The bristles feel wonderful on the scalp . When I start brushing I have to stop myself because it feels so nice . This type of brush also works well on my niece 's naturally curly hair . It 's a great detangler and gives defintion to her curls . It does n't snag or pull out large amounts of hair . It 's strong and wo n't break on you . Denman I 've found sells affordable and well made products .
 This brush is like no other that I have ever used in my hair . I have long , 3b/3c curly hair and it is always a hassle to de-tangle my hair , but this brush makes it so easy . It still takes a while to de-tangle my hair , but this brush does not hurt AT ALL and it clumps my curls wonderfully ! I am very pleased with this brush !
 I recently transitioned back to natural and this brush has been a life saver . It 's sturdy and helps to remove the kinks . Expensive but worth it !
 I 'm transitioning from a relaxer with braid outs . This brush does an excellent job of gently detangling both textures of my hair . My only complaint it that it 's still a bit wide to get to the new growth at the base of a small section . I wish that they made a 3 or 2 row denman .
 I have been using this Denman brush for over 30 years . This is the 4th I 've owned . They last a long time .
 I have curly hair . This brush is simply amazing . It is sturdy and easy to clean . I use it after a shower to distribute product evenly into my damp hair . I have been using the brush for a couple of weeks now and I have NO complaints so far .
 I 've used the same brush for over 15 years and keep going back to Denman products . Best in the world .
 I have very curly hair and this brush get the tangles out with ease . Not much else to say , good quality a great brush .
 Devastated when my old Denman finally gave out after 20 + yrs . Had been searching everywhere to replace this fab brush -- even beauty supplies w/no luck . Dump those cheap stiff , hair damaging brushes and treat your hair & scalp to a Denman .
 I Love this brush . Bristles are hard , weight is good , curvature perfect . A solid purchase that will last . Highly recommended .
 I really love this brush specially for back combing -LRB- teasing -RRB- my hair then smoothing it out . I saw a YouTube video about this brush and I had to have it . I have very long hair and I wanted some volume on top . Long hair tend to weigh the hair down and the top just lays flat . I have tried other teasing combs and non of em worked for me except this one . I 'm so happy I finally decided to get one :-RRB- -RRB- .
 This brush seems okay so far . I only gave it 4 stars because I have not used it for that long . So far I have been using it on my girls hair and it keep those extra tangles out that I may have seem to missed with the comb . I have other ways to that I want to use it that 's I have not rate it a 5 .
 I 've been hooked on Denman brushes since I was a teenager -LRB- approaching 50 now ... -RRB- . The 7-row brush is the perfect all-around brush for medium to long hair . I 've tried others , but always come back to Denman .
 My son purchased one of these hairbrushes and I secretly used it for awhile . I decided I wanted my own so purchased one for me and one for my daughter . I just love this brush , it calms the tangles pretty much ouch free . Seriously tempted to toss all the other brushes!They came pretty fast too
 I 've been here about this brush for the longest time ! in my opinion its a great brush for curl definition for long and short natural hair
 Perfect brush for those of us with thick curly hair . It eliminates the need for different sized combs to truly tackle the tangles . It also separates the curls really nicely by itself . They always look so happy ! Paired with a great conditioner , I think this guy is unstoppable .
 Bought this brush for my daughter who has very tight curls which cause her hair to detangle very easily . She can sctually get her hair detangled with it . So glad I bought it .
 I never ever ever have time to write reviews of products , but I had to find the time to write this review because this brush is everything that they -LRB- Amazon reviewers , Youtube reviewers etc. -RRB- said it would be . My daughter and I have thick , coarse type 4 hair and this brush glides right through our beautiful kinks . Be sure not to brush unless the hair is fully saturated with water or conditioner . I absolutely love this brush !
 Taking note of a similar product review , the first thing I did was remove three of the bristle rows this made the brush more flexible and gentle while brushing . It was hard to fit the rubber pad back into the handle but using all 7 rows was causing unnecessary hair breakage.I much prefer my altered seven row to the classic styling brush with free flow wide spaced pins . The bristles on that one are far too stiff and are probably best for natural/unprocessed afro textured hair
 Denman brushes are a must for us with natural curly hair . They last for years . I 've had my other brush for five years , without any issues , and only purchased a new one -LRB- with more bristles -RRB- because my hair has gotten so long using Little Miss Fuzzy Head - Happy Hair Fusion & the Happy Hair Technique which encourages this brush . You wo n't be disappointed .
 Thus far , I can honestly say this brush works pretty well with my natural hair . :-RRB- I 'm so glad I seen others talking about this on youtube . :-RRB- It 's a bit pricey but I really like it thus far . :-RRB- Thank you .
 The bristle on the brush are not very forgiving . I like the features of the brush and the way that it is crafted .
 I like this brush a lot . I 'm a natural and this brush cuts my set angling time in half . Happy with this purchase .
 I have thick 4C hair , and this brush has been a great detangler & styling brush . I just make sure my hair is wet or has fresh product in it before I use it . Or else I 'm pretty sure it would take out too much hair .
 I 'm African-American with thick curly hair and this brush gets the job done when I 'm in the shower brushing through conditioner . I adore this brush . I simply could n't live without it since I have natural hair . I did remove 4 rows of teeth from the brush though but just so it could go through my hair easier.I highly reccomend this product because without it , I surely would have dreads ! : -RRB-
 What can you say about a hair brush ? I 've had a Denman ... just like this one ... for 20 years and it still works great . I do n't have as much hair as I used to , but the brush does n't care . I just bought a 2nd one for my `` road kit '' , since I travel a lot in my work.Brushes are like any other personal item ... everyone 's taste differs . I like this one because it 's the perfect balance between stiffness and softness , i.e. it does n't rub your scalp raw , but it 's strong enough to do the job . The plastic bristles do n't have sharp edges to poke into your scalp , like other/cheaper brushes do . And did I say it lasts forever ??? Get one ... you wo n't regret it .
 If you have curly hair this is that best brush you can have for your hair . I have African American curly hair so I only brush my hair when it is wet to help make my curls clump better.This brush works better than the knock off you find in the regular drug store
 I bought this product because of all of the hype on Youtube . I was not disappointed . I have natural African hair , and the other brushes I had just were n't cutting it . Either they were to hard or to soft . The Den-man D13 is perfect . I highly recommend this for any naturals out there .
 I had been avoiding this item despite reading raves about it on all my curly/nappy forums . I thought my wide tooth comb did a decent job in detangling my 4b hair , but this brush is like butter . My hair feels great after using it , I feel it helps get all conditioner/product to each strand . Highly recommend this to any curly heads .
 I have long hair , sometimes down to my waist , and this is the best brush I have ever used for getting all the tangles out . I 've tried look alike brushes only to have the handle snap off or have the bristle bed pull out of the handle after a week or two . So do n't waste your money on cheap drugstore brushes -LRB- which cost $ 5.99 -RRB- when you can get this wonderful brush for only $ 11 . Trust me , the Denman will last for years .
 My sister-in-law gave me this brush about 30 years ago . I really like the fact that it does n't irritate my scalp , yet gives a good `` massage '' . But what I really like , being as frugal as I am , is that it lasted 30 years . The rubber base that the bristles attach to has finally succumbed . What other brush works so well and costs less than 35 cents per year to use ? Guess I 'm just going to have to get another one -- likely my last since I 'm already 62 years old . But if I do need a second one in another 30 years , still have hair , and remember , I 'll surely buy another .
 I have had my Denman D-4 for over fourteen years . I have very long , very thick hair and its design allows me to thoroughly brush through any tangles without breaking or damaging my hair . The other review on this board that says the plastic is not high-quality enough for a hairbrush , and that it broke after just a few months , must be talking about another brush ! My Denman D-4 is very heavy , hard plastic with a sturdy rubber base for the hard plastic bristles . Plus you can disassemble the head and bristles to allow for a thorough cleaning . I have never had such a fantastic brush as this , and will always buy a Denman !
 This is the best hair brush ever made . This brush withstands the test of all hair products , soaps , bleaches and hair types . I have had many over my 40 odd years and the reason for purchasing a new hair brush is because they get borrowed permanently .
 I bought one of these brushes at a local store 20 years ago . I got tired of sharing mine with my daughter and I found another one through Amazon . This brush is the best . It feels natural , does not pull the hair excessively and is gentle on tender scalps . Her hair is very long and slightly curly - almost frizzy . Mine is kept shorter and is very curly . This brush works for both of us .
 I bought this for my daughter and she loves it . We both have very thick hair , and have difficulty finding a good quality brush that works well and does n't fall apart . This is one of those brushes that could last a lifetime .
 I 've used a Denman Cushion Brush for as long as I can remember . I have a couple of other brushes , but if I were alone on a desert island with only one brush this is the one I would want.This cuts through my thick hair like a hot knife through butter . It massages my scalp and feels wonderful . My other brushes simply do n't do the job of cutting through my dense hair like this does.The nylon bristles are rounded on the ends and give just the right amount of scratch to my scalp , not too much and not too little.The icing on the cake is that it is easier to clean than my other brushes . I can grab the hair this accumlates and pull it out more easily.This is my tried and true brand of hairbrush , the one I will never be without . I 've paid a lot more for brushes but this is the ultimate .
 It took awhile to ship , but it came finally . I use this brush for my kinky natural hair . The only thing negative is that I wish the bristle tip had a round tip on it . Other than that if your a &#34; natural &#34; this would be a great brush for you .
 I highly recommend this brush , this is my first Denman brush and I absolutely love it ! I read a lot of reviews before I decided to go with this brush . I have naturally curly hair and thought to myself how could a brush help detangle my curls ?! But it really works well ! I was amazed to be able to brush my curls without breakage or a sore scalp afterwards . This is a MUST for every girl that has naturally curly hair : - -RRB-
 I 'm glad decided to purchase a Denman . Never before would I attempt to detangle my hair with a brush while wet . I always depended on my shower comb to do the job , which was a long one . Many times , I 'd become frustrated trying to manage my medium length curly hair , and often times would rake through just to get it done . The Denman makes the process much easier . I have little to no breakage , and I know my hair has been thoroughly detangled . You ca n't go wrong with a Denman .
 This is the third one I 've bought . They last for years and are easy to wash . Perfect for styling and the bristles do not wear out or scratch the scalp .
 My daughter has kinky hair , 10 yrs old . She is natural , no perm . This brush detangles without the pain . I highly recommend it !!
 I was skeptical at first , but this brush really does something for your curl pattern . If you 're natural you should definitely get this product .
 This is the best hair brush that I have ever used . I will be order more of these at a later date .
 This brush is amazing . It detangles my hair easily and keeps my curls perfect . I should have bought this brush a long time ago .
 I bought this brush after my mom bought one.I 'm a black girl with sorta-thick-ish hair . I have n't had a relaxer since January and I like how the brush goes through my hair with ease . It 's also nice to use with wet hair , detangling products , leave - ins or whatever . The bristles are plastic like . It 's easy to clean and dries fast .
 I 've only had my Denman for a couple of months , but I love it so far ! I had read on a curly hair website that using one of these helps promote the `` clumping '' of curly and wavy hair , and so I decided to give it a try . I keep it in my shower , and use it to brush through the curl cream that I use . The Denman helps spread the curl cream , gets rid of tangles , and helps my waves start taking shape.Even though it 's been living in my shower , it has n't gotten warped or funky in any way . If you have curly or wavy hair , it 's worth giving this a try !
 This is the best brush I 've ever used - I 'm a black woman who is stretching out her relaxers and this is the only brush that can effectively get through my tight curls . I love it !
 As an African American woman , after going natural , I found it time consuming to use a regular wide-toothed comb to detangle my curls . So I saw a lot of natural women using this brush on Youtube -LRB- and they all swear by it -RRB- . So I bought it and gave it a try . Wonderful ! detangling takes less time , and it does n't make my hair frizzy ; it actually clumps my curls well . I love that , unlike a regular paddle brush , it can be taken apart and cleaned very easily . even the rubber base . The teeth do not break but are very flexible . So now that my mom has seen how wonderful my hair looks , she has gone natural , and I did n't hesitate to buy another one of these wonderful brushes for her . Highly recommended !
 I have long , curly hair and use this brush to detangle / brush my hair when wet . It 's a good quality brush .
 I 've heard a lot of hype about this brush and decided to get one . I mean , detangling used to be a long process that I had no patience for , but this really made it easier . It 's easy to clean , gentle when used properly.It really helps with the detangling but you still have to be careful and take your time instead of trying to rip through the hair .
 I never thought I 'd have a brush that actually made me feel happy just looking at it :p but this one does ! This Denman brush brushes through my super thick , curly , long hair really nicely ; it 's nothing like other brushes I 've owned . It 's especially great to use in the shower to brush conditioner through hair . I Highly recommend it !
 This is a good brush . I only use this brush with my hair wet and with lots of conditioner . I do n't brush my hair when it 's dry . Great for my curly hair !
 I think this is the best quality brush I 've ever seen . It 's just what I 've been looking for , one with stiff bristles without the little balls on the ends of the bristles -LRB- they come off eventually . -RRB- The 7 rows are perfect for my short hair . Some people have complained about the handle being too short . It could be longer , but it 's long enough for me . I do n't have a problem with it . The total length of the brush is 8 inches . It arrived much sooner that expected .
 I have long curly hair that I have to brush out very carefully while wet and covered in great big gobs of leave-in conditioner . I used to use a comb and pulled out so much hair that it was quite frightening . Enter the Denman brush ... upon recommendation of Teri LaFlesh and her book Curly Like Me . The brush is every bit as awesome as she describes it . It is sturdy and made of great quality hard plastic , the bristles are smooth and are embedded into a cushiony rubber base , but the very best part is that you can easily slide the rubber cushion from the handle , pop all the rows of bristles out and clean the brush in a jiffy.I am so happy with my Denman brush!It is a cinch to wash and to keep clean , it does n't pull my hair out by the handful and even though my fine hair knots easily , this size brush works absolutely perfectly and is easy to stash in a carry-on . I expected it to cost around $ 45 but it was extremely affordably priced.You can not go wrong with a Denman !
 Ok when I saw this brush online it looked flimsy and I thought I was going to get something that looks like my grandmothers wig brush ... . Needless to say this brush was BIGGER than I expected it to be and it has a nice weight to it . I brought this brush to detangle my natural 4c hair have yet to use it but I must say I was pleasantly surprised by how expensive it looks and feels
 I use this brush to comb out my curls . It is amazing ! I find that when I use wide combs , i miss spots and not all of my hair is detangled without damage . I have yet to experience damage with this brush and im surprised . It seems like it would be harsh and barbaric on my curls but it was quite the opposite . I think that this brush -LRB- 9 row -RRB- would be great on longer hair . I recently cut my hair and I think I will buy the 7 row also . This is a great product
 Denman brushes are great for natural hair -LRB- tightly curled -RRB- . I 've had mine since January and it does a great job detangling my hair without pulling it out . It 's very gentle on the hair and does not tug it at all . It feels soft against the scalp , and hair . It 's also easy to clean .
 I have natural thick , curly hair , and this product actually WORKS for me . It detangles -LRB- which is a plus -RRB- yet at the same time is defines my curls -LRB- + + + -RRB- . the denman is also good for blow drying . it helps smooth and straighten my hair with at the initial process so that in turn i can lower my heat with my flat iron . but a WORD OF WARNING for all of you ladies with a beautiful thick head of natural hair it 's best to take out every other row in the brush so that it doesnt feel like its ripping your hair out .
 This thing is amazing . I was worried that it would n't be a real Denman but this is n't a ripoff . I have shied away from these types of brushes in the past because they ripped my hair out , but the Denman is actually better than my wide toothed comb for detangling after I wash my hair . It 's also great for wrapping my hair at night . I 'll never use a regular brush again !
 ... Treat it kindly . Hair may not last as long as you do , so use good stuff . I have used these brushes for 30 + years and love them .
 I use this brush mostly to detangle my natural , African-American hair -LRB- type 4c -RRB- , along with conditioner . I love how it has made the detangling process easier overall . The only drawback I experienced is that cleaning the brush is not as easy as I 'd like - but it 's easier than all other brushes I 've used . : -RRB-
 This is a very nice brush , but a little large for my purposes . I purchased the Denman D3 -LRB- blue with crystals -RRB- and it was perfect ; however , this brush -LRB- the D4 -RRB- was cheaper . So I guess it 's a personal preference , but this is still an excellent brush nonetheless .
 This really is the best brush ever . It actually combs through my thick 4b hair . Deman always delivers the best quality . Dont heitate to buy .
 I Love this Brush!It wo n't cause breakage as other brushes do like the bristle boar brushes.I bought this brush at Sally 's about 2 months ago for a great price only $ 10 . I have nothing bad to say about this brush-its great for Detangling your hair-especially in the shower w/the use of conditioner : -RRB- The brush tends to Glide better through my hair , which is curly.I like the read cushion in the middle of the brush & the design of the brush seems like its going to last me a long time !
 This brush is by far the best brush for natural African American hair . I would recommend it to anyone . It is definitely worth the money !
 Very satisfied with this brush . I used to use Denman Brushes all the time back in the 60s and 70s , but they were eventually replaced with blow dryers , round brushes and flat irons . My hairdresser suggested I use this particular brush when blow drying my hair into a straight bob style . My hair has a slight natural wave and using the round brushes only seemed to make the problem worse and did n't straighten my hair . The Denman brush works miracles . I 'm surprised at how effective it is to style a bob haircut . Old things are new again , thanks to this old standby . I received the brush quickly from the vendor and was satisfied with the product , price and delivery .
 I absolutely love this brush !!! It works perfectly for back combing , and creating `` the bump '' or volume in your hair , even if it is fine like mine ! Would definatly recommend !!
 This brush is very well designed . It feels balanced in the hand and feels good on the scalp . It is extremly light weight for travelling . I recommend that everyone with hair has one .
 Great brush for long , thick hair . Small size makes it easy to slip into a purse , and these brushes are so easy to clean .
 This worked wonders with my grand daughter 's thigh length hair . It is very curly and hair combing time is usually very painful for both of us .
 I received my first Denman brush in 1976 . I love this brush ! I have very thick hair - this is the only brush I can use . Had to give my very expensive - once used , Mason Pearson brush -LRB- for thick hair ? -RRB- to a friend . I could n't get it through my mane . :-RRB- Amazon 's price compares to what the brush cost in the 70 's ! Ca n't say that about too many things .
 Thanks Amazon for being a reliable source for items that are so hard to find in stores . Like this brush . I 've used this brush in my teen years but when I moved to California , I just could n't find this in Target or other big box retailers .
 Love this brush ! I had been wanting to get this brush for a while n I finally got around to it . I must say this brush is great . It does n't pull your hair as much as regular hard brushes . Another nice thing about this brush is it has movable teeth which aids in detangling . Overall very impressed and the only rating that seemed right to give to this product is 5 stars . Also I must praise the seller as well . I received exactly what I paid for and VERY quickly . I recieved the brush TWO days after I paid for it . If you 're looking for a brush that wo n't pull out half your hair or make detangling a living nightmare invest in this brush !
 I needed a new , sturdy hairbrush and the ratings of this Denman cushion brush prompted me to order it . I 've had and used it about six months now and I have to say I 'm pleased and impressed . It 's really held up with frequent usage . My niece who can not stand to have her hair brushed says that this one hurts the least of all the household hairbrushes , so I 'm buying her one for her birthday . It 's easy to clean and a bargain at the price .
 I love this brush on slippery wet hair . Untangles the worst hair with minimal breakage . Better than any other brush I have tried . After every shampoo and deep conditioning , it 's a must have .
 I love Burmax line of products . It is an investment well worth the money . These brushes can be used for to detangle hair , smooth hair , as well as blow dry . I have 4 of these brushes and use them on my clients as well .
 This brush is great for hair brushing . I have thick , fine straight hair , and the bristles on this brush leave my hair smooth , soft and shiny . This is the only brush I 've owned where I wanted to brush my hair . It does n't look like much , but this is a quality product .
 Overall it is a nice brush . I like that there 's not little ball ends on the bristles that will fall off over time ... that was my problem in the past ... It seems that i will hold up pretty well too , which I 'm really happy about . I have pretty thick , long hair to mid back and it goes through just fine with it 's dry , but a little harder when it 's wet . Maybe I do n't have enough conditioner in my hair for it to go through smoothly idk ! I would recommend this brush if you want a quality brush .
 I 'm a doll on a budget & this brush works wonders & the price is well worth it . I 've been on my healthy hair journey / long hair journey & this brush helps to detangle my hair with pulling out a lot of hair . Thank you DenmanP.S . I have 3c hair with patches if 3b & 4a : -RRB-
 Love this brush ! Do n't have seventeen more words to describe this brush so , I will just say it again ... Love this brush !
 My daughter like her new denman styling brush for the affordable price & size is just right for her long hair . Good quality & highly recommended .
 Its a hairbrush that does the job . Its durable and comfortable . I 've used it daily for over a month and its still looks good as new . Worth the money .
 I purchased this brush basically because my neice ranted and raved about it . . so i purchased one ... . I have 4b tight curly hair ... . THIS BRUSH ROCKS ! it really brings out the curl pattern in my hair ... Who 'd ever think that something so simple looking could do what this brush does ... I apply my product to my hair and run the brush thru my hair a couple of times and i look like i have gorgeous curly shiny hair -LRB- well i guess i actually do have it if its on my head lol ! This brush is a miracle worker ... It even make those bushy spots in my hair curl up real pretty . Warning
 i just received this brush and used it 4 the first time and i must say it is the GREATEST ! if ur African-American with unprocessed hair or u have very thick curly hair this brush is a must have . it 's extremely sturdy and it does n't pull the hair out . i have bought several brushes over the past few years and not having any success . this is by far the best .
 I love this brush . It is so sturdy which makes it easy to detangle my thick curly hair . I highly recommend this brush .
 I have been wearing my natural hair for about 8 years now . I 've always used the kind of brushes that were used in my family growing up and saw every black person I knew using . However , after reading the wonderful book called The Science of Black Hair -LRB- a book every black person should own -RRB- , I realized that was the wrong kind of brush to use on black hair ; especially natural textured hair . This brush glides through my hair like butter baby ! I never thought a brush could do that with my type of hair , specifically NATURAl hair . I recommend every black woman who wears her hair natural to purchase this brush . You wo n't be disappointed and you 'll wonder where has this brush been all your life . I am still in disbelief at how wonderfull this brush works sometimes . A product maker that really knows how to make a quality product thats helpful NOT harmful -LRB- like most mainstream products -RRB- to black hair . Thanks !
 i have type 4a hair and im black . i prefer to use this brush after detangling my hair with the naturally curly detangle brush . after im done with that i can brush from root to tip with this brush with ease and without breakage . the bristles are extremely hard and dont move . this isnt the typical goody brush where the bristles move with the movement of brush . i also found that this brush is therapeutic as well . i have frequent tension headaches and brushing my scalp with this brush helps as well . my hair is only about off shoulders when i pull on it so im sure when my hair is really long using this brush will be even more beneficial . hope this helps ! * update 10/27/11 * - Well the bristles has soften up a bit . Its not as hard and stiff as it was before but still very useful . I did n't catch it before but you can pull the handle off and break the brush down into pieces to clean the bristles better . I was able to put it back together and not have it fall apart.This is still my favorite and most used brush .
 Pros - It glides through hair well
 The best brush I 've ever owned . Unlike a regular vent brush it does not destroy the ends of my curly bi-racial locks . And I 've noticed more waves in my hair after use .
 Before I purchased this brush , detangling my daughter 's hair was a total pain . Now , even she tells people the miracles of this brush . I thought the plastic bristles would get caught on our kinky hair , but it is the best detangler ever . Especially when I detangle with the conditioner in our hair . This brush makes quick work of tangles . Highly recommended by myself and my daughter !
 I initially purchased this brush when living in the UK , and it lasted me 6 years . Eventually the red rubbery part that holds everything together , tore . I love this brush and could n't find a replacement for it , when I tried substituting it with other brands , I found it just was n't the same quality . I was happy to find this on Amazon ! I have straight , fine hair , which gets static very easily , this brush does n't damage my hair when untangling it , and limits the static . Great brush .
 I 've been useing this brush for over 20 years and wo n't use any other brush . I have very long & thick hair and this is the only brush that goes through my hair so smoothly . Simply the best brush I 've ever used .
 I hardly ever leave reviews , but this brush is so exceptional that I have to spread the word . Whether I brush dry or wet it makes my course and semi-dry hair bouncy and shiny . I highly recommend brushing upside down with this for great volume . The detangling is also excellent . GET IT .
 I have n't had a good brush in a really long time . I found about about these from a YouTube lady , Foxylocksextensions . Her hair is so beautiful , soft and shiny looking , that I had to try this . Plus my hair needed a total revamp so getting a brush that was good for my hair is what I was looking for.The red padding is a silicon and helps with your hair to not frizz , which its great . I love the nylon teeth too.My boyfriend did n't like using it because he said that the teeth hurt his scalp . I do n't think this brush is meant to be raked against the scalp , its more of a styling brush . The way I observed Foxylocksextensions on YouTube use it was to tease her hair . Which it works nicely for that.It 's just a personal preference and has nothing to do with the quality of the product but it feels a little top heavy . The handle does n't feel very sturdy but it gives me no reason to think that its not a quality product .
 I have a LOT of hair , and on top of that it 's naturally curly and not manageable at all . Seriously , i 'm happy when i normally can go to the salon just to wash my hair because it takes so much on my hands doing it myself . I thought that maybe if i found the right brush , it would at least help me untangle the mess it always become simply by getting my hair wet , no amount of conditioner was helping.Not very lucky on my search though , as i kept finding those that the bristles will come off , or untangle my hair further because of the end shape . Then there were those that only brushed the top part of my hair , but not deeper to the scalp . The worst were those with the `` spongy '' part holding the bristles , because it would either tear up or come completely off on my hair knots . Sure i could have simply go back to using combs , but with so much hair , i would have to keep untangling for hours!I wish someone would have told me about this brush sooner . Seriously i have been using it constantly since i got it , and it takes less than 10 minutes , without even having to use a whole bottle of conditioner at its most tangled . I can safely go to the beach , or pool and not have to worry to death that it 'll take me hours to untangle my hair.What makes this brush so good ? * The bristles , which are strong enough for any hair , yet does n't hurt my scalp in the least . * It 's spaced enough between rows to make it easier , thereby faster to finish . * The part holding the bristles is made out of a `` spongy '' material i have never encountered on another brush . It makes it harder for that part to come off no matter how many knots you have . Yet it 's easy to pull it out when i want to clean the brush thoroughly .
 This hair brush arrived in a package like a Barbie doll , which makes you feel kind of special . The brush is sturdy and high quality . It 's also good because the nylon bristles are smooth and do n't have little tips at the end -LRB- like other brushes -RRB- that sometimes pull out your hair . However , I find the brush to be pretty stiff , and you truly should have thicker hair if you plan to buy this brush . I 'm rating it a 4 instead of 5 because I think the bristles are way too stiff .
 I had one like this when I was a kid , I 'm sure it was my step-sister 's who was quite spoiled.I 'm a 28 yearold man and I have long straight hair that goes halfway down my back -LRB- I look a bit like jesus sometimes lol -RRB- , and this brush works perfect for me and my girlfriend likes to steal it as well.Very efficient and gets the job done nicely . One thing to keep in mind though is that if you have a sensitive scalp the bristles on this brush are sharper then those round tipped ones found on many generic brushes , this works better , but could be painful if you are to heavy handed .
 I have very fine hait , so it 's hard to deal with it . But this brush helps me with any hair do : -RRB-
 The only reason I did n't give 5 stars is because the attachment/brush insert , keeps sliding up but other than that it does exactly what it should ; detangle thick , coarse hair with little to no breakage .
 Works perfectly.Just received mine in the mail today.I probably went over my head three or four times with the brush and it knocked 95 % of the tangles out.My hair was softer and easier to comb after using this brush.As long as they keep selling it I will be a lifetime customer of Denman brushes .
 This brush is known to everyone as a queen or king . :-RRB- It 's amazing . I wear extensions that are wavy and normal brushes from the store knocks out the waves , which is what I do not want to happen . I used my friends Denman and it knocks all kinks out of my hair yet return it to it 's wavy state . It does n't pull out my hair or anything , bounces right back . This Denman was cheaper than what was in the store and shipping was prompt ! Thanks 2 day shipping . : -RRB-
 It 's great for detangling curly hair . My husband has straight hair and also loves to use it to brush out his tangles .
 This is the bomb.com ! This makes detailing so much easier and I have less shedding and breakage ! I love my denman
 This is a good brush if you have long hair , especially if you tend to leave some hair in the brush . Because of the spacious rows , it is easy to clean , so your brush is as good as new every time you use it . It also massages your scalp , which promotes blood flow to the scalp .
 I 've been using a Denman brush like this since high school when a friend told me it was `` the only brush to use '' . They seem to be just as well made as years ago . It 's ideal for my hair and gets the tangles out easily . I owned one for 15 years and it took that long for it to show its age . The red base where the bristles are attached began to disintegrate somewhat on one brush I purchased a few years ago . It might have been from a hair product that I put into wet hair and brush in . So I 've taken to rinsing it afterward . The purse size that 's available is also a great brush .
 I had one of these that my girlfriend bought me in about 1978 that I carried in my travel bag and used every day until 2011 . Admittedly it was getting a bit beat up and finally it disappeared from my hotel room one day in Mexico . There in the morning , gone in the evening.I bought two of these and they are the same as my 1978 model , and perfect . Wo n't pull out your hair . Travels well . Ca n't recommend the sturdy construction highly enough.Watch out for those hotels in Mexico : -RRB-
 What can I say Denman is Legend , sure their are supposedly better brushes with boar hairs but they are over priced in my opinion and do n't work well with thick hair.this brush smooths the hair out detangles and styles the hair , its an amazing brush.I give it a 5 out of 5 because its the best brush I have ever owned and any one that comes over , uses it , loves it , buys it.I suggest you buy one .
 i luv this for detangling my hair . i am black and have natural hair that is a lil past my shoulders when it is down and it is very kinky and super thick -LRB- its like solange knowles afro but thicker and smaller curls lol -RRB- . . i have one issue the red part that holds the brisles keeps sliding out of the handle when its slick with product but its easy to slide back in just a nusance when ur in brush mode and have a rhythm going lol
 I 've always had large paddle brushes from the drugstore but it 's so hard to keep them clean . I heard about the Denman in a magazine ; it was recommended because it 's wide bristles avoid hair breakage . I thought I 'd give it a try and I love it ! It gently massages my scalp and runs though my long , medium-thickness hair easily . Plus it seems like it will be much easier to keep clean than my paddle brush .
 This brush is really good and it helps with my hair , but i was a bit disappointed when i received the shipping . The reason i was disappointed is bc it was smaller than i anticipated , and i have a lot of hair so one can see why that was annoying finding how small it was .
 The bristles are top notch , along with the rubber cushion that holds them . The plastic handle is now cheaply made , compared to a few years back . Still better than a store bought brush .
 I have mixed hair -LRB- ~ 3B/C -RRB- , and this brush is MAGNIFICENT . Better than anything else I 've ever used . It 's , like , LIFE CHANGING . I highly recommend it -LRB- especially for moms of kids with mixed hair , it 's very gentle and does n't snag -RRB- .
 Saw so many reviews on youtube for using this brush to define curls . I have to say I was not disappointed . The brush worked . I would recommend this product .
 This is a great brush . My daughter has extremely thick and unruly hair . She is 14 and style is at the top of her list . This has helped her manage and style her hair a great deal .
 I have super curly hair . Tight curls . This brush does help with detangling . I think because the bristles are so flexible , it does not hurt as much . Im very tender headed . I will buy again .
 Super durable and does n't rip at my coils ! Im transitioning and my hair is very fragile . But this brush gets through the tangles without ripping them out . Be gentle !
 This brush was awesome for my hair because I had no trouble detangling my super dense , coarse hair ! I recommended this to my friend and mom and they loved it ! 5 stars : -RRB-
 I 'm not even sure where I got this brush from , but it finally bit the dust after many years -LRB- the rubber finally failed and came apart -RRB- I tried two other brushes and hated them . I have very curly hair and they both felt like my scalp was ripping out . I did a search online and found my brush ! I 've ordered two of them so I have a backup .
 I like this brush a lot . It detangles hair well . The bristles feel like they are massaging my scalp . It 's sturdy and well made . It will last a while . I love Denman products . This is my 4th Denman brush .
 My dad has n't had his hair cut in 30 years . It 's thin and about mid-back length , and he 's very particular about what kind of brushes he uses . In the last few years these have been increasingly difficult to find . You can find a brush that looks very similar at the grocery store , but it 's not the same brush at all . The high quality rubber base holds the pins well , and the pins are made from a nice nylon . So this brush does n't build up static in his hair when he brushes it , and the pins are very smooth , no tugging or scratching.It 's worth the extra cost , as other reviewers have said , this is a brush that will last years . When you break it down , it 's a better deal to have a brush you really like that you can use for years then to buy a similar brush that will only last for a few months that costs half as much.I 'm very happy with this brush .
 I just love my brushes . Denman makes the finest brushes out there . They last forever and the price is very reasonable .
 I have been using this and other Denman brushes for decades and they are fantastic ... no static , brushes through tangles like a comb , great styling capabilities . Ca n't imagine using anything else !
 This is the best brush I have ever used . I have a thick head of hair and it works well to tame it . The reason I needed to buy an new brush is that my wife and son have appropriated my other Denman brushes . It is truly great especially if you get static electricity when you brush . The rubber base eliminates this problem . Just a great brush .
 This is the best brush for thick hair . Ca n't find equivalent in stores . Have used this brush since the 70 `` s !!!!
 This , too is an outstanding product , however it has become very difficult to find . I do n't know if it is being phased out or what , but I sure wish it was easier to find . Try it , you 'll like it !!
 Very good product and i apreciate this perfume because my family also like it and also my freinds thanks a lot .
 I apologize for the delay - was getting my son married , etc. and just on top of everything . The product is terrific . I was n't familiar with it - just wanted to try it . I 'll try more later .
 This productcan be useful as a calming holistic aromatherapy oil after bathing and it can also be used to enhance any perfume . It is appealing and soothing .
 We all know what these are and usually take a few home from the restaurant . I bought this box of 1000 and divided them up into plastic baggies to keep in the cars . Great for traveling with kids or messy husbands .
 OPI and Essie are , in my opinion , the best nail polish brands out there . OPI is easy to apply and is pretty long-lasting , at least as far as nail polish goes . The best thing about OPI is the insane amount of colors that are offered . OPI has about five million shades of red , tons of crazy colors , shades that include glitter and sparkles , special edition polishes with entertainment tie-ins -LRB- `` Glee , '' `` Pirates of the Caribbean '' -RRB- , etc. . For me , who generally prefers more traditional shades , I value the quality of the product above all else . It 's much better than some of the cheaper brands out there . I also love the clever names of the colors . My favorite shades are Altar Ego -LRB- light pink with glints of bluish lavender -RRB- , Bogota Blackberry -LRB- deep glimmering red -RRB- , and Didgeridoo Your Nails -LRB- shimmering deep pink , my favorite pedicure polish for spring/summer -RRB- . If you are a nail polish addict , you can easily spend a LOT of money on OPI products , so consider yourself warned !
 First of all , OPI is my favorite brand of nail polish . `` Over the Taupe '' is an amazing shade that can be worn with any outfit . I also love shopping at Amazon .
 I used this polish over a french manicure for my wedding . It was absolutely beautiful ! It made my nails shimmer in the low lighting , and was sheer enough -LRB- just one coat -RRB- not to cover the elegance of the french manicure . I love it !
 Love this nail polish , good ceverage , long lasting and great color for summer ! Nice & shimmery .
 Being as though Im a nail polish junkee this color was the perfect color to add to my nail polish display and the color is super bright so Im very pleased and the product was shipped fast and it came bubble wrapped and packaged nicely ...
 Arrived in a timely fashion and the color is to die for . It makes the cut for my top 3 red polishes .
 I love this shade and it wears and looks GREAT ------ when I have pedicures , I want a polish which goes with everything and looks good with everything and this does . I have had a lot of compliments on this color .
 Really love this color , wish it was still offered in the gelcolor line.OPI is always my go to polish and this was no exception .
 Item was lost in transit and they replaced it immediately ... best price ... best service . What 's not to like ? I highly recommend dealing with Big Bang Beauty !
 Come on - it is nail polish !! All I can say is that it is a really pretty color to wear in the summer .
 I have been hunting for this color for a very long time . A lot of stores had told me that his color was discontinued by OPI . Leave it to amazon to never let me down . I love this color . It 's a light pink color with a little bit of glitter . It sure knows how to make any girl feel like a Princess .
 I first got exposed to this color when I get a manicure a few months ago . I choose it on a whim , but was surprised with how much I ended up loving it ! I loved it so much , I tracked it down on the internet and bought two so that I would n't run out any time soon!The color is light pink with micro glitter in it . The bottle will look alarmingly pink when you look at it , but as long as you apply a couple layers of thin coats , it wo n't be over-bearing ! In my opinion , this is the perfect polish !
 Love the color -LRB- slightly irredescent -RRB- yet subtle enough for me to wear at my wedding . Stays on for a long time -- I love it !
 I love this color in particular . It seems to have a burnt or brown hue to it to me and I really like that . It blends well with a new sweater I have that is a bali red color . I am presently wearing it and think it looks great .
 This blue is not too dark and not too light . It was one color I was glad I found and could add to my OPI polish collection , which is my favorite polish . It arrived quickly and I love the color as much as I thought I would !
 My daughter is a fan of OPI nail polish ... I was so happy to see the big selection you had online ! Thanks !!
 OPI makes awesome polish . Period . This color is light , easy to wear with just about anything and my favorite color for everyday . It is office perfect , date perfect , activity perfect .
 This is a beautiful rich shimmering color . I included a photo of my nails . I would say the color is chocolate with a reddish shimmer . I was hesitant to get this color when I saw it described because I thought it would be muddy but far from it . A nice change from traditional reds . This is definitely one of my favorites from Opi .
 If you 're the least bit tanned , this is THE summer shade for toes in sandals . Of course , it will clash with some things you wear , but hey - this is FUN !
 This color is fabulous . It is a rich , deep , chocolate brown . It has an awesome shine . I think this is the best winter color I 've seen . It is almost like having velvet on your finger . Yep , Romeo and Joliet is to die for ! I highly recommend this color . The product also last a long time .
 good color , just a lot more brown than excepted but still love it . gotten many complements .
 Just an awesome shade of blue . I get lots of compliments when I wear it ! Great color to add to your collection .
 OPI quality is consistent and this color is perfect for business - not flashy , just clean looking .
 Atomic Orange is my very favorite summertime color for my toenails . The only reason I gave it a 4 is my bottle was thick . I suspect the Amazon vendor had this product for a long time . I had to buy thinner to thin it out . I think I might stick to buying local at a salon in the future to avoid getting old product . Love O.P.I. though ... my favorite polish .
 i really like this nail polish - it 's really sparkly , but not in a tacky way ; it reminds me of something a sophisticated princess might wear . And you know how some sparkly polish feels rough because the sparkles are too big ? this is not like that ; its smooth to the touch and i just love my nails in this . I have already gotten compliments on my nails from guys.Its more of a silvery pink polish , and a bit sheer - you might want to wear a solid pink under it , tho i like it all by itself - very pretty .
 The pic doesnt do it justice . It has little shiny crystals/flakes in the polish and is just `` to die for . '' It does n't look like chunks of glitter , it is just very `` sparkly '' . The pink color is perfect and it goes on smooth just like all OPI products . I love this color and I love OPI .
 A beautiful deep brown , mahogany loveliness . It is smooth , iridescent and sophisicated . Today is the first time I have ever used this color and I must say I am throughly satisfied , I can not stop looking at my nails . I loved this color so much the first thing I did after my manicure was go home and log onto Amazon.com to search for this color and purchase it togg add it to my personal nail polish collection.I can not yet comment on the wear and tear of this polish yet until further wear . I will post another responsein one week from today in regards to the wear of this product but until then I remain a satisified customer . If you want a change , want a sophisticated look I highly recommend this color. : -RRB-
 Love this color . I wear it everyday . My nails are short and this color looks good . OPI seems to chip easily - only con .
 This color is extremely classy and works well for both winter and summer . OPI also has a great quality of polish , making it especially long-lasting . If it were a little bit cheaper , it would be perfect .
 ` Princesses Rule ' is my favorite Opi nail polish . Like all of the Opi polishes this goes on very smoothly and looks fabulous . It has a nice sheen , some sparkles , but not bright nor glaring . This is a very sophisticated color.At first glance , you are unable to ascertain if there is any type of sparkle at all in this polish . It is very subtle , shiny with a slight fluorescence . The pink is light but covers all imperfections well . Iuse an Opi clear base and then apply two coats of this polish . I finish with a long wearing cover . The manicure will last up to ten days . I find the polish is sturdy . With the sparkle that is advertised , you might think it would be difficult to remove the polish . No , the polish comes off as easily as any other polish when you are ready for a change . This polish does not smudge nor run . It is an all around perfect nail polish.Highly Recommended . prisrob 08-05-12OPI Natural Nail Base Coat , 0.5-Fluid OunceOPI Best of the Best - 10pc limited edition mini lacquer collectionOPI Nail Envy Natural Nail Strengthener , 0.5-Fluid Ounce
 This is one of my favorite colors . I 'm glad I was able to get it through this vendor as I do n't think OPI sells it any more .
 I recently purchased the Atomic Orange polish made by OPI and I could not be more pleased with it.The color is just what you would expect based on the name . I have been searching for the perfect orange polish for a long time - I had an orange polish I loved years ago and when it ran out I could n't find anything similar . This is even better than that original polish.I love how bright this color is , it 's great for the summertime . And of course the quality is what you would expect from OPI . A great product all around .
 We love the atomic orange - it needs 3 coats for full coverage . It 's a bright -LRB- not neon -RRB- summery , melon-y orange color . It 's been a week and it 's still not chipped .
 Atomic Orange is the perfect name for polish.I originaly bought this to wear for halloween but it leans too cool more melon like , i do like the polish i think i will wait till summer to wear it as it is very bright almost neon .
 Great color for a professional environment , or anytime really ! Light , but with just the right amount of color and sparkle .
 I first bought this nail polish last year because I had gotten it put on at a nail salon and loved it . When I ran out , I bought another bottle . It 's a nice color , goes on smoothly and easily , and seems to last a long time without chipping . I have had problems with other products changing color and consistency over time and being difficult to put on -LRB- too thick or sticky -RRB- but never with this product . And I love the way it looks on , especially on my toenails .
 I love love LOVE this polish-it is sparkly , pink and sheer . I was looking for a light color to wear because I was tired of all the blues , reds and yellows that I wear . This is perfect . If you wear a topcoat over it , it will not chip . I have mostly have good luck with OPI and will continue to buy this brand of polish .
 I am usually a neon colors sort of girl , but this color changed me permanently . I felt a little conservative when I first put it on , but I could n't stop looking at my nails and got compliments all day .
 I like the product quality and its easy to apply . The color is tinted pink . One coat just looks slightly pink tinted but has a ton of glitter . Its perfect for kids and teens . Maybe early 20s , but its way too sparkly to wear if you are in your 30s or 40s . Keep that in mind or wear it on your toes .
 I loved the product , I saw it at a nail salon and it was perfect for me and it looked great for when I go out Thank you again .
 This polish is very high quality . One coat is fine but two coats of this polish just puts ` icing on the cake ' . The actual color of this polish is deeper than pictured -LRB- I uploaded a pic -RRB- . Its more like a Bordeaux or Burgundy . It 's highly metalic/glittery and perfect for a glamorous night out on the town.I have n't had any problem with uneven coverage .
 This OPI polish has just the right amount of peachy melon color and shimmer for nights out or events . Not overbearing .
 I am very happy with this polish . The formula glides on very smoothly and evenly , which is great and hassle-free . The color is described as `` tomato red , '' which I do n't think is inaccurate , but I might call it more classic red . It 's very `` pinup-esque . ''
 Love this lip gloss ! Tried it after reading about it in a fashion book & it is perfect for that nude lip look without being too pale or sheer . I especially love to wear it with nude colored lipstick underneath . The clicking twist up dispenser is kind of annoying but not that big of a bother so 5 stars !
 This is a great Mens face lotion . It makes the skin on my face smooth and soft . I always feel better after putting it on in the morning . There is a very slight scent to it that I can only smell while putting it on . It 's not strong enough for anyone else to smell post application . I 've never had it run into my eyes and cause irritation when I 've sweat or gone swimming after use .
 SO if you spend any time outside while working and are at all concerned about ageing super fast , get this . Feels nice and clean and absorbs into the skin pretty quickly . I use every morning before I head to work and my girlfriend has noticed the difference within 2 weeks .
 i love it and the price is cheaper , i will buy it next time , i wish the shipper will be faster next time .
 Not bad , it looks new , as same as the picture , and the price is as good as I bought before .
 This is a great firming , moisturizer for a guy in a rush . I have n't noticed a difference in the dark under my eyes , but have noticed firmer , moister skin which others have noticed too . I extend it from under my eyes to my forehead as it is for the whole face . I read about this in a magazine and it definitely has meet my expectations .
 Have used this produc over one year and my skin on the face has tighten up and most of my wrinkles have asmoothed out . The price from Amazon is great too !
 It 's not greasy , I like it very much!I also like their cleanser quite a bit but for an exfoliator I use Biotherme which I like .
 I could feel the difference right away.three days after starting to use , my wife commented on how face face looked different.less wrinkles.I did n't tell her I had purchased this.Lasts all day.not expensive and who does n't want to look younger & better ?
 My sister raved about the Revitalift line so I tried the men 's stuff . Not two weeks later she 's commenting on my jawline and eyes looking better . I thought it was in my head . I 've ordered the rest of the line . Until they make a hand cream , I 'm putting one in my glovebox .
 I noticed an improvement to my skin almost immediately . I have tried MANY EXPENSIVE men 's skin products and L'Oreal 's Men 's line beats them all!I have been applying this in the evening . I shave each morning in the shower and am prone to razor irritation , bumps and ingrown hairs . My entire face looks and feels better since I have been using this , especially the areas where I shave - smoother , less irritations , better shave . I have also been using L'Oreal 's Men 's Expert After Shave Balm each morning . Really love these products , especially for the $ .
 I use a C-Pap machine at night and it leaves me with horrible lines in the morning just a few dabs of vitalift and there gone plus it has really helped firm up my facial skin , I never thought I would be using face cream but I had to do something all the girls at work had comments on my face lines so i saw this on the shelf at the commisary , So I said well lets see and WOW I was amazed . the container lasted about 6 months using it once a day so when I ran out I looked to the local chain drugstores for more . No where to be found and when i asked the sales girl 's what it was I needed they looked at me like I had grown a second head , It is without a doubt a great product for men Just get over it and use it .
 I have n't ordered this item from this non-Amazon on-line supplier , so keep that in mind . I have purchased this product locally at a grocery store -LRB- new/fresh product -RRB- . It really works great !!! First , you do n't need much -LRB- especially if you tend to get oily skin -RRB- . Thus , the reason the product is so small . Just smooth a small amount over your face -LRB- maybe add a little more to problem areas -RRB- . With regular use , you should notice wrinkles smooth out over time -LRB- I know I have in a short time -RRB- . Also , I noticed a benefit of fading dark spots on my skin -LRB- i.e. , freckles or age spots from sun exposure -RRB- and it helps with the occasional blemish too . It probably has to do with the Pro-Retinol formula -LRB- which is like a really light version of Retin-A without all the redness/skin irritation of Retin-A -RRB- . Probably the best thing is to use the version without the sunscreen at night before going to bed . Then , during the day use this verion with the sunscreen -LRB- but only SPF 15 , so not too much protection - but good for normal day-to-day sun exposure -RRB- . I think this Men 's product by L'Oreal is worth the money for sure and you get multiple benefits in just one purchase . A great deal for all that help ...
 My guy loves the non-greasy yet ultra moisturizing effect of this brand . He also says he loves the scent . I enjoy it too because it 's not overpowering and does n't smell like cologne . It 's a bit hard to find in stores for some reason so we get it here on Amazon . He likes the scent so much more than other male-geared products that he wo n't settle for anything else that he can find on store shelves .
 Good price on a product that at the very least does a great job of moisturizing . As for the anti-wrinkle claim I ca n't say anything positive or negative . Makes your skin feel good all day long .
 I like that this does n't smell . It 's not perfumed . One pump is enough for my whole face . I actually had someone at work ask what I was doing different because my skin looked so good .
 I 've used several different lines of men 's skin products and for the value I think L'Oreal is the winner . When people start mentioning how good your skin looks you know you 're on to something good . I do n't find it greasy at all and my skin absorbs it well . I also like their cleanser quite a bit but for an exfoliator I use Biotherme which I like . I may not look ten years younger but I look good for my age and that 's a good thing !
 I tried this product a few months ago because I have stress `` wrinkles '' on my forehead . I 'm only about 25 years old , and they are n't that bad , but they still bugged me . Over the past few months I saw the lines on my forehead slowly start to fade away , and it also did wonders on my face after I shaved . I used to have minor acne before using this product , but that , as wells as razor burn is no more . I use it once a day after I shave , but it does recommend using it twice a day .
 I have been told I have great skin for my age 57 , but I felt like I would like to try some cream to moisturize and this is great . Very little oder . but pleasant . The biggest like is it is very smooth and non greasy . It just fells great and so far my face feels great and firmer . I suggest this product for a mans first try .
 What more could you need ? It goes on easily , is non-greasy and light , yet stops nasty dryness all day . If you suffer from too much sebum though , could get a little slick later on in the day .
 If your looking for a good product , with a medium masculine fraquence this is the product for you . It has a fragence , not overly manly , but not feminine . The Amazon descriptions above conflict themselves with wether or not SPF is in the product . I recommend the non-SPF product unless you spend a lot of time in the sun from 10-4 , which I do not . Recent studies say too much SPF can deprive you of Vitamin D . So a little sun on the commute at 8am and 5pm is n't a concern for me . As well the SPF material irritate my eyes . I would not buy this if it had SPF . It takes very little product to cover my face , and the 1.6 fl oz container lasted me 6 months . It took me a long time on Walgreens and Target to find a decent product that was n't over-hyped and a recent visit to Walgreens showed the product was gone . So I am very happy to find it here , and hope it gets back in these stores . I have young childer , and those are the stores we frequent .
 Many have commented previously , -LRB- like it or otherwise -RRB- the scent is something that is going to be first thing you will notice . My suspicion is they just repackaged the women 's version of their similar product with some minor modifications . Having said that it should n't detract from what the product claims - and it is also less greasy than Neutrogena . Use sparingly and the smell will not be too much of an issue .
 This moisturizer is extremely thick when you pump it out . Some difficulty in applying and absorbing into the skin . Facial skin feels heavy once the product dries . However it does tighten and `` fill '' the small wrinkles and lines . I wish it were tinted because my skins looks pale once the moisturizer has dried . Easy to use and affordable .
 I 've used multiple mens moisturizing lotions over the years - some very expensive and some like Neutrogena inexpensive . After two months I 'm very impressed with this product . It has more of the active ingredients that actually help with anti-wrinkling and is cheaper than Neutrogena . I read a lot about the fragrance but it has n't been an issue for me . I 'd recommend this product to anyone looking for a good quality mens moisturizer .
 I read a few reviews and decided to check this stuff out . Nice , light , face cream , that does n't cause breakouts , is n't shiny , and seems to help with the signs of aging - especially right around the eyes . Nice container that squeezes out just the right amount of cream . No more fussing with squeezing tubes . The price is very reasonable and offers good results . I recommend it .
 My biggest issue with most moisturizers is the way they make my face shiny . This product does n't do that . It absorbs quickly and seems to keep my face moisturized all day . It does have a very strong fragrance , however . It dissipates within fifteen minutes of applying , so you do n't smell like it all day , but it is strong and noticeable upon application . Some people might find it bothersome , but for me , having a shine free face is worth putting up with the fragrance for fifteen minutes .
 It smells good . It 's just right for a young adult ! Or young boy ! Bought it as christmas presents for my husband 's nephews and it 's just right
 This productcan be useful as a calming holistic aromatherapy oil after bathing and it can also be used to enhance any perfume . It is appealing and soothing .
 I have used this Loreal for Men line for about a year now , and I really like it . It is n't ridiculously expensive like some of the goo out there , it smells really good , and it is ` for men ' , which can be hard to find.One this I do n't like about this line of products is that they never stay the same ! I used a very similar Loreal for Men moisturizer before this -- in the same type tube , the same colors and everything , and a very similar fragrance , only named something slightly different . I liked that stuff too , but when I went to get more , it was no longer available . That 's when I got this stuff , which is just as good it seems.All in all , good stuff this . If your a dude and want a simple , effective , and inexpensive moisturizer for after you washa you face , then this is it ; - -RSB-
 I think this product is great . I use it all the time.To the last guy 's review , that 's really weird I 've never had a problem with amazon.com and have been using it since its been around almost . Did you actually try talking to customer service , patience is a virtue I 'm sure if you actually contacted them they would deal with your problem .
 This stuff is just great as a facial moisturizer . It is not greasy or heavy at all . The scent is also mild , no irritating bouquets as it were . Ashame I ca n't seem to find it in stores any more-so thank you Amazon !
 Stila Lip Glaze is perfect for a shiny yet moisturizing lip glaze . I just wish it was n't so expensive . The taste is n't all that great and I 'm not sure why there are some complaints about the way the tube works . You just turn the bottom of the tube , wait about ten seconds for the glaze to start coming up , and then brush on your lips . I keep looking for a cheaper alternative but I have n't found one yet ...
 Love the Stila brand & this color is fantastic ! Does n't try out ur lips & there is minimal flavor -LRB- which is great -RRB-
 I love Stila Lip Glaze ; it 's been my product of choice for several years now . It 's thick enough to make a difference when you have it on , but I love that Vanilla adds a nude shimmer to my lips without the fake-looking pink or red tint that I 've seen with some lip glosses . To each her own .
 This has staying power ! Not the revlon 8 hr type , just nice , thickens to your likeness and just a bit goes a long way . I love the sheer intensity of the color , and Amazon has it for a great price . It also does n't have that weird artificial flavor or smell that some glosses have which is always nice .
 I found out about stila cause my grandmothers friend used it.I was shocked when I saw the price but this seller had a cheaper one on sale . I bought grapefruit . It 's not the color for me cause its just like my natural lip color maybe lighter . There was another I wanted but before I could buy it it went out of stock . I think it would 've been a better color for me.Initially it took 10-15 + clicks to get it started . It takes about 5 clicks to get anything out for me now . I 'll admit I expected it to have more in it but you do n't need to use very much . It 's a lil gooey if you get to much.I would recommend this to anyone who wants a quality lip gloss.I 'll be posting pictures so be sure to check them out ! : -RRB-
 This is one of my beauty must haves . I am allergic to Chapstick and Vaseline and I can actually use this all day and everyday ! No matter how chapped my lips are this makes them so smooth ! Plus it tastes really good ! This is my favorite out of the Stila line . -LRB- I own like 10 colors -RRB- It is n't sticky or gooey and is so moisturizing ! This came new in the box and arrived in 2 days ! Once you try this you will be hooked like I am ! Plus I am usually allergic to ALOT of products and I am so happy I can use this !!
 Vanilla and Brown SugarA grown-up version of your favorite teenage gloss.it 's sticky so that may turn off some people , but I love it.pumped up , glossy , sexy lips , with a yummy flavor.the wand is like a click pen and the gloss is applied with a brush for control.I admit I am a bit addicted!What 's not to love ???
 I have been using camille beckman 's lotion for years -- paying outrageous retail prices , when I was even lucky enough to locate it . Buying it from Amazon , even including the shipping , saved money and it arrived quickly . Also , the fragrance seemed fresher than the usual . I was very impressed and will order the lotion through Amazon from now on .
 Camille Beckman products are the best I 've ever used , and that 's a lot since I 'm fifty-eight years old . After using this body cream my skin feels like pure silk . I 've always had a problem with dry , rough feet . Now they are as soft as a baby 's bottom . The scent of these products are wonderful . I could go on all day about Camille Beckman . Do n't be afraid to try it , just be prepared to get hooked .
 Camille Beckman lotion is great . I have sensitive skin and this is by far the best lotion I have ever used.Highly recommend it .
 My wife has dry skin and after discovering this product has continued to buy it . That is high praise , indeed .
 The best lotion I ever used !! Makes your skin soft , smooth and silky !!! Not greasy at all ! Love it !!! Delivered fast and the price was great too !!!!
 I purchaced some of this at the warehouse a year ago . The lotion is so intense that the bottle lasted an entire year . I absolutely love it !
 I love the scent of roses , and yet , I hate the feel of a heavy cream on my skin . This glycerine and rosewater body cream is so light that it melts right into your skin . And the 16 oz . size for this price is a very good deal as it lasts a very long time . Camille Beckman 16 Oz . Silky Body Cream , Glycerine Rosewater
 This cream is so silky and smooth . Your skin just soaks it in with no oilyness whatsoever !! I love the smell . Its just simply tasteful ...
 My mom does n't have internet access and can no longer find this product in the area where she lives . I order it for her from Amazon . She swears by this body cream . It seems like she ca n't live without it , since I order it a few times a year . I do n't use it myself , but I 'm guessing it 's good stuff .
 Camille Beckman 's line is one of the best kept secrets in the world of people with amazing skin . Her scents are heavenly , light and clean . I 'm addicted to the parifin hand cream . It leaves your hands feeling silky , not a hint of grease . Feels more like talc but the parifin seals the moisture in . Her body lotion is light and luscious and more effective than products I 've spent 5 times more on . The talc is cooling and fragrant . My scent of choice is Gardenia Breeze , but it took me over an hour in a shop to decide . They 're all delicious . I 've been using Camille Beckman for 10 years and I love it .
 Received product quickly and safely . Will order products I ca n't find . Prefer this over driving all over city to find what I like .
 I recently purchased the # 25 hand cream and loved it . I was n't sure how this would smell , or feel , or work . I googled all the Beckman fragrances . This had notes of others I usually enjoy . I was not disappointed . This is creamy without being in a jar -LRB- the pump keeps it from getting under my nails -RRB- , it is very moisturizing , and the smell is n't too overbearing . I am very happy . For the price , 16oz should last a long time . I will be buying again and trying more fragrance options .
 I really like this lotion . I have had the worst winter ever with dry itchyskin . I was even scratching in my sleep . Nothing helped . I read about vitamin e being beneficial and a search turned up this lotion . I bought a small one and have ordered two large ones since then . It absorbs like magic and my skin is improving . No sticky feeling that makes you wait to get dressed . It is a wonderful lotion !
 Feels really great on the skin . The only issue I have with it is that it has methylparaben and propylparaben , preservatives that are estrogen mimicking and might be something that women who have/have had breast cancer might want to avoid . They are n't listed in the ingredients in the Amazon product description but all 35 ingredients -LRB- most of them natural extracts -RRB- are listed on the product bottle .
 I love all Camille Beckman products . This is a thicker cream than other body creams so it is not running down my leg as I try to rub it in .
 Oriental Spice is by far my favorite scent . I really like this lotion and have been using it for years .
 All the glowing reviews were right ! This is the richest lotion I think I 've ever used , but it also absorbs into the skin quickly and leaves my skin feeling very soft . My daughter -- who usually dislikes body lotion because of the slippery feeling some of them leave on your skin for a few minutes -- really loves this . I wish the vanilla smell lasted longer , but I guess it 's hard to have something fast-absoring and with a lasting fragrance .
 just makes you feel wonderful . Smooths on easily . Has a delicate fragrance . enjoyed especially by young adults , middle-aged women who do n't mind spending a little more for a fine body lotion .
 This is an excellent product . Smells so good . I love it . The shipping was very fast . The customer is very reliable . Great price for this product . I am a returning customer . I always buy from Amazon when I can .
 If you like fresh vanilla - and the feel of silky skin , then I recommend this yummy smell and feel of this lotion !
 I absolutely love this body cream ! The scent is refreshing yet subtle and lasts all day . I have been unable to find this particular scent in the store but have had great success finding it here on Amazon . I definitely recommend this product .
 My husband put this in my Christmas stocking . I used to be able to buy it locally but the shop went out of business so I was very happy to receive this wonderful lotion .
 I absolutely love this lotion . My grandma used it , my mom used it , I use it , and someday MY children will use it . It is an amazing product that not only leaves my skin silky smooth but also has the perks of being handmade in America ! When I called to find out where to buy it since the store I usually buy from went out of business they told me they only sell via their themselves and through locally owned gift shops in order to support the local business community . By far the best lotions I have ever tried ... I will be back to order more soon ! Good choice Amazon!ps - love the Tuscan honey fragrance !!
 Dudes like a good shampoo that smells great , leaves hair clean and undamaged ... and of course , comes in a bottle that will last them forever . This is the one that meets all of that for me . I am totally easy though , so I 'll use anything that works well in small quantities and smells good .
 Garnier Fructis shampoo does great for my hair . Garnier shampoo makes my hair nice and soft . Garnier is a better brand for hair products then some other brands . My favorite brand is Garnier for hair products . I love the smell it makes my hair smell good . Garnier shampoo is worth your money you 'll be satisfied with your hair after using Garnier .
 Stila Lip Glaze is perfect for a shiny yet moisturizing lip glaze . I just wish it was n't so expensive . The taste is n't all that great and I 'm not sure why there are some complaints about the way the tube works . You just turn the bottom of the tube , wait about ten seconds for the glaze to start coming up , and then brush on your lips . I keep looking for a cheaper alternative but I have n't found one yet ...

 Vanilla and Brown SugarA grown-up version of your favorite teenage gloss.it 's sticky so that may turn off some people , but I love it.pumped up , glossy , sexy lips , with a yummy flavor.the wand is like a click pen and the gloss is applied with a brush for control.I admit I am a bit addicted!What 's not to love ???
 I 've used this cream since it came out sometime around 2001 . It 's the only product that works ... and I mean really works.Neutrogena never released a comparable product so now I 'm still trying to snap up tubes of it when I can find it.I found one not too long ago . . for $ 99 . So , needless to say , I 'm still searching and refusing to buy any more Neutrogena products until they bring either this product or a very similar one back to market ... they 've lost a 10 + year customer .
 I used it years ago when it was `` new '' . But then I strayed to other brands . None worked quite the same . Came back to find it is hard to find and rather expensive , but worth it !!!
 This product is absolutely amazing . I have been using it for about 2 years now , and ca n't say enough good things . It really does minimize pores , and it keeps my skin hydrated all day . It does n't have the peeling effect that a lot of products with Retinol have . My face was a little red at first , but after a few uses , it calmed down to normal . I 've actually been asked if I had Botox , and all I could think of was that this was doing the trick !
 You know , for the price , this is just an awesome product . If your hair is as dry as mine but you do n't want a pricey product , this will do a great job . We use these shampoos daily and just love them . My husband just wants me to buy these Garnier shampoos now and forget the more expensive varieties . This particular version keeps my hair very soft and silky , but does n't weigh it down and make it stick to my head . I just love it and am very glad I found this product . The price is certainly great !
 Stila Lip Glaze is perfect for a shiny yet moisturizing lip glaze . I just wish it was n't so expensive . The taste is n't all that great and I 'm not sure why there are some complaints about the way the tube works . You just turn the bottom of the tube , wait about ten seconds for the glaze to start coming up , and then brush on your lips . I keep looking for a cheaper alternative but I have n't found one yet ...
 Love the Stila brand & this color is fantastic ! Does n't try out ur lips & there is minimal flavor -LRB- which is great -RRB-
 I love Stila Lip Glaze ; it 's been my product of choice for several years now . It 's thick enough to make a difference when you have it on , but I love that Vanilla adds a nude shimmer to my lips without the fake-looking pink or red tint that I 've seen with some lip glosses . To each her own .
 This has staying power ! Not the revlon 8 hr type , just nice , thickens to your likeness and just a bit goes a long way . I love the sheer intensity of the color , and Amazon has it for a great price . It also does n't have that weird artificial flavor or smell that some glosses have which is always nice .
 I found out about stila cause my grandmothers friend used it.I was shocked when I saw the price but this seller had a cheaper one on sale . I bought grapefruit . It 's not the color for me cause its just like my natural lip color maybe lighter . There was another I wanted but before I could buy it it went out of stock . I think it would 've been a better color for me.Initially it took 10-15 + clicks to get it started . It takes about 5 clicks to get anything out for me now . I 'll admit I expected it to have more in it but you do n't need to use very much . It 's a lil gooey if you get to much.I would recommend this to anyone who wants a quality lip gloss.I 'll be posting pictures so be sure to check them out ! : -RRB-
 This is one of my beauty must haves . I am allergic to Chapstick and Vaseline and I can actually use this all day and everyday ! No matter how chapped my lips are this makes them so smooth ! Plus it tastes really good ! This is my favorite out of the Stila line . -LRB- I own like 10 colors -RRB- It is n't sticky or gooey and is so moisturizing ! This came new in the box and arrived in 2 days ! Once you try this you will be hooked like I am ! Plus I am usually allergic to ALOT of products and I am so happy I can use this !!
 Vanilla and Brown SugarA grown-up version of your favorite teenage gloss.it 's sticky so that may turn off some people , but I love it.pumped up , glossy , sexy lips , with a yummy flavor.the wand is like a click pen and the gloss is applied with a brush for control.I admit I am a bit addicted!What 's not to love ???
 For clean , clear skin in a few seconds when you 're too tired to go into the bathroom and wash your face with soap and water and a washcloth and a towel all that jazz -LRB- nice when you have roommates and do n't want to have to put on something `` decent '' to go down the hall to do this , too -RRB- . Saved me a million ! times from going to bed without makeup on or a as a quick fix to help me get out the door quickly . Natural , gentle . They get my combination skin -LRB- sensitive too -RRB- clean fast and have never , ever , ever , ever irritated my skin or caused a problem . When I 'm richer someday , I 'll buy stock . I even used these while taking a variety of medications that make skin more sensitive . Also , they moisturize but are totally non-oily and non-comedogenic . This is not a fixed review . I 'm just a girl who loves this product . FYI .
 Love it . Does not dry your hair . Does not flatten your hair it keeps body in your hair . I Recommend this product .
 Neutrogena products have always given me some of my most consistent results through continued use . This is no different . I wash my face with the scrub in the morning and unless I have a really rough day , I do n't need to wash my face again until the next day . It 's helped clear up quite a bit of my adult blemishes and acne for the last year and a half . It 's also gentle enough that I can still use it if I have a minor abrasion or anything like that , too . The lack of oil helps keep my skin from feeling too dry as well.Aside from the wash , I use australian tea tree oil to help control acne as well as heal wounds-100 % Australian Tea Tree Oil + FREE Tea Tree Oil Soap Bars . Where the wash is more preventative , the tea tree oil really helps after your skin 's already been affected by blemishes . I can use it on my face , if I get cut shaving , etc. . It helps eliminate the possibility of infection and repairs the skin . Between the Neutrogena and the tea tree oil , my breakouts are at a minimum .
 I 've used a large variety of face wash brands over the past 15 or so years . I 've been using this Neutrogena Daily Scrub for about two years now and find that it 's the best scrub I 've ever used . I like scrubs better than regular face wash because I feel the microbeads clean your face better . The scent is nice and neutral -LRB- not girly -RRB- . And the price is very reasonable considering one bottle will last you a long time .
 I have used it for more than 2 weeks now . My breakouts are almost gone , and skin feels much better . I only use it at night to avoid dryness . I use Neutrogena deep clean in the morning and also use Neutrogena 3-1 Acne treatment twice a day . I think I will keep using these products .
 It really wakes me up and leaves my skin smooth ! its a really great exfoliater
 I have always had acne and I have tried everything to get rid of it
 I had problems with my skin since I was 13 or 14 . Nothing really works , treatments , pills , whatever , untill I finally found the solution : daily skin rutines . Part of this rutines and I will say the most important part is the soap that you use in your skin . In my case I can not use any soap I need a gel or a foam , something really special , because my skin is very sensitive . I try a lot of products and only a few really work.And this is one of them . The reason why I like this scrub is that the scrub is very soft you do n't even feel it but the skin feel it , and after a few days my horrible red and black points start to dissapear the people really notice.Sadly for me I will have to be atteched to this kind of products for a long time but definitly neutrogena has always been my first option -LRB- only a few times second and this is mostly because in the country that I am they do n't have it or they do n't have the Neutrogena product that I search . -RRB- to buy products for my face ...
 I like this daily-face cleaner because it 's not too strong and gives you a fresh feeling while using it . Remind me a bit of menthol . Strongly recommend !
 i have been having acne problems on my face which is why i decided to try this out . i am extremely impressed just after a few days . i use it in the morning when i shower and less than a week after using i have noticed much clearer looking skin which i am extremely pleased with . i would deff recommend this to anyone looking for a daily scrub !
 I have been buying this product for some time now . I have used it daily and sometimes just once a week . It really helps to keep my face smooth and clean
 This face wash works wonders on my face ! It has lots of tiny beads that exfoliate your skin . I have a mix of both oily and dry skin and this face wash works great for both parts . It also takes off makeup very nicely so I do not need any kind of makeup remover .
 For that deep cleaning of your pores , I do n't think there is a better cleaser then this acne scrub . Only a little is needed to do the job .
 I have subscribed to these . They are a great face washing product , wash your face in the shower and unless you have a bad case of acne that all you have to do . The price is a dollar or more than other stores so why not buy these on amazon . With prime you 're saving time and money .
 Excelent product , I am buying more of this , perfect to clean the face for teenagers , and you feel the face clear , , is also nice to use it before going out
 I love this product on subscribe and save . I can find it on sale locally , but subscribe and save saves me the trouble of thinking about it . Good deal . Would buy locally if it was n't .
 and still breaking out . I currently use this product at night and it helps reduce blackheads and cysts . Fragrance is pleasant and skin seems softer and clearer . Still need a 10 % benzyl peroxide for a few breakthroughs but they are infrequent since using this product .
 I use it everyday and it keeps my skin so clear without drying it out like other facial washes i 've tried .
 gets the dirt and make up out and is great for pimples and shrinking pores . will def . co n't to buy . great price compared to drug stores .
 hard to find in the store at this price . The 3 pack is perfect so you always have extra on hand
 I choose this rating because not only is the price right the product is excellant , my skin just keeps on glowing , I suggest if u have not tried this product I can honestly tell you when you do you will not be dissatified , Thank you for giving me the opportunity to tell you how I felt about this product ,
 I am still carded 90 % of the time I buy alcohol , I like to think it is my Asian genes that make me look young , but sometimes I wonder if it is because I still get pimples as an adult.This stuff does the job . It has little scrubbing bubbles that make you feel like you are getting your face cleaner , although it probably is some type of placebo effect , but that 's beside the fact.All I know is that I use this twice a day and it does n't dry out my face like other cleaners do . Oh , and it does n't contain benzene peroxide so my towels do n't become tye-dye . In conjunction with an acne spot lotion , I am golden .
 This product works for me ; I have oily sensitive skin , male African-American . If I over apply it , my skin gets irritated ; therefore , I wash with it every other night . Lately , I wash it off with facial soap to remove excess residue .
 I have been using Neutrogena products for over 12 yrs now & I truly love this particular one . It is the ONLY product I put on my face . Highly recommend it .
 I started getting premature white and silver hair when I was 20 . It has begun to grow at an amazing rate , and in an unflattering `` Bride of Frankenstein '' pattern , so I 've been coloring my hair the past year or so.My hair is normally shiny and it has always been very thick and very curly , but the rinse I use has to stay on for a while since I have hard-to-color white and silver hair and it makes my hair look so dry and dead.Granier Fructis does such a great job of making my hair look so shiny and full of life , even when I color my hair `` midnight '' black . For best results , keep the stuff in your hair for at least 2 full minutes before rinsing it out . Using Mousse afterwards does not cancel the benefits of this conditioner.I 'm sold on this stuff .
 I ca n't even begin to say how great this shampoo is . My hair recently could never fully seem to be clean ! I would get out of the shower and my hair would look like it was still wet or never washed at all . I 've been searching for a shampoo that REALLY does n't weigh my hair down , and this actually does that . Dove , Nutrogena , Paul Mitchell , Sebastion , herbal essence , renewal , head and shoulders . You name it , I tried it . And they all left my hair weighed down and greasy looking and feeling.Finally ! I found this shampoo , and found a trick . . if you put the shampoo on your palm and lather it up , then massage into your hair and under your hair too , and wash it out , it works soooooo beautifully . Do n't even use conditioner , because this will leave your hair soft as a feather , and not greasy at all!I feel like I should be paying $ 50 for this , I know I spent well over that searching for this shampoo . If you have my problem too , definitely give this a chance !
 Let me start and say what a great shampoo this is . My husband has very fine hair and he just loves what this stuff does for his hair . It makes it so light -LRB- it 's oily too -RRB- so it does n't stick to his head , but it also makes it look so much fuller . You ca n't see his scalp as much ! He just loves it and I ca n't say enough good about it either . Try this - you 'll definitely be surprised at what a great product this is for the money .
 I love this fragrance , I have used it for years , it 's one that takes on an individual scent depending on your body chemistry . I get tons of compliments on how good I smell and I know the scent lasts for quite awhile so a little goes a long way.It can be hard to locate at times , not available in department stores , but if you like a fragrance that is unique to YOU , give it a try !
 `` LOVE IT '' . If you are not a fan of floral colognes , then this is a must try . Very light & clean . I do have to say that scent smells different on different people . I get many compliments on a daily basis as this is my signature cologne . And ca n't beat the price .
 I love this cologne !! It has become my `` signature scent '' . Sorry Eros sold theformula , but am happy with the new producers . Please do n't stop making this !!
 I really love this Inner Real spray ! Seems like when I am about out of it , Amazon comes along and reminds me ... I like that ! The service is the best ! Thanks , Amazon!Sallee Coss
 i have fine hair and have a hard time finding products that will make my hair soft and shiny -LRB- mid 40 's -RRB- and yet not make it so heavy or greasy that it did n't look like I washed my hair . I have colored my hair and had extensions so my hari was in pretty rough shape and I 've tried SO many different conditioners - all costs and types - but nothing has given me back the softness , shine and suppleness ike this . in fact - I 've decided to throw the other hair care produtcts out nad just stick with phyto products . I use hte hyrdrating shamppo and the sesame maskI do n't need alot of the conidtioner and it goes on easy and seems to coat my hari without weighing it down , when I blow out my hair It is n't firzzy -LRB- it never was until I moved to DC -RRB- and it looks normal again.I LOVE this !
 This is the bomb in getting rid of acne . It is well worth the 5 bucks to get it . I started breaking out in whiteheads recently in the middle of my face and it left disgusting , splotchy red spots . I think it was caused by Dermablend . Do n't use dermablend if you have acne-prone skin because it has mineral oil in it that will mess you up . Anyways , I bought this Pre-sunless scrub , before I started breaking out , because I was going to try the sunless tanning . I finally tried this scrub to help with the acne , because it has beta-hydroxy and salicylic acid in it . I saw instant results the first day . Wash your face 2-3 times a day with this scrub and your mild acne will be gone in a few days . I applied it on my face , chest , and back with my hands -LRB- no buf-puf or wash cloth needed -RRB- . It also draws up your skin without overdrying it and makes your skin feel smooth and soft . It also exfoliates the dead skin . I love Neutrogena . They have a lot of good products , but this pre-sunless scrub is by far the best they made . I do n't know why they do n't sell this as an acne treatment product . Maybe I should n't write this review because they might jack-up the price and sell it as a prescription drug . But I wrote this review to help somebody else that is suffering from this acne disease like me . This scrub is a God send . Thank you , Neutrogena !!!
 This scrub may overdry your face and make it temporarily paler . So , instead of using 2-3 times a day , just use once a day -LRB- probably best before you go to bed -RRB- . I like to use the `` Liquid Neutrogena , Facial Cleansing Formula , Fragrance Free '' in the morning now , because it is a mild facial cleanser and does n't appear to overdry . The scrub is still very good to fight acne and help reduce fine lines and minor acne scars .
 First off , I have never written a review for a product because I 've never come across something I love so much . I have recently gone on a lip gloss/moisturizer phase and I ended up settling on Neutrogena 's Moisture Shine Gloss . I love color and I love showing off that way , but I purchased First Blush after I tried a couple other colors and even though it looks rather `` nude '' , I am so very into it . I think that I could truly say that I wear it at least 5 times a week . It 's my new back-up for everything ... pinks , peaches , reds , wearing well with greens , and about everything else . And besides , it makes you feel like a 1960 's goddess ... Thumbs up .
 I am very pleased with this product . It is exactly what I was expecting and exactly as the advertised . It was perfect and it was received just when the said it would be . I will definitely be ordering from them again !
 what a great deal , have used this perfume for 15 yrs , , love it !! and everyone gives compliments on it smell , my mil loves it and so does my Mom !! great !
 I like this perfume because not only does it smell good . But the fragrance lasts almost twenty four hours . It is perfect for any occasion .
 I love this scent and will continue to use it as long as I can get it !! The price is right and delivery is easy through Amazon .
 Standard 30 amp 4 prong dryer plug . Molded plug has L-shaped ground , round neutral , and vertical blade hot legs . 6-foot 10/4 stranded cord with crimped ring terminals and clamp . Heavy outer jacket .
 It came little late , which was unusall for Amazon . It was easy to install.It took half hour to install and work done ... Happy .
 This dryer cord does what it is supposed to do . I can really recommend it . It is inexpensive and works great . Take the bull by the horns and buy it .
 Product is a nice beigey gloss , can not find it in the stores anymore so I came to Amazon
 This productcan be useful as a calming holistic aromatherapy oil after bathing and it can also be used to enhance any perfume . It is appealing and soothing .
 A unique and eye catching perfume bottle - curved with a marron glace copper lace corset for a luxurious wrap.Top notes are rose made even more mysterious by a tad of rum and orchid . Base notes include mere hints of vanilla , sandalwood and sweet amber.A rare scent best for evening and special occasions .
 Makeup brushes can be expensive and I want to get the most life out of them I possibly can , so I bought this brush cleaner . I never realized how dirty my brushes were ! I was appalled and fascinated at the same time . After my very first use of this product , in addition to cleaner brushes , I also noticed that my skin was a little clearer . I am sure those brushes can trap dirt and bacteria in addition to the makeup and by cleaning it all away , I was not spreading it on my face everyday in addition to the makeup . I also purchased the daily cleanser to keep up between these big cleanings .
 I was so suprised to finally find a makeup brush cleaning solution . And this one really does a great job .
 I was so grossed out by how much makeup came out of my brush when I applied this product . I did n't think that much powder could have been in there .
 Why is it that whenever a company makes a truely wonderful product , they inevitably stop making it ?! This product can no longer be found in stores . They probably thought it was n't selling very well , but the truth is , it 's an amazing product that even while using every day , will last over 6 months!I have very sensitive skin , also I like things that rinse off easily , and do n't leave my skin feeling greasy in any way . I fell in love with this product in 2002 and it 's all I 've used ever since . I used to get horrible breakouts , and with this this product line -LRB- Pure Zone -RRB- that all came to an end . It 's really really sad that companies stop making things once they 're perfect . Wow , was I happy to see that someone still had it available , here on Amazon !
 its the only product that works for my face :-RRB- it leaves your skin feeling refreshed and smooth after each wash and keeps acne/pimples at bay !
 This is a great product . It clears my skin without over drying.The Toner is great too . They both are very hard to find in stores .
 I have been using this product for over 5 years now and ca n't imagine using anything else . I am very disappointed that I can not find Loreal Pure Zone in stores . It makes your skin feel refreshed and clean . It wakes me up in the morning and removes makeup well . I do not use the other `` steps '' in the Pure Zone products , this one works well all alone .
 I LOVE this product . Although I do not use it daily , I believe that it can be used daily just like it says . It is a gel with blue and white beads . It did not feel rough on my skin , but you can feel the scrub . And after using it , my skin feels smooth . I have combination skin and it does n't irritate me , I do n't know how it is on other people 's skin . Also , it smells good.I would not use this as a daily cleanser -LRB- just because I do n't think you should be scrubbing your face everyday -RRB- , but as a scrub/exfoliator it is great especially on sensitive skin . And when I say sensitive I mean it as easily irritated by the scrubbing , not the product 's composite .
 This lip balm is almost too good to be true . I did n't know that my lips could feel this good !! Wow . I bought this as a whim , and I 'm so glad that I did . I 've been a burt 's bees junkie for almost 10 years now , and I finally stepped out of my boundaries ! Yes , it 's expensive , but it 's worth every single penny . I got mine for $ 8 at a local organic store , so check at one of those first since this particular one is a little more expensive . I put it on at night , and in the morning my lips are smooth and silky ! It lasts all day , although it 's hard to resist the urge to reapply . If you 're looking for your Holy Grail , try this lip balm , you will NOT regret it!Ingredients
 I have used this lip balm for about 7 years and it 's hands down the best . I 've tried a lot of balms , too ! You know that `` lip scum '' we all get ? This lip balm actually gets rid of it , I do n't know how . And unlike other lip balms that made you have to apply more and more , this lip balm moisturizes your lips in a way that stays longer , so you are n't constantly reapplying it . Lastly , I have a problem with getting itchy irritation from some skin products and this lip balm does n't irritate my skin at all . Love love love it .
 After a misunderstanding on my part , Nutricity -LRB- the seller -RRB- was more than willing to ensure customer satisfaction . I 've been using the Karite lip balm almost ten years . If you 're looking for a superior product , you 've found it ! Furthermore , I highly recommend this particular seller !
 Hands down , this is the best chapstick I have ever used . When Whole Foods runs out , I go on missions to find it . After letting my friends use it , they too trek the metro area in search of this wonderful , beautiful , essential stick . It 's good to know that Amazon is here to help . You really do n't have to apply it often , and I live in dry dry Denver . It has sunflower oil and shea , which are natural sunscreens , and it smells delicious . I 've had men come to me to ask me what I 'm wearing that smells so good
 I can not get enough of this balm . It has replaced all of my other lip products because aside from being good for your lips it smells amazing!It goes on thick and brings out the best of your lips .
 unlike other balms which promoted acne near my lips and caused a vicious cycle of application and drying , karite lips actually enabled my lips to heal . after years of dependency on inferior drugstore balms , i was able to ween myself off of lip balm in all but the coldest winter months . i bought the first stick over 3 years ago and it has lasted until now . this is one of the best products i have ever used .
 Works like a charm where other balms middlingly deliver . Used Karite Lips to help heal a lip cut that kept reopening and splitting everytime my mouth stretched open . It helped soften the cut area so that the wound would remain supple and flexible while healing properly . Excellent by any measure .
 This amazing balm saved me from chapped lips from hell . Over the last week , my lips became inexplicably , painfully chapped - almost as if they 'd been badly irritated by a caustic substance . Yeah , it 's winter , it 's dry , but this was unlike any other chapped lip experience I 've had.I tried a couple of balms I had around , but they just aggravated the situation with menthol , mint , camphor , menthol , peppermint or whatever gets put into these things to give you that cool , zippy feeling . Horrible , painful , made things much worse . I longed for just a bland , gentle ointment that would soothe and moisturize , but my lips continued to burn and the skin just kept tightening and flaking . My lips were bright red.I finally found Karite-Lips , and the healing began . I ca n't express how relieved I was to put something on my lips that did n't sting , but just soothed and calmed my tortured , painful skin . The vanilla scent is perfect , the shea butter is amazing , and my lips are finally starting to heal.Worth every single penny .
 Mode de Vie Karite lips is a superior lip balm that contains a high concentration of shea butter for maximum moisturizing and regeneration of dry skin . You can tell this balm has a lot of shea butter in it because the initial application of the balm is slightly grainy -- this is a characteristic of pure shea butter . After several applications the balm goes on smooth and soft . Karite lips leaves the lips silky smooth and protected , providing a layer of silky emollients that stay on the lips for a while unlike some lip balms which require constant re-application . The natural vanilla in the balm provides a delicious scent and flavor . This wonderful lip balm stick costs a little more but lasts a long time.Shea butter is made from the nuts of the Karite tree from West Africa . Apparently studies have been done on shea butter which reveal some miraculous properties of this ingredient . It can aid cell regeneration and capillary circulation which aids healing of the epidermis . Also , it has restructuring effects on the skin and dry hair .
 This is simply the best lip balm available . I 've tried many different kinds , Bert 's Bee 's , Blistex Herbal , even the often-touted Dr. Hauschka 's Lip Care Stick . None of them come close to being as good as this lip balm . Say goodbye to chapped lips and having to reapply constantly . Karite Lips will leave your lips , soft , supple , and the moisturizing properties last and last . It also has a pleasant vanilla smell , and the stick is large enough that it will last you a long time . Hard to find , but seek it out . This lip balm is # 1 .
 Two stars might seem harsh , but when a superior product is sold in a shoddy container that breaks half way through the useful life of the product what you have is poor value.The lip balm itself is great , but the plastic containers have a tendency to break -LRB- the portion of the tube that you must twist to dispense the lip balm breaks off -RRB- . have had this happen three times . I 've googled and read this same criticism made by other users.I exchanged a number of emails with the maker Mode De Vie who asked me to mail back the defective products and promised to send replacements . That was in March 2009 ; No replacement product has been received at this point.Its a shame because the lip balm itself is my favorite . If the packaging were n't so shoddy I would be posting a Five-Star review . But what good is an excellent product if you ca n't use half of it without the container failing.UPDATE -LRB- 08-03-2012 -RRB-
 I have been suffering for a few months from severely dry , chapped , peeling and cracked lips . The sides of my mouth were cracked and at worst times , bleeding every time I opened my mouth . I had tried everything including straight Neosporin and nothing helped . This amazing balm healed me within a few days . Within 24 hours I had about 80 % improvement . I am shocked at just how good it is . Hands down best lip balm I have ever used !!
 Yes , it is expensive . But after guilting myself into purchasing less expensive brands and being unhappy with the slimy texture , or just plain feeling like crap from the petroleum , I simply buy it and remain happy . The formula is thicker than a gloss thus stays on for much longer . You should still feel moisturized in the morning after applying before lights out . My hubby loves the texture and fragrance , and seeks out kisses if I 've recently applied . My &#34; all boy &#34; teen sons have given up their &#34; manly &#34; Chapstick in favor of this Karite Lips because they say it just works better . If you are looking for a light feel , this is not your product . But if you are looking for a highly healing lip moisturizer without evil petroleum or other drying additives , then this product is definitely a best buy !
 I 've had this product for quite some time in my arsenal of lip balms and chapsticks . Ca n't quite remember where I first scored a tube . I 'm always in the market for something good and effective . This lip balm does the trick and I have just placed an order for a second tube < first one 75 % gone > . The vanilla scent is subtle and fades a lil ' while post-application . It provides great moisturizing properties to my full lips . Kissably soft for your guy ladies . KISSABLY soft -LRB- smooch -RRB- ! There is a bit of sheen to it but it does n't look or feel greasy - nor have I ever thought it to leave a waxy feel . Winter or summer , no matter , it 's great for year round use . I hope my relationship with this product turns out to be lifelong . I say buy-it , try-it , you might < should > like it .
 I 've been using this lip balm since the 1990s . -LRB- It is called &#34; Karite Lips &#34; on the tube . -RRB- One winter , it was so cold that no other lip product I tried helped my chapped lips . My homeopathic doctor recommended this lip balm ; it worked like a charm and I 've been using it ever since . It goes on nice and smooth , not waxy . There is a slight vanilla scent , but it dissipates very quickly , so there is no annoying flavor lingering on the lips . Many lip balms have peppermint oil , which can actually irritate the lips , or other flavors , so it is hard to find a good unflavored one like Karite Lips . I use it every day , either by itself or under lipstick . I would recommend it to anyone .
 This lip balm is the best ever . It smells good , goes on smoothly & lasts a long time.I have had a problem with the tube breaking once but I will still continue using it . Recently had to substitute with another brand which does not have the vanilla & it does n't smell nearly as good . Ca n't wait until it is back in stock at my local place .
 Update
 it 's a big sized tube.it softening , long lasting , protecting , everything you want in a lip balm.highly recommended product !
 This lip balm is , hands down , the best that I 've found . For some reason , all of our local Seattle grocery stores are temporarily out of stock so I had to find it online because I simply do n't have anything that compares . It leaves lips feeling moisturized for a long time and it 's not sticky or slick . it 's perfect ... really .
 I have been using this lip balm for years and absolutely love it . I buy it in quantity so I can give some to friends , who generally become hooked ! The only thing keeping it from getting 5 stars is
 I 've been wanting to try this for a long time . And was happy with this one . A thick and smooth balm with a light real vanilla scent . A good winter lip balm . Try this even with the price .
 I was familiar with Karite lip balm from having purchased it at WholeFoods in the past . It 's the only thing that keeps my lips from getting chapped . Through Amazon I was able to purhcase it for half the cost -LRB- even with shipping -RRB- !
 After years of trying many lip balms on the market -LRB- carmex , burts , chapstick , blistex , dr. hauschka , mac , etc -RRB- , I have finally found the BEST one ! I love this lip balm . It 's goes on smooth and leaves your lips so soft ! I have converted numerous friends into using Karite Lip Balm . It 's worth the extra $ $ .
 This perfume is one of my all time favorites . It is so delicate and every time I wear it , I get compliments . This is a classic perfume that every woman should have at least a small bottle of .
 This is a very crisp sweet floral . I just love it , love it , love it ! Wore it all last year . I changed again like I always do but I have wonderful memories with this scent . I think most women will love this scent dearly ! Ralph Lauren hardly creates failed scents , he is a master of creation . May I also recommend Glamorous is also is a crisp sweet floral . Both are supurlative indeed .
 I bought Lauren Style By Ralph Lauren for my wife assuming she would find it to her liking . I was pleased that she described it as not too sweet nor too strong and smelled as fresh and light after eight hours as when applied .
 Purchased for my wife . She was very happy with it , therefore I was happy with it and it does smell good .
 I ordered this item that is no longer in major retailer stores . I go texactly what I wanted in a few days . Excellent seller will use them again !
 This is the second time I bought this fragrance for my wife . It 's the best there is and not for sale in most of Europe !
 I was very excited to receive this package , as it was a present for my mom . I could n't find it anywhere in stores and was happy to finally find it on amazon . Shipping was quick and it was packaged really well . No damage at all .
 This is my favorite scent and this is the best price I 've been able to find -LRB- from a reputable online source -RRB- .
 MY WIFE IS TASTED THIS PARFUME AND SHE LOVED IT , SO CHRISTMAS PRESENT THIS YEAR WILL BE THIS WONDERFUL LAUREN STYLE .
 I am VERY picky about perfumes . I do n't like anything too flowery or fruity . I like masculine scents like Nautica or Coolwater , but I do n't think they are that appropriate -LRB- to wear as a woman -RRB- . This scent is a perfect balance ... I know it is hard to imagine a scent as being `` classy '' or `` elegant '' , but those are the perfect words to describe Lauren Style .
 My wife was concerned when I told her I was going to order her favorite cologne , RL Style through Amazon , that it would be a generic brand . I insisted that she was wrong and am happy to say , I was right . Not only was it exactly what she wanted , but the price was better than in a retail outlet , and the shipping was timely as advertised . Great job Amazon !
 I bought a bottle of this for my wife and she loves it . I must say that I enjoy it quite a bit too . It 's worth the buy .
 I got this item for Christmas , and I LOVE it . My sister 's birthday is coming up and I will definitely be buying her a bottle .
 THIS IS A NICE AND PLEASANT FRAGRANCE . I LOVE THIS FRAGRANCE IT SMELLS SO GOOD LASTS LONG SMELLS SO GOOD . IT DOENS ' T BOTHER MY ALLERGIES . I LIKE THIS SCENT I LOVE THIS LIGHT SMELLING GREAT SMELLING FRAGRANCE . I LOVE IT I WAS SURPRISED HOW GOOD THIS FRAGRANCE SMELLS !!!!!!
 I 've used this fragrance for years . My biggest problem they made it for ONE season-that bites ! Why do they do this ? This scent is so refreshing !!!! The scent makes me feel so clean and smelling great ! This is especially true when I 've had a bad day . It picks me UP . Love it !
 I thought I would pick up a new item at the drugstore after so much time and money trying to find the right eye cream . Within 30 seconds after putting this cream below and above my eye area , I noticed a shocking result-no dark circles whatsoever and the smoothness and clarity was unbelievable . I would love to do a commercial on this cream , I absolutely loved it . A must have for smokers and lack of sleep . Five big stars !!
 My 2 year-old son has very curly hair , hence is it prone to drying , especially with fun in the sun and pool . This conditions his hair beautifully and leaves it silky smooth . Strangers stop me to compliment his beautiful hair ; I believe that 's largely a gift from God , but this conditioner helps too .
 my 3yo has very fine hair that got very dried out after a few days in the pool . this made hair washing day bearable , as she no longer screamed at all the tangles ! Great product ... she loved the grape smell too .
 They do not sell this brand of conditioner/shampoo where I live , but my cousins from CA had some during their recent visit . I love this product . Most kid shampoos claim to be 2 in 1 , but that is never the case . My 5 year old has a tender head , so this conditioner is a must . It smells great and makes combing through hair a breeze .
 Smells great and acctually does a great job on my tangled litlle girl 's hair and makes hair silky and shinny after drying.I get a free shipping on my Amazon Prime so no time wasted looking for it in stores .
 This stuff smells amazing , and makes your hair soft . I 'm an adult , and I use with the grape conditioner . It lathers nicely , cleans well , and leaves a light scent on your hair for a while.I 've used this stuff for years , and definitely recommend it .
 I always need a conditioner after shampoo my hair . This one is more cheaper but , way better than the D * ve for my hair !
 my kid 's hair feels very silky and healthy after this conditioner , and she swims twice per week . Just hope that they offer more scents to choose from
 This conditioner works really well on my daughter 's hair . Her hair is soft and tangle-free , even after swimming every day . My only complaint is that the smell is not good . The artificial grape smells like medicine .
 i just started using this conditioner with the l'oreal kids shampoo & it 's just wonderful , it smells gr8 & leaves my daughters hair very soft & moisturized
 My seven-year-old has fine hair and I found that regular shampoo had a harsh effect on her hair . After reading several reviews of the L'Oreal Paris Kids hair care products , I decided to purchase the shampoo , conditioner , and swim shampoo . The results have been wonderful thus far . My daughter loves the smell and the cute containers , and the conditioner has been wonderful for everyday use as it does not dry her hair out . I 'm even using it myself . I just wish the range came in larger containers .
 This is a great conditioner and works well on thick hair . Leaves hair soft . Great price but wish it was available in a larger size .
 My wife loves this perfume and has n't been able to find it . She has looked everywhere but to no avail . Thanks for making Christmas shopping easy this year !
 It 's my favorite fragrance . It has a soft yet bold scent . It 's not over bearing . Smells so good . Thanks for the low price Amazon . I will repurchase more soon .
 Love Ralph Lauren scents and this one did not disappoint . While it is not overpowering I prefer to wear it at night . When you put it on the scent lasts .
 This fragrance was discontinued like 2 years ago and this product was well preserved that the fragrance still as fresh as new . It was the best xmas gift for my wife and she loved it .
 I use these almost exclusively vs any other wall anchors . These will screw into a stud if you hit one , but they are perfect for plain drywall too . They 're good for about 40 pounds each , though I like to use them for everything from hanging light fixtures on the ceiling , to hanging paintings on the wall.The anchor has a phillip 's hole , so just stick it onto your drill and run it low speed into the wall . You can do this by hand , but lean into it a little.Once it 's ALMOST flush , leave it . Trying to flatten it too much will just tear out the wall.Now , the center hole is where the screw goes in . I try to keep it close to snug , just to keep things close to flush with the wall where possible . That reduces horizontal loads on the anchor , and improves load strength .
 This is my husbands favorite cologne and the only place to purchase it locally was higher than here . It is great .
 Excelente producto y y excelente servicio . Muy r&aacute;pida la entrega , en tiempo r&eacute;cord . Lo recomiendo . El producto llego en excelente condiciones .

 This is by far the best fragrance from Ralph Lauren for me . I 've tried all of them but the compliments roll in when ever I 'm wearing this ! Strangers walk up to me and start smelling me -LRB- strange -RRB- but I 'll let woman do it all day long ! lol They always compliment me on the scent and say how much they like it ! Always a plus !
 This is and always will be my favorite cologne . My husband loves it also ! You just cant go wrong with this for a gift .
 This cologne is great . I wear it all the time , has an excellent fragrance that is strong and masculine . Great for going out at night and smelling great . Polo is surely a classic fragrance , and at this size and price it is a great buy .
 Started &#34; wearing &#34; this fragrance in the 80s when it was introduced . I have had a consistent feeling about it and did NOT wear it only when I had difficulty finding it offered by many stores . It seems to me that the newer Polo fragrances are nowhere as good . Glad I found a place to get it .
 This cologne smells so good on him I have to keep buying it to have him smell so good ! And the only other one he needs is halston .
 With over thirty two years in the Cologne business this is officially the best cologne I 've experienced . This stuff is highly at risk for being replicated so be sure you buy fro ma reputable source . This stuff last a very long time aswell . I 've still smelt this stuff on my skin beyond 24 hours . 5 out of 5 .
 My husband is in love with this cologne . I should buy it for him by the gallons , if I could ! Great buy ! Thanks ! : -RRB-
 This sums up this purchase
 This is a great fragrance . Deep and sultry . A little woodsy , and musk.Very strong , so , go lightly until you know your smell capacity.A little pricey , but worth it to smell better then your grandpa.This is the fragrance that launched the house of Lauren.And now you know why . It 's classic , classy and bold.You 'll smell like a million bucks , even if you work at Wal-mart .
 Been using Polo green since 1982 . Amazon gets me the best price with reasonably quick delivery .
 This is definitely the best fragrance ever . It is a pity that it is so difficult to find . The new Polo products are no comparison .
 Loved the content of the green glass , but was disappointed that it was not in the green &#34; Polo &#34; box and did n't have all the &#34; Polo &#34; insignias as featured ...
 Hubby has worn this for four decades and just a whiff lights my fire -- lasts throughout the day . A good investment .
 I always used Polo green by Ralph Lauren . The fragrance is deeply striking , and I identified myself with this product . Undoubtedly excellent purchase .
 Polo is Anytime/Anywhere Cologne . Been using Polo since the 80 's . Why change up now , when nothing is broke ? Here 's to another 30 + years .
 Ralph Lauren Polo For Men Eau de Toilette SprayI purchased this product as a Christmas gift for my son . He was delighted with it .
 My husband has been using Polo for 20yrs and loves it ... we saved 10.00 buying here on Amazon and got it with 3 days of the order great job .
 This is an awesome perfume . I have been using this brand for 2 years ... and will buy the same again when this one empties : -RRB-
 You sent the wrong bottle . I distinctly ordered the pour bottle . and that is what you have displayed as my order . You did NOT send the pour bottle . You sent the spray bottle . I do not want the spray bottle . I want the pour bottle . I will not be buying any more cologne from you unless you make it right .
 My husband loves this basic Polo , as well as many who comment to him when he 's wearing it !!!
 I 'm an 80 's baby . I can remember when i was about 5 or 6 years old play putt putty golf in a famous & barr department store in Fairview heights , Il for a bottle of this Polo by Ralph Lauren . Needless to say I was too young to wear it and i believe an uncle of mine took it . If i would have known what i know now I would have kept it for myself . I will be purchasing a bottle soon
 Just what was asked for . My husband had wanted this for Christmas and he was very grateful to be able to have it
 Purchased as a Christmas gift for a member of my family . As a teenage boy , he is really looking to impress the ladies .
 Since I discovered that I cared what women think of me as a teen this has been my scent . I have tried others off and on thru life but this is the only one where women have stopped me and asked me what I am wearing . I mean really it happens plenty . Guys what can I say , this has been around a long time and there is a good reason for it . It turns heads and makes gals remember you and want more . Just saying ! I ordered the omg that is a big bottle one and it was shipped on time as always with no damage . Thanks amazon
 I have worn this for years , I mad e the mistake and bought Modern reserve once , not a good smell for me ,
 I 've been using Polo for years and this is the first time I purchased it through Amazon . I saved a good chunk of change and it is genuine Polo .
 Not only was the product exactly what I was looking for but the price and the service was top-notch . I would order this again from here .
 This has been my favorite going out Cologne for 25 years . It is very strong and has a very pleasing smell that is memorable . It might be a bit strong to wear everyday to work unless you are in a well ventilated workplace . It will not diminish until you perspire a lot or wash it off in your morning shower .
 I bought this from BeautyEncounter -LRB- purchased from Amazon.com but BeautyEncounter fulfilled the order -RRB- and it is authentic . Like others have said great masculine woodsy/outdoors smell that lasts all day . I get some nice compliments from wearing it . And it drives some women crazy : D
 This cologne was exactly what I wanted . I 've been using this brand for years , and I get a lot of favorable comments from perfect strangers .
 I recommend to anyone . Great product . I love this cologne on my husband . Smells good on my husband & he was wearing this cologne the day I met him .100 % wonderful
 I get 4 or 5 compliments a day wearing this product . The aroma is noticed and singled out in a croud . Most women want to know the name of the product .
 I like the feel and the smell . What 's still surprising is that people are keep asking for the brand of `` your pleasant smelling aftershave '' .
 Not much to say about this other than that it 's a classic and one of my favorite colognes ... my Father has worn this for as long as i can remember . Very earthy smell to it much recommended for all occasions .
 This is one of two classic sents from the 80 's the other being Drakkar . It may seem old school , but the ladies of the year 2012 still like it or maybe they just like me .
 My girl friend suggested this fragrance and I will admit that when I first tried it , it caught me by surprise . I had never smelled anything quite like it and it , at first ... was a little on the strong side to suit my taste . Now I will wear nothing else . I love the fragrance and have had positive comments ... not to mention the fact that it drives my girl friend -LRB- soon to be wife -RRB- crazy . A little on the expensive side , but a little goes a long way , so in the long run , I think it is worth it .
 My sexy husband has been smelling like Polo for the nineteen years we have been married . He has tried other scents -LRB- usually samples I bring home from the fragrance counter -RRB- , but he always comes back to this old favorite.Luca Turin and Tania Sanchez , in their fabulous book , Perfumes
 Husband likes it . I have allergies to many perfumes but this one is great.He has used this product for over 20 years and it is just as good now as it was day one .
 Starting when I was just 16-Now I 'm 47 , and after trying other scents , combining them , using patchouli , Hugo , Clinique Happy , Fahrenheit ... Nothing 's ever as nice , and I come back to the green Polo . It reminds me of what being a grown-up man is , from my pre-college years ... Professional , disciplined enough to be able to get a job to afford to wear this stuff . lol
 Polo is always the best and the best price is from Amazon always . You can not find a cheaper price anywhere .
 I could n't find this in the stores when he asked for it last year . I did n't even try to find it this year , I just came to Amazon ... ca n't wait to see his face when he opens it up ! .
 this isnt a review of how polo smells . most people dont buy a cologne or perfume online without ever smelling it so im assuming you already like the scent if youre here . my 5 stars are because this product is 15-20 bucks more expensive for the exact same bottle if you buy it at the big dept store that throws the parade in nyc . its much cheaper here and if you already like it , you may as well save the money and buy it online and get free shipping too .
 I 'm from Brazil and it was my first purchase . I 've got the item before the expected date . The product arrived in perfect conditions of use .
 it was delivered after 2 days of placing the order , i was n't even expecting it to be that fast ... great !!!
 This probably is one of the best colognes I have used so far!Very appealing and refreshing .
 Have been looking for something to replace a discontinued Clinique product-poor decision for them to dc it-and found this . Perfect ; am so pleased . Would like to order another to have in reserve , just in case Almay makes a similar decision
 Retin-A dries the skin out around my eyes every one in a while , and this helps to sooth and heal that delicate skin . LOVE this stuff !!!
 I LOVE this soap . Of course I love all of Dr. Bronner 's soaps , especially because they are all natural and biodegradeable etc. . . and they WORK GREAT !!! But this one is particularly good for my skin . The natural antiseptic , germicide , antibacterial , fungicide properties of Tea Tree oil have made my skin so much clearer since I have started using this soap regularly . It lathers really well just like all Dr. Bronner 's soaps , so you just need a very little bit . The only downside is that it 's not the best smelling of his soaps -LRB- if you do n't know what tea tree oil smells like I would try it in a small size first -RRB- but I do n't mind it . If you like the peppermint soap , I would definitely try this one too .
 I love lipsticks/lipglosses but am very picky . I hate to fuse with it all day - reapplying . I love this product and have no clue why a perfect product was discontinued . The new `` formula '' and replacement is horrible . The colors are all shimmery & have either way too much orange or pink in them . I tried 4 different colors of the new product and none of them are close to nude or natural . The 16 hr is the only lipstick I 've found that does what it says . I put it on in the morning & forget about it . Occasionally I add a little chapstick or the included lip moisterizer if I feel a little dryness otherwise , I forget I have it on.Maybelline will lose a customer if I 'm not able to find this product in this color again .
 I have used this product for at least 4 years and it 's fabulous . Have tried other long-stay lipsticks and they are either too drying or they do n't stay as long as they advertise or the colors are too ` frosted ' . This is a perfect color -LRB- Cinnamon -RRB- plus most of the other colors are great and the wearability is terrific . I put it on in the morning and never touch it again till I take it off at night - I do put the moisturizing balm on it several times a day . The new 24-hour Maybelline lipstick is good for wearability but the colors are not good .
 I received this as a sample and fell in love ! I 've tried other long-wear lipsticks only to have cakey lips . This product lasts and does not feel like others ! Awesome product !!!
 I 'm happy with my Maybelline Superstay Lipscolor . I have tried long lasting lip color before and they all dried out my lips , even the ones with lip balm.I do n't find that it really lasts 16 hours but it 's a good product .
 Really does last all day ! It is only sticky if you do n't use the included gloss that sets the color . After that , even when the gloss wears off , the color stays ! I recommend using a lip pencil to give the lips a nice neat edge .
 I had been using regular lipstick and lipgloss for years . That is , until I got a little older -LRB- 45 -RRB- and started to get the dreaded `` lipstick feathering '' . I began trying all kinds of lip liners , lip conditioners , lip primers ... only to find that they did n't really work . Once I tried Superstay , that was it . The color never bleeds and the lip conditioner is great . I wo n't use anything else now . I have tried other 12 hour type lipsticks and they only dried out my lips and made them feel terrible . I usually only use department store or Mary Kay makeup , but in this case , Maybelline Superstay is the best lipstick for me , summer or winter . I will only use this product now . Great stuff !
 Maybelline Superstay lipcolor is the only kind of lipstick I wear . I am a faithful lipstick / lipcolor wearer - and this stuff is my old standby.My favorite colors are raisin and sienna . They are both dark maroon shades and I constantly receive compliments on it . Look out for packages that come with a gold sparkle topcoat ; it 's the greatest thing ever!Superstay lipcolor really does last all day long and even then , it has to be removed with remover.The only tip I can offer regarding this product is to always put it on dry lips and do n't reapply the color once it 's on or it will never look right again.Again - my favorite lipcolor for years !
 I really love this stuff . It does n't stay 16 hours for me , but it does stay about 8 , which gets me through a work day with my lipstick intact . The first layer is sticky , but once the second layer is applied , it is smooth and nice for the whole day .
 I did n't have any trouble with my lips becoming glued together like the other commentator did . You apply the color portion , let it dry for a couple minutes -LRB- it becomes slightly tacky , then dry -RRB- , then apply the super-shiny clear gloss . There was even some still on after drinking from a glass and that makes the permanence of the color better than many , in my experience ! Lots of nice colors available , too .
 I finally found a fusha in a long wear . I only wear long wear lipsticks now . I could n't find a fusha for love or money , but violet -LRB- go figure -RRB- just came out . I recomend 2 coats . Yeah !
 I applied this lipcolor last evening before attending a musical . Much to my surprise , this morning it is still on and looking good . I just applied a bit more to even out the color and the gloss after it dried . I have never had lipcolor that lasted this long or smelled as nice as this one .
 I 'm happy with this product . It is pretty and does last a long time . It can sometimes begin to feel a bit crumbly -LRB- for lack of better word -RRB- on my lips after a while and requires subsequent applications of the gloss overlay , but I still like it .
 i will say this i will keep doing online shoping with you . fast service i like that . you will way have me
 I bought this product hoping that I would n't have to reapply my lip color ever few minutes . Originally I hated it , it crumbled and flaked off almost immediately . I really wanted to like this product and was willing to try again , this time I put some of the balm on first and needless to say that was the worst idea it just peeled right off . I put this aside for a few days and then decided to try again today and to my great surprise it worked . From about 5:30 am to after dinner it stayed on . Even through band ! I 'm a wind/brass player and have my mouth on a mouthpiece for about 45 straight minutes . I was extremely surprised that it stayed through that stress let alone through dinner and continuous licking of lips and chapstick application and removal . This product is great , when in doubt let it dry longer !
 I am so glad to be able to find this lipstick , It is a color I love . The lipstick does stay on a very long time , but does feel a bit dry on my lips .
 excelente calidad muy acorde con lo ofertado , y el tiempo estimado de entrega es justo lo que publican los felicito
 a little bit darker than I was hoping , but still very pretty . I find it looks best if you blot it before it dries , but it -LRB- obviously -RRB- does n't stay on as long if you do this.I found it a little drying , but the balm is very nice .
 The product does stay well and does not dry out my lips as much as another stayput lipstick product does . The color is a bit lighter than the picture displayed but is still a good day-time color .
 I have tried all types of long-wearing lipstick . This one is the best because it allows your lips stay moist and beautiful all day !
 This is the best of all the long-lasting lipsticks I 've tried . It stays on for hours , and through eating & drinking . But comes off if I wash it off , or is gone by the next morning . Everything else I 've tried comes off when I eat , and dab my lips with a napkin . But this product does not even come off on a napkin . It 's fabulous , and the only lipstick I use .
 The Maybeline Super Stay lip color was shipped on time and accurately at a great price . Great experience . Will shop again with this vendor .
 Honestly , I really like the lipstick . The color is nice , and it does last longer than traditional lipstick . But I would n't say it lasted 16 hours . After eating something , it wears off in the middle . Then your lips look paler in the center and pink around the outer age , which looks a little strange . I have pretty dry lips though , so it might just be me . But it does last longer than other lipsticks and does n't transfer as easy . If you kiss someone , they 'll only get the conditioning balm , not the lipstick . Overall , I recommend it . Just do n't expect it to last 16 hours without a few touch ups during that time .
 Love this lipstick . The color is very versatile and stays put forever . Would definitely buy again and recommend.Not sticky and annoying , either . Very comfortable
 I was in desperate need of a lip gloss that would not only keep my lips moist but also last a long time . I have to tell you this super stay lip color knocked it out the park . I was amazed at how well it stayed on even after eating a meal . The lip color goes on first and dries in a very short amount of time , then you apply the balm which adds a beautiful shine as well as moisture to your lips . What an amazing an creative way to keep your lips sparkling and conditioned at the same time . I ordered the cherry color and it did not disappoint . I will definitely be buying more for myself as well as gifts for friends .
 I ordered the Lilac color . It is a little light but gives a nice shimmer to your lips . Cap clicks on , so no worry about loosing it .
 I love this product . I wear `` cool '' colors and this is perfect for my complexion . You put it on in 2 steps and it lasts all day . The price was very good . I will buy this again , and again ...
 I received this quickly and in good condition . I never tried this type of lipstick but I am really glad I ordered it . It looks good on and I really like the color too . I thought the price was very reasonable compared to buying it at the drugstore .
 This has been a favority color and product for years , and the idea of it being discontinued is one of those cosmetic-world travesties . It has always been a popular shade and other colors that look quite similar do n't `` play '' the same . SO now they hope I 'll waste $ 50-75 trying out new shades til I find one -- weary , lousy business ... Anyway , for now , glad I was able to grab a few of these while still available . To be critical
 I bought it for my wife . She likes it . Cheap but good item to buy.Now she is thing to buy different shades .
 This was the second time I have ordered lipstick from amazon . I no longer can find my color that I like in the stores so I go to amazon and am able to purchase it with no problems . It comes well packaged and new . I am very happy with the product .
 I was really bummed when i discovered this was discontinued . I went on Amazon and found a couple of vendors that had it in stock . I bought them both out .
 Maybelline Superstay lip color plum 755 . I liked this old packaging better than current . I bought 3 . Just what I wanted ... . thanks .
 really good one ... when i eat all the lipstics with food or drinks ; this is the one that stayed on my lips for the whole day .
 I ordered all one color and got 2 out of 3 correct . The item had the correct number on it , but it was not that color . I kept it because I did n't want the hassle of returning just one .
 Product Received . Product as advertised . A little darker than the last time I bought this same lip color . That 's all that I have to say . Sorry if it 's not enough words .
 Looked for this color EVERYWHERE and could not find it !! Finally reserched it on Amazon and of course it was there . Arrived in a timely manner and in perfect condition . Love it against my skin color !!!!
 This was the first thing I 've ordered from Amazon and it came way earlier than I expected . -LRB-
 I first bought this lipstick when on vacation in florida . I love it . I wouldnt wear it every day as it will dry out your lips but there 's just those days when you need a lipstick to stay on longer than normal and this one is brilliant and its a really natural colour and it makes you feel good
 First I have to say that I never have any specific makeup company I buy from ... I find things I love and experiment often with something new on the market . A claim for 24 hour color ? How could I not try it . Incidentally , I found mine at Wal-Mart so they are available there if the shipping cost is a glitch.The first day I put on the lipstick I have to say I was a tad concerned as there are no instructions anywhere on the tube . Now that may sound stupid , but this is a two step process rather than just applying the color . You apply what feels like a lipgloss and that dries quickly on your lips when you then open the other end of the tube and apply a clear stick topcoat that locks the color in place . Thing is , on some long lasting products you need to apply the second step while the first is wet for it to work , and on others you are to wait til it dries . I decided to wing it and let it soak in and dry then I applied the cream stick topcoat.Apparently that worked . I put this on in the morning , forgot about it , then as I was driving home I had something in my eye so I pulled down my rearview mirror and was SHOCKED to notice I had lipstick on ! Did it stay on 24 hours ? No ... not that I need that anyway ... but does it last 8 very well ? Yes , it did . I mean , some had faded but I also ate lunch and wiped my mouth as well so I was impressed.So what 's the design flaw ? The darn lid popping off literally every single day in my purse . The colored end screws into place perfectly and stays put . The other end has a lid that pops on and never stays put . I have tried everything to get that sucker not to fall off in my purse -LRB- it does seem to pop on fine , but always comes loose -RRB- and I liked the lipstick and color enough that I wound up buying a lipstick holder that fit it to put it in so I did n't keep drying out the cream stick topcoat end and getting it all over things like my checkbook.Oddly , not only did they leave off the directions on the tube but also the name of the color . My stick says `` 020 '' at the bottom but , as you can see , nothing like that is listed here . And I actually , I kid you not , had to get a magnifying glass to read that tiny number on the sticker anyway . Reading glasses still could n't make out what it said . However , I wanted to note the color as I think it 's just gorgeous and would probably be quite flattering on many skin tones . It 's somewhere between a coral and a pink but not bold or flashy.Conclusion
 I love the color of this lipstick and I love how it actually stays on for several hours . It has never stayed on as long as 16 hours but it has definitely stayed on through at least one meal , particularly when I have followed the application instructions .
 OK , I now own 6 shades of this amazing product and I 'm going back for more !!! I make my own natural cosmetics so I am well versed in makeup and application and I must say this lip color product is the absolute best I have tried ... . and I have tried them all!Going to go get a couple new shades tonight!The Cinnamon Stay is totally awesome ! My only complaint ... . the print on the tube lable is SO small ... . I ca n't read what color I have in my hand ... ? I am going to re-lable them : -RRB- Enjoy ! ~
 if you 've googled this product you 've probably seen raving reviews for it -- they are 100 % true ! This is an amazing lipstick - it truely lasts all day and through eating . And there are many really nice colors . its a two part application - you apply the color , let it dry , then the clear gloss . After eatting the gloss may be worn off , but the color stays unchanged . I 'm getting rid of all my other lipsticks and just keeping this one .
 This superstay lipcolor item is great . I 've been using it for years and it stays on , does n't dry my lips and looks great ! I 've actually stopped using lipsticks altogether . Who wants the smudges and constant re-applying ? Not me ! So worth the money !
 I love the Maybelline 16 hr lipsticks -- i wish they stuck with this particular formula recipe . It says on and the color is very nice . Lips stay moist and the color does NOT wear off . Enjoy !
 Unfortunately , this model of lip color has been Discontinued : -LRB- I am lucky to find it wherever I can!IT WORKS GREAT!I go to the dentist and have my teeth cleaned and my lip color DOES NOT COME OFF!I have n't tried the new version of this brand ... they do n't have the same colors as the original brand ... I love this brand !
 I do n't generally order this stuff from Amazon . But I loved the wine color . And it really does stay on your lips -LRB- its actually a little hard to take off -RRB- . The only thing I was disappointed about was the dirty tape on the lip color . I 'm not sure if they pulled it out from a really old bin or something but when I got it , I did not want to touch the dirty tape on it . And after I got over the tape and opened it , I loved it . I will try out more colors from them .
 I LOVE TO HIKE , BUT I ALSO LOVE BEING A WOMAN , AND WEARING MY LIPSTICK WITH MAYBELLINE SUPERSTAY , IT DOES THAT IT STAYS ON . I LOVE THE PRODUCT . I BOUGHT TWO OFF THEM . THANK YOU SELLER .
 I have just received my product ruby red I have yet too try it even though I am very anxious !! However I am quite puzzled to as why I received an additional tube of Rimmel 3d magnifying shock lipgloss I did not order & was unaware of its existence but strangely enough it was inside my package wit the maybelline lipcolor ? SN
 I just received mine now :--RRB- . Shipping took a little long but all worth it ... . they no longer sell these in stores -LRB- by be , that is -RRB- so I always try to buy as many as I can online ... I absolutely love this product ! It does stay long , but maybe not 16 hours BUT definitely long enough for you to notice ! I love this Petal 700 shade , it goes perfectly with my fair skin ! I apply it under my Mac bombshell lipstick which helps to stay a little longer . I always get compliments when I combine these two :--RRB- absolutely love !! I 've used others such as I do n't understand why they do n't sell them anymore in stores but thankful I 'm able to order it through you guys ! Will definitely be buying more !
 Love this long lasting lip color - my favorite!I wish Maybelline still made this but they do n't , so I better buy more while I can . Thanks !
 Love this lipstick & have worn it for several years , never failing to gather compliments . It really does last all day , even after eating , with a touch up with the included `` balm . '' Feels great on . Let the color dry completely before adding the balm , though , or it will come off while applying the balm . Bought this through Amazon from wehavegreatdeals4u and was extremely pleased with their fast service . I live in Hawaii and frequently encounter slow deliveries , so this really makes a difference to me .
 I love make up , I 'm the type that makes her own blends , less is more , born with it kind of look but never leave home with out it of girl . so I decided to try Maybelline Superstay lip color 16 hour color . The price was very right so I bought 3 ! Here is the trick apply lip color on clean lips then apply the balm . Because I 'm the lip gloss type I hate lipstick ! I applied a very light pink shade lip gloss on top of the balm and OH MY ! I 'm fell head over heels over this look ! definitively a you are born with it look , not to mention I think that 's what we see on TV an can never get the results of the model on TV . I feel like I have discover a very well kept secret girls ! So Does it last 16 hours ? yes IF you put it on right before you go to sleep ! I tried it but who does that anyway right ? Here is the thing , I put it on in the morning , forgot about it , ate breakfast , out I went , about noon for lunch I looked in the mirror and I could not believe I still had it on lip gloss and all ! It does n't last 16 hours of the day but I 'm fine with at least 6 ! My hint of advise , use very little , it will last linger but again it will also give you a natural born with it look . OH and by the way no taste . I rather no taste than something nasty that makes me sick . And it does n't peel off ! hope this helps ! I just love it !
 I was tired of my red lipstick always coming off , but I happened to find this product and I absolutely love it ! It stays on for a long time , even after meals . When you apply the color , your lips might feel dry but once you apply the conditioning balm , your lips feel smooth even after the lip balm wears off -LRB- the color stays on -RRB- . I highly recommend this!The shipping was great too.I will for sure be ordering again .
 This is a great product love the color.I had been looking for it for a long time in the stores so happy I finally found it . It came quick too . I would definitely order this product again .
 Love this lipcolor it last all day . Great looking lips . You put it in the morning drink , eat and it stays on.Love it , love it !
 I am verry happy with Body Time Spray-On Natural Body Moisturizer!I was a faithful user of Nivea Spray-On Moisturizer for several years . Unfortunately , Nivea discontinued this product.After an internet search , I located Body Time Spray-On Natural Body Moisturizer , and immediately ordered two bottles.In my opinion Body Time is better than Nivea . I will continue to purchase this product , and I have recommended it to my girlfriends.Renate Wagner
 After my breast cancer operation I did not want to touch my scar and yet the Radiation Oncologist advised me to rub cream on it ... Well , this was a life-saver to me as I could just spray it on my damp body and let it dry naturally.I love it and recommend to anyone - sick or not .
 This product works as advertised . Moisterizes very well after showering , and saves me slathering on white , thicker moisterizers that are common on the market . But for one bottle with shipping , you are basically getting spray on glycerin for $ 21.00 . There is an advantage to ordering multiple bottles at a time -LRB- recommend that -RRB- and the cost is much more reasonable . It does get tacky if you use too much . Best to spray and spread to get good coverage from less product . I would defintely recommend this for a replacement for the old , white moisterizers . You do n't have to slather questionable ingredients on or wonder if you will have cancer one day because you did . Safe , easy alternative . Also takes a lot less time .
 As a 10 year tanning veteran , I have quite a bit of experience with tanning lotions . Swedish Beauty has always been my favorite brand and I have tried many of thier lotions throughout the years - without bronzers , bronzers , tingle , blush , etc - and I can positively say that Priceless really is Priceless ! :-RRB- This is the best SB lotion I 've ever used . I go to a great salon with good beds and with this lotion will be able either go less often and maintain my tan or go the same amount and get super dark . I noticed the shade of my tan was darker the same day I tanned and I am excited to keep using this lotion ! It was explained to me that blush lotions are ` tingle free tingle lotions ' - make sense ? I have never been a fan of the tingle lines - maybe I 'm sensitive but they are pretty uncomfortable to me . This did n't feel any different than a regular lotion but has great results . It is a little more expensive than many lotions but you truly do get what you pay for . If you want a deep , dark , tan in a minimal amount of time this is the lotion for you!I ca n't believe I almost forgot to mention the scent !! Priceless smells wonderful ! It 's a light fruity scent that still smells great post tanning session ! You do n't need to immeditely shower - it smells great , but not TOO strong !
 Excellent smell -LRB- like cranberries -RRB- , applies easily , gives a great tanning boost without looking orange . I would n't say the bronzer lasts `` 8 days '' like some of the advertisements say for this product , but it sure does have a nice hold -LRB- at least one shower . I would recommend/buy this again .
 My hair is impossible to manage with any other conditioner on the market that I have used . I put this on and it softens my hair immediately and I can actually get the comb through it without splitting the ends . I LOVE IT .
 I had been using Pantene Hydrating Curls and had noticed no difference in my frizzy hair . Then I tried Thermasilk Curl Defining Shampoo and Conditioner , and it really helped . My hair was less frizzy and it looked healthier . However , I do n't particularly enjoy the scent . It 's not bad , but it could be better .
 I have long been a fan of alpha hydroxy lotions for my face , as they are a miracle for acne . This moisturizer is light , absorbs well and provides ample moisture even for dry skin . I could do without the strong peach fragrance though , which is the only reason I give it 4 stars . It 's a bit strong for me , but luckily the odor does not seem to last too long . The price is fair so I 'd recommend giving this a try if you have trouble with acne and dry skin .
 I have been using paul mitchell for a long time . I feel in love with the moisture line because it does a good job of cleaning without stripping the necessary oils out of my hair .
 Coty presented Wild Musk for women in 1973 its an extravagant fragrance containing vanilla , musk and various flowers . Its ideal for romantic wear . A must have in every womans arsonal of fragrances .
 I decided to spend a little more money on my shampoo and conditioner since my hair needed the extra help . Not to mention it needed the extra volume boost . I bought the paul mitchel extra body shampoo and conditioner and they work great ! I just love how my hair feels and looks . I have curly hair and some conditioners make my hair too soft to the point where it stops curling . This did not happen with this shampoo and conditioner . My curls look great ! I definitely recommend this product . It 's worth the money !
 I have used these products for years and would not use anything else on my hair . I am sensitive to perfumes and the shampoo is not offensive .
 Color is nice and very shiny ... I want every OPI color ... I wish they can come in a box with many tones . .
 I use to use Pureology until a girlfriend recommended Redken Smooth Down Shampoo and Conditioner . . I have been using it for a little over a month now and LOVE IT . . I also bought the Butter treatment that I have yet to use . I have what I personally call-THICK AND NAPPY hair and this stuff tames the inner Don King in me . Does n't leave build up , de-tangles the `` NAP '' and leaves my hair smelling great . .
 I love the coverage and consistency of this foundation . I am older -LRB- 39 -RRB- and it makes my skin seem dewy -- a feat that many other department store brands have not achieved , but the packaging is absolutely , atrociously bad . It is difficult to get any out of the bottle sometimes and other times , a huge blob that is more than I can possibly use comes out . You can not save what 's left over ; it must be thrown away . Please , Urban Decay , update the bottle or I will be forced to find another brand !
 I just love , love , love this product ! I tried this shampoo on my daughter 's hair because she was getting into the pool a lot this summer and I was concerned about the damage from the chlorine . Let me tell you this shampoo and the leave in conditioner that goes with it just leave her hair so soft and silky , I LOVE IT . And the smell is just wonderful , and it last a long time . It 's a good buy , definately .
 my daughter is a swimmer and she uses this product at least 5 times a week . It has a great smell and it makes her hair soft and manageable !
 I 'm bi racial and have naturally thick , curly , corkscrew hair . Also I have a relentless curl pattern , as I have started to get it relaxed and sometimes people ca n't even tell . Before I went chemical , I would go to a professional -LRB- a very well respected and expensive one at that -RRB- and get my hair heat straightened but it would last less than a week . I 've tried everything and I 'm only 20 . What I have learned about my tresses is whatever you take you must give back . I always follow the exact directions of my hairdresser after every service . I never skimp on my conditioner . I prefer my hair long , `` under control '' and healthy but my hair sucks in conditioner like a dirt devil . I sometimes even have to use deep treatments as a leave on.By far , this product impresses me more than any I have tried in it 's league and I consider it a staple . An affordable one at that . you just ahve to give it adequate time . In a MONTH of regular use my hair grew 2.5 inches , I had very little to no split ends and breakage , my scalp was healthy , the cuticle `` seemed sealed '' , hair was soft , and I used very little styling aid to control my waves.NO MORE MOP HEAD FOR ME !!!
 First of all , let me say if your hair is damaged beyond repair ... you will not see a change because your hair is shot . The first time I used this , my hair was in awful shape . I had been constantly changing my hair color for a few years , and I was n't cutting it that often . I used this and did n't really see any change , my hair felt a little softer but nothing drastic . THEN , my stylist talked some sense into me and said I HAD to cut off a few inches of hair and let it chill for a while . That was last summer . Now I have some bleach and color damage , and heat damage from using a flat iron and blow dryer daily . I gave this another shot because I still hear it 's the holy grail , and my hair is n't completely dead anymore . My hair feels AMAZING . It feels like silk , it looks so shiny and healthy . I have n't had time to get a trim since June so my ends were looking a little frizzy and dead , and now they look awesome . I would definitely get this !
 When i saw the reviews i was hopefull but i couldnt imagine that this purchase would be the best one i 've done since now.I have really curly hair , and it got soo dry on winter that started breaking , i was very upsted about my hair.But you can def feel the diference after the first aplication ! The best hair product im very happy ! and i cant stop touching my hair = -RRB-
 I am a white woman with soft long hair . The problem is that I have to wash it daily and after styling it can leave my hair dull and dry . Let 's not even add what a cold , dry winter day can do ... just think STRAW ! Anyways I found this at one of my local stores and it fixed my hair ! I left it in over night the first night and now I just use it daily . I never have heavy hair ... never oily ... I LOVE THIS STUFF ! Any of the other things that I have tried all left a layer of waxy build up in my hair after awhile ... not this ! Try it !
 Have always used Redken the best for my hair and does not leave it heavy or limp just soft and bouncy .
 My hairdresser introduced me to this and I 've used it ever since ... it really makes a difference to my very dry , extremely coarse curly hair , especially in the winter . It is an intensive formula and can be used as needed , rather than at every shampoo , so it will last .
 Just tried this last week for the first time to help my dried out and brittle high lighted hair . Very impressed after the first use . Went on Amamzon today to see if I could get a better price , very surprised as it is $ 2.50 more than what I paid at my salon .
 When I was 16 years old every few months I would get bright red and really light blonde highlights . My hair was very dry . To add to that , every single day I would use a wet-to-dry hair straightener with no thermal product and then when it was dry and straight , straighten it again . Needless to say , my hair was dead and falling out . I started using this per my hair stylist 's recommendation and it absolutely changed everything . My hair that would n't curl anymore got it 's beautiful curls back - and then some . I highly recommend this product.If your hair is really dry like mine was , my stylist recommended that I leave it in for 30 minutes twice a week at first .
 I have very coarse , very thick , very straight , dark blonde hair . I have n't had any chemical treatments , but I still need some help getting my hair to be soft . I am also in the process of growing out a very short hair cut , and my very thick hair needs some help laying down , rather than literally growing `` out '' . The day after I used All soft the first time , an acquaintance I see daily said `` your hair looks really soft . '' I was ready to cut all my hair off again because it was looking so terrible and coarse as it was growing out . This has calmed my hair down and it definitely looks and feels much softer . I am switching to All soft from my other salon conditioner .
 Love this deep conditioning product . Fancy salon or supermarket
 Just bought this as an exchange for Redken Extreme Cat , which was a disaster . Heavy Cream is an excellent conditioner that actually seems to be working to add smoothness , softness and shine . I have somewhat coarse blonde hair and a lot of damage , it 's been working wonderfully for me .
 One time I decided to get highlights on my dyed black hair . Big mistake ! My sister bought me this conditioning cream to fix my quickly drying hair . Although it did n't totally reverse the damage , I noticed it made my roots and nonhighlighted hair softer and better . I learned my lesson !
 I colored my hair with salon dyes at home , and the developer left my hair quite dry and almost straw-like , because I had forgotten to buy a deep conditioner -LRB- an essential step to avoid severe damage -RRB- . The next day , I decided to buy this conditioner because it said that not only would it repair damaged hair and soften it , but also was safe for colored hair . While Redken products have been pretty hit or miss for me , this is definitely one of their best . My hair was incredibly soft and smooth afterward , even healthier than it was before dying my hair . I use it about once or twice a week , and my hair looks and feels incredible . My hair color has not faded more than would be expected , so I would definitely suggest using this over the Color Renewal deep conditioner , which I did not have the same results with.Just remember , if your hair is severely damaged , a haircut is necessary in order to fix it . This product is perfect for a medium amount of damage , but if you have a lot of breakage and horribly split ends , this will not save it , though it can help prevent further damage until your next visit to your stylist . Overall , this is fantastic if your hair is dry and frizzy , if you need a deep conditioner to use after having it colored , or if you simply want hair that is light , soft , and silky .
 This product was exactly what I had expected , and it arrived in the estimated time given by the supplier .
 This perfume is a discontinued perfume . My favorite perfume . The delivery actually came alot earlier than expected . It was in perfect shape and brand new as advertised . The fragrance smelled like it always has smelled . I would definitely consider this to anyone .
 In my humble opinion , Palmer 's Hair Food is the best stuff ever . I was n't too sure about it when I had gotten it . The stuff looked like yellow-jello-gelatin-goop . Use too much , your hair will have that wet shine look to it and be greasy and stiff to the touch . Getting the right amount in your hair is a based on experience . This product was bought in November 2011 , it is now September 2012 and given I use it every one to two days , there is still half of it left . So a little goes a long way . My experience with Palmer 's Hair Food taught me to scoop a very small amount and rub it on my fingers and run said fingers into the length and ends of my hair and then comb scalp to end and style as usual . It 's been noted by my friends that this product is marketed towards ethic hair type . Is this is true , I do n't know . My hair is standard Asian -LRB- Indian , in fact -RRB- straight , black , waist length hair . And anyone who ever had the luxury of having long hair will tell you it is pain to maintain , much less keep your locks luxurious and healthy . Nevertheless , this product made my hair soft , shiny and manageable . So in the end , yes , I would recommend this product as it has worked for me . And remember ! A little goes a long way . : -RRB-
 Palmers Hair Food Formula has a nice texture . If it can hold up in the heat , i will recommend it . mike
 Ralph Lauren Cool stands out amongst the many fragrances on my bathroom counter - it 's bright pink and turquoise bottle screams SUMMER ! amidst a sea of other more subdued perfumes . It has a very clean and fresh scent that more than one person has complimented me on.It 's definitely a more young , playful fragrance than I 'm normally attracted to , but it 's one that still quite wearable to work , to the beach , anywhere , for anyone . If you 've been searching for a fragrance that is all about Summer 2004 , get this one before it 's gone .
 i first encountered ralph lauren , cool , when i was in the city shopping with some friends at sephora . as soon as i smelled it , i said `` wow , this smells so ... so ... cool ! '' its refreshing and delicious . it smells like you could eat it . its fresh and spunky and ive gotten many compliments from guys ; - -RRB-
 I love Ralph Cool . I think that it is a scent that enters the room as you do . I do n't really like floral scents , but I love Ralph Cool . Lasts long , and I get a lot of compliments !
 I absolutley love this scent . It is by far my favorite perfume and I get lots of compliments from my dog everytime I wear it
 The product was shipped very quickly , especially for being around Christmas . It smells great too ! Its the only scent I like my wife to wear .
 I am so sad my favorite perfume in the world has been discontinued . Stocked up giving myself a year to find a new scent !!
 finally a supplier who still has this perfume , it 's very hard to findthank you , keep it in stock for us perfume lovers
 Great floral scent ! kind of strong at first , but it settles in and becomes a warm pretty scent , i have gotten many compliments from guys and even my boyfriend asked if he could smell my stomach because that 's where i sprayed RL Cool !
 Stila Lip Glaze is perfect for a shiny yet moisturizing lip glaze . I just wish it was n't so expensive . The taste is n't all that great and I 'm not sure why there are some complaints about the way the tube works . You just turn the bottom of the tube , wait about ten seconds for the glaze to start coming up , and then brush on your lips . I keep looking for a cheaper alternative but I have n't found one yet ...
 Love the Stila brand & this color is fantastic ! Does n't try out ur lips & there is minimal flavor -LRB- which is great -RRB-
 I love Stila Lip Glaze ; it 's been my product of choice for several years now . It 's thick enough to make a difference when you have it on , but I love that Vanilla adds a nude shimmer to my lips without the fake-looking pink or red tint that I 've seen with some lip glosses . To each her own .
 This has staying power ! Not the revlon 8 hr type , just nice , thickens to your likeness and just a bit goes a long way . I love the sheer intensity of the color , and Amazon has it for a great price . It also does n't have that weird artificial flavor or smell that some glosses have which is always nice .
 I found out about stila cause my grandmothers friend used it.I was shocked when I saw the price but this seller had a cheaper one on sale . I bought grapefruit . It 's not the color for me cause its just like my natural lip color maybe lighter . There was another I wanted but before I could buy it it went out of stock . I think it would 've been a better color for me.Initially it took 10-15 + clicks to get it started . It takes about 5 clicks to get anything out for me now . I 'll admit I expected it to have more in it but you do n't need to use very much . It 's a lil gooey if you get to much.I would recommend this to anyone who wants a quality lip gloss.I 'll be posting pictures so be sure to check them out ! : -RRB-
 This is one of my beauty must haves . I am allergic to Chapstick and Vaseline and I can actually use this all day and everyday ! No matter how chapped my lips are this makes them so smooth ! Plus it tastes really good ! This is my favorite out of the Stila line . -LRB- I own like 10 colors -RRB- It is n't sticky or gooey and is so moisturizing ! This came new in the box and arrived in 2 days ! Once you try this you will be hooked like I am ! Plus I am usually allergic to ALOT of products and I am so happy I can use this !!
 Vanilla and Brown SugarA grown-up version of your favorite teenage gloss.it 's sticky so that may turn off some people , but I love it.pumped up , glossy , sexy lips , with a yummy flavor.the wand is like a click pen and the gloss is applied with a brush for control.I admit I am a bit addicted!What 's not to love ???
 Does a wonderful job . Really great product . Find that it keeps my hair in place and looks so natural . Great
 I stopped by a salon I 'd never visited before and my hair looked so wonderful and the spray was so light , yet had such great hold that when I got home I called the salon back and asked them what they 'd used . They told me about this Brocato Moveable Hold . Here in Florida I am always on the lookout for something that will work in our humidity and frequent rain storms . This hair spray fits the bill . The best part is that it does n't just stick your hair together . Your hair will move and look very natural but even in a wind storm it goes back to the style you started off with . I ca n't say enough wonderful things about this product . I love it so much I decided to try some other Brocato products and now that is all I will use . Thank goodness I can find it on Amazon !
 This mask is AMAZING ! Immediately after using it my face GLOWS and the texture is immediately softer and smooth . I have moderate acne , and this is by far the best face mask I have ever used . I feel like it literally clears up minor breakouts by the next morning . I even leave it on overnight as a spot treatment for those emergency fixes . I am SO EXCITED that I found it here , because my drugstore does n't sell it anymore , and I ca n't find it on drugstore.com , either -LRB- they usually have the products I ca n't find elsewhere -RRB- . I HIGHLY recommend this product - you 'll LOVE it !
 This mask is perfect for me , it takes care of cleaning , without stripping my skin , it makes pores smaller , feels refreshing and has a pleasant cucumber fragrance .
 I found this product to be very soothing to my skin when I was dealing with sun-caused acne . I highly recommend it for sensitive skin types . It helped heal and repair my skin .
 Dont let the other one star review sway you from this wonderful soap . Works just the same as the body wash , and really does make your skin glow and smooth your complexion . After about a week of useing the soap , I got many compliments about my `` glowing '' skin.I would reccommend it to anyone who wants a glowing complexion .
 I would 've given it 5 stars , but it was a little strong smelling . I would have ordered a lighter smell for a young girl .
 I like this product because it is not greasy and it stays on all day . I will recommend it to others .
 This prouduct is non geasy and really keeps dry skin smooth!I use Aveeno products but some items are hard to find .
 I 'm so happy to have found this moisturizer . I have terribly sensitive skin but unlike most people with sensitive skin , I do n't just get rashes or hives -LRB- which I do get from some things -RRB- . When my skin reacts to a product , it 's usually through an acne type of breakout within hours of using a product ... like on my arms and legs too . It could be noncomegenic and I will still breakout ... I 'm a strange animal I suppose . I think it 's quite odd and quite frustrating . Howver , my skin loves this moisturizer though and it makes me soooo soft while also leaving me with a light soft fragrance , which reminds me of a baby . Mind you , I can not put this on my chest , back , or face , but this is a big improvement !!! ... those are n't the areas I need it on anyways . It rubs in quickly and is not greasy at all . I hope other buyers enjoy it as much as I do . : -RRB-
 This is by far the best lotion I 've ever used . I should buy a case of it ! :-RRB- I even get it for my mother for every Christmas or birthday or Mother 's Day . : -RRB-
 I happened across this lotion when it came on sale at my local drugstore . I liked the idea of creamy oil so I gave it a try . It is an excellent moisturizer which disappears into my skin almost immediately . It handles the dryness but is so light I am not aware of it unless I brush my hand across my skin . It leaves a smooth and light protective layer . Really nice !
 This is a really excellent product - a moisturizer that provides comforting softness to your skin without being greasy or heavy . Your skin is smooth and silky to touch after use of this , and the light almond scent is very pleasing . I 've used products that are much more expensive yet never gotten such a great result . I recommend this without hesitation , especially if your skin is uncomfortable in the wintertime .
 I 'm stationed near the North Pole , it 's not a very humid place , so whatever I thought I knew about dry skin , chapped lips , and winterburn , I 've had to forget and learn from scratch . With -80 windchill and 175 mph winds , skin care is an absolute must here . I trust Aveeno , it works , it does n't feel like oil or plastic , it has that familiar oatmeal scent . One application after a morning shower and shave and i 'm good to go all day .
 Love love love this ! Oil whipped up into a super lightweight and instantly absorbed souffle ! Softens , moisturizes , leaves no greasy or waxy feel - melts into the skin like buttah LOL . Pleasant subtle fragrance . Friendly to sensitve skin .
 I have 3 cats and one little shihtzu that is piddle pad trained so I wash my hands dozens of times throughout the day . They get so dry that they crack and hurt so I was looking for a good hand cream that did n't feel heavy or leave a greasy feeling . Hard to find one that does all that , but this one is perfect ! It absorbs right in and feels so light , yet leaves my hands feeling so soft . When I first used it , my knuckles were actually so cracked they were bleeding and that cleared up in one day of use . It has an amazing scent as well that make it a total winner . I just ordered another bottle to have in my kitchen . Love it . Totally satisfied with price as well because I have paid much more for a good cream .
 Not as expected in oil form . It 's like another moisturizer . Also quite like the natural scent of the lotion . Good for someone allergic to strong artificial scent like me ~
 I suffer from dry cracked hands and this product does not sting my hands as other brands do . I recommend this product to people with itchy dry skin .
 Ive always been a lover of Aveeno products . . I absolutely hate creams and lotions because of the sticky-ness hence the reason i decided trying this product ... -LRB- as the product description advertised - not sticky -RRB- Was soo glad I bought this . . Exact to description definitely not sticky and leaves your skin soft and moisturized . . I would not be buying anything else after this !
 I am suffering with very dry skin as a result of cancer radiation etc . This product is like a miracle , goes on so easily and absorbs quickly ... My dry skin has improved remarkably .
 This product is hard to find on shelves in my area , on the rare occasion I or my mom would see it we would buy up like 3 bottles at a time . I have just started buying it on Amazon instead . I love that it absorbs quickly and does n't leave my hands greasy -LRB- I HATE having greasy hands -RRB- but still leaves my hands feeling soft and moisturized . The scent is light and pleasant , similar to the scent of the other aveeno products . I 'll also use it on my legs after shaving and on any other dry/itchy patches I might have on my skin and the oatmeal in it really does seem to help calm the itching .
 Aveeno lotion is the best , it 's not greasy and not watery ! Really works well for sensitive skin and dry skin !
 This product shipped quickly and was just in time for some stressful days . Every time I put this lotion on I feel a little bit more calm and collected . It 's non-greasy and lasts for awhile . It keeps skin soothed and soft .
 I bought this to go with the stress relief body wash . I will say that when you first put it on , it smells weird -LRB- old lady ish -RRB- , but after a minute it smells just like the body wash . It moisturizes wonderfully . Highly recommended !
 Sent this to my daughter while she was pregnant , now she does n't go without it . The scent last a long time and is very moisturizing .
 I have been using the original non-scented version for a very long time . I have psoriasis which makes it hard to find a lotion gentle enough and moisturizing enough . I also hate the greasy feeling . This lotion has all of that , and now I found a smell I like which does n't irritate my super sensitive skin . My husband loves the smell too and he does n't usually notice little things like that .
 I have been using this brand for a long time and it smells great without being overpowering . It soaks in and protects my dry skin .
 Smells nice , like a rose water , light weighted , easy to obsorb but moisture , good stuff !!! Yes I will hightly recommend this product
 I have to give this lotion five stars because it 's the only body lotion that I 've found is gentle enough to also use on my face and neck . I put it on at night and after showers , and it 's kept my skin in great shape -LRB- no breaking out like I usually do from other body lotions -RRB- . It 's light but still moisturizing , and is n't like other body lotions that are heavy with scent or feel too thick to slather on your cheeks . This is my go-to lotion for everywhere
 Its a nice moisturizing and stress relieving lotion . Soothing and sets my skin at ease . Works throughout the day . I use it daily after showers . Its smooth and doesnt have that oily feeling . When it gets to the end I break open the bottle so I can get to the lotion all the way at the bottom its so good I love it .
 I try to use most Aveeno products and I think it 's great for my babies sensitive skin . Not too crazy about the smell though .
 This is the best hand lotion I 've ever found . I love it - it does n't leave your hands greasy and lasts for hours . It is easier to order online since many stores do n't have it in stock or are all sold out .
 I love this lotion , the smell is delicious and I feel my skin very soft after use it . THIS SELLER WAS VERY FAST AND RESPONSIBLE WITH THE SHIPPING ... AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT AND SERVICE . I 'll buy again , THANKS !
 The Colloidal Oatmeal in the Aveeno Products is the reason I keep buying them , even if I 'm not overly excited about smoothing petrolatum over my skin.I wish these products were all natural . I have noticed the oatmeal has a calming effect on my skin and the addition of Lavender , Chamomile and Ylang-Ylang is emotionally healing.The minute you put this cream on your skin , you can feel the difference . Your skin becomes calm , soothed and smooth and silky . Perfect for after a shower or during the day when you need a calming moment . ~ The Rebecca Review
 Bought this one after a long time research on body lotions . Finally get this one with no parabens -LRB- threw away my old lotions because of this -RRB- . The smell is so good , not so strong and comfort enough . It does a good job moisturizing my dry skins and is non-sticky ... Will definitely buy more in the future
 I have serious skin issues -LRB- eczema and allergies -RRB- and have been through many products and this one seems to work best for me . It is not greasy or oily and it has a very light scent . Great price , fast shipping and it works for me !
 I love to go barefoot ! The moment I enter my humble abode , or anywhere else where bare-feet are tolerated , off come the shoes . It 's a little rebellion , I think , from all the wear and tear my feet and legs have had to endure as an RN . Those little pinkies just scream to be free from the confinement of those , very necessary , athletic shoes.Going barefoot has its bad side , though . My feet become very dry and calloused -LRB- yep , I can walk on rocks and acorns without flinching -RRB- , and my heels are prone to cracking . Not a pretty sight ! I have tried every remedy out there from , ` Miracle Foot Cream , ' to cow udder cream , all to no avail . Some seemed to actually make the situation worse.I was already enjoying Aveeno 's Stress Relief formula for overall body moisturizing , becoming increasingly impressed that it actually DID moisturize for 24 hours , as advertised . So , I put it to the ultimate test . I applied it liberally to my feet , put on some light socks , and left them on overnight . I was absolutely astonished at the difference in just one night . My feet were soft , and the cracked heels began to heal . After a few more overnight applications , my feet are almost brand new , for the first time , in years.If this lotion can moisturize neglected feet/heels resulting in this much difference , it is a no-brainer , that it can moisturize the rest of the body with ultimate efficiency . And , while nurturing your skin , you can enjoy the scent of lavender , chamomile and ylang-ylang , all embraced in aromatherapy for their calming , stress reducing , properties.Give it a try ! A little goes a long way , and for the results received , the cost is fabulous !
 I mainly use this on my kids . When my daughter was a baby she had dry skin and rashes . . I used to use a different baby lotion but the rashes would n't go away . Her pediatrician recommended Aveeno so we tried it and her rashes went away -LRB- and pretty quickly too -RRB- ; I 've been using Aveeno on her ever since . I love the way this stress relief smells ... It 's a bit flowery so if you do n't like that scent do n't get this . But I use this on my two girls and myself so it saves me from buying different lotions.Amazon price comparable to Walmart and Target . . not too much differenceBOTTOM LINE
 This gentle lotion with its pleasant aroma serves many purposes . It is good for smoothing skin ; acting as a stress buster and softening your skin . It is ideal if you have corns and calluses . Just use a little bit and it will treat your skin as gently as a well fitted glove . Add to it is that it is reasonably priced and you will get your money 's worth each time you use this .
 I adore this lotion ! I made sure to smell it when I was in the store to make sure I enjoyed the smell . I find that it is really calming and does go on my skin well . In the winter months , my legs get really dry and itchy . I now use this every night after a shower and my legs have n't been as dry and the lotion also calms the itching . With the subscribe and save , the price is cheaper than my local stores as well . I highly recommend this lotion .
 I really like this lotion . It smells great and feels nice . It 's a little on the spendy side , but it 's a good product .
 Aveeno is just a great product . It smells good and I gave to a friend and she loved it . Soft skin .
 i absolutely love this brand especially with the lavender . it reminds me of the oder from lavender fields during my summer stay in Provence , France . not to oily and just right !
 If your like me and your looking for quick results , this is the product for you . This works best on clean dry skin . An immediate difference is seen around the jaw line since I have slight jowels and this product eliminates them giving a firming affect . It also does eliminate any slight bags you may have from no sleep or a long day . I sometimes use this product twice a day . Once in the morning when I wake up then in the evening before going out works fantastic . I highly recommend this product !
 I love the product itself , but the price is just a lot for this product when you can get it in Dillards or Nordstroms for approximately $ 180.00 cheaper .
 Such a nice way to end the day . I use the lotion as well ... Love the smell !
 I have been using Aveeno lotions and other products since being recommended to use it after a severe allergic reaction to Penicillin as a child . Now as an adult , I tend to get dry skin , especially after showering . I started using the Aveeno Stress Relief Foaming Bath months ago and my skin has completely changed . It not only feels better , but it looks great ! My skin has never been so moisturized . I use the Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion line after showering or bathing and its the best combination . Not only does it really make you feel more relaxed , but it smells great !
 I have very dry skin and have tried many different kinds of lotion . This is the type I 'm pleased with the most . It stays on for a long time and does n't feel sticky or too rich like some other lotion . The smell is great too ! I will definitely buy some more when i 'm done with this bottle !
 Stila Lip Glaze is perfect for a shiny yet moisturizing lip glaze . I just wish it was n't so expensive . The taste is n't all that great and I 'm not sure why there are some complaints about the way the tube works . You just turn the bottom of the tube , wait about ten seconds for the glaze to start coming up , and then brush on your lips . I keep looking for a cheaper alternative but I have n't found one yet ...
 Love the Stila brand & this color is fantastic ! Does n't try out ur lips & there is minimal flavor -LRB- which is great -RRB-
 I love Stila Lip Glaze ; it 's been my product of choice for several years now . It 's thick enough to make a difference when you have it on , but I love that Vanilla adds a nude shimmer to my lips without the fake-looking pink or red tint that I 've seen with some lip glosses . To each her own .
 This has staying power ! Not the revlon 8 hr type , just nice , thickens to your likeness and just a bit goes a long way . I love the sheer intensity of the color , and Amazon has it for a great price . It also does n't have that weird artificial flavor or smell that some glosses have which is always nice .
 I found out about stila cause my grandmothers friend used it.I was shocked when I saw the price but this seller had a cheaper one on sale . I bought grapefruit . It 's not the color for me cause its just like my natural lip color maybe lighter . There was another I wanted but before I could buy it it went out of stock . I think it would 've been a better color for me.Initially it took 10-15 + clicks to get it started . It takes about 5 clicks to get anything out for me now . I 'll admit I expected it to have more in it but you do n't need to use very much . It 's a lil gooey if you get to much.I would recommend this to anyone who wants a quality lip gloss.I 'll be posting pictures so be sure to check them out ! : -RRB-
 This is one of my beauty must haves . I am allergic to Chapstick and Vaseline and I can actually use this all day and everyday ! No matter how chapped my lips are this makes them so smooth ! Plus it tastes really good ! This is my favorite out of the Stila line . -LRB- I own like 10 colors -RRB- It is n't sticky or gooey and is so moisturizing ! This came new in the box and arrived in 2 days ! Once you try this you will be hooked like I am ! Plus I am usually allergic to ALOT of products and I am so happy I can use this !!
 Vanilla and Brown SugarA grown-up version of your favorite teenage gloss.it 's sticky so that may turn off some people , but I love it.pumped up , glossy , sexy lips , with a yummy flavor.the wand is like a click pen and the gloss is applied with a brush for control.I admit I am a bit addicted!What 's not to love ???

 I am a baby boomer concerned now about drying skin . This product was a miracle for me . It is the only body wash I would ever consider using because it is so effective and it also smells lovely !
 My wife is very picky and she received this Crazy Curl Balm as a sampler in a large order of other products . Good job ... Alagio ... of all the very mediocre products with lying ads Alagio is understating a very nice product .
 I have used this eye cream since Sept. 2003 , sometimes twice a day . The jar lasted until July 2004 . I have been very pleased with the results . My only wish is that it would be less perfumed ; however , I intend to buy it again in the fall .
 The best eye cream ever although it is very hard to find in the US . You can never go wrong with this product , a must buy .
 It 's my favorite eyecream ! It is somewhat costy but it does last forever ! I 've had mine for 2 months now and I use it 2 times a day . I bet I can use it for atleast another month . I really recommend it ! I 've been a beautician for 11 years and I have gone through many eyecreams . This is still my favorite !
 This eye and lip gel helps keep my fair skin around my eyes and lips from looking like crepey . I have tried others over the years and always return to this product over and over again
 I love the color of this lip liner . It 's the best match for my skin tone I 've ever found . I 've never been a fan of self sharpening lip liners . This is one you have to sharpen .
 I was so pleased to find this color lip liner , which seemed to have all but disappeared from the shelves of stores.The delivery time frame was fine and it was packaged very well .
 Great product . This is a gorgeous color with clear gloss over . Kim Kardashian cute ! The only thing that could be better is if iy was self sharpening .
 I love this color , it 's a great shade and flexible . The only bad part about it is it 's a pain to find / get .
 Prestige lip liner is the best ! It is not greasy and really does stay on all day . I also love the pink colors available for us blondes . the product arrived very quickly and I am very satisfied with this purchase .
 This is a favorite product . I love the pale color that does n't overpower the lip shape .
 had a hard time this as it was out of stock alot of places . that may be because its great . a perfect color for me as my skin is white and i have dark hair . its pale and natural like real lips but better .

 I thought I was getting the green tea Back to Basics serum because that is what was pictured and I really liked the green tea serum I had before , but I was sent a different serum . I should have sent them back -- have used them some , but do n't think I like them as well as the green tea .
 I love this stuff . I like it for when I pull back my hair or if there is no time to blow dry my hair . It helps with no friz . It also does not leave any of that white residue like other products do . It does not necessarily thicken my hair , but it does feel weightless and holds great .
 great product and fast delivery . i need some more so i know where to go now
 I have rosacea and this product is great for hiding it , along with uneven skin tone , and tiny spider veins . I highly recommend this product .
 Great price , delivered early and was exactly what I wanted ! :-RRB- I love bare minerals and am a bran loyal customer but do n't always have time to get to the store and it can get quite pricey when you use it everyday but it 's the best foundation out there !
 I have tried many foundations over the years and this is by far the best I have ever tried . There are many reasons as to why it is but I 'm just going to name a couple . First of all , I have dry skin and I have to moisturize before applying any make up . I 've tried liquid foundations that are geared towards people with dry skin and none of them have worked for me . They usually look greasy , settle into my pores/lines or just slide off within a couple of hours . I like that I can use a moisturizer that I like and use bareMinerals over it . It feels light -LRB- like I 'm not wearing anything -RRB- and covers most imperfections without looking caked on . Even if you have a blemish or age spot it can be blended away . You can use a smaller make up brush to add a little extra to those areas and it works really well . You can use that technique for dark circles as well . On a final note , let me say how impressed I am with it 's staying power . Summers are very humid here and there is nothing more frustrating than doing your make up only to have it sweat right off 5 minutes after you walk out the door . Somehow bareMinerals holds up . Love it ! That is all : -RRB-
 I have never tried out the bareMinerals product line before , but everyone spoke so highly of it , so I thought it 'd be worth a try . I used the color match images provided by the seller to find my right color . The product looks great for the most part , however , I picked a color a little too light for me , so next time , I would go with the shade a little darker so it also will work when I 'm tan . The package came quickly and it perfect condition . Would definitely work with this seller again !
 I 've used BareMinerals for years and ca n't praise it enough . This was a replacement/refill for me . The clicking insert was something new to me and I find it REALLY helps cut down on the product being spilled .
 perfect for that summer tan color on sun protected faces !! I would definitely purchase again ! -- -- -- -- -
 This is my favorite foundation . I have sensitive skin and I am very acne prone but this foundation helps keep my breakouts away by wearing it . I never use to wear makeup because of hour I break out but this really helps . I have n't tried much else of bare minerals but I am slowing trying new things . This color is perfect for my winter complextion . its very light but it makes me feel like I am not a ghost !
 I love this makeup . It goes on easily and stays and stays . Not pancakey and the powder is light but has good coverage . This is a great price for this makeup too .
 I have very oily acne prone skin . When I put this makeup on , my skin is transformed into beautiful dewey flawless skin . It truly is amazing . One container lasts me a whole year . I love it . I love how natural it looks . I would never wear anything else . I only wish I had discovered it sooner .
 I hardly ever wear makeup -- maybe on the weekends , and I never wore foundation until trying the bare minerals about two years ago . I am quite satisfied with the results . I originally ordered the `` light '' foundation , but it was too yellow on me . I ordered `` fairly light '' and am happy with the color . It gives me a put together look . I have lots of freckles and DARK circles around my eyes . I do n't look overly made up -- just fresh and pretty -LRB- I use their dry eye liner in `` bark '' and the `` glee '' as blush and a little mascara -RRB- . The bare minerals foundation lets my freckles show through . I ca n't seem to get it to cover my dark circles the way the models on the tv commercial do , but nothing can cover my circles . The line is kind of expensive ; but I do n't use a lot , so it 's lasting a long time and still working well . I have purchased it at qvc.com -LRB- they have a wide selection of colors and varieties -RRB- and the dermstore.com -LRB- they are less expensive but not as wide a selection -RRB- . I recommend it !
 This make-up is perfect for me . I 'm young , and do n't have dry skin . Forothers this product might not be the best ... so I offer you this ... CONS ------------------------------------------------------------------ First ... Not good for dry or wrinkled skin ... sorry . I tried my makeup on my mom -LRB- in her 50s -RRB- and it just did n't look right . If you have a pretty good number of wrinkles , sorry not gon na work.You must moisturize ! If you do n't moisturize you 'll get dry skin . Which is good for me ... good for the skin.PROS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Quick and Easy ! You can literally put it on in seconds . You can touch up the spots you need to quick -LRB- under eye circles , blemishes -RRB- and brush over your face to make your complexion smoother . -- Fresh , not heavy , Does n't feel or look like you have any makeup on . Awesome in that department . -- Leave it on at night ? - Hell yeah ! I like that if I forget to wash it off it 's not a big deal . Which tells you it can be bad for you skin . -- Stays on well.It 's great for me . I 'm in the military and I do n't want all the guys to know I 'm wearing makeup but I want to be confident . I apply enough to even my skin tone and cover imperfections -LRB- me no ! -RRB- Perfect ! Bare Minerals Works great for me because it 's so fast and easy not as messy as foundations . I was told about it by a friend and I would not go back to liquid foundation again . Hope I help someone make a good choice .
 This is the absolute best foundation I have ever found ! You can control how much you put on depending on the brush you use . I typically use the flawless face brush or the kabuki brush for full coverage to cover up blemishes . The best part about this foundation is you do n't need to buy a separate concealer , just use a smaller brush and apply right over the blemish and it 's gone ! I love it . It 's so light on your face but it provides enough coverage but not too much so it 's cakey . I 'm all for the natural makeup look and this stuff is perfect !
 I am 23 and have true combination skin -- oily , acne-prone T-zone with some dryness everywhere else . I have medium brown skin -LRB- I am Indian -RRB- . I got the starter kit and use medium beige foundation first , then warmth , and then sometimes mineral veil -LRB- it has talc -RRB- . I am not allergic to bismuth oxychloride . This makeup went on more smoothly and evenly than other makeup I have tried before . The little concealer brush plus the foundation actually improved my dark circles and little redness around my nose better than any other concealer I 've had . So , all in all , I use this makeup every day -LRB- I have for about two months now -RRB- , and I really like it.BUT : -- If I apply too quickly or too heavily , I get a pinkish-white sheen that looks plain weird on my dark skin -LRB- if I apply lightly , no problem -RRB- . -- It does feel slightly prickly if I apply it when my skin is too dry -LRB- this feeling goes away as the day goes on -RRB- . -- The people at the store have no clue what they are doing . I am a biology major and a med student and NO MAKEUP should be left on overnight , especially something as fine and potentially pore-clogging as this . Also , they recommended a shade that was too light for my skin and made me look like a pink clown . When I went back -LRB- to a different lady in a different store -RRB- and said it did n't match , the lady applied the shade I suggested on one half of my face and the old shade on the other and said , `` Well look ! You can wear both ! '' Yes , I CAN wear both , but I SHOULD only wear one ! The one that matches!Finally , they really do the hard sell in the store . The lady wanted me to buy everything in sight , and when she put the makeup on me , she CAKED it on . Nothing looks good on the face with that kind of application . Plus , she really buys into every little piece of marketing crap about every product in the store . They do not have a good eye -- they think that buying shades that do not blend into your skin `` gives you color '' . They are right . They give you unnatural color that looks as artificial as they do . -- Although this makeup has reduced the number of big pimples I get , I occasionally get a tiny red bump somewhere that did n't happen before . It is pretty easy to cover.CONCLUSION : -- I moisturize my face more now than I did before using this product . -- I wait five or ten minutes , then apply it with a light hand in about 5 minutes -LRB- foundation , warmth , sometimes veil -RRB- . I do not use barevitamins or whatever . It 's too harsh . -- I 'm good to go .
 I have been using Bare Minerals since 2004 , and I have to say I am pleased to have not had to buy anything else for face coverage . This is what I do n't like : - The packaging is horrible . It 's making me not want to buy it anymore . It 's just such a stubborn packaging and it spills , and sticks and does n't screw on right . This not only delays time but stains your white counter tops with all the makeup that spills out . Maybe it 's all marketing , make poor packaging to spill the make up so you buy more . - If your skin is a little on the dry side , make sure to use a primer or face lotion because it accents your dry spots , as it is a powder . And sometimes it can come on a little pale looking , so compare shades to get the best out of them . - The powder sometimes falls onto your eyelashes when you 're applying above the eye , so use in moderation and blend it well into the brush . Do n't use alot , you 'll waste it.And now the good : - I think it blends very well with the warmth , bisque or any other of the Bare Minerals powders . It really keeps your skin looking natural with a healthy glow . - Does an above average job of concealing . You may have to reapply more than once throughout the day though . - I have naturally clear skin , and this does n't cause skin irritation or breakouts . It does n't clog my pores , and I could leave this on while sleeping if I have too . But I do n't , I still want to wash my face . But it 's nice knowing it 's healthy enough for your skin and non liquid based . - The SPF 15 or above , great idea.All in all , this is a great product for the price and it lasts pretty long too -LRB- 3-4 months -RRB- . Even though I hate the containers , I guess it has n't been a deal breaker for me yet , - though I hope they 'd redesign the packaging soon .
 After considering Bare Minerals for a very long time , I bit the bullet and decided to give it a try . I hate wearing foundation , but I do n't have perfect skin , or even really really nice skin . So I have to fake it with make-up . I was coping pretty well with a liquid foundation and concealer from MAC , but really wanted something drier.First of all , using the tap-swirl-buff method the way the DVD advertised resulted in practically no coverage . I had to use more and more to get anywhere , even after using the concealer brush . Because of this , the foundation did n't last too long . Seeing as how I dropped a good chunk of change on Bare Escentuals , I am not too pleased about this.Second , sleeping in this made me feel kind of icky . I was n't as greasy as I would have been had I slept in my MAC foundation , but grease is grease.Finally , the aforementioned tap-swirl-buff method also covered every surface in my bathroom with a fine patina of medium-beige covered mineral powder . This means I have to clean my bathroom more frequently . How is THAT fair ?! To counteract all of the negative points , I would like to say that once the make-up was on and applied and everything , I liked the way it looked . It took me a while to get the blend down pat -LRB- I 'm multiracial and have an in-between skin shade -RRB- , but once I got it mixed to a shade I liked , it looked alright . And I was able to spend a day out in the sun and heat and not have a nasty , sticky , oily T-zone . That in itself speaks volumes!Overall , it 's not a bad product . But due to my experience with how long it lasts , I 'm sticking to my MAC foundation for now . It goes much further , and covers better .
 Bought online , which was not good for first time user ; shade is n't quite right , although close . If you have n't used this stuff , then it 's necessary to read the instructions , or your 're likely to come out with `` pasty face '' like I did the first couple of times I tried ! < grin > Not at all portable for work.Good coverage , needs touch-up at least one time during work day.Needs the right brush to use it well ; the tool truly matters here .
 Let me start by saying , I have terrible , awful , terrible , terrible skin !!! I get dry , scaly patches , but I 'm also an oil slick . I 'm prone to bad acne , and at 25 , I have to say , IM SICK OF IT !! I ca n't fix my skin , BUT Bare Escentuals has helped to improve it . Not only the texture , but the blotchy redness is gone -LRB- well , with the make-up on , of course -RRB- , the acne is GONE -LRB- !!!!! -RRB- I have a very loving husband who adores me , but I 've always been awfully self-conscious of my skin . After a week of using Bare Minerals , my husband actually pointed at a make-up model in a magazine , and said , `` Your skin looks like hers ! `` Personally , I would recommend this product to every living creature on the planet . My only gripe is that it 's a little pricey ... but it 's worth the self esteem I 've gained !!
 Have been using this mineral makeup for years . It 's light , does n't even feel like it 's there . Does n't clog pores , been if you sleep in it . Stays on well .
 same product as in fancy stores . better price . i love the &#34; no make up &#34; look that gives me a younger and even complection .
 This price was just to good to be true ! I thought it could n't be for real . Was skeptical but had to give it a try for this price . I love Bare Escentuals and have been using it for years ... just ca n't get over this pricing ! It was exactly as described ... so order with confidence ... no worries !! This stuff is great !! Thanks for the great price and fast shipping !!
 Long-lasting , I used it every day for full coverage over liquid makeup since August and just ran out mid-December . Love it !
 This was a gift from a wishlist for my girlfriend who uses bareMinerals on a daily basis . Very well priced on Amazon as compared to retailers -LRB- which I would expect -RRB- and it was exactly what she asked for . Picked up 2 of them to last her a few months .
 Air like this product . I got it first time , because I had a gift card for sephora and decided to try nice powder . I use it with primer under and it makes it lay better
 As a person with very sensitive skin I thought I could n't wear make-up until I found Bare Escentuals . I wear this absolutely every day and love that they have diversified their shades a bit . This is a perfect match for my slightly pale and rosey skin tone .
 I have never worn foundation in my life . I hated being able to feel it on there , & I hated the effort of washing it off every night & how long it took to put on . This has solved all those problems . Applying the foundation takes maybe 30 seconds . I do n't feel like I have anything on my face at all . Family was telling me how nice I looked , but when I told them I was wearing foundation they were surpised . It looked so natural . And this stuff wo n't hurt your skin if you leave in on at night . So no big hassle when you 're tired & want to go to bed . The starter kit is the way to go ; I was going to try just the foundation & was glad I got the starter kit . It 's a really good deal over buying the things seperately as well .
 I can certainly related to all the 20 plus posted comments about this product both good and bad . I too suffer from post acne , large pores , and oily skin . The first time I tried BareMinerals I was like a few of you , couldnt see a difference , didnt know if I was putting it on right , didnt have the right color -LRB- being that I am a woman of color -RRB- thought it was a was of money . And you know what I threw away the first foundation jar never to buy it again , until I saw the infomerical about the product and of course , a shopping channel that will remain nameless that sells this particular product . So I decided to try one more time . What made me a believer the second time around was that I made sure of a few things : Always use `` Mineral Veil '' first as a primer.Then use `` Warmth '' as a concealer , highlighter and any other imperfections.Make sure you always `` Buff , Tap , Swirl '' everything time . It is a certain way you have to work into the skin.And lastly to use `` Mineral Veil '' as a finishing powder.I will say this , I do disagree with Leslie saying all you need is a little of the powder and that 's that . No makeup artist worth their grain can ever create such a perfect canvas for the skin just by using one product and very little of the product . Not going to happen . You may need a several `` swirls , taps , buffs '' to get the look , you may need to use moisturizer in the powder so your face wo n't dry out . You might need to custom blend several shades to get that color you always wanted . It happens.All I am saying is that the product does work , if you are willing to work with it , unless you have a severe reaction to it by all means get your money back . I gave this product a second chance and now that Leslie has added three new shades for women of color I am glad I did !!!!
 This is the best thing I have ever bought . I can look good and natural at the same time , it is amazing.Now , I have to be honest . When I saw this product on tv on commercials and the advertisement on the channel QVC , I did n't really all the way believe it . But at one point I got so frustrated about my makeup -LRB- I have tried almost everything that 's possible for foundation -RRB- , I went right online one night and order it . It has a return guarantee , so what did I have to lose ? And everyone has said such great things about it , I just had to try it . If I did n't like it , I 'd just take it back ... When I first received it in the mail my first reaction was -- `` it is this small ? '' Really , it 's smaller than I thought , but I figured out why after I used it . I think this stuff will last me for years ! I only have to use just a tiny bit to cover my whole entire face -- it is sooo amazing.My old makeup was awful ! Let me explain . I have very oily skin and acne scars , so finding the right makeup is difficult . I have worn liquid makeup for quite some time now , and let me tell you it was not my solution . I put it on and two hours later it has already melted off my face . To cover my acne scars , I first have apply concealer , but that only made my face look the more `` unnatural . '' And since my face is oily , liquid only makes my face look shiny and greasy , plus unnatural.When I put Bare Minerals on my face , I was so shocked . -LRB- 1 -RRB- It took such a tiny amount to cover my entire face -LRB- 2 -RRB- It looks so natural , I do n't even look like I 'm wearing any makeup , yet my face looks flawless -LRB- 3 -RRB- It gave me a little glow -LRB- 4 -RRB- It actually covered my acne scars !!! -LRB- not the pimples though -RRB- I love it !! The price was so worth it and I will never , ever wear liquid again!This stuff is a dream . I love that it also has sunscreen . And just the fact that I 'm not putting harmful ingredients on my face makes it all so wonderful . I do n't have to worry about the effects of liquid makeup -- blemish causing and early wrinkles . It 's safe to actually sleep in this stuff !!! Wow . How natural can you get?Bare Minerals is so wonderful . It makes your skin flawless but natural . If you were like me and do n't have a makeup solution , what do you have to lose to try this great stuff ? It 's money back guarantee , and I 'm sure you 'll love it . Every female should try it !
 I 'm a 50-something brown-skinned Black woman with sensitive combination skin . My skin also has some dark spots due to psoriasis . I love a flawless matte finish and had tried everything from Estee Lauder 's custom blended Prescriptive to Black Opal and everything in-between including Fashion Fair , Iman , Mary Kay and Flori Roberts . They were either too dark , too orange , too heavy , too dead , lacked oil control , or transferred to whatever ! Just as I had resigned myself that I 'd never get the look and feel I really wanted , it was suggested I try bareMinerals system . I had just run out of MAC so the timing was right . Since it 's a totally different cosmetic system and application process , I followed a suggestion from this review board and went to Sephora to get professional guidance.I bought the warm deep/deepest deep starter kit -LRB- which comes with a DVD -RRB- and immediately started practicing . Much to my surprise , I liked it !!! I was very pleased with the flawless coverage , my skin could breathe , and it did n't transfer ! That 's not all . The dark spots were totally concealed and my face < u > felt < / u > wonderful to touch ! EUREKA !!! When I went to church , women were actually complimenting me on having such clear soft-looking skin . Can you say Shock and Awe !!! This really is a 5-star product . However , I withheld one star because brown to dark-skinned women may have to experiment blending both the foundations provided with the warmth booster to get their exact foundation color . This could be an expensive proposition since you 'll be using several pots simultaneously and replenishing at the same rate . $ $ $ BTW
 While I like this product in general , it is not a perfect product . In order to give a fair review , there are few things to consider : - Since the product itself is nothing more than colored minerals , what brushes you use with this product are very important . - This is a great product if you have descent skin . It offers enough coverage to even out your skin tone and still looks natural -LRB- which I like -RRB- Using a stiff brush , you can also cover up minor spots and blemishes . - However , when I have a break out -LRB- any thing more than a few zits -RRB- , this product is not going to perform any miracle . It can not offer the same coverage as a real concealer , and it will not correct bad skin texture . - When I got stressed , my skin becomes very dry or flaky , then the power is simply not gon na stick , and could actually make you look worse . - Because of its translucent quality , you do n't need to get a dead on color match and still looks goodAll things considered , I do like this product . On days when my skin behaves , it really gives you that natural , dewed look . I would also recommend you wear a light moisturizer or foundation primer before you apply , -LRB- I recommend Laura Mercier Foundation Primer -RRB- so it will gives you a smooth surface to work with .
 This is the best foundation ! I was tired of my regular liquid foundation melting after only two or three hours -LRB- I have combination/oily skin -RRB- . This foundation stays put and puts up with oil and humidity -LRB- it does not , however , stand up against 100 degree + weather -RRB- . Still , I will never use another foundation.When is question of what shade , I recommend getting to a Sephora store and having an associate help you . If that is not convenient , and you are debating between shades , I recommend picking the lighter shade . I was surprised how dark the Medium Beige shade was , even when I apply it lightly . The Light shade is suitable for most Asian woman -LRB- like me -RRB- and Caucasian women who are not extremely fair .
 While this is n't the miracle product the commercials claim , it is a one of the better foundations that I 've used . It provides good coverage , and it 's very lightweight . It does have a tendancy to look cake-y if you use too much , and using the right amount of product can take a few tries . My only real complaint about this product are the caps . They have a tendancy come loose . Much of the product ended up in my makeup bag , and this product costs too much to lose half of it .
 After years of hearing about Bare Escentuals I finally decided to give it a try . I really did n't have high hopes for it , but wanted to see what all the hubub was about . After just the first couple of days I truly felt my skin was improving . I tend to break out from traditional foundations and have n't worn any for years , only powder . I had to be really careful with other makeup to make sure all of it was removed each day or I would break out . When I put this foundation on it felt silky and weightless on my skin . Even when I took all my makeup off my skin still felt smoother and healthier . I believe this product really works . You just have to make sure you do n't put too much and you will be fine . Apply it in layers if you want more coverage . If it did n't work for you right away I recommend reviewing your application technique or ask the consultants on the website . Technique is important.I truly believe this product can work for anyone . Best makeup I have ever owned compared to any drugstore or department store brand . The kits are a great investment ... Bare Escentuals Get Started Kit - Medium Beige/Medium -LRB- $ 181 Value -RRB- ... the brushes alone would cost the price of the whole kit . I have also noticed that their brushes work the best for application . They must be specially made to pick up the minerals so make sure you use the right brush too . I have been recommending this product to all my friends , they can clearly see on my face that it works . I ca n't wait to try all of the products in their line .
 I thought a LONG time before trying Bare Escentuals . I did n't trust that it would be different than plain face powder or liquid foundation -- and it 's a little pricey . But I 've tried all other kinds of makeup , and they either make me break out or feel oily in a few hours -- and I do n't have really oily skin . Even the oil-free formulas . I end up having to wash my face after a couple hours and go ` au natural . ' Plus I broke out as a result of using them.This product is much better than I even hoped . I can tell it 's on my face barely because of a slight powder feel , but it is like I just put it on -- even several hours later . No oily mess , no transfer to clothes . It covers my acne spots -LRB- concealer brush -RRB- , but my cheeks still have a natural rosiness so I do n't look like I 'm wearing a mask . The foundation covers the circles under my eyes well . No itchiness , no breakouts . Plus , I have pinkish undertones not beige -LRB- auburn hair , hazel eyes -RRB- , and the `` fairly light '' matches perfectly without mixing.I actually purchased the starting kit with the buki brush , concealer brush , 2 foundations , mineral veil and revver-upper . You need the revver-upper to make the foundation stick , and the mineral veil does something good , but i 'm not sure what . I guess pales out some areas ? Ca n't put my finger on it , but it 's nice . I never use the warmth . One thing
 It 's well worth the bit of extra effort at first , even though the infomercial CD is insipid and annoying.I am 45 . plenty of broken capillaries , age spots , live in So cal , have not been great about keeping my face out of the sun . I use the bisque for a concealer , then follow the steps for the foundation , warmth , glee and veil . A little goes a lonnng way , you do n't need to cake it on!I have garnered so many compliments on my skin , it made me wonder . . what the HECK did I lookl ike before ?? Anyway , I will never use any thing else .
 This is a fantastic make up . Very easy to put on without looking `` caky '' at all . I works for me and leaves a completely natural look . The best is that you do n't have to use so much as you think.Just remember that less is more , or else it can turn into flakes and look anything else than natural.There is one thing I will recommend
 I have been using Bare Escentuals for about 4 years now and continue to get compliments on my beautiful skin . I did not always have great skin ! But once I switched to this make-up line , my skin instantly , dramatically improved . My skin is so much healthier and really glows with this make-up . You ca n't feel it at all , it lasts ALL DAY , and does n't rub off on clothes ! The coverage is fantastic and it only takes a few minutes to apply everything . I especially recomend the foundation , mineral veil , bisque , eyeshadows , blushes and all-over face colors . You can also use a lot of these as lipstick , which is great b/c it takes forever to get through a jar of blush ! :-RRB- Go ahead , try it - you 'll be HOOKED ! =-RRB- B.E. I love you !
 I saw this make up advertised one night , and thought I would take a chance.I am so glad I did !! I have 58-year old skin , and along with age comes dull skin , spots and those horrid spidery-veins . I tried every kind of make up under the sun , from powders to liquids , and they all looked horrible.Too heavy . Too `` pancakey '' and some made my face break out . Then I ordered and received this magic stuff , and my skin looks great now !! I 'm shocked how well it works to cover all imperfections , and especially those spider veins that incorrectly indicate to other people you drink too much . I do n't drink at all , so where did they come from ? I do n't care anymore.I have this wonderful make up that takes me all of three minutes to put on.I just love it.I use the foundation and the mineral veil . They work perfectly and I could n't be happier .
 It has taken me forever to find the perfect foundation for my senstive skin . I have rosesea , and you would not know it when I have my powder on . It stays put . It does not come off on your hand when you rub your face . Stays put during sweaty humid summer days . You never get the caked on feeling that other faoundations give . Easy to match to skin tone . GREAT PRODUCT !!
 I have very damaged skin from years of environmental and acne abuse . However , this foundation seems to settle on my face in such a way that liquids just do n't seem to . The colors are very easy to match with skin tones and I have not have to mix colors to find my right shade . I have found that the most important thing is to get the Bare Escentuals brushes - they may seem a little pricey but the cheaper versions just do n't compare . The Bare Escentuals brushes are far more superior to anything I have used out there . And this powder lasts for ages !
 This is a great product . . people always comment on what nice skin I have when I wear it . It looks and feels very natural .
 This is the best foundation I have ever tried . Thinking that perhaps a less expensive mineral foundation would work , I have tried mineral makeup by Loreal and Physician 's Formula . I have been disappointed in both situations . Nothing goes on as light and natural as Bare Minerals.One tip
 Quality of product was excellent as described . Powder is light and easy to apply on . Has not caused any breakouts since first use . Will definitely continue to purchase this foundation after I finsh using this current one . Highly recommended !
 This product is amazing ! I use to have to pile on the makeup but now this is all I use and it gives me a flawless and natural look . It is also good to my skin ! I ran out of this powder and had to switch back to my old powder from the department store and I kept breaking out . As soon as I switched back to bareminerals I noticed such an improvement in my skin within a day ! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS !!! Just make sure when putting it on you swish your brush around in the cap to get the excess off and brush on your face lightly .
 I have extremely sensitive skin , most foundations cause break outs and others seem thick , cakey , or uneven . This is the best foundation I have ever used ! It goes on smooth , soft and covers well with no streaking , clumping or discoloration . It looks like my own skin while concealing all my blemishes . I wear this for at least 16 hours a day and not once do I need to reapply . I also use the blush which is just as great ! I have olive skin in the summer but fair skin in the winter . I use the fair foundation and it matches my face perfectly .
 I love this stuff . In my opinion , it 's better than any liquid foundation by far , and it 's also the best of the mineral-based foundations -LRB- and I have tried a * lot * of them -RRB- ! I started using BareMinerals when I was in my mid-30s , and now I 'm 41 . I initially tried it out because liquid foundation was just not doing it for me . As far as the liquids , I 'd tried everything from Cover Girl to Chanel to Clinique -LRB- Clinique was the best of the bunch -RRB- . They all behaved the same . They were all right at first , and then it took no time at all for me to sweat them off -LRB- I live in North Carolina , where it 's humid and warm-to-sweltering-hot most of the year -RRB- . And they did n't cover very well . And they streaked and caked . And it was very difficult to find the right shade.I was enchanted with Bare Minerals . You can not feel it , and if you get the right color and apply it properly , you can not see it . People see YOU , not your makeup . It honestly improves the look of your skin instantly . I get compliments on my skin * all * the time.Even when I get sweaty , the Bare Minerals stays on and looks as fine as ever when I get back into the air conditioning ! : -RRB- As many others have already said , if you want to get the real benefit of any makeup , you have to clean your skin well and apply the makeup properly . Here 's my regimen , if you are interested . First , I exfolidate , tone , and moisturize . Then , I use the BareMinerals foundation and cap it off with the Mineral Veil . The Mineral Veil is the trick to the staying power , I think . Sometimes it needs to be reapplied a time or two during the day , during the hottest summer months . Without the Mineral Veil , the foundation powder does n't stay set nearly as long . I sometimes use the BareMinerals blushes and eyeshadows . Their lipgloss stick is terrific . It lasts forever , and it smells like vanilla . I got the one that comes with the `` Goddess '' kit , and it 's amazing . I also got their regular lipstick , in `` Yumi . '' This stuff lasts all day , especially if you apply , blot , apply powder , and then apply another layer of the lipstick.Here are other mineral foundation products I 've tried
 First off , I am a new user , and I just love this product . If you have never used it , however , I would not buy the starter kit . Why ? Because you may not get the right shade . I considered buying the `` light '' package , which comes with `` Fair-Light '' and `` Light '' foundation , but I found that I need to wear the shade `` Fair '' . My advise is to have someone at the makeup counter at your department store -LRB- or at Sephora or ULTA -RRB- who is very familiar with the product help you to select the right shade for you . They can also give you application tips . Also , I would buy better quality brushes than the ones they offer . The bristles often shed , and they feel prickly . You 'll have to spend more for better brushes , but at least they wo n't fall apart after a couple of months . Having great tools is SO important . Ask any artist!Now about the bareMinerals foundation itself ... I love it ! I have fair skin , and even though I 'm in my mid-twenties now it still is n't clear . I still have some acne , and of course there are the post-acne marks . This is the first product I 've used that I 've REALLY been satisfied with , and felt like I finally had beautiful skin . A friend of mine recommended this to me a couple of years ago ... I wish I had listened to her ! I did n't try it until last week , when my sister got it . Get it , but get it the way I suggested ; - -RRB-
 After hearing so much about this product , I had to purchase some when in the States recently -LRB- it 's unavailable in Australia of course -RRB- and I 'm glad I did . I went to the Bare Escentuals store at South Coast Plaza and the girl there put this on my face and it looked OK . I must admit , I was n't totally convinced at first , but I bought it due to the hype and when I first put it on myself , I still did n't quite get it . Now that I 'm doing it at home and taking more time applying it , I have to say that I really like it . The only reason I dropped a star from the ratings is because no matter how hard you try to not get excess powder on you , it still happens . It can actually have good coverage if you use it correctly and it looks totally natural.I think this is a product you have to try for yourself . It 's maybe not quite worth all the hype , but still very nice and easy to use . I love how my skin looks with it on and would really recommend this to everyone .
 I have been using the Bare Minerals products for several years and my skin has never looked better . It evens out uneven skin tones , covers redness very well -LRB- like mild rosacea -RRB- and is so light that you do n't even realize you are wearing any makeup . I use the foundation , warmth , mineral veil , and eye shadow . Not really a big fan of the shadow because it gets everywhere when you try to apply it but everything else is fantastic . The colors are so easy to blend to get a perfect match . Very pleased with all the purchases from Bare Minerals/Escentuals .
 I am a natural redhead with fair skin and tons of freckles . I have always had trouble finding a foundation that matched and evened out my skin tone , but did n't hide my freckles . I have tried liquid , powder , cake , you name it - all in the hopes that one of the products would work for me . Bare Escentuals foundation is the best product I 've ever used . My skin looks `` finished '' without looking like I have a pound of make-up on . It stays in place all day -LRB- yay - no shiny nose at 3pm ! -RRB- and does n't irritate my sensitive skin.It takes a little bit of practice to get used to using the brush to apply it , but once you get the hang of it , it really only take a minute or two . I use `` fair '' as my year-round shade and I add some blush or bronzer if I need to add a sun-kissed look . I love the way it looks and most people do n't even realize I am wearing make-up , which is they way I like it.The true test for me is if my sisters and mother like the way my make-up looks , mainly because they wo n't hold back if they do n't ! -LRB- Hooray for honest families ! -RRB- Both of my sisters now wear Bare Escentuals foundation , as well as my 59 year old mother . They love it as much as I do !
 This product was delivered immidiatley and in excellent condition . The pricing also made it a great deal !
 I am so glad I tried this . It is the best foundation I have ever used . Love it and will use it forever !!!
 WHAT MORE CAN I SAY BUT THANK GOD FOR THIS MAKEUP . IT HAS CHANGED MY LIFE . I COULD NEVER WEAR LIQUID FOUNDATION BECAUSE OF MY ACNE PRONE SKIN . BARE MINERALS IS A LIFE SAVER . PERFECT COVERAGE EVERYTIME . I CAN NOT LIVE WITHOUT IT . A + + + + + + + + + + +
 I 'm a redhead with verryy sensitive skin that is battling acne . I never used to receive compliments on my skin . However , when I wear this foundation I get compliments because my skin looks much better than it did with liquid foundation -LRB- I was using Prescriptives -RRB- . I do think that it does n't last as long as the advertisements claim , but if you touch it up it 'll stay with you . I 'm a busy college student who debates if I should wear something other than pajamas to class , but always have time to quickly do my makeup . It literally takes one minute for me to apply mascara and foundation etc. .
 I was in a hotel in Las Vegas before an important interview and I was again frustrated with my make-up . Nothing I applied really looked `` natural '' . After many years I found a color to match my skin -LRB- I have extremely fair skin -RRB- , but the look of the foundation was cakey after a while . I have trully tried everything and every make-up out there , including make-up brands only found in Europe and nothing worked . It was the only time I gave in to an infomercial because I was simply tired and fed-up . I REALLY REALLY LOVE THIS MAKEUP !!! I now have a `` naturally '' beautiful skin and people ca n't tell I 'm even wearing make-up most of the time . A few pointers :1 - Make sure you layer it . It 's very important to conceal everyting first ! If you apply layer after layer with the concealing brush , the make-up actually looks natural and the concealing part looks nice . Then you can use the big brushes for the all-over foundation .1 -LRB- a -RRB- - You can just apply in small sections . I usually dab the quantity needed just for my cheeks , then for forhead a.s.o. Trying to cover everything all at once may not be effective because you may need different coverage levels for different areas.2-You need to use a good moisturizer . My skin is extremely dry and even flaky , so the moisturizer helps the make-up really set.3-You do n't always have to wear the mineral veil . If I 'm having one of my `` alligator skin '' days , I just use the foundation and my skin is not flaky-miraculous ! Good luck !
 I 've been using Bare Minerals foundation for two years and it is amazing . After 20 years of dissatisfaction with every foundation on the market , I am pleased every single day I use this superb Bareminerals product . It 's so light I do n't feel like I 'm wearing anything at all . It covers all the imperfections on my skin , like acne and rosacea . And best of all , it looks so natural . I 've never looked better and it 's all due to this natural foundation .
 We bought this as a second part of a gift for my mother-in-law . She was over the moon because she loves this product so much . It is a perfect gift for a woman who has everything and better yet , it is something she will use .
 i 've been using this foundation for over 2 years now , and i love it ! it has imporved my skin texture so much ... my skin looks perfect now .
 After using so many different foundations , I finally found the perfect one for me . This foundation just looks so natural . I have oily skin on my t-zone and normal skin on the rest of my face . After using this foundation , I was just so amazed at how my skin looked , flawless and glowing . The medium beige totally blended with my natural face color so it was hard to tell that I even had any make-up on . My co-worker even asked me what I did to my face to make it so smooth . I am so happy with this product and I intend to use it forever . No other mineral make-up compares . If you want the natural look , go for the bare escentuals foundation , you wo n't regret it .
 I have tried many foundations , but by far Bare Esentuals foundation is my favorite . I have very dry and sensitive skin , so finding products that I can use is almost impossible . I like how it makes my dry skin dewey looking , and it also gives me a medium to full coverage look . The great thing is you can control the coverage just by the amount of minerals you use that day . Also no matter how much you use , as long as , you use the right color you wo n't get that jawline demarcation . It looks very natural . Another positive thing is B.E. foundation does not enhance my wrinkles , I do n't know about you , but most powders seem to enhance them . Finally , I like that a little goes a long way . It might seem a little pricey , but in the two years I have used the foundation I have only had to resupply three times.A couple of tips when using B.E. foundation , apply with the `` Flawless Application Brush '' it seems to do a better job then other brushes . Also like I said before a little goes a long way , so use SPARINGLY . Last but not least and the only negative comment I have about the foundation , be careful it can get messy . No matter how careful I am , I seem to end up with a little on my counter and sink .
 ... and I 've only had to buy 2 jars so far . A little really does go a long way , and when you think about it , for the price , you 're actually paying LESS than you normally would buying refills every other month for the chalky looking makeup that does nothing for your skin . I 've even tried to go the cheaper route and buy the new department store stuff that pretends to look like Bare Minerals . I used it for about a week , decided I hated it , and went back to my Bare Minerals . Once you use it , nothing else will ever feel right on your skin . Point is , I love Bare Minerals and I do n't think I 'll ever use anything else ! : -RRB-
 This product is fantastic . My advice is to use your daily moisturizer , wait till its absorbed -LRB- around 5 min -RRB- , apply sunblock it you wish -LRB- I use shiseido spf36 stick -RRB- apply your under eye concealer , then use a transluscent loose powder before applying this foundation . The loose powder smoothens your skin very lightly so the product will not cake on your moisturized/sunblocked/eyeconcealed skin . Believe me , just try it and you 'll see how flawless the result will be . Hope this helps some of you out there ...
 I love BE as a concealer / even outer for most of my face However , it looks cakey under my eyes -LRB- I prefer a liquid concealer there -RRB- , and seems to make lines around my nose and mouth more noticeable . I agree with a previous reviewer that this would probably make great skin better , but not as true for semi-problem skin . I personally love to use BE in the day just on my more smooth areas of my face -LRB- lightly -RRB- and as a spot concealer . When I want more coverage , I use liquid .
 I think a lot of people who find that this product does n't work for them may not be using it properly . I 've been using the foundation for 5 years . I 'm 59 yrs old . The first time I used it , I used too much , and did n't `` swirl '' it in with the brush enough . Then my daughter showed me how to use it . I 've used it ever since , and always get compliments about my complexion . I love the way it feels -LRB- like you 're not wearing foundation -RRB- and I do n't have to constantly touch it up all day . I have moderately dry skin , and use a moisturizer a few minutes before applying the foundation . It goes on so beautifully when you apply is correctly and do n't use too much . It truly gives your complexion an even , youthful glow . I love it !
 I have been using this foundation for about 3 weeks now . I like the effect , the subtle glow , it works for my normal-to-oily skin . I just wish it was n't such a mess to apply . The powder always ends up on the counter , sometimes on clothes , no matter how careful I am . It 's a waste of product too
 I 'll never go back to liquid makeup of any kind ! Bare Minerals look terrific and is super easy to apply . Did it actually change my skin ? No , but at almost 50 I 've gotten more compliments on my skin since I 've started using it than I did in my 20 's . I was reluctant to try Bare Minerals because frankly it was much more expensive than any makeup I 've ever used . Though my skin is oily I 've always had healthy , smooth skin . As I 've gotten older I found that liquid makeup only made my oily skin oilier and my dry skin flaky . I tried another powder foundation but it looked too powdery and came off on my clothes . I 'd made up my mind to try BE when I received the starter kit as a gift and I 'm so glad I did . Now anytime I get asked about my skin I go into my sales pitch and I 've had several converts ! Love this stuff !
 I order Bare Minerals from their website regularly and this was a great deal . I was worried it might not be the real stuff , but it was .
 I got this product because i have always wanted to have bare minerals . . i 'm a total girly girl . . but when it finally got here , it was way too light , it makes me look like a ghost . now i have to wear a dark foundation and put this over top to lighten it . It also is n't that great of a product , i do n't know maybe i do n't have the right brush , but its really not made out to be what all the commercials say it is . although it is half the price on here . . so thats a plus !
 LOVE IT and would be lost without this productflawless coverage and i receive compliments about my complexion constantly
 This foundation has been great as far as color matching goes . It blends very easily and looks natural . I love the improved design on the container - now you can twist-lock the part where the powder comes out , so that you do n't dump tons of powder out into the lid if you put it in your purse.I wish the coverage had more staying power , especially in the summer .
 I will start by saying this is a great product at a really good price . When I recently purchased this , I received an 8g container that was advertised . I was informed that Bare Escentuals is only making 9g containers now , and that Amazon has not updated the product listing . Just wanted to share so that people can make an informed purchase of this product .
 This item came quicker than stated and am very pleased with the product . It 's the best make-up I 've ever used . It makes your skin look airbrushed . It stays on long too and is so light you ca n't feel it : -RRB-
 Great size and prompt/fast delivery ! I love the product . I purchased three to give to my mom she is soooo happy at the savings !
 Bare Minerals does exactly what it says it will and quick and easy to apply , takes just a minute to do . Feels very light , looks natural and actually improved texture of my skin without any allergic reaction with my extremely sensitive skin . A little difficult to determine correct shade to use . Will continue to use as it 's very easy to order and received in timely manner .
 I love BareMinerals foundation and was thrilled to find it at a lower price - Thanks , Amazon !
 Absolutely love it . Goes on smoothly and the color is a perfect blend . Looks natural - no lines . I would recommend this product .
 This is the best makeup around , especially for people with problem skin because it 's all naturaul . Have tried many brands of foundation , only to return to this . Excellence ! I will keep buying . The Seller Is Fab too !
 As someone who does n't like to wear a lot of makeup but likes to look polished , I swear by this stuff . One of these will last me roughly 2 years of everyday use . It 's really light , it covers well , and perfectly matches my skintone . Everything they say on those freaking commercials is true ! I do n't get it . THERE SHOULD BE SOMETHING WRONG WITH IT BUT THERE IS N'T . Sorry guys .
 I love this foundation . It goes on so smooth and light . I really do n't like to wear liquid foundation after starting to use this product . It makes my skin clearer as well .
 I love the bare minerals line . They are really easy on the skin . Easy to use and work with . I 'm not a huge makeup girls but do use this foundation with a concealer daily and I could dream of using anything else .
 Just what I expected . It is the largest size I have seen , not the teeny tiny one and not the medium one . Right color . Same as I would have gotten in store .
 This is the makeup brand I have been using for a long time now and I was glad to see it available on Amazon . Received it the next day -LRB- and did n't request overnight shipping -RRB- so I was impressed : -RRB-
 I 've tried all sorts of high end foundations - Makeup Forever HD , Korres , Benefit , etc. and I finally got around to trying Bare Minerals . I 'm glad I did ! It gives a NATURAL finish that I love , since I 'm trying to get away from the made-up look . I had no problem guessing to find a shade that matched me perfectly . I have a feeling that this stuff will go quickly since I use it pretty much every day , but it 's worth it to me . It lasts all day and does n't sink into the lines under my eyes too bad -LRB- although it will if I layer it over another concealer -RRB- . I also have to be sure to wear a primer , especially around my nose , because this stuff accentuates my pores a lot . The finished product is worth it for me though ... I will buy again : -RRB-
 I was very pleased with my purchase . It was the full size that I was looking for and I received it before the estimated delivery date . The price was fair too . I would order from them again .
 I 've been using this mineral foundation for over five years because it is the best I 've tried . I experimented with cheaper mineral products from a drug store , but I did n't get the same flawless coverage . The coverage is very natural looking . You can control the amount of coverage you are looking for by simply applying more or less of the product . Again , this stuff is the best , and it continues to receives high ratings in magazines for a reason !
 This foundation covers and is very light.I use the primer , for me it is necessary to use it before the foundation . The primer creates a very smooth surface as I have pores and such that need to be evened out first.This actually helps with blemishes . It clears them up.I also find it necessary to use the mineral veil to smooth out the foundation .
 This foundation is very lightweight and non-greasy . It feels as tough you do n't have any on which I love and also love the fact it has SPF in it .
 This product is just great ! It was recommended by my friend and I have decided to try . Even with my problematic skin it fits me perfectly . I would recommend Bare Escentuals Original to any woman who is using make up . Thanks !
 Ca n't live without this foundation ! It does exactly what it says it does and more ! Buying it through Amazon is the best ... it is the least expensive place to purchase it !
 I really dis-like the weight and feel of traditional foundation but I need coverage due to dark circles and uneven skin tone . I take full advantage of using the concealer brush and the kabuki brush for full coverage . I find that the shade I chose was a perfect match , it has good coverage , feels light and is less fussy to put on than regular foundation . I also like that it does n't make me break out.I only gave it 4 stars because I find that it does n't last all day . Then again , you reapply it like you would a powder so it 's not a big deal.Bottom line is , for me it 's good coverage and still manages to be lightweight and look natural . I 'm happy with that .
 I love this make-up . It covers up imperfections of the skin and still feels like you are not wearing any makeup at all . It 's light weight and you really do not have to use that much for decent coverage .
 The product itself is fantastic . However the company is not . It always takes forever to recieve anything that I buy from there . This time the containter was in pieces and all of the powder was loose inside the package . I returned it and have never recieved a replacement .
 I have always struggled finding the ` right ' makeup - often spending hundreds of dollars on high-end products . I have fair skin with deep inset eyes resulting in dark undereye circles . Bare Escentuals is the ONLY product I have found that covers my dark circles and does n't settle into creases or get cakey . I admit , I have oily skin and BM does n't solve the problem , so before I apply BM I use Cover Girl translucent powder on my T-zone . Other than that , this has been a miracle for me and I highly recommend it to anyone willing to try . But like any product , it wo n't work on everyone - BM does n't work on my mom but every friend that has tried it after me has been successful . Plus , putting it on is a breeze as it 's practically fool-proof . I say just try it for yourself and see ... who knows , it may be your miracle product too !
 I have very sensitive skin . Dermablend was recommended by my Dermatologist . Seems alittle dry to apply at times , but my age is 62 so I just add a little more moisturizing lotion to my face then apply .
 This is the best mineral makeup out there . I have tried other brands and none of them can come close to the quality of bare minerals . I am so happy I found it on this website so I do n't have to spend more than $ 25.00 on it . The price is excellent . I was using mary kay 's version of mineral makeup before and it 's about the same price as this is on this site .
 I have been wearing Bare Essentials ever since I saw their infomercial years ago . There is nothing else I would put on my face . There 's not much more I can add that others have n't said . I just wanted to tell anyone who has n't tried it that if you have sensitive skin and are looking for a light foundation , you have to try it . I will be a lifetime user .
 This is by far the best makeup I have ever used . It goes on flawlessly and is so easy to apply . I will never go back to the cheaper , store-bought brands ! I have also introduced this makeup to several friends and their moms & sisters , and they all love it as much as I do !
 I have extremely acne prone skin ! Most of my acne is from cosmetics that I use . I used bare minerals in High School and my skin was always perfect and I never broke out . When I hit about 19 years old for some reason I decided to go with liquid foundations , and i stuck with them for several years and my skin broke out horribly ! I tried drinking lots of water , and changing my diet and nothing worked so one day I thought back to my high school days to try to figure out what i was doing at the time to make my skin look so good and I though about the bare minerals ! I started using it and sure enough zero acne . I have very very sensitive skin so it surprises me that i 'm not sensitive to the bismuth oxide . Like some viewers said I would not recommend this on skin that is wrinkled I tried to put some on my 65 year old grandma and it looked like crap on her . But then again my 48 year old mother in law uses it and it looks great on her but she gets botox and chemical peels to make her skin smoother and wrinkle free . And in my opionion this covers acne very well you just have to know how to use it correctly , I like that you can use the foundation as a concealer because sometimes when using mineral makeup and in two different shades for the concealer and foundation your skin can looked two toned ! Downsides to this makeup is it could be expensive for some people and i 'm not sure if this is good for older skin . I 'm 22 years old and I would definetely recommend this to teens and girl in their twentys but then again I think it depends on the texture of your skin .
 I am 60 years old , but because of good genes I look quite a bit younger than my age . When I wear Bare Minerals foundation I find people staring at me - their reason is `` You look amazing . Your skin in absolutely flawless . '' My answer to them is `` good genes and Bare Minerals foundation ! ''
 My best friend tried this make-up before I did . I only had to try it once and I went out and bought my own starter kit . It 's wonderful ! It 's great for spot treatment or all-over cover . So many people think I am going natural when I actually have a full layer of make-up on . It is possible to put on too much , but that would be user error and not the make-up . The only con , is when I sweat in the summer , the bare minerals can cause a slight irritation . But it 's not bothersome enough to stop using . I love it too much !
 I have been using this product for several yrs now and I love the stuff . My makeup always looks natural and I do n't have to worry about it clogging up my pores . It is also streak free . I always look good .
 The first experience that I 've had with mineral makeup was with Ulta 's mineral makeup . I was subjected to ugly makeup lines and was severely unimpressed . After visiting Sephora , the salesperson convinced me to allow her to demo Bare Minerals on my face . First she -LRB- what I call -RRB- pounded the foundation in , for use as a concealer . Next , she used a buffer brush and made circles all over my face with the product . The end result was nothing short of spectacular . I could not fathom the difference in quality between BM and Ulta . We ended up buying the foundation and lip gloss from the company . I have never gone back to any other foundation and have found that my skin is actually improved with this product . I would not recommend sleeping in it , as the company says is encouraged . . But if you are too tired to remove your makeup -LRB- which people often are -RRB- do n't fret about having it on still . Your skin should be fine.Bare Minerals recommends that you buy their `` special brushes '' . That 's a sales tactic . Any foundation and concealer brush of good quality will suffice . In fact , I bought some very good quality brushes at Kroger by a company called ELF for a whole dollar . The same sort of brushes Bare Minerals are selling for much more.Now the iffy parts about Bare Minerals . From a distance the product makes my face look flawless . I use Avon 's multi colored bronzer -LRB- browns and pinks combined -RRB- or my Ulta Bronzer on top for a glow . Otherwise , I look very `` powdery '' . At the nose and chin , where my pores and more noticeable the product creates nasty powder pore areas ; which is not pretty at the least.This product is not quite perfect , but its pretty well near it . Always use a moisturizer before hand or a foundation primer .
 A co-worker brought in some items that did n't match her skin tone ... she gave them to me , i tried them and the rest is history !
 I 've been using this product for over five years now and I am almost always caught off guard when it comes time to `` re '' up . How convenient I can order it -LRB- along with a book -RRB- from Amazon.com . I love it . thanks
 Looks natural , covers well , does n't clog pores . It works great for my super-light , red and ruddy complexion .
 1 STAR * I 've just realized my acne got worse since I started using this foundation . I have grains now all over my face especially in the T-zone which was not like that before . Pores look bigger like giant holes and the coverage is n't superb either . Also , it made my skin feel itchy . BAD BAD BAD ! : -LRB-
 I have been using bare minerals for roughly two years now . Before , I used liquid foundations . While the number of blemishes I get a year has been significantly reduced , I still get them from time to time ... usually right along my temples and chin . I believe they are right-on about the gunk in liquid foundations clogging your pores , but this is n't a ` clear all ' ... you will still want to use a cleanser and such as normal.I went through a patch of bad acne last year and began using Proactive , which significantly dried out my skin , to the point of it being very flaky , even though I used the green tea moisturizer twice a day . When that happened , the bare minerals did n't settle as nicely on my skin , and I feel it accentuated the dryness , making my skin look ... powdery , I guess would be the best word ... like someone threw flour on my face and I did n't get it all off . Once I quit using the proactive , though , it went right back to looking gorgeous.It does n't last all day . I put it on around 7am every morning , and by 11:30 I have to do a bit of a touch-up , usually on my nose and chin . If I plan to go out that evening after work , I will generally do almost another full application to reapply . I am very pale , and the fairly light base is perfect for me ... I have really dark circles under my eyes , but using the concealer brush in the base covers them nearly completely without looking caked on.It is a bit pricey at $ 25 for the 9g jar , but , you can generally find it new and sealed on eBay for around $ 18 , which is a little better . Plus , I find that it lasts me almost an entire year .
 First powder foundation that I came across with excellent coverage without the hassle . I have very obvious hyper pigmentation marks and this stuff covers it very well .
 I was reluctant to order this product . But I did n't need to be . It came in a timely manner and was exactly what it said it was . And at a far better price than I have been buying it . I will definitly be buying more from themLaura S.
 Item exactly as described . It 's the same make up I buy at the store but for a much better price .
 I love the price and the product but I think the color was too light for my skin . I will order in the future because there was fast shipping but I will order darker color .
 I was somewhat reserved and usually do not purchase on line . I can truly say I 'm very pleased with my purchase of bare minerals and the price was right . The SPF foundation is the real stuff and will not hesistate to re-order in the future .
 This product is the best ever !!! I first tried BM when it came out because a friend who owned a salon decided to sell it and talked me into it . The shades available were quite limited at that time , and one major complaint I had against it was -LRB- being extremely fair-skinned with neutral undertones -RRB- was that it was either too pink or too yellow . I also began using it in the summer and felt like it melted down my face when I would sweat . I use Fairly Light original formulation with SPF now and it matches perfectly . I always use the Handy Buki which is great for around the nose and eyes and chin , and gives full coverage.I 've got a lot of redness , am prone to breakouts and have combination skin . I started using Revlon Colorstay foundation for about 4 years , and noticed my skin was breaking out even more and I started getting cystic acne . And so the caking stage began !!! I rediscovered Bare Minerals again about 2 years ago . A friend of mine was a true `` believer '' and convinced me to try it again , this time using Prime Time and Illuminating mineral veil . What a huge difference it makes !!! Prime time is essential for making this foundation apply well and stay . It can settle into fine lines , dry spots and look hella ugly if you do n't use Prime Time . All you need is one little tiny pump of it for your whole face and you will notice you use less product , buff more and you will have fantastic , healthy looking skin with a dewy natural finish . You must always exfoliate and use a nice light moisturizer like Bioelements Crucial Moisture.It beats the hell out of caking chemicals all over your face and risking ugly breakouts that are even harder to cover.Coverage is Med/full . Extremely buildable , lovely finish . YOU WILL LOVE IT !!!
 Makeup is exactly what she wants and loves . She uses it every day and only goes through two of these a year .
 I received my product on time and its the right color but my container does n't twist and click to lock into place , so I always have minerals floating around in the lid . Not the biggest problem , I 'll live .
 Great price and you do n't have to leave your house to purchase . I love that it is cheaper than my cosmetic store and exactly the same product .
 I am very satisfied . I have used Bare Minerals make-up for some time now and I love it . The product was exactly what I was expecting in every way and price was very competitive compared to buying direct from Bare Escentuals
 Would n't leave the house without my Bare Escentuals Foundation . Love , Love , Love it !! Gives a very soft and natural feel to the skin .
 I used to us BareMinerals Medium Beige for a long time and it did help lessen break outs and keep my skin looking clear . I then tried the new matte version of B.M. and disliked it . It made my face look chalky and rested in my fine lines . I then switched to Silk Naturals brand and I used it the past 2 years . I recently bought B.M. at Sephora to try again and I was dissatisfied.Pros
 I switched to bm about a year ago after finding them in my local outlet mall . I have a very stubborn red undertone pigment and this stuff works amazing !!!
 This foundation I have been using for years . Covers the spots and gives an over-all even look to the skin .
 I Love Bare Minerals !!! It goes on just right and you ca n't tell that you have it on . Excellant !!!
 Received fast ... great price ! I have used this product for 12-15 years and this is the best price I have ever seen ! Thank you , thank you , thank you ! I will be back !
 I love this foundation . I 've been using Bare Excentuals for years now , have tried other foundations , and keep coming back for more . I recently bought the Bare Escentuals bareVitamins Prime Time and it does wonders . I highly recommend getting both for a smooth application and all day wear without creasing .
 I 've been using bareMinerals foundation for several years , and recently began buying off Amazon since I know what I need and the price is fairer . This merchant shipped quickly and delivered my item exactly as expected ! Thank you !!
 I have been buying this makeup for years and I love it . It 's light but still covers blotchiness and redness of blemishes . It came quickly and seems to be authentic .
 I 've been using Bare Minerals for about 7 years now , I have very highly acne-prone skin , and I needed something lighter than a liquid foundation . Honestly , this stuff has been a God-send for me . You can use as much or as little as you need for your current skin condition.Obviously Bare Minerals has a very strong following , but if I can make just a couple suggestions ... First , go to a Bare Escentuals store if at all possible to have them help you choose your color . Do not guess . Then come back to Amazon next time to save a couple dollars , as the price on here is cheaper than most stores carry it for.Second , especially if you are acne prone like me , I highly recommend using this product to apply it , in place of the brushes : Beautyblender 2 + Blendercleanser Combo , The Ultimate MakeUp Sponge Applicator + CleanserI wash the Beautyblender sponge with the cleanser before every single use , and then use it while it 's still damp to apply my Bare Minerals . You would n't believe how quick and smooth it goes on . Plus , makeup brushes are a haven for germs , but SO difficult to wash , and can not be used wet/damp .
 This is a full size 8g container . I have been using Philosophy airbrushed canvas makeup , but I still like this better , and it 's cheaper . The sifter is new to me , but it seems like a nice feature . Fairly medium is pretty much a perfect color for my skin . I have light skin and freckles .
 Same product I have been using for years . This is the ` larger size'of the product . Good deal . bought several at once , shipping cost a little high though at 11.99 for 3 .
 the only foundation I use , and have used for years . Love it . Will never go back to liquid . I love it , but my only complaint is that it does go into the air and leave a film of makeup all over the bathroom ! Least of my problems though
 I have been using bareMinerals for 3 years now and love it . The first thing I purchased was the kit with a few different foundations , brushes and the mineral veil . It lasts forever -LRB- meaning I 've only had to buy it I think one other time -RRB- and I put on at least the foundation and mineral veil everyday . The brushes feel are of such a high quality and really do make my face look flawless . People tell me all the time how wonderful my skin is , but it 's not really that nice . I just let them think that it is !
 I am surprised by the make-up artist who left the review in which it was emphasized that a strict regimen is necessary in order to enjoy the benefits of Bare Escentuals . This I have found to be absolutely not true.Also , and I do think this is relevant , as many people who are interested in this product have problem skin , I personally have not found that washing , ex foliating , or moisturizing ever helped to truly resolve any problems . If anything , when I have used this product in conjunction with others , I have broken out and/or experienced redness , itchiness and peeling . Those people who have naturally healthy , happy skin can probably pile on the products with no ill effects , but for those of us with more sensitive skin , as commercially tempting as it is , that sort of regimen can be disastrous!I have sensitive , acne prone , pale , combination skin . Although I finally learned how to control my acne , I still suffered from breakouts , redness , patchiness , enlarged pores , and an oily t-zone . I personally have noticed that the less I do to my skin , the better . With Bare Escentuals as my only product , my skin is actually crystal clear 95 % of the time - with or without the makeup.Before bed , I wash my skin with nothing other then luke warm water . If necessary , I remove mascara with burts bees orange face wash . Usually , though , I pick make-up that removes easily . I never scrub , rub , or ex foliate . Then in the morning , I apply bare Escentuals with a brush . -LRB- Its very important to clean your brush once every few weeks ! -RRB- This is all I ever do to my skin , and I have to say , it looks smooth and unmarked with or without make-up ! Other foundations make me break out , itch , and seemingly caused my skin to produce more oil . Concealers did n't blend well , did n't last , and aggravated my blemishes . This stuff , however , works so well !! And I have found that if i do n't wash , scrub , or slap on products , my skin actually produces less oil and balances out ! My skin is beautiful and glowing!Now , do n't get me wrong , this wo n't fix all of your problems with your skin - but if you use a million products on your face , I guarantee that it will improve if you use nothing other then this make-up for a few weeks . Personally , I fixed 95 % of my skin problems - after 9 years of trying ! - with internal approaches . This stuff takes care of the other 5 % without setting me back.One of the best things about this stuff is that it is naturally antibacterial , and seems to accelerate healing when I have a blemish . I also swear my pores are smaller but this could also be from washing less . Regardless , you can use it to increase your confidence level without jeopardizing the health of your skin.Lastly , I think this makeup is definitely full coverage , especially if applied regularly . If I have a blemish , I spot cover with a small brush , and then use my larger brush to apply all-over foundation to my entire face . Its easy , quick , and very effective - and it lasts all day ! Definitely my favorite !
 I use this foundation every day and I love it . People tell me all the time that my skin looks great . I have vitiligo -LRB- a condition that causes loss of pigment in skin -RRB- which means that I have patches of skin that are lighter than my normal skin tone . BareMinerals foundation makes my skin tone look even and provides a little protection from the sun . It 's light enough to wear all day and easy to put on . While I love the product , I would really rate it a 4.5 , because the design of the packaging needs some improvement . It 's kind of messy and does n't travel well . However , I 'm willing to put up with that because I love the end result .
 I love this foundation ! Everybody compliments me on my complexion when I wear it . Pricey , but worth it !
 I really love this product . It lasts forever and finishes your makeup wonderfully . I 've been using this product for over 11/2 years and just got my second container ... so trust me , it is very cost effective . barb
 I always hated how long it took to put foundation on , being able to feel it on my face , and the effort of washing it off every night . This product has solved all those problems . Applying the foundation takes maybe 30 seconds , I do n't feel like I have anything on my face and this stuff wo n't hurt your skin if you leave in on at night.But this is n't the miracle product the commercials claim . It does have a tendency to look cakey if you use too much , and using the right amount of product can take a few tries . My only real complaint about this product is the caps . They have a tendency to come loose . Much of the product ended up in my makeup bag , and this product costs too much to lose much of it.The starter kit is the way to go ; I was going to try just the foundation but was glad I got the starter kit . It 's a really good deal compared to buying them separately .
 I had been hearing about Bare Minerals for quite some time , but was never willing to spend the money to try it . I convinced my sister to buy the starter kit for my Christmas present last year & I have spent the last ten months wondering why I waited so long.Although my skin tends to be on the dry side , my real problem is covering up my overly red cheeks and matching my skin tone correctly . It seems that every time I would use other foundations -LRB- whether liquid , powder or even stuff that vaguely reminded me of `` spackle '' -RRB- I could never get it look right . To make things worse , it seems like my skin would absorb the foundation somehow and a few hours later parts of my face would look like it it had nothing on it at all.I am not exactly sure why Bare Minerals works , but the powder does the trick . It also makes my skin feel incredibly soft & I love the fact that I can fall asleep in it and not feel guilty . Honestly , give it a try . I am in my late 20s and I have finally found make-up that works for me . I do use different brands for my mascara & lipstick ... but only because I never had a problem there & I do n't feel the need to try out the Bare Minerals version.One last thing , it is a different way if putting on make-up so practice a few times to get the hang of it .
 After years of not wearing make-up I tried to use bare minerals . Although I liked the way it looked , for some reason , my face felt itchy . So , I stopped using and started wearing MAC . But , MAC often made me feel like I was wearing make-up . So , one day , on may way to the MAC counter , I stumbled across bare minerals again.This time , I learned the proper way to apply it and what a difference that made ! And , I love it ! It really looks and feels natural . It makes me look better but not made up . I can wear it every day . And , people compliment me on looking great . So , my suggestion is that you take the time to go to a make-up counter and learn the proper techniques before you buy.My only concern is that bare minerals does not cover dark circles very well . So , I use Bobbi Brown for that . But , the other bare mineral products can help to give you a natural glow of beauty . And , the brushes are reasonably priced compared to other high end cosmetic brands .
 I have never been one for applying makeup . Seemed a big ordeal , matching the foundation -LRB- there are tons of colors out there ! -RRB- and then the application of a liquid always turned me off.I tried BE first at Sephora and had them do a makeover for me so I could see how I liked it . It looked good , even other customers who were in the store said it looked good , so I bought the $ 60 starter kit.There was a learning curve , using the brushes , the swirl tap buff process and the concealer and mineral veil , but it quickly became a very easy and fast routine that can be done in under 5 minutes ! I was instantly hooked because it is light , I ca n't feel it at all , it covers my mild rosacea and it unlocked my inner Artist -LRB- as one reviewer said -RRB- . I love the process of applying the minerals , and I never ever thought I would say that about makeup . From there , I tried the blushes , the different radiances , and created different looks . I feel that the makeup is very forgiving -LRB- if you are new to makeup -RRB- and you really ca n't make any mistakes when applying the color -LRB- unless you apply too much which is the case with ANY makeup ! -RRB- I love the brushes and wash them often to keep them new . I feel like an artist with my brushes and all the BE colors in my palatte . makeup for me is finally fun ! I have received many compliments on my skin , that I have a glow about me , that I look healthy and radiant . I never before heard such nice things about my skin ! I recommended BE to my aunt and good friend , both who decided to try it and love their results . I myself avoid the cakey look by moisturizing first -LRB- any makeup applied to dry flakey skin will cake and look dry -RRB- . I ca n't say enough about how much I love Bare Escentuals . Everything , from the mascara to the glosses are terrific . Give it a try !
 I have used Bare Minerals since it hit the market and it is by far the best mineral makeup on the market.I have tried several other mineral makeups only to be disappointed . If I had tried them first I probably would not be using mineral makeup.It does take a little practice when you first start using the mineral makeup , but it is worth the time spent practicing in the beginning . It takes much less makeup and that was hard to get used to . I didnt `` feel '' it on my skin like I did with the liquid and that was hard to get used too also . -LRB- I didnt feel made up -RRB- I learned to trust what I saw instead of what I felt and got used to the fact that it takes a lot less time to apply it than liquid.With Bare Minerals it goes on silky smooth and covers beautifully , looks natural , and it does not rub off onto your clothing ! It goes on so quick I can do my makeup in a fraction of the time it took when I used liquid makeup . Plus when you look in the mirror it just looks like I have good skin instead of seeing the makeup on my skin.The new sifter bottle case it great . The minerals are so fine it is hard to keep from spilling using the older bottles .
 bareMinerals is a great brand and their foundation works well to flawlessly cover acne , scars , or dark circles . However , I use more than one shade of powder to match my natural skin tone . I use ` Fairly Medium ' with a concealer brush for under my eyes and problem areas , and I use the slightly darker ` Medium ' for my overall face . Buying more than one shade can get expensive -LRB- $ 27 each in stores -RRB- and I 'm SO glad I found out I can get bareMinerals on Amazon . I saved about $ 10 on each container and they got to my house by the end of the week . I will definitely buy my bareMinerals through Amazon from now on !! side note
 I ca n't imagine going back to a bottle of liquid foundation again . Bare Minerals covers every little thing you 'd want hidden and yet many people have commented that it does n't appear I even wear makeup . It has a very natural finish which lasts throughout the day . It beats any liquid foundation I 've used hands down .
 This is a great foundation if you 're looking for a lighter coverage . I wear this in the Fair shade , and it blends very well with my skin tone and looks incredibly natural . I do like the matte Bare Escentuals foundation better than the original , because my skin is a bit oily and using the matte foundation helps prevent a bit against shine that can build up during the day . I would never wear this foundation without a primer , though ... otherwise it wears off super quick . Still , it 's easy to apply , it looks great , and I would recommend it .
 BareMinerals is a great product ! Who knew something as simple as a powder could replace liquid foundation ! I do n't know it does it , but it does . Mixed with Golden Medium , this is the perfect shade for me .
 I mix this with the Light foundation and get the perfect shade for me . Love love love BareMinerals !
 This is the best foundation I have ever used . It not only works as a foundation but as a concealer too .
 I finally bought this product , and I am happy that I did . It comes with a short handled brush which was a pleasant surprise . There is a plastic tray that sits on top of the powder , and it has small holes that allows a small amount of the foundation to sit in the tray . This product is really light and gave me a polished and flawless look and feel .
 I am a huge fan of the Bare Minerals foundation . I highly recommend it . If you can go to a store that carries the brand first and have someone help you find the color that works for your skin tone then you can find the exact one that you need online for a great price .
 This foundation makes your skin look airbrushed . I have flaky skin around my chin , so it is often difficult to find a foundation that will hide this type of flaw . As it did not hide it completely , it does however make it a lot easier to take off the flakes with tweezers . Not only that , it feels better on my face all day . I have gone back to other foundations before and have only returned to bare minerals . There truly is nothing like it .
 It 's a weightless powder formula that blends right in with your own skin tone . What could be better ? I feel comfortable wearing it all summer long without any clogged pores or acne due to wearing a heavier liquid foundation . I work out a lot and those other foundations MUST be removed before any physical activity or you can guarantee clogged pores . You do n't even have to take off the bare minerals . I always try to wash my face at least 2X a day , but we all know those long nights out when you do n't always get a chance to wash your face late night ... You can be confident knowing your not going to wake up to a whole bunch of breakouts . This foundation feels like your not wearing anything at all . I love bareminerals and I 'm a consumer for life ! It 's by far the best foundation I 've used !
 This is one of the greatest products I 've ever tried in my entire life . Really , Bare essentuals has become my top 1 make up and I 'm gon na stick to it 4EVER ! plus , for the quiality is really chip . THIS MAKE UP KICK ASS !
 I 'm not much of a make-up person even though I 'm 19 , but I do have certain things I need to watch out for when I find make-up : - First is the color . I was able to be easily matched to a color by a person in-store ! However when trying to find liquid make-up it 's really hit or miss , and I end up finding that Smashbox and NYX are too dark for me . - Secondly is how it reacts to my skin . I have problem skin -LRB- acne , scarring -RRB- as well as sensitive skin on top of oily skin . So it 's kind of like a mash up of sucks . Anyways , this foundation does n't react with my skin in a bad way and helps out my skin . Only minus is that it does n't really cover up my pores but then again it 'd look cakey and that 's what primer is for . :-RRB- - Third , finally , is price . I got a `` 10-day '' sample and I 'm still using it today and I got it around April , and not looking to run out in the next two months or so . I could n't imagine how much you get when buying a much bigger pot!Will be continue to getting more samples or actually buying the sets . : P
 I started using this product about 5 years ago when I finally asked my friend what she used on her face that made it look like porcelain . I used to think , `` She is probably just one of those lucky few with really good skin . '' When she told me she was using this product , I immediately went out and bought it . It is magical as you put it on and watch all your flaws disappear ! I ca n't imagine ever using anything else .
 I have been using this product for almost two years . It is amazing ! I have really pink cheeks and it helps a lot . It also helps hide the redness in my face when I 'm hot .
 This product was just as promised . I love this foundation because it is so easy to apply and it gives really great coverage . It was shipped in a very timely manner .
 I 've been using this foundation for 4 years , and love it . It looks natural , is not harmful to your skin , lets it breathe , and gives good coverage while not looking like you have makeup on .
 Great product ! Much better than liquid foundations that I used previously for years . No one will know you 're wearing makeup ! Let 's your skin breath . All of this company 's products get 5 starts from me !
 I have used the bareMinerals makeup for 2 years and am very satisfied with it . It goes on easily and wears well throughout the day .
 This is the best make up for skin . I have n't had a break out or oily skin since I started to use this brand . I would never smear all those chemicals from the liquid make ups on my face again .
 You ca n't beat it . It does not cake and it covers really well . And its made of minerals so it does n't clog your pores . I even wear it to bed . I love it .
 I 've been using colorscience for years now and love the powder built into the application brush ... this powder works just as well for a fraction of the price but the only downside is the mess it leaves after you put it on ... if they had a better applicator it would be IDEAL!Overall for the price it 's a GREAT product !
 I LOVE this product . I use the medium tan which is perfect year round in the sunny climate that I live in . It gives very nice coverage and gives my skin a nice smooth appearance . The only issue is , is that I am a little clumsy when in a hurry and tend to spill a little of it when not careful which is not difficult to do.I also love that it 's good for your skin . I 've had very few breakouts since using this product .
 I have been using Bare Escentuals for about 3 years . I ca n't believe what an improvement in my skin . Plus easy to use and looks great . I wo n't be caught without it .
 I used to use this product before Peri-menopause hit and yes it does work the way everyone says it does.The pros
 Bare Minerals foundation is truly like your own skin . The air light powder foundation buffs on like feathers and blends in with your own skin so perfectly you truly do not know it 's there . It is healty for my skin expecially with the SPF built in . I would never wear any other foundation.Update as of 9/20/12
 Wife loved the product and the price . Double winner , cant beat it ! Always a bonus when you make your wife happy .
 Bareminerals is always my go to make up . I have very bad acne scars and acne . I like to use bare minerals because it does n't irritate or feel heavy on my skin . I can sleep with it on and not worry about a breakout the next day . I totally recommend it .
 Absolutely love Bare Minerals EVERYTHING . From the brushes to the foundation to the all-over-color . As long as I can afford it , I will never buy any other brand . I love that I can sleep in it without it clogging my pores or causing breakouts !
 I have used bare minerals for about a month now and I absolutely love this product . I use to use clinique . I have very oily skin , sensitive , very minor acne . I love buffing the foundation onto my skin it feels so soft . !! Everyone tells me it looks natural .
 For the most part bare minerals SPF 15 Foundation is great.My Pros : I love that it buffs on easily and provides excellent coverage . It 's easy to use , light weight and you can apply it start to finish in minutes.My cons : I hate that it does n't last as long as you would like . It 's definitely not a 16 hr make-up . It rubs off and becomes uneven through out the day . I find I have to apply another round if I want it to look finished for an evening out after a day of work.My review of seller : Excellent ! Super timely and free shipping was a huge PLUS ! Package got to me before it 's expected date even and was packed securely!Overall : I recommend this product . It 's easy to use , very clean , and beautiful coverage . Just be prepared that you might have to reapply it to maintain a `` fresh '' look . : -RRB-
 The Bare Minerals Foundation arrived in great shape with no problems ! Like the cost savings!Received the order ten days quicker than expected .
 First of all , I HIGHLY recommend having someone in the store apply this makeup the first time so they get the color right . I was in line to buy this for the first time and a sales rep offered to apply it before I bought it . I hate being nagged by sales people but i let her do it and good thing I did . The two colors I was about to buy were WAY off . I have always tanned easily and I never think my skin is pale , even in the winter . However , she found that LIGHT and FAIRLY light worked best for me . I was about to buy MEDIUM so thank goodness I did n't . I 've had problems with acne my whole life but it has gotten much better from my teen years but I still have occasional issues . I feel like this makeup has helped my skin a lot . There is NO WAY I can go makeup free , even when I have clear skin . I have dark circles under my eyes and not an even skin tone . I think this stuff covers just as well as liquid foundation but without feeling like you have a pound of grease on your face . I use the fairly light with a small brush for my concealer and the LIGHT for an overall foundation . Makes my skin look better than ANY liquid foundation I have tried . It 's gross to think I used to put that crap on my face . I barley break out now and if I accidently forget to wash my face before I fall asleep I do n't feel disgusting when I wake up . Just love it . Will never go back . I think getting to color right is by far the most important so let someone do it for you !
 After picking the wrong shade -LRB- and looking like a shiny ghost -RRB- , I went directly to the bareminerals website to determine the correct shade for me , which suggested I had a far darker complexion than I thought I had ; however , I reluctantly went with the suggestion and bought that shade through amazon and I 'm glad I did . I got the matte golden tan shade and it is perfect . Finally , I do n't look like a blotchy hag or a starved waif . While I still use a bit of regular powder to eliminate looking shiny around my nose and forehead , this product is the best `` foundation '' I 've ever , ever had . I do n't have to wear any kind of blush or concealer and it covers the red patches over my nose and cheeks and significantly lessens the appearance of the dark circles under my eyes . I only add a bit of mascara and lipcolor and I 'm done for the day with only a single touchup needed later in the day to blot away excess oil . That 's it . My imperfect skin looks younger and more perfect with tone evened out and I do n't really even appear to be wearing makeup at all aside from the mascara . Less is definitely more here . I 've had no skin reactions whatsoever either . Wonderful product . I love it !
 This was just what I needed . Although I already knew the color I wanted so I would suggest finding the right color first .
 Have been using Bare Escentuals for many years . Lasts a long , long time and stays on until you take it off . Many compliments as to how my complexion looks since I am 70 years old .
 I can not do liquid foundrions . I have combination skin and this is the only foundation that works for me . I have to make sure and keep my brushes clean , otherwise it breaks me out . Other than having to wash the brushes , I love this stuff !! Buying more as we speak !
 It 's really a good quantity for the price . The only thing is that it does n't cover blemishes as well as the newer bare mineral foundation . Therefore , I must use my new &#34; fairly light &#34; to cover blemishes then use this to cover all over.Overall , not bad .
 Fantastic price ! Always order it from here and save at least $ 15 on your order ! It IS Bare Minerals product , the exact same makeup you buy at Macy 's !
 It was great . The makeup came quickly in the mail with no trouble . Brand new with original packaging and I saved a ton of money buying from here .
 This is a great foundation . I ca n't tolerate heavy products on my face . You do n't even know this foundation is there . It gives me a more even tone . This is a keeper .
 This is a high quality product . Love the color . Great price . Easy to use . Bare Minerals Foundation is highly recommended !
 I hope as most of you , I started out with the sample kit . Most of these bad reviews have not tried the product in the past . Great replacement and such a fair price . I bought Golden Fair and was surprised when the description stated it was the &#34; Large &#34; size for the price it was listed at . It is in fact the Large sized . The problem with this listing is that they are SO many sellers , SO many colors with SO many product descriptions . But I can vouch that Golden Fair is true to it 's description . Will purchase again .
 love bare minerals , i have been addicted to BM since 2005 , tried other things but keep coming back . the coverage is excellent and light wearing
 Bare minerals make up is hard to find at a low price . I found it here and had to buy two !!
 The price was so good , I was expecting the smaller size jar or arrive so I ordered 3 . I was shocked when the large size jar arrived . I can not believe what a great price this was ! These will last me for years .
 This product was just as it is when you purchase it from the Sephora store . It 's even better though ... because I did n't have to waste time going to Sephora and picking it up ! I also think it had a $ 3 discount from the store price . Very happy .
 I have an allergic reaction to many makeup products but fortunetely I am able to use Bare Escentuals . I do n't like the way liquid makeup feels or looks on my skin . I have wrinkles and liquids seemed to feel like spackle filling in the cracks ! Bare Escentuals powder is so light it 's like there 's nothing on my skin yet it smoothes out the uneven coloring and makes my skin look soft and glowing and heaven knows , we can use all the help we can get ! Easy to apply and lasts all day.Only negative is their new top . I am cheap and try to use every grain of powder but with this new &#34; improved &#34; top , you ca n't remove it and as it gets empty , I know there is still a bunch of powder hiding in there , just taunting me !
 I normally buy bare escentual bareminerals foundation from Sephora . But this product was a few dollars cheaper , So I decided to buy it online . I 'm glad I did because It is just like Sephora 's product only a couple bucks cheaper .
 This makeup is amazing . As long as you do n't mind the wait and you time your replacement orders properly it 's way better than paying full price at an approved vendor that supplies Bare Minerals . a MUST HAVE PRODUCT PEOPLE !!
 I love bare minerals . I usually get med beige with a yellow undertone . This med is a pink undertone . I have to mix it with a little of the warm color I have but for the price it was worth it !
 Hi i would love to give this seller a good amazing feedback , this product came right directly on time , thank u ! A + + + + I would also recommend Bare Escentuals makeup for those who have oily skin . I suggest those who have severely dry skin is go to Shiseido makeup products -LRB- bareminerals own this company too -RRB- , my mom used to be on bare minerals n switched to Shiseido , i know Shiseido products are highly cost prices but buy the samples on ebay , save u money $ $ $ n lasts long time ... Thanks all !
 the price was cheaper than gettimg it directly from the bareminerals company who didnt even have it available online ! It arrived quickly too ! Very satisfied !
 Great product like always . Gives skin a healthy look . Blends well , lots of natural colors to choose from . Great product .
 I wo n't use anything else . It provides full coverage with a sun kissed glow . And it 's so light and does n't clog pores . I can even sleep with it on . Best product for the best price on the market .
 As a gal in my 50 's , with good skin that nevertheless gets a little dry and sensitive and has some fine lines , I always thought of Bare Minerals was for the young gals . Too drying and cakey for an older gal like me ... WRONG !!! I have been going through foundation by the dozens trying to find a new one since my beloved Max Factor PanStik was discontinued -LRB- yes , that is how old I am , I used to use PanStik ! -RRB- . So I finally figured , what the heck , let me give it a shot.Well , to my surprise , I LOVE IT !!!! It does NOT make my skin dry at all - in fact , it feels like it is keeping in more moisture and is more protected . it looks smoother and more even , even when I am not wearing it.It does NOT make fine lines more noticeable at all - in fact it gives me a nice luminous glow without looking makeup-y that is more youthful than my previous foundations.It is EASY to apply and foolproof too , as long as you follow the instructions and buff it nicely . It was easy to learn how to do it.You can do a quick buff for a casual look or layer it for a more polished look.It never looks powdery or dry on me.I have to say , I am impressed and would definitely recommend it to others.one proviso - if there is a store near you , go and try the colors and let them demonstrate how to use it . I thought i understood how to do it but at the store I got other tips and was able to pick just the right colors without geussing .
 I love it now , but it took some getting used to . -LRB- SKIP to the last three short paragraphs if you want my abbreviated review -RRB- . Some background
 I have been using Bare Minerals for a few years now . I love it . This past purchase I decided to try warm tan instead of my usual golden tan . I am dark complected and I felt for the winter , this brought out more color for me . The golden tan gives me more of a glow for the summer months . Fast shipping , great product , fabulous price especially if you can combine it for super saver shipping .
 I use it for 5 years , love it , my face doesnt look DONE , would not be without it . In summer I add the faux tan to it to match my natural suntan , it 's also a good sunblock
 I started using this product about 3 years ago . I 've tried other mineral makeups such as Merle Norman , but I always go back to the Bare Minerals . It wears so well . When first putting it on it does have abit of a powdery look , but within a half hour it blends into your skin and looks great . I do use the mineral veil over the foundation which I think gives you a dewey look . I work long shifts -LRB- 12 hrs -RRB- and I use to get a shiney look towards the end of the day and my eyes would become irritated , but with this makeup it looks as good as when I first put it on . No eye irritation either . My only complaint is I can not buy this product where I live , I have to order it .
 I like this product because it evens out my skin tone . Also , it 's not heavy and does n't leave lines like liquid makeup.The only thing I do n't like about it is that the powder flies around , leaving a mess on counters and clothing , but it 's avoidable .
 Amazing product , just as seller described . Product and shipping time could n't have been better ! Thank you !! This is the greatest make up of all time . This tone in particular . . . Med . Beige is the perfect shade for anyone with an olive undertone to their skin . I 'm Italian , and in the winter , it 's hard to find something the correct tone for when not tan . This is THAT color . Depending on which Bare Minerals brush I use , you easily get light to full coverage . It 's your choice . I 'm obsessed with the line , the make up , and Highly recommend this seller
 My skin is so dry that regular liquid foundation peels off my face in large flakes . So I stopped wearing foundation until I found bare minerals . It covers very nice and it feels like I am not wearing any make-up at all . For dry skin I would recommend using the prime-time primer or skin rever upper 5 to 10 minutes before putting on the powder . It adds just the right amount of moisture . And for blemishes I love the rare minerals blemish therapy . It is tinted and cleared up my blemishes in only a few days.I used to get mad because there were parabens in this product but the last set I bought no longer had them so that is a + .
 I bought this product at a regular store -LRB- Ulta -RRB- and fell in love with it . It does not look caked on and it covers most flaws
 I work in a Plastic Surgeons office , and we sell another high end mineral makeup . It cost much more than Bare Minerals . My opinion is Bare Minerals is better . It covers much better , and looks more natural . The one thing I discovered is that instead of using the brushes that are recommended , I apply with a round makeup sponge . The coverage is better that way . Also you can dab alittle more to cover any area you need to with your sponge . And if your oily at all , a must is Mineral Veil . Love this product and I have used it for years . Liquid makeup has so may fillers that are bad for your skin , and they also use dangerous ingredients like glycol.Another big plus is ease of application . Mineral makeup cuts you foundation time in half . You never have to worry about that unsightly cut off point .
 I am so delighted to have started using the Bare Minerals line of products . I 've had problem skin most of my life . Any foundation I used created acne flair ups . Then , after coming off of Acutane , I cound ' t find a foundation that was right for me - Until I started using The Bare Escentuals line of products . My skin has never looked better or more natural . And the built-in sun protection is fantastic .
 WOW , where to begin . I first got this about half-way through freshman year of high school because I had really , REALLY bad skin . Like breakouts everywhere , it was a mess . So naturally I would try to cover it up with cakey and stickey and thick liquid or mousse foundations , which just made my skin worse . I was getting desperate because high school is hard enough without terrible skin so I finally splurged and switched to Bare Escentuals foundation , blush -LRB- for those special occations -RRB- , and mineral veil . Since getting those three products I can honestly say that not only has my skin gotten better , with less breakouts , but the make-up itself works better than thicker formulas . Even though when I first got it I was skeptical , like this little powder will cover redness ?? It REALLY WORKS , it has much better and better looking -LRB- radiant -RRB- coverage , although I never really believed that whole `` you can even sleep in it !! '' deal , I always take it off anyways . Please , just give this stuff a try at least once , you 'll love it !
 Great product ! I have found the advertising to be very true . Light on your face , covers the minor flaws well , never break out from it ... etc. . I would recommend Bare Escentuals to anyone !
 If you have dry skin , be sure to use a moisturizer or this will not look nice . Otherwise , very natural , covers imperfections nicely with only one product . Have been using it for almost a year .
 I am hooked on Bare Escentuals - it provides the best coverage of anything I 've tried and you do n't feel like you have anything on!However , the brushes they carry are a little disappointing.I bought `` Prescriptives '' brushes , much better quality and worth the $ $ .
 You would n't think that just a powder like this could give you coverage , but yet give you a natural glow , but this does . Must use the professional makeup brushs for applying to get the full benefit -LRB- make sure to clean them with warm water and mild soap regularly -RRB- . Also , the other products are great with it
 I first bought this off of an infomercial 3 years ago hoping that the claims were correct . I have not been disappointed yet , in any of their products . The foundation covers all of my discolorations and evens out my complexion beautifully . I would recommend to anyone .
 I have been using this product for about 3 months , and love it . The best part is not having to deal with the lines at the mall and having it delived to my door .
 This is a product I have been using for years and love the light weight foundation powder . It always leaves my skin clear and hides any imperfections . You really can not beat the price either .
 I dont regret ordering , was shipped quickly and was cheaper than the stores . the container was new and the correct shade . I would order again .
 Bare Minerals is the best makeup foundation I know and I have tried quite a few . I love how it feels like you are not wearing any makeup at all . It blends with your skin and makes you glow naturally !
 I have very sensitive and allergic reaction prone sking - especially on my face . This light makeup is a good solution for me because it does n't make me break out and it looks nice and natural with the right shade . It helps smooth and diminish the appearance of redness and dark circles . I always finish the look by applying the dark shade/bronzer as a blush and sometimes putting the mineral veil on top of the foundation and before the blush for longer lasting wear . I do n't do this everyday , but whenever I have an outing or special occasion it looks nice .
 This is the third time that I bought this foundation . It does a great job hiding some imperfections . Absolutely recommend it !
 It 's the only powder makeup I use , this is my winter shade for when I do n't have a tan . Covers my acne really well and does n't clog my pores
 It was just like it was described . The reason I bought it online instead of going to the mall was because I hate going to the mall . I am forever buying my bare minerals makeup on Amazon now . Thanks !!!!
 I 've used this product for years and highly recommend it . The new Click , Lock , Go sifter is a great way to help control the powder .
 In my over twenty years of trying numerous foundations , I have yet to see anything cover and perfect all while allowing the natural radiance of your skin to shine through . This powdery foundation is like powdered gold . Not only do the crushed minerals shimmer ever so delicately , they are magical once they touch your skin.The lightness of the product is fascinating and you feel as if you are not wearing foundation . The free feeling and the beautiful complexion you achieve through the use of Bare Escentuals may make you want to try all their products . The kits are a good way to introduce your skin to the products because they include the brushes you need to apply this powdery foundation.The Artist in you will love the way you apply this makeup . Each container of powder has many possibilities . You can blend more warmth or add a touch of summer shimmer . Once you have your foundation on , the possibilities are endless.This product is free of preservatives , talc , oil , fragrance , dyes and irritating chemicals . Once I put on this makeup , I thought I was dreaming . My skin adores this product and liquid makeup is history ! The mineral veil also keeps away shine and is the perfect compliment to this foundation . This makeup and the delicious Lush bath products are my finds of the year . I take a bath with one of the bath ballistics and then apply this makeup and feel like the world is a more beautiful place . Bare Escentuals will add the magic of radiant skin so your natural beauty is never hidden from the world . ~ The Rebecca Review
 I was in a hotel in Las Vegas before an important interview and I was again frustrated with my make-up . Nothing I applied really looked `` natural '' . After many years I found a color to match my skin -LRB- I have extremely fair skin -RRB- , but the look of the foundation was cakey after a while . I have trully tried everything and every make-up out there , including make-up brands only found in Europe and nothing worked . It was the only time I gave in to an infomercial because I was simply tired and fed-up . I REALLY REALLY LOVE THIS MAKEUP !!! I now have a `` naturally '' beautiful skin and people ca n't tell I 'm even wearing make-up most of the time . A few pointers :1 - Make sure you layer it . It 's very important to conceal everyting first ! If you apply layer after layer with the concealing brush , the make-up actually looks natural and the concealing part looks nice . Then you can use the big brushes for the all-over foundation .1 -LRB- a -RRB- - You can just apply in small sections . I usually dab the quantity needed just for my cheeks , then for forhead a.s.o. Trying to cover everything all at once may not be effective because you may need different coverage levels for different areas.2-You need to use a good moisturizer . My skin is extremely dry and even flaky , so the moisturizer helps the make-up really set.3-You do n't always have to wear the mineral veil . If I 'm having one of my `` alligator skin '' days , I just use the foundation and my skin is not flaky-miraculous ! Good luck !
 I 'm allergic to most make-ups and lotions and stuff but I tried this product and have never looked back ! It has great coverage and does n't bother my skin at all , the way some supposed hypo-allergenic make-ups do . Highly recomended
 I love , love , love this makeup ! It makes my skin virtually flawless even though I have acne scars , without the matte look that other foundations create . It looks like I am not wearing anything but gives my skin a great glow . I also love that it is natural and made of minerals and protects my skin from the sun . I am too lazy to wash my face at night , so its great that Bare Minerals is so good for the skin that you can actually sleep in it ! It improved the condition of my skin . You need to use Mineral Veil over it for a finished look . I love the whole Bare Essentials line .
 I have used this product for the last 7 years and will not use anything else . It is so much cheaper here .
 This makeup is amazing and at half the price you can get it for anywhere else , I will definitely be buying from this company from now on !
 I 've been using this foundation since 2001 , I Love it . The foundation goes on light yet because of its great coverage it does n't take too long to apply which is what I need when gettting ready to go to work ... do n't have a lot of time . I 've always liked the bareminerals product line , particularly in their foundatiions , warmth , blushes and eye shadows . I 've seen and tried me-too-youers but I still come back to bareminerals . I highly recommend it .
 I have bought this product twice now . It does not break me out and gives a moderate coverage . Its one of those foundations that you ca n't see going all over but it hides most things .
