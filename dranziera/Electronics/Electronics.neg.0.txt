 I have had the charger for more than two years . It charges AA batteries just fine , but has a huge problem securing smaller AAA batteries . To charge the smaller batteries you need to flip down the little button at the positive end . In the beginning one of the four AAA batteries would pop up , and now three out of the four wo n't hold . The problem is the flip mechanism became loose , and any horizontal pressure would push the buttons back up . What I have to do now is using duct tape and a segment of crayon , apply the crayon on the buttons , and wrap the tape around . You know how painful that is .
 I bought one of these chargers . . the instructions say the lights stay on while the battery charges ... true . The instructions doNT say the lights turn off when its done . Which is also true . 24 hours of charging and the lights stay on . I returned it thinking I had a bad unit.The new one did the same thing . I just kept it since it does charge ... but the lights are useless since they seem to always stay on . It 's a `` backup '' charger for when I manage to drain all my AAs but I would n't want this as my only charger .
 I read the reviews , made my purchase and was very disappointed . The charger is convenient by charging all four batteries at once but the charge only lasts a very short time . I now have to go and find batteries that will give me longer life than the kodak NiMH AA batteries .
 I bought this charger in Jul 2003 and it worked OK for a while . The design is nice and convenient . However , after about a year , the batteries would not hold a charge . Might as well just get alkaline disposables , or look elsewhere for a charger that comes with batteries that have better staying power .
 I 've had this for just over a month . I had read other reviews on this product prior to purchasing , and to me it seemed like it had received good reviews as simple-to-use machine with good attribues for not-so-electronic-literate person like myself . It had been working just fine , until few days ago I was playing a DVD and all of a sudden it would freeze , and on the TV screen there would be many different colored squares , completely distorting the image . And now , the Dvd player does not even recognize any format -LRB- I 've tried CDs , DVDs , and even VCDs -RRB- , as it only says `` Incorrect Disc '' . I just now found another review where the person had the same problem , had to take it to a local service center , got fixed , came back , and the exact same problem popped back up three weeks later.Reading that , I do n't even know if I want to even bother taking it to get it fixed . Since it still plays VHS perfectly fine , maybe I 'll just invest in a simple DVD player , which defeats the whole purpose of why I bought a DVD/VHS combo player in the first place ...
 I also began having the incorrect disc problems that I 've read about on here . The VCR still works , but hte DVD side is useless . I understand that DVD players sometimes just quit on you , but after not even one year ? To me that 's a sign on bad quality . I 'm giving up JVC after this as well . I 'm sticking to Sony or giving another brand a shot .
 I am a big JVC fan , but I do not like this model , I was suspiscious when I saw several units in the return section of the store . I bought one anyway -LRB- new -RRB- and must say I am not happy . The unit sends out clicks to the receiver once in a while , the transition between scenes is not always smooth , -LRB- like a little pause -RRB- and while it is still fairly new I ca n't get any DVD , CD or even a DVD headcleaner to work . All I get is a `` incorrect disc '' message .
 I love the style of this , but after a couple years , the DVD is giving me problems . It does n't even work anymore and I use my broken PS2 Now . I would n't recommend this , I 'm just going to upgrade to a recorder now . I wish it would work but I guess i 'm giving up on JVC . I really did like this one ... before it stopped working . The dvd player gave me problems probably after a year of having it .
 I can not scroll through a DVD menu that is set up vertically . The triangle keys will only select horizontally . So I can not select anything on most DVD 's besides play . No special features , no language select , nothing , just play .
 My experience
 I purchased my 6620LDG , like other reviewers , to replace my old kitchen TV . I really wanted an LCD with a built-in DVD player . While I like the TV just fine , the remote is another story . I actually wrote to the manufacturer about the remote and gave them quite an earful . Included in my e.mail was the following : `` While I find the overall TV to be good , I am appalled at thequality and functionality of the remote that operates and comes withthat particular model . I simply ca n't believe that a name brand likeSylvania would provide such a poorly designed remote to accompany ahigher-end TV . '' '' ... this remote is very uncomfortableto hold and operate . It is as if your designers made no accommodationsfor how people hold remotes , and what makes them comfortable . '' `` Seriously . I cantt imagine who designed the actual size and shape of that remote or which idiot approved it 's public distribution , but the entire lot of them need to find other professions if they think that this remote is at all acceptable . '' `` A remote should be , at the very least , functional and comfortable enough to go unnoticed , dont you think ???? Aside from the horrid shape , size and weight of the remote , this remote has an absolutely terrible layout and lacks some of the most basic buttons that come with the cheapest of remotes . I was shocked and horrified to realize that this hideous remote had no `` last channel '' button . Are your designers living in the 70s or do they just have their heads up their butts ? '' `` I havent had a TV remote in my hand without a last channel button in at LEAST 20 years . Since the remote is so huge , how could it not have one of the most traditional buttons on it ? I consider the very lowest and feature-less remotes to be those in hotel rooms . They look like top-of-the-line models when compared to this piece of crap.On top of not having the basic buttons , and amongst other issues , the remote is frustrating because
 I bought this for my wife for her birthday , and had toreturn it because the DVD palyer would not work . I returned it and got a repalcement , which once again the DVD player failed to work ! It is a piece of junk .
 This TV is set so that it is not capable of a `` recall '' function . If you want to flash back between channels , this TV is not going to give it to you . The remote control that comes with the TV has no recall function , so I bought a Sony universal , which is a much better remote , that had the recall button on it . However , I soon learned that the TV is set at the factory to not have the capability to flash-back . It may not be a big deal to some , but this user found it very annoying .
 Was hoping that this drive would run off of bus power , but it required the adapter to actually work . :-LRB- I sent it back .
 I am disappointed in its performance . It seems underpowered and is constantly trying to read CDs , half the time unsuccessfully . I am going to try to return it to Amazon .
 Bought this camera for Christmas . Had her open it first so she could film the nights party & NO TAPES ARE INCLUDED ! Of course all stores are closed Christmas day so the thing is USELESS until the day after . Shame on Sony . How much would a tape included in the packace cost them ? Not included Battery chargers are ...
 This product description is WRONG . I purchased this product because of this `` $ 25,000 '' equipment warranty . Product received only states that the actual surge protector is under warranty and has no mention of equipment warranty . Is Amazon starting to make stuff up now ?
 I 've had the camcorder for a while now , and was hoping to be able to use the USB streaming feature to make small computer movies and send them to my friends and family overseas . Although the camcorder is good the included software is weak and the USB streaming makes a very choppy poor quality AVI file . I recently got a new computer and could not find the device driver disk that came with the camcorder . Sony technical support was a joke and they ended up trying to sell me a driver for my camcorder . So now I have a camcorder that I can plug into my TV or record onto a VHS -LRB- Do people still use VHS ? -RRB- but any dreams I have of putting something on my computer are fading fast . I 'm going to have to find a new way to send my parents the video I took of my new house.Frankly in this day and age an analogue camcorder is a waste of money .
 While this is a decent Analog camcorder , do n't expect much from the USB streaming feature . The maximum frame size over USB is 320x240 , which is half the minimum recommended for creating a DVD out of a home movie . If you want to get the video from your tapes onto a computer or DVD , expect to purchase a separate video capture device or card.To make matters worse , the bundled software does n't let you capture more than thirteen minutes of video at a time before it crashes and claims the drive is out of disk space , regardless of how much disk space you really have avaliable . This happens even when recording to NTFS volumes , which do not have the 4 gig file size limit of Fat32.Most third party programs will also have issues using the camcorder 's USB streaming features . The drivers create an eclectic audio device that many video capture programs ca n't see , so you 'll have to use a separate audio cable unless you like the idea of not having any sound . Roxio 's products are among the many that ca n't use the audio driver.In short , it 's a decent camcorder , assuming you compare it to other devices as though the USB streaming feature did n't exist , because for all practical purposes , it does n't .
 I bought it new in 2002 for $ 400 . The color is pretty good . The resolution is very poor , only close shot get you satified . Other than that you get blur edge and barrel distortion sometimes . I did n't use it a lot for the first 3 years , only the last 2 years I used it regularly to tape my daughter 's piano class homework every 2 weeks for 5-8 minutes each time . Recently I have to knock this camera extremly hard several times to make the recording start -LRB- It 's common issue as the piano teacher told me . -RRB- . So I have to find a new camcorder now . I do n't know what can I do if it refuses to work one day in my daughter 's piano class .
 This would be a nifty little contraption if it was n't for the fact that you ca n't change the top -- my primary impetus for buying it.I have a Handspring Visor and lost my stylus . I did n't want to pay for shipping on a new stylus 3-pack from Handspring , so I went to Best Buy and purchased this instead . Not only can you not change the top so that it fits in the Visor properly , but now the entire headpiece falls out constantly so that the bottom part of the stylus gets stuck in the stylus-holder . Oh , and did I mention that the light function only works part of the time?Not worth your time or effort .
 This power adapter has only half the Amp rating needed to power the powerbook G4 17 '' . It took 14 hours to charge the battery and still used the battery partially when the computer was in use and the power was connected though the adapter . I noticed that they left out the Amps it has in the advertising . The other reviews below must be fake or they have a smaller G4 powerbook or an iBook .
 I decided to give this a try after taking a look at the Apple price for their replacement -LRB- averaging $ 80 , s/h NOT included -RRB- . The reviews helped ease my mind about using another party replacement for the adapter as well , and for the 1st few months everything seemed ok , although I kind of wished the connection seemed more secure . Unfortunately , in the past 2-3 months or so , I 'd noticed the somewhat ` loose ' fit of the plug had gotten worse , so much so that just adjusting the laptop on my legs would mean it often falls out . At this point , now I have to keep checking the connection to make sure it 's still inside the Mac . I 'll glance up at the battery indicator and wo n't see the charging icon , but rather that my battery 's being used for God only knows how long . Then I 'll have to press the plug back in again . I took the Macally adapter out one day to look at it closely and discovered what the real issue is
 In a complaint to Macally regarding intermittent charging , their response was : Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4Thank you for contacting us.Our PS-AC4 has problem with the 12 '' PowerBook G4 . At this moment , we do not have any working one for your computer .
 This charger worked fine for a few months , but now charges so slowly that using the computer while it 's charging drains the battery . Very frustrating . Very poor quality .
 I bought this to replace the supposedly same power adapter that I purchased last year . This is NOT the same adapter as pictured for the item -LRB- I see that a customer has added two pictures of the true product -RRB- . I was not concerned with this difference but would have preferred to have a light indicating the power is on . At first , it seemed to power my powerbook G4 fine , but later it started to cycle as charging and not charging , thus making the screen brighten and darken . When I shut the computer and let it charge , it did charge some , but I 'm concerned about ruining my battery -LRB- which is also a replacement -RRB- . It simply does not work when you are using the computer . . and I 'm ALWAYS using my computer ! I will have to find an alternative to this product . I thought it was bad enough that the one I got last year quit working , but this is ridiculous .
 Be careful . The box packing for this says it works with a PowerBook G4 or an iBook G3 . It will not work for a iBook G4 . The Amazon product page does not make that clear .
 I bought two of these in the last year and a half ; one to keep with me when I travel and one to leave at home -LRB- replaced the original one from Apple -RRB- . I loved these ! They were the same model number as the one I ordered in the last month . I had to buy another one b/c I dropped one of mine once too often . I plugged in the new one , and it started charging , but then it started going on and off and the screen was dimming back and forth . The battery indicator kept going from charging to discharging . I did n't think that this could be good on the computer and/or battery . I closed the lid , left it to charge overnight -LRB- thinking I had drained the battery too much -RRB- and it charged the battery , but again , once I had discharged the battery about 25 % and tried it again , it surged again . I ordered another one and sent the first one back and it did the same thing . I really disappointed ... the charger looks different than my first ones , but it looks sturdier and better . Why does n't it work the same ?
 I am on my third cord , after returning it twice -LRB- within one year ! -RRB- . This cord does n't charge consistently , and so it makes your screen flicker , and music and videos skip . You have to fiddle with the cord for 10 minutes to even get it to charge at all sometimes . Believe me , it 's not worth the lower cost for this - just get a more expensive one that actually works .
 I 've now been through three of these cords . they seem to last around a year before just dying . The first two eventually had fatal connection issues with the piece that connects to the computer , however my third one has just died and is actually not getting any power from the wall . The little indicator just fades out , and now wo n't come on at all . Yes it 's a lot cheaper than the other cords , but I 'm just not sure its better . I know lots of people have problems with the apple cords as well .
 This power adapter charges my 17 '' Powerbook G4 excruciatingly slowly and , now 6 months after purchase , it does n't always even charge.Flakey charging issue
 Bought this guy for a Mac PowerBook G4 Titanium -LRB- the description clearly states this power supply works for the PowerBook G4 -RRB- . Never worked . Could n't say if this is a fluke or if they are all of comparable quality .
 You are n't saving any being this adapter . I purchased this for a 12 '' G4 Powerbook . The power it supplies goes on and off constantly . This ca n't be good for the computer . It certainly does n't charge it . Do n't waste your money on this Macally adapter . Try to find an original Apple adapter if you can .
 Ever since I bought this and charged my ibook with it , my ibook has n't worked ! Do n't buy it .
 I never should have bought it . It broke after using it a week .
 As others have experienced , mine starts a a charge/battery/charge cycle that is maddening , and probably no good at all for the battery . Do n't buy .
 This adaptor and Apple 's adaptor are not going to live long . They are all pretty worthless , except for the fact that you HAVE TO HAVE ONE.I just buy the cheapest 65 watt adaptors I can find -LRB- for both 15 '' iBook G4 and 17 '' PowerBook G4 -RRB- and plan to replace them within 6 months . Every now and then I find them for $ 20 - 40.00 , and buy 2 to 4 at a time . Next time I 'll buy a new laptop with the magnetic plug ! Am very disappointed in Apple . I love my Mac , but quality is definitely going down .
 I read the reviews before purchasing this adapter , and I guess I simply got a dud . That happens , but the tech support is horrible . The support staff was very unhelpful and told me it would take weeks to replace.The other adapter replacements do n't seem much better , given the poor reviews for Kensington 's model.Just hope you do n't get a dud .
 I bought this adapter for my 12-inch G4 powerbook , one of the computers listed as compatible with this AC adapter . The specs all match up and it SHOULD work . But it did n't . The power would fluctuate and the computer would go back and forth between AC power and battery power , making the screen flicker and the battery never charged . I contacted MacAlly and they said they 're aware of the problem but do n't have a solution . Their answer to the problem was to return it , which I did.If even MacAlly admits it does n't work , they really should n't keep selling it . All I can do is say do n't buy this AC adapter .
 Many positive reviews seem to indicate that this charger works handsomely for some folks and some laptops . It did not , however , work for me or my 12 '' Aluminum Powerbook G4 . Prior to purchase I visited the MacAlly website and found this line regarding compatibility : `` AC adaptor works with G3 iBook and G4 PowerBook only `` I assumed that my PowerBook G4 would fit under the definition of a `` G4 PowerBook '' and proceeded with my purchase . The adapter arrived quickly and smartly packaged , but when connected it would continuously cycle between charging and not charging or connected and disconnected . This seemed to be the case even when the laptop was powered off , but was particularly apparent when the laptop was running as it would cycle between full and 3/4 screen brightness and the charge indicator would bounce between `` charging '' and `` calculating -LRB- ie running from battery -RRB- status . When I contacted MacAlly via email about this I received this marginally helpful response : --------------------------------------- Dear Customer , Thank you for contacting us.If the adapter you purchased does not have a blue LED light on the white Brickbox , it may have charging problem with 12 '' PowerBook G4.Please return to your vendor and buy another brand charger for 12 '' Powerbook G4 if this is possible.Sincerely , Michael Huang , Tech SupportMacally USA4601 E. Airport Dr.Ontario , CA 91761 --------------------------------------- I replied , attempting to clarify that he was essentially instructing to buy from someone else . And received the following `` clarification . '' --------------------------------------- Dear Customer , Thank you for contacting us.Clearly put , this adapter is designed for powerbook G3 and G4 series , no problem about it.Recently we have received some feedbacks , just for 12 '' screen size PowerBook G4 only , that some 12 '' powerbook G4 -LRB- not all of them -RRB- might exists some powering flickering issue between charging and battery . Currently we are still under the investigation phase for the cause for this issue.Customers who had bought this AC adapter with eligible warranty can mail the adapter back to our company for us to duplicate their scenario to troubleshoot the cause . -LRB- powerbook model , operating system version , etc. -RRB- For those customer who are in dire need for such adapter , if it is possible , they can contact the vendor for return or exchange for another brand which is working problem-free with powerbook 12 '' . Either way will do.Please advise.Sincerely , Michael Huang , Tech SupportMacally USA --------------------------------------- So , I can return the charger to MacAlly for `` troubleshooting . '' But no mention of repair/replacement/refund and some vague hinting that perhaps the charger does not work with the range of laptops that they claim.Ultimately this charger may provide a good value for some , but seems to be somewhat particular ; even above and beyond the well covered 65W-45W distinction . Lastly , MacAlly did not provide a particularly satisfying customer support experience .
 This product does not work with my ibook G4 . As stated by some earlier reviews by other customers , the charger toggles between charging and not charging . Occasionally , if it is left on , it will continuously charge . I thought about keeping it , but it is unreliable and there are other third party options for $ 10 more.This one is going back to Amazon .
 It worked well for a few weeks , but then the battery of my iBook G4 stopped being re-charged .
 Recently purchased this . It charges my powerbook G4 intermittently , charging up and stopping every 2 seconds . Very annoying and not helpful at all . Could n't charge the battery of my computer up . Also , it makes a buzzing sound every time it `` charged '' for the 2 seconds . Maybe mine was faulty , but I would rather find another brand than exchange it for another one . I 'd put zero stars , but you ca n't put up a review without one.I instead , bought a BTI -LRB- brand -RRB- charger . Many people will give a bad review without giving you an alternative or solution then . I recommend the BTI powerbook charger . You can find it on Amazon for CHEAPER than the Macally by searching `` Battery Technology AC Adapter for Notebooks -LRB- PS-MC-G4 -RRB- '' . It cost me $ 27.84 instead of $ 33.24 . Not a huge difference in money , but there is a huge difference in performance . The BTI charger works quite well and does n't heat up badly . FINALLY AN ADPATER THAT WORKS WELL ! I 've had 2 apple adapters , a Macally , and now the BTI . Try the BTI .
 I bought one of these adapters about a year ago to replace the original apple charger that came with my ibook G4 . The Macally worked fine for about a year then died ; since it lasted as long as the pricier apple one , I decided to go ahead and get another one . The new adapter - which is listed as exactly the same product I bought the first time - is physically different , and I think is not really compatible with the ibook G4 ; the charger does n't always connect firmly to the laptop . And it could be a coincidence , but in the month since I have had it my computer has started having sudden power failures when running off a/c power -LRB- but has no problems running off battery -RRB- . I guess I will be shelling out for the apple adapters in future - this one seems too risky .
 I read reviews of this product before I bought it that mentioned that it makes a high pitched sound . I figured these reviewers probably had defective adapters . However , mine also makes a high pitched sound . It does n't do it all the time , but I worry that as it gets older , the sound will get worse . Although it charges my computer fine , if I could do it over again , I might pay the extra money and get a different brand ... unless you do n't mind high pitched noises .
 Bought this about a month ago as a back-up adaptor . When used on my Powerbook G4 and my wife 's iBook G4 , it does not charge them when in operation . It supplies power so that the units are functional when plugged in , but it will only charge the units when they are closed or turned off . I 'd give this a one star , but at least it powers them when they 're on , even without the charging .
 Nice form factor etc. . . but bad function . Product appears to charge my Powerbook G4 12 '' when it is off or asleep , but when working it cycles on and off and emits a faint buzzing sound from the brick . Try another product .
 my ac adapter broke down as well , the tip going into the computer simply fell out of the plastic plug . do n't get it . it 's basically $ 40 wasted .
 I received a different adapter so I can not really tell you about the Macally adapter . I received an adapter from Inspire and it does not have the longer cord , the velcro strap or the led lights . But it does charge my computer and it arrived quickly .
 This adaptor does not work with the dual USB iBook . It looks like a good product , but the plug does n't fit .
 I had to return it and order the original one
 This product should have arrived at least 12 days ago ... I may be out some money .
 I take back my previous comments as now this adapter is dead , and MUCH faster than my original one . I await Macally 's response to my request for a new one .
 I 'm sure this product is great for G4 Powebooks and G3 iBooks , but nowhere in this product description does it say that this adapter is NOT for use with iBook G4s . I tried this on my iBook G4 , and the computer kept switching back and forth between battery power and the power supply from the adapter . I 'm returning this to Amazon tomorrow , but am upset that I wasted $ 20 overnighting this adapter because I absolutely need to use my computer this weekend . I wish they would update the product description to make it explicit that this is for Powerbook G4s and iBook G3s ONLY .
 Look carefully at the pictures for this product . The initial picture , without the brand name and with a blue LED light , is the product that works on iBook G4 . The customer photos show a completely different product , one that is not recommended for use on iBook G4 . I did not receive the product in the initial picture , but thankfully I noticed this before I opened the package -LRB- the package says iBook G3 -RRB- and I called the support line . They said I had not received the right product and could not guarantee that the product would work correctly -- or at all , so I ordered a replacement through Amazon . Still , I did not get the right product . Amazon told me they would stop selling this product as there is a problem with what is being shipped . I got my money back and went to our local Mac 2nd party store to find something reliable for the G4 .
 I 'm now on my third charger for my Powerbook -LRB- my dad says I 'm rough on equipment -RRB- . Let me tell you , the Macally is NOT it . Like others , it fluctuates between charging and battery every 1-2 seconds and the brick makes weird squeaky noises . After not having a computer for a week and being so relived to finally get this charger , I was almost in tears to find that it is a piece of crap . It charges when the computer is off or in sleep mode , but that 's not going to cut it . If you have a Powerbook G4 , do n't waste your money on this .
 I bought this charger thinking that it would be compatible with my late 2005 iBook G4 . The description page has nothing stating that it is not for ibook G4 but only for Powerbook G4 and ibook G3 . Also , after only about 3 weeks of use the charger died completely . This is by far the worst charger I have ever had . Pros
 Ordered this item in October 2008 , as my original iBook power adapter had developed a short . The first Macally adapter I received powered the computer fine , but as soon as I let the battery deplete and expected the adapter to charge the battery , it failed . It would alternately go on and off -LRB- the power icon in the menu bar indicated this , toggling between `` powered '' and `` battery only '' every second or so -RRB- , and the white brick was making odd clicking noises.Returned it . Received a replacement . Same problem - as soon as it needed to charge the battery , the adapter failed . I gave up , asked for a refund , and purchased an Apple charger instead -LRB- with only a failing adapter for power , I was not inclined to give the Macally adapter a third try -RRB- . I should also note that the `` new '' design for this item does NOT match the photo shown here
 this charger does not have enough power to charge my Powerbook G4 while it is running . it will show the charger indicator back and forth from battery power to charging.But when I charge while it is off , it works perfect.I had requested a replacement once and the result was still the same .
 I have been very unhappy with this product because it :1 -RRB- makes a high pitched buzz2 -RRB- intermittently stops providing enough power causing my computer to constantly switch back and forth between battery and wall power .3 -RRB- the cord is difficult to wrapI 'll be trying to return it through the warranty process , but I wish I had just coughed up the -LSB- lots of -RSB- extra money to buy an Apple one .
 Well , it was a good deal and seemed to work well for a month ! But after the stated time it quit . I noticed that the charging/battery guage on the tool bar was flickering back and forth and noticed a quiet humming sound coming from the power adapter . Since I live in Eastern Europe and someone brought this here from the US for me to use as a second adapter -LRB- to use at work -RRB- it will be hard to return . Maybe it was a fluke , but now I 'm down to the original adapter and no backup . Hope you have better luck .
 I have been through two of these , each one only worked for a few months before going bad . After three months and only sporadic use , the first one I bought started cycling on-off continuously . This is n't apparent unless you are using it while plugged in , but the battery icon will show it is charging for a couple of seconds , then flip back to the battery icon for a couple of seconds and so on . I contacted the company , which confirmed it was faulty , so I sent it back to them for replacement . I received the replacement from Macally and after a couple of months , the second one started doing the same thing . I have read this is a pretty common occurrence with this product . I suppose there is a reason that it 's a third the cost of the Apple product .
 My Apple charger broke and I needed to buy a new one . Thinking it was ridiculous to spend $ 80 on a charger , I went with this Macally charger . I read most of the reviews here on Amazon , including the one and two star reviews from people who said the charger did n't work and , when plugged in , oscillated between charging and not charging the computer . I figured they might have received a dud and decided to try my luck anyhow . I have now received two of these items from Amazon both with the same problem . When I plugged it in and was using the computer at the same time , the power oscillated between charging and not charging every second or two . When I put the computer to sleep or turned it off , it seemed to charge the computer . Anyhow , after having the same problem twice , I decided to shell out the bucks for an actual Apple charger instead of having to deal with the annoying charger and keep sending them back and forth to Amazon.I do believe , however , that this charger fried my computer 's battery . After using this product a few times , hoping I could get it to work , the battery meter would read 70 % charged but the computer would just shut down because , in reality , it was not charged . The guy at the Apple store said that I would have to replace my battery eventually but that the charger probably helped speed that process along.Anyhow , I am now poorer from having to purchase both an Apple charger AND a new battery , but now I 'm happy that I can actually use my laptop ! I would not recommend this product to anyone not only for the inconvenience of having to deal with a faulty product but also because it can actually mess with your laptop.On a side note , Amazon returns were GREAT . Very efficient ... I have not had any problems with them . They even sent me the replacement product before I had a chance to mail back the first one . Something I was not expecting at all .
 I purchased this adapter to replace another PS-AC4 that worked for about 18 months before going belly up . This one lasted two weeks . I called MacAlly and quickly got an RMA number , then I overnighted the defective item to them . That was ten days ago , and I 'm still waiting for the replacement to arrive .
 I bought this because it was a cheaper alternative to Mac 's -LRB- ridiculously priced -RRB- $ 80 charger . At first it worked pretty good , but about a week or two after i got it it seems to not be working like it should . i think there is some kind of warranty , so i should try and exchange it ... but sometimes when it is plugged into my computer it will charge for one second , then stop for one second , charge for one second , stop for one second , etc. . It still manages to charge the computer , but im not sure if all this on \ off stuff is necessarily good for my computer ...
 I used one Macally charger for my G4 for a month before it died and stopped charging my computer . Amazon replaced the product and my second one lasted one day . I returned it and am now using an apple charger .
 I read the reviews on this site and noticed that some said they received the wrong product . After looking at mine i noticed i too had been slipped the Inspire adapter , not the Macally that i ordered -LRB- which is far superior to the cheap knock off -RRB- . I have been trying to contact Clear AV but they are never available . . am off to contact Amazon next .
 I plugged this item into my laptop and nothing happened . No power - nothing.When I unplugged this adapter the negative metal ring from the plug stayed lodged inside of my computer , I had to remove it with needle nose pliers.I had to call the company 5 times before getting a rep on the phone as I was continually placed in automated limbo for about 15 per call . The rep actually admitted to me that this happens alot because the rings are too small and fit to tight in the computers.I was really looking forward to saving some dough . But this adapter was surprisingly worse the the original that came with the computer.They are sending me return authorization .
 I bought my first Macally a year and half ago , and it worked great for about 7-8 months . After reading all the then recent bad reviews , I decided to risk it and order another one ... it 's not worth it . My second Macally acts exactly as all the other defected ones
 This charger is horrible . Worked for long enough for me not to be able to get my money back from Amazon . Makes the screen blink while charging and flashes back and forth from charging to not charging . Customer service at this company is horrible . After waiting two weeks for a response they wanted me to send it back before I get a new one . Who knows how long that will take . I am probably going to have to trash this waste of money for the more expensive Apple one . I guess you get what you pay for .
 An AC/DC power converter is a very basic item , so I had little doubt that this sub for the expensive Apple original would be effective , though not stylish . Unfortunately , we have had problems . The Powerbook started delivering electrical shocks and inconsistent charging with this adapter , and they got worse when we moved to a country on 240V . I know that the shock problem comes from the Macally adapter because I have another PB and an original Apple power supply , so can do all combinatorial tests . I like Macally and have several of their other products . I probably just got a bum unit but unfortunately can not deliver a positive review based on previous experience with the company .
 The adapter worked fine for my power book g4 for a few months and then it broke . Nothing physically happened to the adapter for it to break , but suddenly it just would n't charge any more . What 's interesting is that the blue light on the brick goes on when plugged in to a power source , but if I plug the cable that attaches the computer to the brick in , the light goes out and it does n't charge .
 We ordered the Macally PS-AC4 power adapter and received an entirely different product from a differnt comany . As noted by other Amazon shoppers we received th Inspire M8482 . This adapter is differnet in the following ways . . instead of the 10 ` cord with a velcro wrapper , it has a short cord that leavesthe transformer hanging from the input of your computer . This will ultimately break the DC connection from the board . . this is not repairable . Their is no led power light as advertised leaving you wondering if it is on . It is clearly a cheap knck off and we are taken for idiots who might not recognize that . I am mad ! I just went through a similar thing with Overstock . Months of emails , calls and waiting on hold ... for a grain of satisfaction . It is insulting to think that these big companies have so little respect for us !
 As someone who uses her laptop for several hours each day , being without an AC adapter can be a painful experience , so when I need a new one , I like it to show up in a timely manner and to actually work when I plug it in . This adapter ... not so much.When I plugged it in for the first time , it charged my laptop battery for about a second before clicking off . Then on again . Then off again . Every second or so , there was an annoying little clicking sound as it switched itself on and off , and the battery continued to drain itself very slowly . In sleep mode , it would charge , but only after almost a full day . Eventually , it started working properly . For a couple of days , anyway , before it defaulted to the previous condition . In a word
 I bought this adapter almost two years ago and it still works-kind of . The insulation on the area of the cable where it enters the brick has become damaged , exposing the outer wire . I taped it up , but there is always a connection issue , where the AC indicator at the top of the screen will often flash to battery power and then back to AC . I keep the AC adaptor in the front compartment of my backpack , so it sees some but not major abuse . I 'm sure this wo n't be an issue if you are n't traveling with it , but I just thought I would relate my experience .
 After using the charger for about 2 weeks I started noticing drops in the power feeding to the iBook . After about 2 months the charger stopped working altogether . On inspection I noticed that the metal part of the plug was separating from the plastic part and I suspect this is causing the disconnect . MacAlly has no warranty information on their web site and I called them several times only to be diverted to a messaging system and I never got a callback.I 'd say avoid if you can .
 I too have the same problem most recent reviewers have had
 I bought one of these in July after my original one of three years went on the fritz . At first , it seemed to work fine on my 12-inch Powerbook G4 . It had to turn my laptop over to see the green light and insure that it was charging . It 's a bit inconvenient since the original one lit up at the connection so that I could immediately see it 's charging state . The Macally Adapter charged my battery and spare with no problems.The real issue came when I wanted to use my computer at the same time as charging it . The screen flickered dim and full , every few seconds . The effect is just like the difference when the original charger was plugged in with the computer power-saving feature on . The screen goes from power-saving dim to full power , only this time , it keeps cycling . When I opened the Powersaver I could see that the charger was cycling between charging and not charging . Then I read on another web site that the Macally Charger does n't work with Aluminum powerbooks , which mine is.If you just want to charge your powerbook when it is off , the charger seems to work okay -LRB- at least , after a month of use -RRB- . But trying to use the computer with the power plugged in , like you might do giving a presentation , is most annoying.I wish I had check this one out a bit more . It 's not easy finding a charger now that Apple no longer makes the 12-inch . I ca n't vouch for how this might work on other laptops but I sure do n't recommend it for the 12-inch Powerbook G4 .
 I read the first few reviews on here and decided this product was a good buy . I could n't have been more wrong . After a few days of usage it started to charge for a second , then stop for a second , repeating on end . I 've read some more reviews , and it seems this is a common problem . Though it seems other people are satisfied with this product , so my advice would be to stay away from a product with such an evidently high percentage of lemons unless you feel like rolling the dice .
 The Macally PS-AC4 Power Adapter would not charge my PowerBook . I tested it with a multimeter , and found that it had an open lead.I contacted Amazon -LRB- even better , through their web site - no waiting on the phone or waiting for an email -RRB- , and they shipped another.This second one had the same problem as the first.I contacted Amazon again for a refund.The product was junk , but the service was excellent !
 I had the original Apple charger that came with my Powerbook G4 . It lasted me about a year and a half . I opted for this Macally charger , for two reasons , 1 . the price 2 . the great reviews on Amazon . I have had the charger for less the 6 months and it is already non-functional . Yes it is cheaper than the Apple charger , but it really comes out to the same price , considering that an apple charger costs about $ 90 and lasts 1 1/2 years and the Macally costs $ 30 and lasts six months .
 I bought this plug as a substitute to replace the Apple one that blew out . Unfortunately , this plug seems to have problems . I noticed that it heats up really badly when plugged into some plug outlets and causes my laptop to heat up as well . Once , I also heard some noise coming from my iBook G4 that was n't there before . This noise went away when I unplugged the power cord . What I 'm most upset about though is that it seems to have shortened the battery life of my computer to about 50 % now ! I think I should have bought the Apple plug instead .
 Unfortunately I shall not be able to review the Macally Power Adapter . I did not pay due attention to the fact that the AC adaptor works with G3 iBook and G4 PowerBook only.I plugged it in with a G4 iBook , it made some complaining noises and it died . Maybe it would be proper to really WARN that it will NOT work with a G4 iBook in CAPITAL LETTERS . $ 40 . - down the drain !
 Its hard to find these types of chargers since Mac switched to the magnetic type . Its hit and miss with the working . My battery indicator switches from charging to not in a blinking fashion .
 After 4.5 months , the adapter died . I contacted Macally about the one year warranty and learned :1 . the only way they will issue a refund is if the adapter causes a fire ! 2 . I needed to send the adapter to the manufacturer in California for them to evaluate -- I would be without a power cord for a week . They said the replacement adapter might be refurbished.Ultimately , I went to the Apple store and purchased a Mac power cord .
 its is unclear rather this really works with G4 Powerbook . the connector that plugs in to the powerbook fits , but the connection itself is unstable and easily disrupted by just a little wiggle or touch of the cable or connector . If you are looking for a replacement cable go with Apple branded . that one works .
 This is one of the most poorly designed and implemented chargers around . I own a 15 '' Powerbook G4 -LRB- which this is listed as being compatible with -RRB- . The problem is that this is n't actually a 65watt power cord ... so do n't expect to use your computer while it 's charging ... and do n't expect to be able to touch the `` brick '' as it 's plugged in , you 'll burn yourself.I 've returned this item and got a charger from another company for just a few dollars more that works a TON better .
 Macally is a terrible company . NOT worth the money you save . I recently bought a power cord thru them that emits an electrical current thru my computer . They will only send me a replacement but wo n't give me my money back . Not worth the risk . Buy Mac!Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4
 I bought this power adapter and it worked just fine at first . I took good care of it and after about six months it just stopped working .
 just got this charger yesterday to replace my broken apple charger.All this charger does is allow me to turn on the computer -LRB- sometimes -RRB- , it does NOT charger my powerbook g4 .
 Spoke praises too soon after owning the product for just a couple of days . Turned out , after about five days of use , the adaptor would not charge my battery -- I 'd plug it in , but the battery icon and the a/c power icon -LRB- lightning bolt -RRB- kept flickering back and forth as the battery drained down . I guess in this case , `` adaptor '' is an acronym for A Disappointing Amazon Purchase To Obviously Return . I packed up the product , returned it , and was promptly sent a new one , which had the same exact problem after only one hour of use -- if you read the other one-star reviews here , you 'll see that this is a very common problem with this product ! I 'm nutty enough to give it one more try , if they 'll send me yet another adaptor -- will post again with review , and if the third one does n't work , either , I believe the seller has a moral obligation to remove this product from Amazon . Oh , and for the record , I tried my old original Apple adaptor and , despite it 's loose , wobbly connection , it charged my computer just fine ! -LRB- So the problem is definitely their product , not my computer . -RRB-
 I just got the adapter today , I plugged it into my iBook G4 , and I was able to turn it on , but the battery does n't charge , and after a minute or two , the screen dims and the laptop goes to sleep . Buyers beware ! You might consider an official Apple adapter !
 I had this charger for over two years . Last week while it was plugged into my computer , it just died . No blue light no current . I ended up splicing the connector to my old frayed Apple charger . The connector is much better than Apple 's .
 Everything the other reviews say about this product is largely true
 i bought this product when my original ac adapter was destroyed by my dog . even at the price i paid , this was an awful product . most of the time i had to spend forever to jiggle the connecter into my mac to get it to even stay connected , and then it would just spontaneously stop charging and i have to jiggle again . it 's awful ! i never had any problem like that w / my original mac ac adapter . it 's gotten so frustrating that i think i 'm going to take a hammer and smash it into pieces . and technical support does n't reply my inquiries . do NOT buy this product , even if it seems cheap ! stay away from it ! look around on craigslist and buy a used adapter instead . this adapter is garbage
 I bought this to replace my ` falling apart ' original charger . Worked like a charm for 3 months , then I found my computer dying on me . The charging signal would change frequently from charging to not etc. . I ordered a new battery , as i thought it was on its way out . I downloaded coconutbattery , and that explained all i needed it to . It showed the charger as connected , BUT not charging . I scrounged up my old charger , hooked it up , and sure enough , connected AND charging . It is without a doubt the macally charger . So i recommend it if you only plan on using it for 3 months or less . So not only am I out a charger , i ordered a battery for no reason .
 Adapter worked flawlessly for six months , then became intermittent . Seems to be broken or shorted somewhere near the connector to the computer . Even the ridiculously flimsy cord from Apple lasted longer than six months , so I ca n't say I 'm pleased . Macally says they 'll sell the connector cable separately for $ 17.00 which is not much of a bargain .
 I have a powerbook g4 . after my apple chargers broke twice within 2 years -LRB- once the tip broke off inside my computer and would have cost $ 1200 to repair-but only cost $ 200 due to applecare ; the other time the charger randomly started shooting bright orange sparks inside the point that connects to the laptop -RRB- , i decided to try this one . in january , i bought one of the original chargers as described in this listing from microcenter , with the blue LED light . during the first half hour , i got the endless charging/not charging/charging cycle , but eventually that subsided and it worked fine for about 2 weeks . I ended up buying a different charger from ebay and returned the macally charger , because i was n't confident in the durability of this product.now its may , and the charger i bought off ebay completely stopped working , so i returned to microcenter . they have the NEW macally chargers that do n't have the blue light . I bought one to hold me over until i can find a better alternative , and after 24 hours being plugged into my computer , it NEVER stopped the charging/not charging/charging cycle . it powers my computer just enough to keep it from completely running out of juice . about an hour ago , i went to microcenter AGAIN to exchange it for an identical one , and this seems to be doing the same thing . that 's 3 products , from at least 2 seperate batches , that all have the same defect . i have one more hour to get to microcenter and I 'm going to exchange this piece of crap for another apple charger . i expect the $ 80 apple charger to last me about a year.thank god the mac books have magnetic chargers . i 'm sick of this crap .
 Do n't buy !!! This charger does not work . It broke twice before Amazon told me they would not send me another . The customer service was excellent from Amazon .
 I was hoping for a cheaper replacement , but what I got was a charger that was not much more reliable than my previous Apple charger.The problem with this connector is that it does n't always seem to make a good connection with the computer . When this happens , it sends the computer into a powered-charging-battery loop . I have to fiddle with the connector to get it in just the right spot to keep a good connection . While this is only an annoyance to me , I wonder what it 's doing to the internals of my computer .
 I bought this product to replace the original battery charger that came with my 12 '' Powerbook G4 . Unfortunately , it seems that it only will add charge when I have the computer closed or off . If I have the computer open while the charger is plugged in , it not only does n't add charge , it also makes the screen brightness oscillate.I would n't recommend this product for anyone who needs to charge their Powerbook while using their Powerbook . Wish I would 've just spent the extra money on the Apple charger .
 When I purchased this , it said that it was compatible with the ibook G4 . IT ISNT .
 Short and simple
 I bought this charger near the end of May of this year and it stopped working about 2 weeks ago . It is not the same charger as in the picture with the gray cord . It looks just like most of the other generic chargers available on Amazon . It charges quite slowly -LRB- ibook g4 14 '' -RRB- . I have a brand new APPLE brand battery , so I do n't think it has anything to do with that or the computer . From now on I will stick with the cheaper generic chargers until my computer is totally dead .
 This product is advertised to work with the iBook G4 , but it does NOT.This plug looks fine , but despite what the product description stats , it is n't compatible with the 3 - to 5-year-old version of the 12-inch iBook G4 , which I own and now must buy yet another plug for after this one did n't work.Consider yourself warned .
 Having the same problem as others mentioned here . Does not work on my iBook G4 . Alternates between battery and power adapter .
 The product link says the cable is detachable from the computer end to the brick , not true . It says it has an LED to show when it is charging , not true . It says it is for a PowerBook G4 , not true -LRB- From the start I had to twist it to get it to tell my computer not charging . it does n't have the power to charge -RRB- . I returned the first one to get what was listed but Amazon sent the same thing out . I could n't be bothered so I just stuck it in the corner.DO NOT GET IT , its too overpriced and does n't do what it says . PRODUCT INFO IS FALSE !
 After two go bad experiences with this product , all I can say is do not buy anything from Macally , at all . The first AC adapter for my G4 laptop went bad within 6 months and the second AC adapter was shot in less than five . When I say this product is junk , I 'm not exaggerating . Basically , when you started to hear a high pitch whine , that was all she wrote . Within a week or so , the unit was dead . After the second one went dead I contacted Macally 's customer service representative which was an exercise in futility . I was stonewalled at every turn . I finally just asked them to send me a new unit and they demanded proof of purchase . I then offered to send the old unit in but they wanted a receipt . All of this for a twenty dollar AC adapter . I 'm sure this guy has a lot of practice giving his customers the shaft by virtue of the other bad reviews for this product . Do yourself a huge favor and do not buy anything from Macally .
 Out of the difficult to open package , this adapter worked for a couple of days.I missed the light on the end of the standard Apple adapter -LRB- yellow for charging , green for charged -RRB- . But the price was right , until , it started cycling on and off . The Mac screen would dim and brighten dim and brighten . Boy , was I glad to notice that the on screen battery light was cycling between a/c and battery . Unplugged the Macally , computer ran fine on just battery . Runs fine on the Apple charger I had left at home.The good news is the return to Amazon was extremely easy , presuming the lack of destroyed packaging does n't void my refund.I 've ordered a different brand -LRB- with light ! -RRB- . This one may have just been a bad example . I 've had good luck with other Macally gear .
 We plugged this on only to have it spark and not power our ibook G4 . It went back the next day .
 This product would intermittently charge my computer , charging about half of the time and not charging the other half . It has 3 1/2 stars as an average from so many reviews because you get exactly what you pay for with this one - a cheap alternative.I was happy with the first one I bought . It lasted about a year and a half with heavy use . I thought I 'd try another one but odds are you 'll end up with a defective one of you buy a few of them .
 Like every other Mac user , I think the replacement power cord with the bulky , cumbersome block is overpriced and less than durable , so I decided to outsource . What I got was never quite up to speed , but since my laptop mostly stays plugged in , the quick charge was n't a must . Unfortunately , after a scant 8 months , with very little movement or unplugging -LRB- I 've packed up my laptop for travel exactly twice in that time -RRB- , the power cord has given out . There seems to be a short between the wires , with the hazardous side effect of causing random sparking at the connection between the computer plug-in and the wire . Needless to say , I 'm not going back to this product !
 This is my second PS-AC4 . The first was exactly as pictured here and on the MacAlly website . It worked great and I would highly recommend it -LRB- I purchased it about 3 yrs . ago -RRB- . However , the most recent one -LRB- ordered from Amazon -RRB- has been redesigned . There is no blue light , it 's slightly smaller in size and DOES N'T work with the G4 iBook.I only use this power supply when I am on the road , so I only used it a couple times in the two weeks I 've had it . Recently I was doing a Keynote presentation and noticed the iBook switching from battery to power supply every second and repeating , endlessly . I reset the Power Management Unit -LRB- PMU -RRB- on the iBook , but that did n't solve the problem . When I contacted MacAlly , they informed me that this model does not work with the G4 iBook . I was told `` You need to return it back to your vendor for refund or different brand . `` Both MacAlly and Amazon do not reflect this new information on their website . MacAlly 's site even says it 's recommended for iBook users.I am still in the process of getting this issue resolved . My advice after messing around with 3rd party power supplies ... buy a genuine Apple as a replacement . It 's worth the money in the long run .
 I bought this boombox for a kitchen that I knew needed to be loud . While the Hummer MusiXstation looks amazing and has pretty good functionality , the sound quality and volume is very low . To be honest , I wish it sounded like it looked . The radio is not very good at picking up FM stations , either . It does have a Audio in jack , which was very helpful and not available on a lot of other models.I was not impressed overall , and we switched back to our 1998 boombox in the kitchen.Pros
 I was amazed to find out that this cable was so cheap and would work with my 1080p tv . Much to my surprise , the cable did n't respond too well to my tv and left me with black screens every so often . When I did my reasearch , I realized that not all HDMI cables are the same ! If the cable is anywhere from $ 1 to $ 40 , chances are it wo n't work well and is n't HDMI-Certified . Does n't seem strange to only have to spend $ 1 on a High Definition cable when your tv and sound system probably cost around 3 grand?THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HDMI CABLES ! NEVER BUY A CABLE UNLESS IT HAS BANDWITH , SPEED , COLOR , SOUND , AND FREQUENCY RATINGS ON IT ! Also remember , the longer the cable the less data makes it out of the other side!Watch videos on Monstercable.com to learn more about which cable is best for you and you tv .
 We purchased this tripod for one of the larger Sony cameras that we also purchased through Amazon . The camera is awesome . The page for the camera recommended this tripod so we bought it from Antonline . This tripod is not nearly strong enough for use smoothly with our camera and when I contacted Antonline for a refund they refused to deal with me , even if I paid the shipping back to them . If you buy this tripod , beware that truly strong remote control tripods can start at $ 300 and go up from there .
 My friend bought this monitor for me -LRB- from Fry 's Electronics -RRB- as a Christmas present . It worked fine until the screen started going black for no reason . I would just switch it off and then back on to fix that problem . But later I heard a `` poof '' and it went black , and then there was a burnt smell coming from the monitor . It is now dead -LRB- after less than 6 months of use -RRB- . I will see what Soyo can do for me , but it looks like I am out of luck without the receipt . I know I 'll have to pay for shipping , and I do n't mind paying for some repair/exchange , but I hope they can work something out for me since their product was defective . ** Update 10/26/07 ** After several calls/e-mails , it looks like SOYO is going to help me out in my predicament . I ended up talking it over with someone on the phone and he was very helpful . While I ca n't change the rating on this item , it does seem that SOYO customer service works if you stick with it . I will further update if there are any other developments . ** Update ** I received the new/fixed monitor after about a month . Costs to me were shipping the monitor , $ 5 standard charge by SOYO , and $ 35 missing receipt charge -LRB- so since it was a gift it was cheaper for me to do this process than to buy a brand new monitor -RRB- . It works well , again , and I hope it continues to do so .
 I bought the Soyo 24 inch monitor based on a $ 100 reduction in price at Office Max and what appeared to be a review on the internet . Previously I had a Viewsonic 17 '' LCD monitor which was pretty bad too . The Soyo has a bad stand that is supposed to be adjustable , but I could not do it and had to prop it at an angle with a book . The User 's manual is nearly incomprehensible . The speakers have to be the worst sounding ones I 've ever heard . I am going to repack and try to return it and buy something better ever if I have to pay more .
 After reading the great reviews regarding the VCT870RM tripod -LRB- here and elsewhere -RRB- , I decided to purchase one for my Sony HDR-HC1 camcorder.When I first opened the box , the VCT870RM seemed sturdy and well made . The tilting action was smooth and had a nice touch , and the remote controls on the handle worked well . However , the panning action was so stiff that while attempting to pan , the main column would twist and the handle would bend slightly . It felt like the tension control knob was tightened , but that was not the case . In fact , the panning continued to drag severely even with the tension knob completely removed.I recently found a VCT870RM review from about 5 years ago where somebody else was having the same problem with stiff panning . However , due to all of the other great reviews for this tripod , I 'm assuming that I just received a bad one.I 'm now in the process of working with Amazon to get a replacement sent to me . So far , Amazon has been great , as they 've already scheduled UPS to come to my home and pick up the defective tripod the very next day . They say that I 'll receive my new tripod next week . I 'll post here on the status of the new one when it arrives.UPDATE
 This tripod is out of production , although I bougth it because the price and the need of lanc connection for my camcorder Sony DSR PD170 , was the only model with a reasonable price . The desadvantage is that it can not hold stablity for the camcorder , too light , not enough hight , and the locks for the vertical and horizontal moves are not good enough , you loose in trying to loose or tight the buterfly nuts . The only advantage is the remote controller and the price . I hope Sony can improve it like the next level but with more confortable price .
 I think this is my first review in the years I 've been on Amazon , but for once I feel that I need to speak out on a bad product.I bought both the DGK and theWhiBal White Balance Reference Card - Pocket Kit -LRB- 2 `` x3 .5 '' -RRB- and I have to say that the WhiBal just feels better and feels that it will last a lot longer -LRB- the DGK cards are only about the third of the thickness of a WhiBal -RRB- . However the Digital Grey Kard has one thing going for it , it has a superior laynard.I would recommend spending a few bucks more and get theWhiBal White Balance Reference Card - Pocket Kit -LRB- 2 `` x3 .5 '' -RRB- instead .
 Works as described . I am just so annoyed that Sony would lure me into buying their video camera for a competitive price without including this cable , making the overall cost of the camera no longer competitive . It 's smart for Sony to conduct business this way , but only in order to earn profit in the short term . You can bet I wo n't be suckered in to buying any more Sony products in the future , now knowing that this is how they run their business .
 I was shocked at how expensive this is so I searched other sites for one . I found a 4-pin to 6-pin firewire at CompUSA 's website for $ 3.99 TOTAL -LRB- free shipping ! -RRB- This Sony cable works great , but I ca n't tell the difference between it and my cheap one ... thus the one star .
 Cable is sold as having the ability to transfer video from a camcorder to a PC.It does n't do it . I spoke to the company and they told me that there is no cable that does that . I asked them why thet advertised this cable as being able to do it and he told me I should have known better . They then charged me 15 % to take the cable back . You would be smart to shop elsewhere . They do n't know what their products do and they charge you for their lack of knowledge .
 It worked for about a month . Even when it did work it was a hit or miss thing . I had to fool with it for a while . Maybe it was because I bought the cheapest one available . Maybe it was a knock-off , who knows ? I have yet to try it on another computer to rule out it not being the cord . Fair warning .
 If you have a new computer or maybe newer that 2003 this cable will work if you are working with one older than that like me it does n't work . So now I have this wonderful cable and waiting to get an upgraded computer to match .
 I spent a couple hours , trying to get transfer DV from my camcorder to my mac powerbook . After hours and hours I had to realize that the USB cable delivered with the sony camcorder was absolutely worthless . If you do n't own a sony VAIO -LRB- which in my opinion just a overdesigned peace of fancy 007 gear with an i.Link connection , which no other PC/MAC has -RRB- your getting frustrated pretty quick . I would have given the cable a 5 star rating , but the way I had to get the cable , by having to buy it seperately , is a big rip off . However I found the exact same cable in an apple store called `` Thin Fire Wire '' . The exact same cable -LRB- 1.8 Meter 4 to 6 pin to be exact -RRB- for only $ 29 and it works just fine . So check out an apple store near you and save some money.Shame on you Sony .
 Like many of the other reviewers , my ZR40 is now giving me the infamous `` Remove cassette '' message and is mangling tapes . I have used it to record maybe 7 hours worth of video over the last two years . Search the web for `` canon zr users group '' and `` eating tapes '' to hear similar horror stories . Stay away from Canon camcorders .
 Things I like ... - price - sizeThing I did n't like and made me return - performance under regular indoor house lighting very grainy and considerably worse than my 8mm analog . Doing further research it appears this is likely not unique to Canon but common to DV camcorders . I am going to stick with my 8mm for a couple of years until DV tech improves since much of my use is indoors filming kids , etc. .

 world ... do noti repeatdo not get this camcorderthere is nothing worse than thisi wasted -LSB- money -RSB- buying it from amazon.comi could have gotten the same thing -LSB- for less -RSB- including firewire , 4 dv 's , and a carrying caseIt is honestly the worst , disgusting , and despicable electronic out thereif you get this you will have literallyliterally threw -LSB- your money -RSB- into the atlantic oceanDO NOT GET THIS EVEN IF SOMEONE PAYS FOR IT . RETURN IT . GET YOUR MONEY BACK !!!!!!!
 Unfortunately I had a very bad consumer experience buying this camera . I had borrowed a ZR20 from a friend the year before and liked it , so when the ZR40 came out I wanted to buy it . I read online that some people were complaining about motor noise with this camera , but I figured I try it anyways . I bought it at Best Buy -LRB- should be called Worst Buy -RRB- , and when trying it out found that it does have super bad motor noise . You ca n't hear it while recording - it 's when you are watching a tape you recorded playback on your TV etc that you hear it . The motor noise is recorded in with your audio , so you hear a loud hummmm in the background . It was too loud for me to live with . If I was recording something with no background noise -LRB- like my baby playing -RRB- , then it was as loud as his voice ! ... I have now ordered the Panasonic PVDC152 which is supposed to have good sound . We 'll see ...
 I bought this model 18 months ago . Now it has big problem . I ca n't rewind the tape well . `` remove the tape '' mesasge always pop up . I sent it back to Canon for repair . They asked me $ 169 for repair . What can I say now ? Too bad camcorder .
 Well where do I begin ? After a month of use , the battery stopped working . Contacted Canon via email . They replied battery is not under warranty . Would you like to buy another one ? Please .6 months later . I started transferring video to my computer only to find out this stupid camera eats tapes . I have lost two tapes so far . One of them was my son 's birth !!!! The eating tapes issue is a major problem with this unit . They have known about it and continue to ignore it . Do a search on `` zr40 tape problems '' to see what I am talking about . There are even more results on sister product , zr10 . I will never buy a product from Canon again . They are idiots for doing this to their customers .
 The camcorder was little dirty , and had a missing lens cover ... Joanne did not have the missing cover and did not know why it was dirty ... The power cord was defective ... ordered a new one ... Looked like it was chewed into ... The case -LRB- cassette -RRB- compartment was slightly bent and unable to open at first ... made some adjustments to it ... Fred
 As many others have reported , this Zr40 began eating tapes with only a few hours of use on it . I have lost many precious moments recorded on tape because of the tape loading problem.The only good thing I can say about this camera is the bag was large enough to hold my Nikon P100 . The Canon is going in the trash .
 I own one of these cameras and it has very low hours on it . The transport mechanism has failed and will not properly load and play tapes . Not only that , the tapes now appear to be damaged for playback on another machine . I have owned many Canon products and have been satisfied with them , but this unit at $ 600 should be avoided .
 Things I like ... - price - sizeThing I did n't like and made me return - performance under regular indoor house lighting very grainy and considerably worse than my 8mm analog . Doing further research it appears this is likely not unique to Canon but common to DV camcorders . I am going to stick with my 8mm for a couple of years until DV tech improves since much of my use is indoors filming kids , etc. .
 After about a year of use , ZR 40 started eating tapes . Do a google search on the topic , there are hundreds of people with the same problem . ` Remove Cassette ' and ` Eject ' -LRB- use those as keywords combined with ` Canon ZR ' to view message boards postings -RRB- will appear on the screen , and that 's the end of the toy .
 I just received my ZR 40 and really liked its size and low weight . But once I tried it , the fun was quickly over . Low light recording -LRB- in my apartment with lights on -RRB- was horrible and even with low-light mode selected , it was unacceptable . And in night mode , everything moves in slow motion . Overall , the quality was not that great , even in day-time shooting.I have a regular Sony Hi8 cam , and its low light and night capabilities are 100 times better . I would seriously hold out for a better camera , even if it costs a bit more.The image stabilization also makes the picture look strangely un-lifelike .
 Like many who have found this camcorder , I liked the canon name and bought based on Canon and value . It was a mistake because I do n't feel I should have already used up the life of this camera yet . If you go to several discussion groups you will see it has several issues with the deck , i.e. `` transport '' . Just google zr20/40 etc. and `` eat tapes '' . Suggest you try Sony or Panasonic .
 IT IS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WASIT DOSE FIT THE CAMRA BUT I THOUGHT THAT IT HAD A USB END ALSO , SO THAT I COULD HOOK TO MY COMPUTER
 Buying a Sony cable was n't worth it . I could have spent less buying any 4pin to 4pin 1394 firewire cable . Search around . Buying name brand may not be worth it .
 I purchased this for my sony camcorder . I have windows XP on my laptop and this cable does not work . My laptop does not even detect my camcorder when attached ... Its a waste according to me
 I ordered the Sony 4Pin to 4Pin Digital Video cable for my Sony digital camcorder and it came with a bent pin in one of the connectors . I specifically ordered the Sony rather than a generic one because I thought it would be more likely to be of higher quality . It was advertised as new . When I plugged it into my camcorder it did not work . On examining it I found that it had a bent pin . When I looked at the camcorder connection I found that the bent pen had ruined the connection in the camcorder . What a bummer . I contacted the seller and they were willing to send me a replacement for the cable but took no responsibility for the defective one ruining the camcorder connection . I did not bother to get another one for obvious reasons .
 I have 2 outdoor Lukwerks cameras and 2 indoor cameras . I 've had them since September 2007 . They were easy to set up and the new software -LRB- version 2.5 -RRB- seems stable with fewer cut-outs . However , I 've had hardware failures . Within six months of purchase , both power supplies to my indoor cameras failed . Replaced.In June , 2008 , one of my outdoor cameras died . I contacted customer serviced and gave the information . Three days later , I got an email from Lukwerks tech . support with an RMA number . I packaged the dead camera and sent it in . About 10 days later , I received a replacement . In all , I was without the camera for about two weeks , but I DID get it replaced.In July , 2008 my second outdoor camera failed . I have not yet had it replaced . I purchased it in June , 2007 , so it 'll be interesting to see if they will replace it since the warranty is only 1 year . I will update when I have further results.All of these hardware failures are troubling . I speculate that it is caused by electrical noise or surges that are frying the fragile components in the cameras . During the summer these are fluctuations in electrical power caused by all of the air conditions and the switching going on by the power company . Since you can not put line conditioners or surge protection on the cameras , they are fully open to this noise . It 's either that or just the heat of the summer . Either way , the components in the cameras seem very weak and fragile . To have a 100 % of my outdoor cameras fail within 14 months is disturbing.When the cameras work , they do an adequate job . Other than the hardware failures , I am pleased with the picture quality and the functioning of the cameras.I would be hesitant , however , to invest in this system again since it appears that the component quality is severely lacking . At least , that has been my experience .
 I have four of the outdoor units that are as good as a paperweight . At over $ 200 a piece , I 've wasted over $ 800 on these . Do n't waste your money . I 've never wrote a review on any product before , and I 've bought a lot of things off of Amazon , but these are the worse items that I 've ever bought . Avoid at all cost .
 The Logitech Wilife outdoor cameras have a known defect -LRB- caps melting -RRB- . -LSB- ... -RSB- They fail in about a year . This is due to the following four 1000uF caps
 The drive lasted 3 days before the flash fell off and was lost from the encasement . The encasement was examined and appeared to be flimsy plastic . I do n't recommend this product based on a lost unit .
 I was installing these chips in a G4 Sawtooth macintosh computer and the chips did not work . I had kernel panics that eventually left the operating system unusable . The hard drive had to be reformatted and the OS re-installed . A great headache and PITA . I need to return these memory modules , how would I do that.best regards , vilppu
 At first this printer worked well , but after a year it is nothing but trouble.To begin with , you ca n't print more than 4-5 pages before the `` page grabber '' will start to grab more than one sheet of paper at a time , and the text ends up going across both of them.Then there is the printer driver , which is also not up to par -- where is the manual two sided printing that has been in the classic Mac OS for all of these years?In short , this was my last HP printer . The jamming paper feed is too much for me to handle .
 This thing works sometimes , and its cheep . Other then that I do n't have much good too say about it . It uses up the ink in the expensive cartridges like water . And is so noisy it sounds like a truck going off road . I 've owned quite a few cheep HP ink jet printers , and I 've been disappointed by them all . I am going with Epson or paying a little more for a higher model HP . In the print world , you get what you pay for and buying cheep is a bad idea .
 I 've had the P1000 for a couple of years . Worked great with WindowsME . After installing XP on my desktop I had to reinstall the printer software to get it to work . Just got a new laptop and it does n't work at all . . in fact , the P1000 causes my Dell Inspiron to crash whenever I disconnect the USB cable . When the cable is connected the laptop never recognizes the printer .
 I really liked this printer when I first got it about 3 years ago . Sure it was loud and a little slow , but it printed pretty good . Well , after about 1 1/2 years of VERY light duty , I all of a sudden start getting error messages on my PC telling me the printer is not connected to the computer . First I changed the cord to no avail , then I tried different open USB ports on my computer , so it ends up I just have to position the USB cable perfectly to the back of the P1000 to get it to work . At least it would still work , right ? Well that got me by for about six months and now it just will not connect at all . Now my HP P1000 has a nice new home in the trashcan and I 'm giving Canon a try . If HP puts as much thought into printers as they do computers I definetely do n't want to buy another HP product again ...
 No Mac support . Boooo Hissss!No Win95 support ? GOOD ! Why are you still running that outdated OS anyway ? At least upgrade to Win98 .
 When I run the software installation , it loads it 's two executable files into my startup directory . This should n't happen.When I try to launch the emarker software , it says `` Can not initialize encryption , Application shutting down '' . I e-mailed their tech support for some ideas and the responder said they did n't think the software would work with Win98SE . ?????
 I got one of the earliest examples of these new devices . They are simple to install and fairly simple to use . In essence , you put it on your keychain , and anytime you hear a song you like -LRB- and perhaps want to buy -RRB- , you hit the button . Then , you attach it to your computer via the cradle , log on to Sony 's eMarker website , and by selecting your city and station -LRB- you must remember what station you were listening to when you hit the button -RRB- , it checks the time stored in the unit against the playlist supplied to the Sony website from each radio station . You can get some info on the song/artist , hear some clips , and if you 're so-inclined , you can buy the complete song from Sony via download . This is a ` free service ' , unless you decide to buy the music . In that sense , the eMarker is a clever tool for Sony to sell direct-to-consumer , avoiding the other means of internet distribution now available , as well as circumventing the retailer .
 i brought this gift with high hopes . Sadly , those hopes came crashing down pitifully . I admit that sony had a great idea . In fact , it would have been perfect for me because I 'm always wondering who sang THAT song on the radio.It 's cute and small , but not for a keychain . In addition , the USB capability is really handy -LRB- at least for newer computers -RRB- . The product is a lot like its website -- cute , stylish , but not practical . I disliked having the radio station settings so limited and the song information arriving so slowly.I would recommend holding off for a better product .
 Save your money . It 's pure hype . If you listen to more than one station , you have to wade through several audio clips to figure out which one you liked . If you listen to anything but pop , it 's useless . It 's just a gadget to get you to buy CD 's through their web site .
 The Sony eMarker is an awesome idea , but understand that it is nothing more than a stopwatch that depends on data from a website powered by Sony and Broadcast Data . This information seems to need some help , as the `` 24 Hour '' wait for playlist updates is sometimes taking 5 days . The product is cool , but Sony needs to keep their end of the deal and update the website ... I 'd wait for a few months before buying another one so that Sony can iron out the bugs .
 I 've had many problems with Sony computer items before , but I thought I 'd give this one a try . After being on the phone with Sony -LRB- who did n't even know what the emarker was -RRB- for over four hours , I still ca n't the thing to work . There 's some problem with the program you download from emarker.com . The program has problems loading the emarker USB drive into your computer . Thus , you ca n't use it at all . If I were you , I 'd wait till they develop this product further and work out all the problems . Sony told me they would pass my problem on to the Research and Development team , who would try to get back to me as soon as they can -LRB- I hope this team knows what the product is ! -RRB- As for me , I plan on returning my emarker today .
 Great idea or so I thought . I fell for the marketing hype . This little gadget is nothing more than a time stamp . You plug it in and it reads the time stamp and shows you what was playing on the radio station that you pre-selected when you registered on the web . If you were listening to a different station , you have to look it up on their site , which defeats the purpose of this thing . You can already look up songs on the net without this gadget . In fact , you can do it better without the gadget , because , emarker 's coverage is limited -LRB- No AM , jazz , classical , or music videos -RRB- . Save your money !
 Before you buy this thing , understand one thing . When you mark a song , you have to remember the station you were listening to at that time . So if you have 10 emarks , you have to remember the station you were listening to at the time of each of the emarks . I wondered about this detail before I bought the thing and found no mention of it anywhere on their website . I assumed it would mark the station somehow . My mistake . Learn from it .
 Once you get past the hype , you will realize this device is a . . clock . When you press the button on the e-marker , it only records the time , not the radio station . When you download the information to your computer and connect to the website it looks for the song that was played on the station how many hours/days ago you pressed the button . If you selected the wrong station you will get a different song.If you use the scan button on your radio , this product is not for you
 I was sold this item only to learn , after opening the corresponding Web site necessary for eMarker function , that Sony was terminating the corresponding Web service in 45 days !! A great idea but no support .
 The eMarker is a wonderful and innovative idea . The size is right and the price is reasonable -LRB- a little cheaper would be nice , but its acceptable -RRB- . The big problem stems from the fact that Sony has no Mac support ... or support for a number of other platforms as well . It 's not like its hard to make the eMarker compatible with these systems . Sony is only shooting themselves in the foot . If this product were to support the Mac , it would be a 4 or 5 star product .
 Do not buy the emarker . It is being shut down by Sony on 9/30/2001 . I received the following email from emarker.com on 9/5/2001 : We will be permanently closing down the eMarker.com service on 9/30/01 . To keep your eMarks information , just print the screens from your eMarks pages.For eMarker refund information , please click here . -LRB- emarker.com -RRB- Thanks for your support.The eMarker Team
 I live in Phoenix , AZ and we have quite a few radio stations that are listed with E-marker . The main problem is that you have to wait 24 hours before the radio and song information is updated on E-marker 's web page . Also , if you listen to more than one station it becomes a problem to remember what station you were listening to at the time you heard the song and pressed the E-marker . Trust me , it is hard to remember which one of your 3 listed radio stations you were listening to , especially if it was more than 24 hours ago - I thought the whole point behind this product was to let you not remember !
 The set up is real easy , the site is too flashy -LRB- no pun intended -RRB- and the play lists are never updated . I have NO idea what the other people who give this good reviews are thinking . I live in NYC , media capital of the world , and if it does n't work here with hip-hop and Latin stations , it wo n't work anywhere . If you r into Latin music the site tells you the stations are supported but when you mark a song it gives you the popular songs not necessarily the songs playing . It is very unreliable , I have yet to see it work more than 3 times , and I have owned it for well over a month . If you want to get it , DO N'T . At least wait until they start working on getting the play list on point .
 Do not believe any of the so-called good reviews ! This product is nonsense and simply DOES NOT WORK . I was able to install it rather easily . However , the flashy sophisticated website is NEVER updated ! The play list are NEVER available ! I am very dissappointed in Sony . Great concept , good looking product as usual fom Sony . Typical lack of performance . My experience is 180 degrees from the good reviews and I do n't believe they are real or honest .
 This was bought for me as a gift , but it is completely unneccesary . It 's simply a case of a company using widely available technology to make some money off of peoples ' ignorance ... If I hear a song that I wonder '' ... hmm , what was that ? '' I simply log on to the StarCD website and choose the radio station I was listening to and the time . It uses the same data that this device does . The only thing this device does is record times . If you think its worth spending the money for a keychain timestamp-thingermajig , go ahead . Ill just jot it on my hand with a pen . -LRB- I have no commercial or otherwise affiliation with StarCD , I 'm just an impressed user . -RRB-
 When I first heard about this I was elated , no more guessing what the song I was listen to is called . Then I connected to the website . At the time I had a 28K modem . Trying to access Sony 's flash-enabled site was undesirable , if not impossible . I had to wait half an hour just to figure out what a three minute song was called . Also , the fact I still had to write down the station I was listening to . Doesn ' that defeat the purpose of this toy ?
 I thought this product would be great , and help out my kids a lot !! My daughter hates it and it is so confusing . We ca n't find a lot of just regular songs . It is easier just to call the radio station and find out yourself .
 Nice idea , poor execution . It simply does not work well , and is therefore much more trouble than it 's worth .
 This was the biggest waste of money ever created . If you want to know the song that much , call the station and ask them , they do n't mind , really .
 I 'm sure you can see by now with everyone else 's reviews that this product is garbage . Well , hey , if you pay close to nothing , do n't expect anything much in return ! Just save yourself the money and DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT ... instead , put some gas in your car or something !
 I too bought into the hype that the emarker presented , but after using it for a week I realized how pathetic this product is . Its nothing more than a clock that marks the time of day you here the song and NOTHING ELSE ! You have to look up everything manually including the radio station and the appropriate time . Not only that but you have to memorize which mark stands for which station , it doesnt even do that !! How stupid , does sony believe they can just sell products by putting their name on it . Tsk Tsk . The product is also really dependent on the internet , so if you dont have a good connection like me you can forget the practicality of the emarker . Actually , even if you do have a cable or dsl line , its still useless .
 I 'm a gadget nut and this sounded like a great idea . Unfortunately , the execution of the idea was less than what I would have expected from Sony . Here 's why the eMarker only gets one star :1 . Windows 98 only . No Windows 2000/ME/95 / Mac support . What were you thinking Sony ? Why is it so difficult ? USB support is there ? 2 . Only a handful of `` big '' cities are available real-time . Even though I 'm in the 7th biggest city in the country , I guess we do n't count . The rest of the `` 100 + cities '' require that you wait for 24 hours before you can get the song info .3 . You can only store 10 songs at once . Considering the fact that I have to go home to use the thing -LRB- no Windows 98 at the office -RRB- and I have to wait 24 hours to get the 10 songs this is a horrible limitation . This device is doing nothing more than storing date and time stamps . Why limit it to 10 ? That 's ridiculous .4 . The website where you get the info is `` pretty '' but from a usability perspective it sure leaves a lot to be desired.Bottom line ... . Wait until they get it right .
 Do n't let the sleek look of the emarker fool you , it 's got bugs a-plenty and some serious design flaws . Here 's what the other reviews -LRB- written by Sony employees ? -RRB- and the literature do n't say : * E-marker does n't seem to work with AOL ; you have to not only use another browser , but also set that browser as the default . * When you plug the emarker into your computer , it `` automatically '' loads your marks into the site ... or at least that 's what it 's supposed to do . On 3 browsers and 2 different computers , I have n't quite gotten this to happen . * Sony seems to be more concerned about being cool than functional - to top off all the emarkers ' inadequacies , they -LRB- over -RRB- designed a Flash interface to get your songs that does n't quite work either . Simple HTML would have been fine , guys ... Spare yourself the agony and wait for version 2.0 ... this is the first time I 've been irate enough about something to write a review and I assure you everything above is true ...
 Where is the space for a zero star ! Just purchased a emarker and ill tell you one thing , I should have read these reviews first . All the bad you hear about this little thing is true . I am not priveliged enough to live in an area Sony feels compelled to offer service in , so I dont even have one station to mark . The site is terrible and I cant even get the program to `` enable '' itself . Whats the difference though , cant do anything with it anyway . This is typical Sony . My advice , check out all the ratings here and go to the website and see if they even offer any stations in your area . Believe me , they wont tell you it will not work in your area . It , however , is a neat idea . Needs lots of work .
 I bought the Sony E-Marker because I thought it was a great idea . I am the type of person who does not remember who sings what and the title of songs . I was estatic when I received it in the mail and could not wait to start using it . To my disappointment when I went to download the driver I found out that it is only compatiable to Windows 98 . I am currently running Windows ME . I tried to contact emarker for support with no luck or response . I have no idea when an update will come out so basically I have a product that I would love to use just sitting on my desk taking up space .
 no place in the ad does it say the use of this depends on the radio stations in your area must belong to their service for this to work none in my area of south west florida seem to least of all my favorite stations and it seems that the music you listen too must be of the lastest out or there is no info on it or where you can buy it so yes i feel like i got ripped off ... thank you sony
 eMarker service will be end by the end of September.Refund service has already started.I just got the device last month and am ready to refund now .
 Know this the web site for this gaget may tell you that the radio listings information is updated every 10 minutes . That was not the case with the radio stations I tried the emarker on . The only song information I could get was `` information unavaiable check back in 24 hours '' . They dont even promise to have the information in 24 hours . This is not the fault of emarker my understanding is most radio stations only update their play lists every 24 hours . So the problem is the misleading information provided by the emarker site . Caution if you buy this product dont expect timely information from emarker .
 This product is no longer supported by Sony , therefore it will not work .
 If you are lucky these days the DJ will tell you a little about the song you just heard on the radio . If you are REAL lucky you will remember what he said by the time you pull into the driveway . If you are even luckier , you will remember it the next time you are at the record store.What a great idea for those of us whose just arent that lucky.When I first got this thing I thought it was great AND I thought if anyone could pull it off it would be Sony . Well ... . as with many other companies in this economy - rather than be creative and try a different approach , they quit . I just recently received an email from eMarker -LRB- Sony -RRB- claiming that they will be '' ... permanently closing down the eMarker.com service '' even though they claim that it generated a '' ... good deal of excitement '' . It used to be that companies tried a little harder at making something a success - willing to operate it at a loss for awhile until enough momentum builds to fuel success . I think Sony gave it a whopping 9 months or so to catch on ... wow . My guess is that not many people purchased CDs from their eMarker website . But they never did try anything else to make it profitable - they just decided that the current business model for this thing did n't work so they quit.Until a month ago their site was HEAVY with Flash media . I have a cable modem and it was somewhat slow for me - I cant imagine what this would have been for 56k users ! But they changed this - made it simpler/faster . And then they gave that a mere month . Nice execution guys ... thanks for the disapointment!I really hope someone else picks up this idea , I am sure that with a little creativity it could be profitable.Anyway - dont buy it . You will only be getting back in line for the rebate .
 eMarker has been discontinued by Sony , here 's the noticeThis is to inform you that we will be permanently closing down the eMarker.com service on 9/30/01 . You will not be able to access your eMarker.com account after 9/30/01 . If you have eMarks that you would like to save , simply print the screens from your eMarks pages . You will only be able to save hard copies of your eMarks information .
 E-marker started to lose it 's appeal when I had a problem with the driver . Sony provided little assistance with the situation and I basically had to solve it through trial and error . The website was easy to manuever through , but receiving the proper listings was n't constant . I will give Sony credit for coming up with the idea , and respect it 's potential . However , for now it serves as a interesting eye candy piece for my key chain .
 Sony just stole the idea from Xenote , iTag was far better and it was Free . iTag was working and has far more station , it was so simple to use that you just needed a single plug to work . They steal idea and they are not even abble to steal it correctly . It 's just a shame for a such big companie as Sony .
 I often listen to the radio and do n't know what songs are called so I could download em . I saw an advertisement for this product , and decided to try it out . Everything went well until the first time I uploaded the emarks . For some reason 3 or 4 of each song was comming up . I deleted them , but was unable to delete the emarks on my emarker . I was very dissapointed in this product , espically the software and I strongly dissuade you from buying it .
 I can tell you that I used to have a small smart device called the iTag from Xenote and that worked VERY well . Plus ... it was FREE !! I used to use it in the Bay Area and the selection of the radios was great , the Web site very easy to navigate on . I could even get my info in real time which was great . Unfortunately , this start-up , as many others , had to close doors for the lack of $ ... . Too bad that those guys at Sony have too much money but do not care enough about their customers to launch a decent product ... After the PlayStation 2 fiasco launch , they keep going on ... : - -LRB-
 Use of the eMarker depends on the eMarker website . However , Sony has just announced that they are discontinuing the website , and so eMarker devices will now be useless . Do n't buy one unless you want a museum piece.For those of us that already own an eMarker , Sony has graciously offered to provide a cash refund for every eMarker returned directly to them .
 This product works exactly as advertised . Click the button and find out what the song is . The website is n't set up very well , and it 's slow because of all the annoying flash stuff , but with broadband it 's definitely usable.Unfortunately , it 's only usable for the rest of September . Emarker.com is shutting down , and that makes the eMarker useless . Thus , the 1-star review . Current users are being offered a refund , but my guess is if you buy one now you wo n't get that.I 'd write more detail , but I have to go print hardcopies of my eMarks . : -LRB-
 Check their web site at www.emarker.com . A pity . This looked like a good idea . : - -LRB-
 Once you get past the hype , you will realize this device is a -LSB- $ -RSB- clock . When you press the button on the e-marker , it only records the time , not the radio station . When you download the information to your computer and connect to the website it looks for the song that was played on the station how many hours/days ago you pressed the button . If you selected the wrong station you will get a different song.If you use the scan button on your radio , this product is not for you
 I bought this thing to get the names of songs on the New York spanish stations . I checked it , double checked it , called customer service , and STILL I got incorrect song information . Maybe its the radio stations fault , maybe its E-marker 's fault , all I know is that it DOES NOT WORK .
 It was most disapointing to learn that EMarker only services the top 10 major markets with ` instantaneous ' song titles . The rest of USA will have to wait more than 24 hrs to get any information . The web site www.emarker.com is slow when working within your ` account ' and the email support is poor with EMarker engaging in finger pointing blaming problems rather than addressing a resolution.I purchased 5 of these for presents this holiday season with expectations that this unit was a neat solution to hearing a song and wanting to know the title later when I got home . I did some research and my zip code was covered , the demo showed a hip session of information exchange . Only after searching for a reason to why my music did n't display did I learn the exclusion to non top 10 markets.Don ' t waste money , time etc waiting for EMarker to come up to scratch . This product is only for those in the top 10 US markets . However , if you 're not one for instant gratification , and you like to wait more than 24 hrs for an answer to a web based music device then I guess you 'll be ok .
 Sony has stopped supporting the e-marker and is offering refunds to anyone who already has one .
 This unit is quite difficult to use . The button is very sensitive , which sometimes causes false entries . The website is complicated to use . I think with a little work E-marker will be a good product to have .
 Before buying this product I read all the reviews . Unfortunately , I did n't pay enough attention to the warnings that the product does n't work . I thought I could trust a company like Sony to deliver a reliable product and figured that the poor reviews were the result of consumer error . I was wrong . The complementary reviews on this site just ca n't be real . The product looks nice but works like a piece of junk .
 These eMarker guys are out of business , so not sure if this thing even works any longer .
 its unbelievable to me that you still have this available to purchase . After 9/30/01 , you can not use this , so why is it on sale still ? and why is it going off the market ? Its a great idea , I hope someone else picks up where sony leaves off .
 Pretty cheap for a Hi8 camcorder , but quality is unacceptably poor . The zoom lever is hard to operate , and when you put in a tape the mechanism makes tons of noise , really making you nervous . LCD screen is a little flaky , deciding to quit working occasionally so you have to turn the machine off , wait 10 seconds and turn it back on . It also destroyed a new TDK Hi8 tape this past winter . I think I wasted my money , and look forward to getting a Sony this summer when I get a new job .
 The on/off switch is stuck . I can not therefore record or review tapes . I pried the switch and made a temporary contact and confirmed that the camera can record and play-back I would like to be able to return it for full credit or have it repaired .
 it sounds great im just wondering y it did not already have 5 stars ! di u think it would be great 4 my 12 year old ?
 Bought this item in July and it stopped working in December . Specficially , the playback function stopped working .
 This camera semed ok at first ... but less than a month after I bought it , the eyepiece viewfinder broke and only displayed a white screen . In bright light -LRB- like outside -RRB- the entire screen is unfocused and a light object being filmed ends up looking like you filmed the sun , it does not filter the light very well . The battery lasts for about and hour and fifteen minutes when the viewfinder is open ; this is not so great when you are out and about and can not re-charge . This camcorder is the lower class model for Samsung , overall I thought it to be cheap and a waste of money . For only a few dollars more you could get a reliable Sony.The camera did have a few pros though , the mirror , negative , mosaic and art effects on the DSE button were fun , but not worth the hassle the camera gives overall . My advice
 The camcorder worked only a couple of times.Then the playback picture was totally ...
 Like Korean cars , this Korean camcorder does what it says , but it 's not something you 'll be proud to own . The controls are awkward ... even Sony 's compact minidv camcorders have better buttons . The video quality is sub par , and my unit , which I received as a factory-sealed gift , broke after about 6 months , a first for all the Asian electronics I have owned . For a little bit more money , you can buy much better camcorders from Japanese manufacturers .
 I bought this printer new , when it was HPs top of the line . I have been very disappointed in it from day one.The print quality is fine . The duplexer is a joke . It needs the bottom of the page to grip the paper , so it can not print on that area . The driver software gives you two options to deal with this - print everything at about 90 % scale to squeeze the content into the printable space , or re-sort the pages allowing the SW to move the page breaks . Neither is appealing , so I found that I reverted to manual duplex mode - taking the paper out and reversing itself myself.The biggest problem I have with the printer is frequent paper jams . Even when using HP brand multipurpose paper , I find that the printer jams about 25 % of the time . In the quest for speed , the paper load mechanism is just too fast , pulling in many sheets of paper instead of just one .

 This has to be the most horrible printer in the world . If I could give it -5 stars I would . I just got a new digital camera and of course just got this printer . Now when I print my photos it has blurred lines through it and is all messed up . Its print quality is horrible . It may be a bad printer - but HP is no help at all . They keep saying to install new drivers , when it is clearly a hardware problem . I want to throw this thing away , unfortunatly I got it on clearance and I 'm stuck with it . Do n't buy this pile of junk .
 I have a small business and it was important that the envelope feeder work well . From day 1 , this has been a nightmare . Components of the printer block the envelopes/labels and they do n't feed properly . If you use internet postage , you lose money with the misfed labels/envelopes . I 'm very disappointed and am shopping for a new printer now , only a short time after purchasing this one .
 This printer has been a nightmare . First I can not usemy Visioneer scanner . They say it is not compatable.I removed a jammed paper , and since then anything I print , such as invoices , checks and such , come out with blotchedprinting and paper tears . I get NO help from technicalsupport -LRB- They 're learning -RRB- . No 800 number , which means youhave to call CA on your buck.I used to swear by HP . Now I am convinced that theirproducts are close to junk . My opinion is STAY AWAY !
 The printer worked fine for about a year -LRB- no borderless prints though -RRB- . After 15 months it started jamming every single time that I tried to print . I expected a ... repair bill -LRB- replace the roller -RRB- since the printer is out of warranty . According to HP , no 1215 printer can be repaired . Their only option is an exchange . They will send you a new HP 1215 for -LSB- price -RSB- -LRB- retail is -LSB- price -RSB- -RRB- and you return your old one . Apart from a ... coupon this is the ONLY option . Buyer beware .
 Until this product , I was a huge promoter of HP printers , but the HP 1215 apparently was designed with little attention to Apple compatibility . Unpredictably it refused to print first in 0S9 and then in 0SX . I 'm frankly sick of downloading and reloading new drivers only to find they do n't work and/or freeze up my entire computer . Because of this printer I 've cleaned off my entire hard drive , lost valuable files and programs , and still wound up with a non-functional machine . It 's been in my closet for 6 months , and I 'm considerably happier with a new bottom-of-the-line Canon printer .
 I had had two HP printers . Both broke in the same places - where the paper shoots out from the printer ; the wings or the `` arms '' which guide the paper from the printer - both broke easily.Also I get an annoying message on my computer that the `` yellow box marked ! '' is on and therefore I have to exit out of the printer mode and reset the yellow box so that the ! is deleted . Then go back into the printer mode . This is so annoying that I am never getting an HP Printer again.If you look on the instruction book , the annoying message can never to resolved - only by resetting the message yellow ! again , and again !!!!!!!!
 On 04/03/02 I bought a new printer hp photosmart 1215 , it installed perfectly , now , suddenly it decided to stop dead!I have contacted Hp Customer Care re the problem ... timeout settings ... no help availadle ... also my PC tells me there are now no drivers for this device installed ! How can this be ???
 I purchased this printer with high expectations . But was very disappointed . Right off , I had problems with paper jamming and printer errors . I even think it jammed so much that a small piece broke off . When it prints the quality is great but I have had a lot of trouble with it when trying to print on card stock . It does n't appear to be very sturdy and makes me very nervous every time I try to print more than a few sheets at a time . Even regular bond paper has a tendency to jam if printing more than a couple sheets at a time . I 've always thought HP printers were the way to go , but after this one , I do n't know if I 'll buy another HP .
 We have had this printer about 3 weeks and the cartridge already needs replaced . We do not do an excessive amount of printing , so I think that is a little too soon to run out of ink.Also this printer jams up very easily -LRB- one of the reasons I was replacing the last HP printer I had -RRB- I feel I have spent as much time fixing paper jams as I have printing . It is easy to fix when it does jam up , but a little frustrating that it happens so often.The print quality is good -LRB- just make sure you have the paper settings set correctly to the type of paper you are using ! -RRB- and it does print quietly and is easy to operate . But overall I would not recommend it .
 I have owned an HP 940c now for about a year , and as it 's now 4AM in the morning and I have a long project to work on , the printer has given me a hardware failure.Having said that I 've tried it on different computers , with different cartridges -LRB- thought maybe the OS X driver was to blame but evidently not -RRB- , and it 's dead . Now it 's 4AM and I 've spent 2 hours troubleshooting the printer only to have it dead.To top it off this printer uses the HP # 15 cartridge which is a # 45 cartridge with half the ink at the same price . . you can not use a # 45 in this printer.I highly reccomend against buying this printer . Not only is it subject to the expensive ink cartridges but it has been widely known for paper feeder problems -LRB- a school district recalled theirs -RRB- , and they are all eventually prone to this sort of failure .
 Lasted six months . Never worked exactly right since I purchased it . I think it had software driver problems . Would work sporadically , then lock up and paper have to be cleared manually . Final straw , no matter what type paper it was fed , it would catch in the feed path underneath the print head for no apparent reason . Of course the paper still keeps trying to feed , so the machine just wads it into a mess . In addition to the software driver problem , I think it has a significant design problem with the paper feed as it often trys to feed up to five or six sheets at once , even the HP desk jet paper designed for such printers . I will say that when it did work , it printed well .
 My 940C lasted five years , but ate up its paper drive mechanism yesterday.The prints were very good , although color quality was sometimes off.Hard to complain when it came free with the Mac , but it is a slow printer and with amulti-color ink cartridge , somewhat more expensive than a printer using more individual cartridges.Always had minor paper feeding glitches .
 I spent over 2 1/2 hrs . -LRB- after 1 hr . myself -RRB- on the phone with HP trying to install this printer . It never would work right . The HP tech said there is a problem in the software program of this printer . This HP DESKJET 940C is everyone 's worst installation nightmare !
 This is our 2nd HP printer . Only to say , we regret buying it . The 1st HP printer , was purchased over 3 yrs ago . It 's an 1100c series color printer that is on a `` higher '' end of the printer line.Buying a G3 PowerBook had us looking for a USB compatible printer . At first , we purchased the LexMark Z55 , which worked GREAT for almost year , before a faulty part went out . * -LRB- we do a LOT of printing -RRB- . So , thinking about how a former HP product was great , we got this one at the store when we were in a rush . We did n't even look at the demo . BIG MISTAKE ! 1 . SPEED , was the first disappointment - way too slow . LexMark speed is way better , even for photo quality pics . The ole 1100c is faster than this one too .2 nd disappointment was HP changed the printer cartridges . These are NO LONGER refillable . They have metal clips on the sides , and there is no way to refill them .3 . There are n't enough printing options available . Sometimes I wanted to makes changes that I could do easily with the older 1100c series printer . I found that the options change depending what program I am on , therefore making it more confusing . -LRB- to go into detail on this subject , I 'd have to write a long long explanation -RRB- . Basically , it was a LET - down , I do n't even want to keep this thing . I 'm better off buying a different printer , with refillable inks . Ink is just too EXPENSIVE to be purchasing and not refilling .4 . When the Black ink starts running low . It Basically makes you change the cartridge . It does n't allow you to run the printer on low black ink . The machine stops functioning , and the big ink light blinks , and sends a message to your computer , saying STOP ! Color inks run low , and the computer allows you to function with low color , but different story on the black ink .
 After returning two malfunctioning HP960c printers due to frequent paper jams , we bought the HP940 hoping it would work better . It was worse . The paper jammed or was shredded every second page . It took a great deal of time to print even one document . We tried the more expensive HP paper and the paper jams continued at the same rate . We were unable to print any envelopes at all due to repeated jamming . It is clear that the paper feeding mechanism is defective in these HP printers.We 've had HP printers for years with no problems . We were loyal HP fans ; however , we 've had to return THREE of their printers in the past few weeks . That 's unacceptable . We just returned the HP 940 and bought a Canon S630 . So far , no problems with the Canon -- a relief !
 Despite the great rating and rave reviews , I curse the day I brought this one home . I have gone through at least a ream of paper in the three weeks I have had this printer -- not because I am so productive , but because the paper jams so often and the printer actually shreds the paper as it tries to eject . Several cries for help and complaints to HP customer service resulted in `` that 's a common problem . The arm does n't detract after each page . You will have to manually reset the arm whenever that happens . '' So far , that means 6-8 times per day . No more HP for me ! This is my second bad experience . You would think I would have learned by now .
 I decided to get a new printer for picture reproduction and small business projects . The printer shredded 40 % of the print jobs I sent . The roller jams the paper in back , forcing you to remove a panel and ripping the sheet from the teeth of this monster . It is like playing toy-tug with my dog . If it does not eat your print jobs , then the sheet is fed in cockeyed and it prints off kilter when a lucky sheet makes it out of this beast . I was very dissapointed after only one week of ownership
 This is a great printer for any use up to 8X10 photo production . The `` But '' in the review is the cost of ink and the fact that it uses a single cartridge . I run out of one color ink even with it set to a lighter setting in the printing menu and I am out of luck . The rest is wasted . The two sided printing is great ... particuclary with all these programs now having the ` manual ' on the CD to print ...
 My 940c stopped working completely 3 days after it was installed . Apparently , the power supply went bad . It could get no power . After spending a half an hour on the phone -LRB- my dime-long distance -- HP does not provide a toll free service number -RRB- waiting to speak with a technician , I was told the first thing they 'd have to do was to send me a new power cord ! Even though that clearly was not the problem , I had to wait 2 weeks while they shipped me a power cord -LRB- that turned out now to solve the problem -RRB- . Then , they decided to send me a new -LRB- ? -RRB- unit . It arrived today . The only thing that came in the box was the printer . No print cartridges . You see , they expected me to remove the print cartridges from the original printer and place them into the new unit . That was n't possible since they were locked into place underneath part of the printer housing and the original technician was told that this was the case . I just finished another call -LRB- on my dime , again -RRB- to HP and was told that they could ship me another set of cartridges that would arrive in 10 to 14 business days . Hooray !! It has been eight weeks since I purchased this dog of a printer and I still ca n't print ! Now it is my job to pack up the old printer and find a FedEx drop off site so that they can get their old printer back !
 I owned this printer for more than a year . It worked fine until I bought a new computer , I unplugged it , moved to a new place , and replugged it . The power supply burnt out . The printer was dead . I wasted 2 packs of unused expensive ink cartridges .
 Apparently a replacement for the terrific 932c printer , this `` upgraded '' model is a bomb . Jams , ca n't print straight , picks up multiple sheets , and horrible service all add up to a misfire . I went through the hassle of getting two replacement units shipped to me , and both replacements had more problems than the original ! I 've written off my 940c . I do n't think anyone should waste their time -LRB- and certainly not their money -RRB- on this one .
 I bought a new laptop and wanted a new printer . This wone came highly recommended from the story . It worked great for three months -LRB- of course , the length of the warranty -RRB- . It now only states `` paper jam '' and after hours of time on the phone and with the hints on the web , I am going out to buy a new printer - I would certainly not buy this one , again .
 Recently my 2 + yr old hp printer died and I purchased the hp940c.Installing the software took approximately 1 day . After spending over 1hr -LRB- my nickel -RRB- on the phone with hp -LRB- no -RRB- support -LRB- due to system error msg 's caused by the installation -RRB- , I hung up and determined the cause of the error msg 's . I also have a problem with paper jams due to what appears to be a design flaw . I suggest hp quit focusing on the compaq/hp merger and get back to designing reliable printers . If not , you might just call yourselves UNEMPLOYED !
 This is the 3rd HP printer I have owned and it has broken the fastest . My first one was around for four years of college , then it died . The second , an 820 Cse lasted about 18 months . The 940c lasted me just over a year and died . Add to this the fact that the cartridges are expensive -LRB- I 'm stuck with 6 of them -RRB- and do n't last terribly long.I 'm thinking laser to replace this one , and a Canon inkjet for color printing .
 My HP Deskjet 500 worked for more than seven years before I finally traded up for a color printer - the 940c . I 've had the 940c for just over 1 year and it has broken . I 'm buying a Canon this time and keeping my fingers crossed for better quality .
 After using this printer for one year -LRB- home use -RRB- , a plastic bracket to which a spring attaches to maintain belt tension on the print cartridge carriage broke . Rather than try to get a new part , I 'm going to throw this printer away and buy a new one .
 I have had mine for about two years . I love the color it gives but it has also given me a lot of problems . Something has gone wrong with the memory inside making it impossible to print in `` best '' quality . An error message will pop up on my screen and then it will start printing out garbled junk . I 've down loaded the latest driver -- more than once -- but with no success . It has been a waste of money to me -- especially when ink cartridges are so high for it !!
 Do not buy this printer . I have had nothing but trouble with it - it jams every other time I print , and most of the time , it grabs 3-4 papers at once , and prints on all of them . I certainly expected better quality from HP , and this did not deliver . The printing is decent when it works , which is not often . I will be looking for a different company next time .
 I hate this printer ! It is nothing but problems . Every single time I go to print even a single page , there is some sort of problem ! The paper jams , I get timeout errors , the ink runs out too fast and I am unable to fill it with the refill kits . The thing has a mind of it 's own and starts spewing out pages even when I 'm not trying to print anything . It would n't be so bad if it did n't put trash on each page wasting my paper . It 's a piece of junk ! 1 Star is highly overrating this product !
 STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRINTER , I have had a Hp 1100 and had moderate success with it , after a few months the multiple paper pickup and jam problem kept occuring with no satisfactory fix , I just got this printer and it is even worse , it does not print correctly and multiple jams even after two hours out of the box , the copy was consistantly misaligned . I am sending it back .
 I replaced an EPSON about 6 months ago that worked for about 9 months before the paperfeed went out . I thought I was `` movin ' up '' by purchasing an HP , well , this one stopped working after 6 months
 I bought this printer based on the reputation of HP -- not again . I have had it for 5 months and it just stopped working . I went to the web site to get troubleshooting info about the error codes . I have spent an easy 6 hrs working on it and nothing worked . It suggests calling phone support `` if you are still having trouble . '' I called phone support but , because I had bought the printer more than 90 days ago , they wanted -LSB- money -RSB- per phone call -- forget that . I email for support and it sent me a computer generated response redirecting me to the same web page I first started with . I am taking the -LSB- money -RSB- I would have wasted on the phone call just to get someone to read me the same damn web page and then ask me to phone back later and going to try a new brand of printer . HP no longer means quality !!!
 I 'm having the same problem as Ennus from Seattle . When I have plain paper in the printer and printer properties set for plain paper the printer works fine . The trouble starts when I load photo paper -LRB- HP 's own brand of premium photo paper glossy -RRB- . I set the printer properties for hp premium photo paper . I use HP 's photo imaging software that came with my HP digital camera . What happens is the pivot assembly arm in front of the paper feed mechanism does not retract as it does when I have the printer set up for plain paper . When the pivot assembly does not retract , the paper will jam against it as the paper feed mehanism continues to feed the paper causing ruined paper and a jamed up printer . HP 's support has been slow to respond and of no help . The only way I can print a decent photo is to load only one piece of photo paper and as it starts to print and jam against the pivot assembly , pry up the paper with a pen . You have to do this quickly as there are six separate points that the paper jams against . I know this printer is prone to having a tab be incorrectly positioned causing jams as HP has a procedure on there site for repositioning the tab . That is not the problem I am having , as the tab is correctly positioned . If it were not for this feed problem , I would give the printer 3 to 4 stars , but of course this is not a minor problem.It is extremely aggravating .
 Setup was easy enough , but this printer routinely goes haywire , spitting out a whole cartridge load of paper and refusing to print . I have tried it with several different PCs , with this same intermittent weird behavior . Only a reset of both the printerand the computer seem to fix everything.I 'm off to buy an Epson !
 This ANTONLINE site has falsely advertized this HP Deskjet 960Cse Color printer on Amazon . After paying the advertized price of $ 61.97 plus $ 22.82 shipping and handling charge , they sent and delivered you a 6 oz size bubble wrapped pack Innovera Solid ink sticks/cartridge . No invoice or phone number in the package !
 I have just spent 5 minutes trying to get this damn printer to print an envelope without mangling it . Wonderful .
 I 've had this printer for a while now , and i rarely can get it to work properly . When it is not taking 2 pieces of paper at a time , it is printing in some strange code . The quality of the picture is alright , but nothing special . I would highly recommend not to buy this printer
 I 've had HP printers for years and have always liked them . However , this printer is a real headache . We 've had 3 -- taking the time for returns was a hassle . With each of these HP printers , the paper feed mechanism has been defective . With every document I printed , the feeder malfunctioned and the paper was torn or badly misaligned . I found out on the HP website that others have had similar problems with a number of HP printers -- malfunctioning paper feeds . HP has done nothing to correct this problem . I 've now become a Canon printer owner am quite happy with Canon printers -- excellent quality and no problems . I 'll never buy another HP printer .
 I ordered this part as an upgrade for my HP e-pc c10 which requires specifically HP part P1538A . I thought this Viking part is compatible as it clearly says HP Part # P1538A by Viking on the Amazon heading . The computer could n't boot up on installation . A phone call to Viking tech support says it wo n't work on e-pc series despite it being P1538A compatible . so beware !
 It 's light , it 's convenient , it 's easy to use . But what does it matter ? In the end , the unit produces so much buzzing that it renders itself useless . It 's just too annoying , and I would not ever want to watch the footage . I 've been working with this for a year , sending it back and forth to Canon , and they tell me there is some `` allowable buzzing . '' They actually replaced mine , hoping it would appease me , but the second unit was exactly the same.I 've now missed filming the first 19 months of my daughter 's life because of this . Canon does n't seem to care much . Time to sell it on ...
 I bought this camera after looking at some other brands and this model looked JUST RIGHT for me ... The manual states that the ZR45MC requires a 4 to 6 PIN FIREWIRE to hook up to a computer -LRB- I have a brand new iBook 14 '' screen/700/G3 . . top of the line of the iBook series -RRB- Do n't you believe it ! I could n't find a 4 to 6 PIN cable anywhere , so I had to order it online via APPLE . I went to put in the cable and presto chango ... it wo n't fit ! If you look closely at the SMALL PRINT on the cover of the OWNERS MANUAL you 'll see the disclaimer . The owners manual is basically for the ZR50MC . So far I have not even been able to use my camera ... For the amount of money we have to pay for this camera , you 'd think the company could provide correct information about the product . The information on Canon 's technical site ... states the same thing as the bogus owners manual . I have 7 days left to return this camera if not satisfied . How do I know if it even works with my computer ? ... By the way , there are only two FIREWIRE options mentioned at the technical site ... 4 to 4 PIN , or 4 to 6 PIN .
 Giving my unbiased opinion
 Its a very nice camera do n't get me wrong . However due to its compact design , the speaker is too close to the tape motor . During quiet and not so quiet areas , you will hear a high pitched humm coming from your camera as well as on what you record . Canon confirmed this as a design flaw . The ZR45 , 40 and 50 all do this . I was really disappointed , I returned mine . . I wish there was a way to fix it .
 Let me preface this review by saying that I really , really wanted to like this camcorder . I did a lot of research before buying this camcorder , including reading a lot of on-line reviews . Many reviews mentioned that the motor noise was picked up by the microphone and was audible on recordings . Some reviewers said it was n't noticable . Well , against my better judgment I purchased this camcorder . Within the first 10 seconds of recording I could tell the motor noise was going to be a problem . Sure enough - it was quite annoying for me . I do n't want to discount the other reviewers who said they did n't have a problem with the motor noise , but for me it was untolerable . I 'm thinking that maybe some of the Canons might be louder than others , but the one I had was LOUD ! I went out and payed the extra money for a Sony DCR-TRV18 -LRB- there is/was a ... rebate going so it was n't too much more than the Canon -RRB- and it is MUCH quieter . It also seems a little better built , too . For me it was totally worth the extra money.Here 's the skinny on the Canon ZR45MC : Pros : * Relatively inexpensive . * Fantastic optics and optical zoom.Cons : * Motor noise - it 's audible while recording and on the recording .
 I have had this camera for 18 months and about 2 months ago , it started beeping at me to eject the tape almost every time I used it . I went on-line and found that this is common with this camera for some reason . I was able to prevent major problems by removing the tape after each use , but that no longer works . Now I can not record or watch any tape without it forcing me to remove the cassette . I was very fond of this camera until it stopped working . I am very disappointed that I will now have to buy a new camcorder -LRB- a local repairman estimated over $ 200 to fix it -RRB- . I have a friend who has the exact same camera and he has yet to have a problem , but it is n't worth the risk .
 Basically a nice unit . Loaded with all the features you could ever want
 It was a pretty good camera until it stopped working . One day I turned it on and it started beeping and flasshing an eject tape message . But you could n't eject the tape and the camera would not respond to anything . I had the camera just over two years when this happened . Luckily I purchased an extended warranty at Best Buy . Best Buy sent the camera to Canon for repair . Canon would not repair it because it would be too expensive so , Best Buy gave me a new camera . And I was allowed to get a different brand , so I went with a Sony Handycam .
 I bought the ZR45MC camcorder in Sept ' 02 . I have been using it quite regularly . then all of a sudden I can not load new or old mini DV cassettes . The moment I load a cassette , a message flashes on the screen ` REMOVE TAPE ' and beeping sound is generated together with a flashing ` EJECT ' message . Next step , I ship this to the Canon Factory service in NJ . They replied with an estimate of $ 160 -LRB- on top of the $ 654 I pad for this !! -RRB- . Also most importantly when I shipped from the Fedex office in Boston , the Fedex person made a remark that she has been seeing quite a number of the Canon camcorders going to NJ for repairs.To sum , I think this is a racket Canon has devised to rip off customers.So beware when you buy a Canon camcorder , ask the retailer about the tape loading mechanism , and if they have any maintenance plans that will repair it .
 As with others , this was a great camera until the remove cassette problem appeared 8 months ago . Now it barely plays or records . I 'm never buying another Canon and going back to Sony . BTW , the buzzing is the automatic microphone gain . If there 's not enough sound to record it cranks up the input volume so much that you hear the tape motor .
 I used this camera for a year untill during a period of a couple weeks of not being turned on , something to do with the light sensor malfunctioned . I think all Canon ZR series cameras are inclined to having buggy hardware and I dont remcomend buying one .
 I love the features and optics of this camera . I love everything about it , except that it really does n't work and their service is terrible . Many people posted about the humming sound -- I did n't have that problem . But the electrical system was intermittent from the time I got the camera . I 've sent it to them three times , and each time they repair it , or claim to . Now it is out of warranty and the battery still does n't work . So I 'll have to buy a new camera and hope that you do n't make the same mistake I did -- go with a different camera .
 Ordered a Belkin , got something unknown . Part number on unit -LRB- BI13-120100-AdU -RRB- does n't match the advertised one . What 's up with that ? $ 11 is too much for a knock off brand .
 This item should come free with a Belkin OmniView . Seems amazon and sellers are deliberately selling separate to make more money by charging shipping and handling for an item that should ship with Belkin OmniView when a customer is purchasing one .
 I ordered a BELKIN and received an AMIGO.Not what I ordered and when I complained ... I was sent ANOTHER AMIGO.Get a clue . Do n't shop Amazon !
 I loved this when I first started using it and recommended it to everyone -- but after very limited use , it was totally shot . Either the keys did n't respond at all or if you pressed one key , multiple letters appeared -LRB- `` a '' became `` as '' ; `` q '' became `` qw '' -RRB- and it was impossible to return . One friend who also purchased it had exactly the same problem within a month , so it was n't just a bad unit.If I coud give it NO stars , I would .
 This is high density module . It works only with a fewmainboards . It does not with the two I have.Amazon.com - please correct me if I am wrong .
 This Kingston memory is n't recognized by my computer which is only about a year and a half old . I went and used SimpleTech memory instead which works just fine . I would not recommend this product .
 The description does n't address the compatabilty issue with your computer . In my case , I purchased two , and had to return them both , since neither was recognized by my computer . Although the seller took them back for full credit , it 's still a hassle , and a disappointment that it did n't do what was hoped it would . The rating does n't necessarly rate the product , since it could n't be rated because it was not compatable , it 's more towards the lack of documentation regarding compatability .
 Despite being a PC133 slot , this chip did n't work with my computer ... when I put it in , the computer would n't boot , when removed , it booted fine ... Other RAM works fine ... I 've used many Kingston products and this is the first time I had any problems ...
 I have nothing good to say about Kingston memory . I tried installing this module in an E-machines T1220 1.2 GHz Celeron system that is only 3 months old and no go . Would n't work in two other systems I tried . The same spec memory from Centon and PNY both worked without any problems . Mine is going back .
 I found that this module would n't work in my computer , though industry-standard low density memory workedfine . Kingston technical support confirmed that thiswas high density memory and would not work in my PC.When I asked them to swap it for standard memory , theresponse was that I bought the wrong memory , and itwas n't their problem to exchange it to make it work.I 'll not buy Kingston products again .
 I did n't like installing this printer at all . It was recommended above the Lexmark I use at work and was looking to buy , by the sales person and I should have gone with the Lexmark . The first time it did n't install and when I tried to remedy the problem , following the directions exactly , it crashed my entire system . It took me 3 days and a lot of time with the tech to correct the problem and I am still having errors . Maybe it 's because I run Windows ME but this printer has been a complete disaster . I also do n't like the color quality . It reads color much darker than what 's on the screen and everything has a very blue tint . I will be replacing this printer as soon as I can with a Lexmark .
 My order was placed on August 28 , but I have not received the printer in a month .
 This thing is awful . Prints magenta only . Drives me crazy . I am going to go find a high building to throw it from .
 I had no expectations for print quality with a printer at this price , but expected something that worked . EVERY attempt to print either jammed the printer or ripped the paper . I attempted to print with newly opened reams ranging from low end generic copy paper to Epson photo paper with consistent results . If you do decide to buy , 1 -RRB- ensure the store will accept returns , and 2 -RRB- be prepared to pay return shipping .
 This printer works great for almost any application , but do not expect to print on special paper . On even the soft gloss paper , the ink blobs and gives poor quality printing . The color photos print better on regular paper than on photo or special finish paper . NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PHOTO PRINTING , you will be disappointed .
 After returning the first version of this product because of constant paper jams , the replacement would not recognize the printer drivers from the first or allow me to replace them . In trying to overcome this through HP 's support line , the recorded message said I would be directed to a representative and then promptly cut off the call -LRB- twice -RRB- . Returned that version also .
 It came eith a hole , so from day 1 i coul n't use it without a patch , and i had to buy another patch because this one did n't work either
 Guess I knew we were gambling when we bought this , since about half the existing reviews said it arrived with a leak . Remind me to never to go Vegas , right ? It arrived , we blew it up with the built-in pump , which worked like a charm . Seemed like it was pretty comfortable ... then my son took it on a sleepover , and woke up the next morning flat on the floor . Returned it to Amazon as a defective item for a full refund . Thinking I like another reviewer 's idea of just buying a regular twin-size mattress , since we would usually be using it at home anyway , then maybe get one of the pump-less airbeds for the occasional road trip , since those have better reliability stats than the ones with the built-in pump . Live and learn ...
 I bought this for my 9 year old to sleep on . We used it the first time and everything was fine . Pulled it out a month later and it has a slow leak somewhere that I ca n't find to repair . Basically a waste of $ 35 . I guess you get what you pay for .
 I ordered this bed for a visit by my 4 year old granddaughter . We had to add air to the bed every morning . I had this experience with another brand , but hoped this one would be better . Definitely NOT worth the money .
 The price is great . The bed looks good . I have ordered several over the last few years . I 've only had 2 last 6 months or longer _ The most recent one I ordered had a leak so I returned it for a replacement . The replacement started to leak 32 days after receiving -- 2 days after the return policy . All I can say is if you need it - order 2 ; because it 's likely 1 will start leaking pretty soon . Unless you only use it occassionally . I use mine every day .
 It came with a leak I ca n't find . Rating it no stars was not an option .
 I 've owned many air beds , and many of these . How well they will work for you depends on how often you use them . I like them because they maintain even pressure on your body . The reason you move around while you sleep on a non-airbeds is because of the `` hot spots '' that develop from too much pressing in one place for too long . I 've also had several AeroBeds , made in the USA , with built in pump and sleep number control , several different and expensive type air springs , and INTEX , made in China , standard rib springs , with separate battery operated plastic pump . They last between 6 weeks and 6 months with the average being around 3 1/2 months . The AeroBed quality was better , more consistent life , but lasts only 20 % longer , at 10 times the price . If you go AeroBed , get it from a store that takes care of the warranty for you . I went for years on free AeroBeds until they stopped carrying them . Since I 've purchased these.What goes wrong
 I had to try sleeping on it the first night - in a couple of hours it was less firm , which made it difficult to roll around on . It did n't take long to realize that buying this bed was a mistake.Returning it will be very difficult because it is almost impossible to fit it back in its original carton -LRB- because one can not evacuate all of the residual air necessary to make it fold up small enough -RRB- . Prospective buyers should be mindful of this .
 We used this for less than 21 days for a guest . It does everything as advertised except that it began to leak air ; by the time you wake up in the morning , it has shrunk to less than half it 's inflated height . There is a patch kit included but we could not find where the air was coming out . We had to return it to Amazon . We bought a single folding bed instead with a memory foam mattress , not compact but less risky than an airbed .
 I bought this air mattress to use while my new bed was being shipped from back east , the bed lost air every night and I woke up almost on the floor . I tried to send it back but it was impossible to get back into the box .
 We purchased the Intex Inflatable twin bed with built in pump . After a few uses it started leaking air . By the middle of the night , it was down to about half full . So , being we are out of the 30 day return time frame , we are just out.If you buy this , good luck .
 Using this air bed was a nightmare to my husband . It is not firm and loses air easily . It lost half of the air in 30 minutes . When my husband got up from this bed in the morning , he was almost on the floor . He slept as a curve during the night , which really hurt his waist , which affect his movement . Definitely will return to Amazon today .
 This looked like a good produce and inflated easily , but would not hold the air . I am very upset that in returning , I will not get full refund for this defective product ! There will be a restocking charge , which is rediculous because they ca n't sell a defective product !
 I purchased this bed because I wanted to put it in a very small living room space . -LSB- The space is a combined livingroom/dining area . -RSB- I thought it would be suitable for a reading area . I planned to put a nice cover on it and some throw pillows.The bed has a coil type surface . I find it uncomfortable . It makes creaking noises while in use . I 've owned it just about a month . At first , no extra air was needed . I added air about once a week . Now , it needs air several times a day . I considered returning it , but will not because it was very cheap.I also purchased the Intex Supreme Air-Flow Queen Airbed Nylon flocked with built in electric pump . I have n't used it yet . I purchased it for use as a guest bed.I own the previous model with the memory foam top . I received it as a gift . It was comfortable . It started losing air after about a month and requires refills often . Finally , the pump broke and no longer works . I use a manual air pump for it now . It does n't stay full for the whole night . I could n't send it back because the postage cost too much.Suggestions : Buy products at this site that are sold and shipped by Amazon -- NOT other sellers . Amazon has supersaver shipping , ships in a timely manner and is great about reurn and replacement of items .
 Dear potential sucker , My first airbed by intex sprung a leak in about a week , so I obtained a refund . I bought this model next , and it lasted almost twice as long!I am now on my third . I should have learned my lesson , but my current intex airbed has been around for about one year , and currently has 9 , count 'em , NINE leaks . Everytime I patch one , another springs.Intex also makes inflateable boats . They must get sued for a lot of drownings . No wonder they have no email contact . If you buy ANY intex airbed , you are buying utter garbage.Sincerely , SidWa State
 I bought this bed at the end of May so that I would have an air mattress available if a guest were to stay . I first took it out of the box it was shipped in more than a month after it arrived and set it up the day before my guest was to arrive . It sat in an unoccupied room for one night - no one slept on it at all and lost substantial amounts of air . A serious amount air leaked out - it was visibly noticeable . I can not imagine how much air would have leaked had a person slept on it . This is a horrible product . It was past the 30 day refund from Amazon and after being on hold for over 20 minutes waiting to speak to an Intex rep , I gave up . You are seriously throwing your money away if you purchase this item . It was never slept on - period - and is unusable .
 I bought this to sleep on while I moved it to my new place and used it about 6 times before the seams on top came apart . I never realized how important the seams were until that dreary night when at 3am they started to come apart . I turned to my side and another came apart . I turned to my other side and the rest came apart -LRB- I weigh 120 lbs if it matters -RRB- which turned the bed into one giant ball . Since the seams are gone there is no shape and if you lay on it the air is distributed to the opposite of your weight ... I ended up in a hammock type pose . I let some air out in hopes it would bring the top down but nope , instead I sunk further.I called the manufacturer , emailed Amazon for the contact info to be sure , emailed the manufacturer again and finally got a response . Although some models come with a 90 day warranty , this one did not so I was SOL.Never again . Buy yourself a cheap mattress instead , at least it wo n't break and the comfort will be about the same .
 So I 've had this product since July 2011 , and it is now in the trash . The seams do not hold up and 2 have released , creating giant ` bubbles ' in the mattress rendering it unusable . I paid nearly $ 50 for this back then , and only used it 3 or 4 times . Very disappointed in the poor quality of this item .
 A comfortable bed for the money . But I 've had 7 or 8 of these , and they ALWAYS fail in one of two ways :1 -RRB- An external seam will break , usually near the head area . To fix it , use a good size piece of Gorilla Tape -LRB- forget the enclosed repair kit -RRB- and press down very hard around the leak so no air can get out . No need to deflate or remove flock from the area , but you have to press down carefully and firmly .2 -RRB- An internal seam will pop -LRB- usually in the middle -RRB- and create a huge bubble in the center . No way to fix that , unless you want to use pillows or folded blankets to level out the low areas.That 's my advice . I 'm still looking for a good , sturdy alternate model .
 I had a twin size Aerobed mattress for several years and I was very happy with it . When it finally developed a leak , I went shopping for a replacement . I decided to try Intex rather than Aerobed because it is 5 '' longer and I read complaints about recent models of Aerobeds having leaks . As usual , I read all of the Amazon reviews on this bed and I noted the complaints about leaks , but it seemed like a large majority of people were happy with it . I decided to give it a try since Amazon has a good return policy.When I got the bed , I had it inflated within 5 minutes of removing it from the box . The inflation process is very quick and easy and I found the bed to be comfortable . Unfortunately , when I came back an hour later , the bed was noticeably soft . It hit the inflation button and quickly the bed became firm again , but again , and hour later the bed was too soft to sleep on.Amazon is sending a replacement and I will update this review . If the second bed leaks , I will not try the Intex brand any more.Update
 I wanted an air-bed because I move from one place to the other almost 4 times every year . Moving an airbed is so easier compared to moving a traditional bed . So I started looking for airbeds on Amazon and this one had some good reviews -LRB- 4 out of 5 -RRB- . So I bought this bed finally . The shipping was late . The free super saver shipping is a joke as I had to wait for almost 10 days because I did n't want to spend another 15 bucks for expedited shipping.The bed itself was fine for the first one month . The , on one middle of the night , there was a hissing sound at around 2 AM . I got up to see what it was and realized that there was a hole in the bed . The `` puncture kit '' that came with this bed is a joke too . They do not show it too well in the pictures but this bed had some folds along the sides of it that kind of come out when you inflate the bed . Unfortunately , the hole was in this fold and it was hard to patch it up with the repair kit.I would have returned this item but all this happened on Dec 5th while the return window for this product closed on Dec 2nd . It was almost as of the manufacturer knew what would happen to this bed after 40-45 days of use . So I can not return it now and that is money I will never see in my life again .
 I 've bought several air beds from various manufacturers . I bought one identical to this one 1 1/2 years ago . It was comfortable but lost air after 3 months . I justified this as the user may have not taken care . However , I now believe its the brand . This one would not inflate at all . I will not buy this brand again . I 've had great life from a better brands .
 I ordered these beds because my grandkids were sleeping on the floor and couldnt afford real beds and in less than 2 months both beds have popped . They didnt jump on them they just lost air seemed like the seams were the problem . 1 bed was replaced but the other remains not replaced . I would never buy these type of beds ever again or this brand . They were not cheap and I cant afford to replace them again . So now they are back to sleeping on the floor again . I heard they were good or I would not have ordered them . I am terribly disappointed .
 I ordered 3 of these . They are sturdy , comfortable , and stay inflated . The electric motor in each easily and quickly inflates and -LRB- almost -RRB- deflates them . The height also makes them feel more like a real bed.However , if you want to completely deflate them for storage , that can be a real trick . I could never deflate any of them completely , so in frustration I cut one open to see what the problem is . A design flaw allows an internal plastic flap to cover the deflation port when they are almost empty . The more you try to vacuum or squeeze out air , the tighter the flap seals the port , sealing in the last bit of air.Now I know , and there 's nothing I can do about it , but I feel better after attacking one with scissors ...
 I bought this for my four year old he in between beds and wanted something temp since we are planning to move to another state and did n't want to by a bed we would have to move so decided to by this . within a week had a first hole patch everything fine two week later another leak think it coming from where the motor is . . we had a queen size on from same brand it that happen to that one as well . The one without the built in motor never had an issue with which is what we are using now . I also do n't like the top it not comfortable with the humps .
 Currently , there are no wholes throughout the bed . But , for some reason when I wake up . The bed is already out of air . I only weigh 120lbs . I do n't understand why it does that . Please save your money , when you start to have the same problem .
 I purchased the first airbed and found it to be exactly what I wanted . I ordered and received a second one which I have not yet used . Meanwhile , the first one has sprung a leak and is not usable . Big disappointment . No reason for leakage as it has been used only for small individuals .
 If I could give a 0 star I would.So I bought this airbed while I had a friend visiting so she could use my bed . It seemed to work just fine the first night . However the second time I inflated this bed and slept on it , I got the worst night of sleep ever . During the night , the air slowly came out of the bed -LRB- I have checked all over for leaks or holes but could not find anything -RRB- . I woke up several times to a half inflated bed and then had to re-inflate the bed again only to wake up an hour later to the same condition . Needless to say , I am extremely unhappy with the product . Hope Amazon will let me return this terrible thing .
 We purchased this bed for an extra for when the kids come over . Nice looking , but do n't let looks deceive you . By the morning , you wo n't have any air in your bed .
 It actually lasted a whole month until it decided to deflate and go flat . I guess I am just hard on blowup beds.I was using it every day as a regular bed , perhaps it would be better if used for visitors only .
 This product is very difficult for me to use . The air pump does not connect easily and I would not recommend it .
 I received this air mattress and was very impressed at first . It 's only been a couple of months with sporadic use by an average size/weight person and it 's now unuseable . Two of the seams along the top of the mattress have now `` popped '' so that the top of the mattress is 1/2 big bulge and 1/2 normal . There 's no reason this should 've happened . When only 1 seam popped it was still ok , but with 2 gone we have to throw it away .
 Everyone who slept on this mattress , ended up with a jumble of bedding after a few tosses and turns . I would not recommend it .
 Was so excited when I found this . I have slept on these small skinny air mattresses that are like a few inches tall when inflated and always would fall off them during the night or end up underneath them . So ordered this raised airbed thinking since it 's like a size of a regular twin bed it would work out great for camping . Went camping for a weekend with this . The first night I inflated it , it sagged a bit so thought I just did n't put enough air in it so I pumped it up more until it was nice and firm . By bedtime it had deflated a little again . It was annoying but I slept on it anyway and it ended up being okay . The following day I had to put more air in it twice and by bed time it was even more deflated but was too tired to do anything about it so slept on it anyway . At 4am woke up to it being about 1/3 to 1/2 flat , somewhere in there and my back was killing me . So decided I had had enough and finished sleeping on the ground , which ended up working out better . Never going to get a raised airbed again , or at least not one with a built in pump .
 When it started leaking I could n't find the leaks . First the top started leaking , later the bottom so now I have totally given up on it.It was comfortable before it started leaking .
 it inflated easily and was very firm , by the morning i noticed it was considerably softer , and as i sit here now typing this i find myself gradually getting closer to the floor . easy enough to reinflate , but still , this should not happen the first night .
 I bought this for my 8 year old to sleep on in temporary housing during a corporate move . This bed did n't last two days and it came apart in the seam where we could n't patch it . I would not waste my money on this product again .
 I used the bed 3 nights and it started leaking on the fouth night . I contacted the seller and was told to find the leak . If it was in a seam it was under warranty . I tried to find the leak , but was unable . I emailed them back to ask the best way to find the leak . I received NO response.I did a little reasearch on the web and found MANY people had a problem with this bed.So I am unable to find the leak and unable to use the bed.I an not Happy with the company I purchased if from and will not recommend them to anyone !
 i only used this bed about a dozen times . it was never really all that comfortable and the last time i inflated it , a huge lump developed right in the middle making it unusable . there is no way to get rid of the lump and it is rock hard solid . it raised up about 3 inches high and is about 15 inches in diameter . its too late to send it back now so its going in the dumpster . i have since read other reviews of intex doing the same thing . i will NEVER get another intex again ... i am going back to aerobeds !
 leaks after leaks after leaks . i have patched them with super glue and bike patches and they just dont seem to stop comming . i am tired of patching them . dont ever buy a air mattress . just fork out the cash for a good mattress .
 Great product for my visiting 3 1/2 year old grand daughter ! Stays inflated well.Fair price ! Easy to inflate and deflate !
 i dont know why these guys are trying to cheat . i paid full amount and i was expected to receive a twin size airbed but when i opened it it is actual size is single sized matress ! so this company is baad ! will never suggest it to someone .
 I have always recived what i ordered , but this one was not . . I ordered the hi rise , but recieved one way to short to the ground . . it was to much trouble to send back , Im too old . . I was dissapointed as now I can , t use it . . husband can , but I can , t. . be careful you get the right product ...
 Inflates like a charm , then deflates under the weight of a child within 3-6 hours , I should have gone with my gut and purchased another Aerobed because the one I already have -LRB- queen -RRB- has worked for &#62; 7 years .
 We used the airbed for one guest -LRB- my very careful mother-in-law -RRB- over the holidays and it was fine . My son took it on a trip and it began loosing air the first night and he has not been able to use it since . I would not buy this again and in fact will try to return it when he returns home with it .
 I went through three of these , neither one of them would maintain the air pressure and would slowly deflate . This occurred within 2 uses for each of the 3 mattresses i had . I considered maybe the person sleeping on it was too heavy , but alas , the person is 210 pounds and the weight limit is 300 , so that wasnt it . I thought maybe it was punctured , but if it was the person would have awoken on the floor instead of on a supper jeloutnous rubber blob , so that was not it either . What conclusion left is there - this thing sucks and doesnt maintain the air .
 I bought this Intex bed for my son . He is renting an apartment while waiting for a room assignment in a dorm.The bed , although still inflates , now has a bulge in the middle , so he falls off the bed . Even though we tried deflating and inflating the same , the problem is still there .
 I bought this for my daughter to sleep on when she was home from college . She actually liked sleeping on it but 3 weeks later it developed a slow leak which I could not find . Therefore I had to throw it away . A complete waste of money .
 It only lasted for less than 3 months then there was 2 holes that I fixed but still there was a leak somewhere and eventually I just threw it away . I do n't recommend this air mattress .
 Heard a huge boom and I noticed the seam had given out and then this huge bubble formed in middle of the bed and then it ripped a few days later . I purchased the product on or around 10-6-2011 and before 11-1-11 it was deflated !
 I bought this air mattress two months ago . I used a couple of days and it worked fine . Now a friend is planning to visit so I decided to use it again but something went wrong , instead of a flat surface , there is a huge bump in the middle that would make sleeping on it uncomfortable if not impossible.Since this is a product you will use only a couple of days before putting it away until you need it again , the amazon returning period will be over by the time you actually try it and find something wrong with it . And the company that makes this mattress says `` this product does not have any warranty or service program '' . I hope I can put this in the recyclables bin!I wish I would 've spend a little bit money on a real mattress that wo n`t fail after a while .
 Opened the box , unrolled the mattress , plugged in the motor and then ... the motor made a few feeble noises and shut off in less than three seconds . Plugged it into several different outlets with the same results.Intex customer service told me that there are NO WARRANTIES on their air mattresses and the only option was to return it to Amazon for a refund . I will not be ordering any products from Intex in the future .
 I have purchased two of these air mattresses . When inflated , they are great . But , during the night , they slowing deflate . I have yet to discover how to keep these mattresses inflated for eight full hours . I wish I would have bought a different air mattress .
 At 80 '' iong , this is an extra long twin , not a standard twin . Consequently I had to take back the sheets I bought , as they were 5 '' too short . I would have ordered a different model had I known that 80 '' was n't standard . It 's easier just to replace the sheets and I do n't have time to send the bed back .
 I bought this bed while I decided to purchase a normal bed . I was at first excited but as the week , past the seam popped and the bed now has a bubble and un-usable . for the money you pay for an air-bed I stick with a traditional bed over and air bed . Least to say thanks the quality is poor ! I do not recommend .
 These beds seemed like a great idea and so convenient but the reality is very different . I ordered 2 twins for some company that was coming down for the holidays . We inflated them and except for some minor air leakage over the course of a 4 day stay , they worked great . Fast forward to the second time we used them a few months later and one of them worked great and one leaked to the point of going flat during the night , quite a surprise for our guest . We tried repeatedly to find the leak -LRB- s -RRB- but to no avail . We were out of warranty at this point , so I went and ordered another thinking that the one bed still worked well . We got the new bed and used it almost immediately only to discover it leaked . It was under warranty so Amazon shipped a new one which ... you guessed it LEAKED . Oh and as a final note the one remaining bed that DID work now leaks . I went to KMart and bought a new Coleman twin mattress and along with a no name twin I bought at Walmart 6 years ago , I now have 2 working air mattresses .
 Airbed does n't keep air overnight . If you try to return it you will be charged a restocking fee to restock an airbed that does n't work so you will get no refund ... exchange it for another crappy airbed ... My recommendation is ... do n't buy this crappy airbed !!
 The bed arrived much sooner than I expected , and I inflated it for w few minutes before I took it on my retreat . Imagine my surprize at having it deflate within an hour of getting is set up in my room . I ended up sleeping on the floor that night.We 'll see how the return process goes . I 'm headed out to buy an air mattress locally .
 This item loses air overnight . Must be inflated daily if not nightly . If you return this item the store wo n't take it back , you must ship to the maker at your expense . Or you must cut the air pump out because they do n't trust you not to keep using it , like we have to trust them on their quality .
 I received the bed , and I loved it . But after one night it almost completely deflated . I tried to find the holes but I found none , so it was kind of a waste of money .
 I was hopeful this mattress would work out , having read mixed reviews , but as others stated , the mattress held air for only several days before it started losing air during the night . My son would then have to turn the air pump on -LRB- during the night -RRB- in order to have be able to have a comfortable night of sleep . Generally speaking I think all air mattresses do the same thing , as I then purchased one from the local K-mart , which is also going back tomorrow for the same problem .
 Was very comfortable when I inflated it , but had deflated twice before the night was over . Boasts features like beds twice the price -- the internal 120 AC pump is handy -LRB- especially since it deflates so fast -RRB- but it is noisy , and who wants to interrupt their sleep twice a night to reinflate the bed ? Not me , that 's for sure . I really wish it had n't been a leaker , I like this bed , everything about it except that .
 My mother bought this bed for my 5 year old to use when we visited on weekends . Worked great the first 4 or so times she used it . But now the valve that lets the air out wo n't close . It spins , but does not seal shut so you ca n't inflate the mattress . Very poor quality .
 This bed sucks after 1 month I was asleep on the bed when a popping noise woke me up I did n't know what it was so I went back to sleep when again a popping noise woke me up again I could n't figure out what it was when I got up the following morning I noticed a big bubble going down one side of the bed that 's when I realized it was the bed making the popping noise smh
 All these airbeds look good on pics . But the common problem for all these even well known brands is deflating . The tightly inflated airbed almost completely deflates by the morning , even if u find the leakage and seal it , by next day other leakage will appear . it is horrible feeling like u are on the boat during the storm when it is flat . Eventually after buying 3 airbeds from well known brands i bought spring mattress for 100 $ and feel very good without needing in inflating it every morning !
 It works but the next morning it has lost some shape and is n't as comfortable as it could be . For the price and the function is okay , the twin size made it right for our allowable space - but if you will need a longer term solution it is probably better to invest in a more expensive air bed .
 This is really a bad product . I bought it in hope that I could have one extra bedding when required . I used it on first night for myself and after 3-4 it deflated , annoyingly i filled the air back in night and went to sleep . In morning i was awake again because it has deflated . I thought i am doing something wrong , read the manual and searched online , found nothing . Next night it was the same story . Returned to amazon . -LRB- note
 I ordered for use when company came-my niece slept on this once and ended up on the floor after one night . I can not recommend this to anyone .
 We received the Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump on September 10th 2008 . It is for our 8 year old daughter who has joint pain due to a genetic disorder . Her doctor recommends an air bed to relieve the pressure on her joints caused by a `` traditional '' mattress . The first 2 months it worked great . She was sleeping better and woke up in less pain . The next few months we had to pump it up every other day , but she still was in less pain . Now today , April 11th 2009 , just 7 months later she ca n't even sleep on it . Within 3 hours the bed is almost completely flat . Our daughter is now sleeping on couch cushions until we can find a new bed . Do n't waste your money on this bed ! Find ANY OTHER airbed , you 'll be much happier .
 THIS IS THE THIRD MATTRESS IN 5 OR 6 WEEKS AND HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH ALL THREE . THEY ALL LEAKED RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING , SOME WORSE THEN THE OTHERS . THE BUILT IN PUMP WORKED GREAT AND I LIKED IT VERY MUCH . THUS THE 2 STARS INSTEAD OF ONE STAR . I AM VERY THANKFUL FOR AMAZON 'S GREAT RETURN POLICY . IT WAS REALLY A PLEASURE TO DEAL WITH THEM .
 When it comes to airbeds , you ca n't expect a lot , after all , it 's a balloon that you sleep on . As it turns out , the Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed lives down to those standards . It may be comfortable for your guests for a night or two or three , but inevitably -- like ALL Intex airbeds -- it will fall apart , bulging out at the seams and becoming unusable.This was my third Intex purchase -LRB- I purchased the items in rapid succession -RRB- and every last one of Intex 's airbeds failed within 6 weeks of purchase ! When you contact Intex because your airbed is only five-weeks old and now resembles a mangled balloon animal more so than an airbed , they will politely tell you there are no refunds , warranties , or replacements for you and to buy another one of their products.Normally , I 'd just forgo a negative review and just say , `` buyer beware '' and leave it at that . Unfortunately , the `` quality '' of the Intex line of products is so atrociously bad and their `` Customer Service '' is so arrogant and clueless -LRB- or perhaps a `` bot '' sending automated , canned email to customers -RRB- that I feel it is my ethical responsibility to warn anyone looking for an airbed to stay away from this brand of airbed . I am appalled that Amazon allows them to peddle their shoddy wares here .
 We bought these beds in September for our grandchildren to sleep on when they visit . They are 6 and 7 and weigh under 50 pounds . These beds can not make it through one single night inflated . We either have to get up during the night and re-inflate them or the kids will wake us up because the mattresses have lost so much air they are uncomfortable.We 've had to repair both beds because they develop pin holes from being folded when we put them away and you can hear air escaping around the area where the beds inflate themselves.I 'm very disappointed in this product and will not buy another air mattress from this company since it 's clear their quality has gone down hill drastically since we bought their double bed seven years ago.My opinion is `` save your money and find another solution for guests to sleep on '' , that 's what we 're doing now .
 I chose this twin air mattres becaue of the reviews and brand , good quality . I bought it about 2 months ago for a weekend of Holiness , it just had a hole when i aired it up . Threw it in the trash terrible product .
 I purchased 2 Intex Pillow Rest Twin Beds due to the size specifications of 40 X 80 X 18 1/2 '' . They were to be used by my > 6 ft. tall family members when visiting . I was extremely disappointed when we inflated the 1st bed - which BARELY measured 32 X 70 X 16 . I sent a letter to the supplier , CMS WorldWide Sales , explaining my dissatisfaction & was told to send pictures & measurements -LRB- which I did -RRB- and they would -LSB- quote -RSB- ... `` Once you had provided us the information we had requested , we will be glad to forward you the return shipping labels . `` This was months ago , and to date I still have 2 Intex Pillow Rest Beds -LRB- the 2nd box was never even opened ! -RRB- that are no where near the specs stated on the packaging.I will NEVER order anything from the CMS WorldWide Sales supplier again .
 I purchased this a couple weeks ago , and used it for the first time last night . It worked well . Plugged it in and it only took a couple min to inflate . My problem with this bed is not so much how well it works inflating but what a hard time i had deflating it this morning . I was so frustrated trying to get all the air out that i finally just wrapped it up . With even a little air still in it , it makes it so hard to roll up tightly and put away . It just looks bulky . I have tried aerobeds in the past and i love that their beds have a release valve , this one uses the a small hole built in with the pump . The release valve work much better , and I decided to go with this because it was affordable and i could n't find aerobeds in twin size . I am definitely gon na see if i can get a return on this ... i just hope i can fit it back in the box it came in .
 I saw several people had written about air leaks but at that point the majority appeared to be happy with their purchase . We ordered two twins for our camp . Mine started leaking immediately . My husbands seemed to be good from Spring to nearly Winter when his too began to leak , so bad that both of us were pumping air several times during the night to keep a little bit afloat . That was bad enough but having several friends and family in our bunk house part of the camp awake while doing this pushed it over the edge . My father in law bought the same time my husbands started going down hill so it should be interesting to see if it happens again . Our camp closes down during Winter so Spring will be the big test . I suspect we will go with something a little more expensive and not regret wasting the money we did on these . Then again my hubby is very good at fixing things so maybe there 's hope .
 The bed needs air refilling more often than I thought it would - every 3 days at the most . So much so that if I did n't pump it , the bed would all be like a water bed with `` jelly-like '' feeling . To lessen this effect I situated it in a corner of the room against the walls . Further more , what surprised me was the round water condensation on the bed sheet just underneath my -LRB- head -RRB- pillow in the morning . But what confuses me is that in the evening the bed feels cold -LRB- or the air inside feels cold -RRB- . What I like about it though is that the pump works real fast in inflating - although it is loud for an evening activity .
 I ordered it because I have a 6ft 8in relative who spends time with me . The description says this airbed is 40in wide and 80 inches in length . The box housing the bed clearly states the bed is 39 in wide and 75 inches long . I am really disappointed because I have been shopping for this for over 3 months and only recently decided this was the right bed . WRONG!The goal is to provide comfort . / his wo n't , his feet will be hanging off the edge of the bed . Its going back .
 This airbed does not stay inflated . It went flat half way through each of the five nights I used it . It is junk . Do n't buy it . If I had bought it at a store it would have gone back the next day .
 Only used a handful of times and the bed already leaks air . Waste of money . I know it shows a one star rating but the true rating is zero stars .
 The product deflated during the night . We refilled and let sit with no one in it for a while and it still lost air . I was very disappointed as the product initially started great for my Aunt who would not have been able to be on the floor with a traditional air mattress . I am attempting an exchange hoping it was just this one item . Most of the reviews were glowing and I am hoping that the replacement will perform as the other reviews indicated .
 Was nice while it lasted . After a few nights on the mattress , one of the seams in the middle apparently broke . Now it 's nothing but a large bubble in the center . Tried flipping it over but it 's like sleeping on a rocking chair . Nothing to do but take it to the dumpster .
 I live in a smallish one bedroom apartment and have frequent visits from out-of-town friends and relatives , so I have a pretty significant need for temporary beds . When set up , the temp bed is right in the middle of the living room , so I need to deflate and store a temporary air bed on a daily basis when guests visit . Unfortunately this is a nightmare endurance test for air beds as the frequent compression and folding of the unit for storage along with the periodic inflation and deflation is a formula for a shortened air bed lifespan.There are two significant names in makers of at-home air beds
 We did an extensive amount of research online for an air mattress that would be durable . This item , despite a handful of reviews -LRB- all with 5-stars -RRB- , began to deflate immediately upon being inflated . Unfortunately , we did n't test the mattress before the arrival of our house guest , unwittingly giving her the pleasure of seeing a night on the couch materialize right before her eyes.Given that so many air mattresses seem to leak , we were partly prepared for a non-working mattress . But here is what we were n't prepared for
 I had another airbed that lasted about 2 years before there was a leak and needed to replace it . This one had pretty good reviews and it was taller when inflated and would be easier to get on and off it . I did like the airbed and it was comfortable . We used it less than 5 times over the last 4 months and it deflated slightly last time I used it . I should have investigated further at that time but just deflated it until next use . I used it this weekend and had to pump it up again in the middle of the night and I think my time for warranty is over with .
 Product was defective from day on and lasted a whole 32 days and now will inflate but by the middle of the night you sleeping on the carpet .
 This product was received having a slow leak . . box was received damaged . . . Daughter went to bed at morning we discovered her in the middle -LRB- sinked -RRB- ... . I would not recommend ...
 I bought this mattress as a spare guest bed for our vacation condo . I was delighted to see it described as being 80 `` x40 '' -LRB- a twinXL -RRB- . It arrived and the box clearly stated 80x40 dimensions so put it in the closet for future use . Just pulled it out of the closet 3months late and inflated the mattress only to find it is a standard twin measuring 32 `` x72 '' . Nothing close to the stated dimensions noted in the product description and on the box .
 It does n't stay firm even overnight . The motor burned out after a while . I bought a Coleman ...
 This bed was cheap and the quality was consistent with the price . The seams deformed about 6 months after use began and bulges formed that eventually made the product unusable . Do n't purchase for long term use . The seam design is flawed , which is probably why most of the other manufacturers offer a quilted pattern . The return shipping and 50 % refund potential make recovering any money impossible . I got some use out of the bed , but definitely would n't buy anything else from this manufacturer .
 I purchased three of these and within 1-2 months , ALL three of them `` broke '' . The seams on two of the beds broke , leaving a huge bulge in the middle of the bed and the seams of the third bed kept coming apart . . Im not sure how many holes I had to cover but way more than their repair kit allowed for . After contacting the company and starting the refund process , I was told that since they were bought through Amazon I would n't be able to receive a refund . TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE ! Yes , the beds are $ 35.00 so I definitely got what I paid for but ca n't believe how cheaply they are made . DO NOT BUY THESE PRODUCTS !!!! Spend more to get more bang for your buck !
 Just a great item . However there are approximately 5 length-wise seams on the bottom to create stability . After two months , one seam `` disappeared , and now the bed rocks , because there is one large air space.I can probably live with it , just have to put some towels , whatever to stabilize it .
 Air mattress
 I bought this product because I 'm living temporarily in a city and will move to another city later , and do n't have the extra money to buy a better bed . Since then my shoulders hurt from sleeping on it . I 've lost interested in sleeping after that . Before that i never have problems with sleeping.It 's ok to sleep for one or two nights only i guess . If you intend to sleep on it for a few months , buy a comfy bed instead of this !
 Had the bed two weeks and so far not a problem . I did not inflate it to the maximum pressure-I 'm 250lbs the maximum load being 300lbs-but rather 3/4 full of air . I have added air only one time-maybe 10 seconds . I sleep on this airbed every night . There is a tendancy for me to roll to the side of the bed-whether that 's just me or the bed is yet to be seen . To add to this review I had the bed for three months-the pump went out after that time . I suppose we take our chances.MalcolmL
 I purchase this air mattress in late October and two month later I was laying on the mattress I move my arm and a fist size hole appear over my head . The mattress arrive fast and was easy to set up . If you plan on using this mattress for a guest bed or for your kids when they come home for the Holiday or summer break please get something else . Not worth the money . I had Coleman and small hole appear and the patch does not work but for this mattress the patch does work for a small hole not the fist size hole .
 This mattress began leaking after only 3 or 4 nights of use . I found the leakbetween a crease in the top -LRB- flocked -RRB- side . After proper repair effort it wasunable to stay inflated . I have put the air bed to better use . Thank youKeith Colton
 We were among the unlucky buyers who happened to receive a dud . The airbed had a gash at the bottom , which we patched . But it also leaked at the seams and our attempts to patch that did not work . We returned it , unslept-on -- no easy task , since we were required to return the manufacturer 's box , and of course we could not get the deflated airbed back into it , so we had to find a box big enough to hold both the deflated airbed and the manufacturer 's box .
 This was the worst product I ever bought . It held up only about 40 days and then , got more inflated on one side then the other . Of course ended in the trash . I have no car , so was very hard for me to return the item , and go to the post office . Waste of money . Do not order from this company ever . BAD PRODUCTS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 This is not worth the price . Used it once and had to re-inflate it five times . Does not hold air . A piece of junk .
 The air mattress was good only for one day , after one day it started deflating and I have to inflate it every night before sleep . By the time I wake up on it the next day it has become like a water bed since it has deflated . I can not find the hole from where it deflates .
 It came with an air leak that was impossible to find . A real disappointment .
 Took it to France and electric pump only worked for a minute and blew . Bought a hand pump to pump it up . It was a painful job . After it was fully pumped the bed was rather comfortable . Decided not to bring home to return because once it was pumped there was no way to deflate to the extend that it would fit back into the original box .
 It was a super deal ... But there is something wrong with it . It will not retain the air level that I want.I will be returning this item
 I do n't really hate it , because my order was cancelled for some unclear reason . The order was cancelled several days after I placed it , so I 'm no fan of Intex .
 I ordered this bed in an emergency situation for my 95 year old mother to sleep on . The bed was easy to fill and evacuate , but it has a slow leak that necessitates adding air to it every day . I could n't send it back because I would have had nothing for my mother to sleep on .
 every person i communicated with was not only rude but were clearly annoyed by my need for help and completely unwilling to assist me . I returned the product that i was charged $ 103.10 for and was refunded $ 40.70 . thanks
 I bought this for my off campus residence , and the two months it worked fine ... and then the problems began . First , two the curves on the top -LRB- not sure what exactly they are called -RRB- merged into one so I had to sleep on one half of the bed . Recently , I noticed it was starting to sink and re-inflated it . Shortly afterward I heard some air and found where it was leaking and did n't think too much off it . Then in the middle of sleeping I woke up on the floor and then just gave up on it , and now am having to resort to sleeping on the floor . Tried calling their customer support line and it was backed up , then I found out that the main support line is for their pools . I would recommend a different brand like Coleman , or getting something from Cabela 's .
 I filled it with air when it arrived . It lost air by the morning . Since the bed was cold when filled , I gave it another chance . The first night is was actually used , it had to be refilled in the middle of the night .
 I used this product for one month of every night sleeping before it sprouted a leak in one of the seams on top that could n't be patched due to the fabric . It makes patches virtually impossible to stay stuck.There you have it .
 HI All , Never ever buy this product you will lost money and it 's a wast of time ... leacking after a week . fix that than find another leaking ... till u trash it . . and get rid of it . . i have the pic and i paid for it $ 60 worth nothing zerrrrrrrrrrrrroooooooooooooooo .
 I bought this airbed on October 2009 , I only used it 3 times and now is loosing air !! How can it loose air like that with only 3 uses ?? At the beginning it seams good because is comfortable and tall , but now I ca n't use it anymore unless I want fill it with air at the middle of the night .
 We loved the internal pump which also will pump the air out . It is so fast and the mattress itself gives a good night 's sleep .
 I was so excited when I received this air bed , but after sleeping on it on the first night , things changed . Every single night I had to put more air in it in order to keep it firm . There were no leaks that I could hear , but it was a pain to keep putting air in it every night . If this does not bother you , the bed itself is extrmeley comfortable.Intex Pillow Rest Queen Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump
 IT HAD A LEAK FROM DAY ONE . RETURN AND EXCHANGE PROCESS WAS VERY GOOD THOUGH . STILL WAITING ON THE NEW ONE
 Bought this product for a friend 's visit back in late October . Since then -LRB- It is now early February -RRB- , it has been slept on for a total of seven nights by two different normal sized adult guests , and promptly deflated when a third guest tried to sleep on it this past week . To its credit , the product did last just fine through those seven nights . It did , however , break not too long after the 90 day warranty ended and we have no reason to believe we will be able to repair it or otherwise recoup our loss . Purchase with the understanding that this is basically a disposable air bed with a warranty that seems conveniently short .
 Would not purchase this item again . Used in spare bedroom for guests . Hardly used , until now . Hoping top have Xmas guests use . First to lay on it , and center ring pooped.Still usable , but uncomfortable . The second night used bed hissing sound and a large leak appeared . They provide plastic to repair leaks , but do not provide any adhesive . I have to eat it now because I had until 11/12/12 to return.I can get partial credit , not including shipping if I just had just kept the box and shipping label for 3 months .
 Product came with no documentation whatsoever , no installation CD . Attempted to install this on 2 computers . `` plug and play '' install did not work . downloaded the appropriate drivers from Soundblaster and informed me that NO soundblaster card was found on my PC . attempted to contact vendor , no email was available , only a long distance phone number . Threw it in the trash .
 The drivers for this card are indeed hard to find and install . Creative has so many different variants of their drivers that it took many different attempts to locate the right ones . Windows XP Professional did not install this card as plug-and-play , so my only option was to hunt down the drivers . In the end I found the right ones , but it was a lot of work . For those not driver savvy avoid this card for sure.The most disappointing part of this story is the performance . It does fine for most basic sound generation on my 2.0 Ghz Pentium 4 system -LRB- YouTube clips , system sounds , etc -RRB- , but I suspect that it is a weak link in MP3/AAC playback in iTunes . Music played back in iTunes skips and stumbles frequently making it unbearable to listen to . Upgrading to the latest Windows XP service pack , iTunes version , and Quicktime along with DirectX 10 did not alleviate the problem . I have never experienced this problem on any system with XP installed , including systems with far lower processor and memory specs . This leads me to conclude that the sound card is not keeping up -LRB- maybe its still a driver issue -RRB- . In the end the cheap price will only be a true bargin if you are really willing to spend the time to hunt down the drivers , and you only need basic sound on your computer . You get what you pay for here for sure .
 I ca n't resist writing a review , because I rely heavily on what others have to say too.I just bought the 1115 and it 's being returned today . I 've had an Epson Photostylus 870 for the past couple of years and had a little ink mis-hap -LRB- my fault -RRB- and thought , what the heck I 'll get a new printer figuring the technology has improved , etc. . This time I decided to go with an HP because I generally like their products , but I 'm going back to an Epson.The quality of photo prints are not even comparable . The Epson prints are clear , crisp and realistic . The HP prints -LRB- even at 2400dpi -RRB- are grainy and fuzzy.Not to mention that ever since I installed the printer -LRB- using USB -RRB- my floppy disk drive has been grinding every few minutes . Not sure what 's up with that.I will say that the HP is fast and fairly quiet . Printing regular documents on paper of course looks nice , but for `` real '' photo images try Epson.Good luck !
 I would not buy this printer again . It quickly uses up all the yellow ink . This is a common problem with this printer . See Yahoo Answers , search for `` hp photosmart yellow '' . I think they should be recalled .
 I Have had trouble with HP and XP since upgrading . Although they say it is xp compatable with driver , it is not . Will cause system to lock up and when I called HP they blamed XP . Bought a Epson and first time install without a hitch . Hope this helps and God bless you !
 Bought Photosmart 1100 three months ago . Loved it till it thought my color cartridge was bad . Now printer will not recognize any new cartridge . Seems there 's a hardware bug that the printer will not reset a flag that indicates failed color cartridge . I 've bought 2 new color cartridges and a new black cartridge . Called HP & they had me clean cartridge 3 times , power cycle , and even sent new cartridges . Analyst at HP very nice , thought ... still the display flashes `` Color Cartridge Failed '' and `` Replace Color Cartridge '' . Wo n't even print B&W . Dumb thing ...
 My HP DeskJet 870cxi died last month , and I replaced it with the Photosmart 1115 , which I wanted to use with a Dell desktop -LRB- XP Pro -RRB- and an Apple iBook -LRB- OS 10.2.1 -RRB- . The only nice thing I can say about this printer is that it prints beautiful photos on photo paper . Printing anything else is a lesson in frustration.Printing a color web page with this printer is SLOW ... it seems much slower than my old DeskJet . Second , I get frequent paper jams when printing on plain paper , and especially when printing envelopes . The printer jams when printing photos on 6 x 4.5 '' photo paper that came with it . When I print documents on plain paper , I also occasionally get these cryptic error codes , and my document stops printing halfway through the job , leaving the paper stuck in the printer.The printer also comes with a CompactFlash and SD readers built in . It 's pretty cool to insert a Compact Flash or Secure Digital card from a digital camera and print an index sheet right from the printer . However , my XP desktop wo n't recognize the cards from the printer . It says that there is no card inserted . Frequent e-mails to HP tech support have not been helpful - they say the card is faulty -LRB- it works fine in my camera and my Lexar card reader , however -RRB- . Mac support is suprisingly lousy , because HP has been pretty good to the Mac in the past . I had to wait a month until HP released drivers for Mac OS 10.2.1 -LRB- Jaguar -RRB- . The Mac drivers have the same problem the XP ones do
 My friend just brought a Epson c820 and it print better photosthan my HP 1115 . I paid ~ $ -LSB- money -RSB- and he paid only ~ $ -LSB- money -RSB- from costco.So , I brought one myself . Epson print better photo than HP 1115 . If you think of buying this printer , try Epson first.Also , the driver of HP 1115 does n't work with my Iomega CR-RW andmy new Epson printer together . Bad software driver !!!
 I have used this printer for the last two years , though it has not been heavily used . It has completely broken down , will not acknowledge that it has paper , and the `` carriage '' is broken . It will not feed anything through and constantly has paper jams . I have been told by repair specialists that it will cost several hundred dollars to fix it because the `` carriage '' is so expensive . Though it does print beautiful photos , I am very disappointed with this product 's performance over time !
 I have had several of these monitors . I use a two-monitor set-up . - The backlight on the first burned out one month out of warrantee . ViewSonic would not replace the first monitor - fair enough as it was out of warrantee . I purchased a replacement . When it came , the screen was blue , and the color could not be adjusted . ViewSonic sent a replacement which had a green screen , and again , the color could not be adjusted . They were unable to find another VA912b , so they sent a different model to replace it.-Meanwhile , my second monitor , again a VA912b burned out the backlight after less than six months of use.-Beware that the glowing reviews you see for this monitor may not take into account its poor reliability . Should you choose this monitor , be sure to get an extended warrantee ! Better yet , do yourself a favor and choose another model or manufacturer .
 I bought this from frys and am returning it today . Maybe it 's only me , but mine had really bad quality and distorted images . I had 17 '' LCD monitor from viewsonic and was replacing it because it has similar problem . Now , 19 '' has same problem and I am done with viewsonic . I am not going to use viewsonic monitors again . Instead , I am going to try samsung ones .
 I 've had this ViewSonic model for a little over a year . It has been good to be until now . I have been losing pixels every week for the past month . I 'm out 25-30 pixels . Are n't products suppose to last longer then this ?
 The thing is I like the display and everything , but the first monitor when I got had a bad pixel in the middle . So I understand it happens , return it and got another one same model . Two days later the same thing happen , and two more days I got one more bad pixel . So I am returning this one as well , but no exchange this time . Just not worth it . Plus you can not adjust it , it stays only in one position . It may not happen anything with this bad pixels , but I do n't want to take a chance . It 's a hassle .
 I bought my unit in July , 05 . Installation and configuring the unit took ALL DAY , with at least 4 hours on the phone with HP support -LRB- including working with senior support folks -RRB- just to get it functioning at a basic level . From the beginning I experienced problems . A few of the more serious ones are listed below :1 -RRB- television picture quality with my older Sony Trinitron is terrible . The support person working to help me configure the unit eventually simply said , `` well , it is a DIGITAL entertainment center , '' when we could n't get the picture right . Given that I have digital satellite service and the set top box provided by the satellite provider gives me a crystal clear picture on my TV before I hooked up the DEC , I was not pleased by this response . If the satellite tuner get give me a good picture , I ca n't see why the DEC could n't as well . It comes with MULTIPLE tuners - none , apparently for an analog TV monitor .2 -RRB- The unit is supposed to work like a TIVO for recording broadcast programs , and allow you to do things like pause a live broadcast to answer the phone or get a snack . Well , on my unit , pausing causes the program to freeze , skip and otherwise freak out . The only cure is to turn the unit off and restart . Of course , I do n't use the pause feature any more .3 -RRB- For music , this unit comes with iTunes , and also a way to list , play and organize your music that has been imported into iTunes on they 're Media Center . Importing my CD 's into iTunes worked perfectly well . When I view the `` my music '' selection in the media center , my individual albums are duplicated , with the play lists segmented among the duplicated listings . So for a given CD with 12 songs , there will be two or three entries for the CD , with one or two songs with one entry and the rest of the CD on the other .4 -RRB- Making playlists on My Music is an important feature for me . I find that while I was able to make a couple of playlists when the unit was new , I no longer can . Its not clear why , but , it is another frustration.These are just a sample of the issues . Calling HP support , which I have had to do MANY times , is an uneven experience . Often the help is good . However , they have not been able to resolve the issues I 've listed above . The complexity of the product and the issues with design and testing I 'm seeing means that problems that you have with it are also complex , with many layers of related issues . Solving these kinds of problems over the phone -LRB- your only option -RRB- is extremely frustrating and often does n't solve the problem.Given the price of the unit and given that what this product does is to combine technology offered in the past as different products -LRB- that is , it contains proven technology -RRB- the problems I 've encounted are inexcusable . This product was not ready to be put on the market . I would return the z555 and get my money back if I could . Knowing what I know now , instead of buying the DEC , I would get a Tivo and a good iPod with accessories to play my music off of my home stereo instead and save myself a ton of money and frustration.As it is , I just feel `` taken '' by HP and my DEC is NOT working now . $ 2000.00 down the drain .
 When I purchased my HP Z560 Digital Entertainment Center it was going to be where I stored all my music and video so I could access it from any computer in my house on my home network . It was going to be the computer that I used to take care of working with all my digital entertainment . What a let down ! This thing does not do much of what it says . First there is a big problem with the video card and the display set up . I swear that the NVIDIA graphics card they put in this unit is incompatible with the rest of the system . I think it would be better off with a different card . They say it will work like a TIVO . It will as long as you do n't try to pause the program you are watching and recording . If you do the unit will freeze up and your recording is done . Try to record from a set top or disc and it wo n't let you.To make a long story short and to quit raising my blood pressure about this unit again . It makes a good desktop computer although fairly slow and antiquated . Try to use it as a media center computer and you will definitely be sorry and disappointed . The personal media device you can get for the computer is kind of nice but not worth buying the computer for . Buy it seperate from HP if you want it . I can not believe that HP put something so junky and glitch ridden on the market . I paid $ 1600.00 for the unit and it is a POS . I beleive they should buy them back or give credit for a new computer to any one who bought one . Now I know why they pulled them off the market so quick .
 Picked one of these up the other day , mostly for the slick design and for the wireless keyboard with trackball type mouse controller . But that 's all it has , is looks ... After using the keyboard , it quickly became tedious to use , since not only are the keys hard to push down , they are in a tight proximity of each other and not in the usual places , and the wireless is hit and miss , possibly because it runs at only 49MHz frequency . It will miss keys here and there , so you have to type very slooow , and check your work very often , and with passwords where you ca n't see what you are typing , good luck ! It quickly becomes a tire ... There is no number pad and the trackball mouse is skippy and lacks a scroll feature ... The processor is 2 `` generations '' older than the current dual core intel processors and the RAM is standard DDR instead of DDR2 ... Unless HP updates the components and the keyboard , this is a terrible value and a POS .
 my scanner has n't worked since the day i took it out of the box , installed the software , and the green light is on but when i hit scan it does nothing ! looks like it 's a dud . lol .
 There is no other way to put it . All Visioneers are garbage . Purchased my 2nd one -LRB- after first one died for no reason after a year -RRB- and have experienced many problems . Lately it wo n't let me scan anything because of an error saying to `` unlock your scanner '' . There is no Freakin lock on the darn thing !!! After contacting the company many many times -LRB- btw - there customer service sucks ! - No telephone number , unless u pay $ 2 per minute , just a computer-generated machine that unsuccessfully helps you called SARA -RRB- . I finally put a claim in through the Better Busines Beaureau , there response was that they could n't send me a new scanner cause it was after 1 year of my purchase , but they would be so kind enough as to let me purchase a new one and give me 25 % off of their price -LRB- which was probably an elevated price -RRB- . I told them to kiss off ! Anyway - please do n't buy this product or any Visioneer product - they Suck !
 I loved the slim design and the USB power so I could power it with my notebook 's USB port . The software was an upgrade to the other visioneer scanners I 've owned over the years , which is easy to use . However after only a few hundred scans , there 's a growing progressive distortion on the left side of images as if blackened , resulting in a very poor scan . I 'm throwing it away . Buy something else .
 Absolutely the worst software for flatbed scanner I have ever encountered . Scan is slow and softcover lousy . Do n't buy
 Vista has been out for 4 years , I 'm up to Windows 7 , and they still have n't released a driver update for this scanner!This is what 's called planned obsolescence , where they intentionally make something not work so that you have to buy the new version . There 's no reason or excuse for Visioneer not to release an update.This was the last scanner I 'll ever buy from Visioneer . How can I have any confidence that they wo n't do the same thing with their new scanners when I upgrade computers again ?
 The price was excellent but the standard shipping was very slow . It does n't work with Vista , no drivers , so is useless to me . I gave it to my son and it works fine with Windows XP . My son has used it to scan pictures for me and it is of good quality .
 Have owned 4 flatbed scanners up til now , 3 of which were visioneers . I use these scanners for archiving books and magazines . The 7300 good features
 I was looking forward to a new scanner after my HP died after just a year . I purchased this one based on the several good reviews on Amazon and other sites.Now that I have the scanner I am sorely disappointed . The picture quality is horrible . No matter the tweaking I do in the scanner dialog , the picture is faded and grainy.The software itself is the least useful interface I 've ever worked with . The `` auto '' buttons makes the image worse , the image area recognition has never yet gotten it right , and the most useful feature only applies if you are sending the scan to Paperport , something I never want to do .
 I knew that Visioneer had a bad reputation , but when my HP scanner finally died after six years , I picked this one up primarily because I had an Office Max gift card and that 's all they had in this price range . The software installation bluescreened my computer in Windows XP - twice . I tried to run the software anyway and found it confusing and hard to use . It 's going back to the store . Look at HP - I 've had pretty good luck there - or Canon , which is what I 'm going to buy once I get my money back . Visioneer has worked hard over the years to earn its lousy reputation - save yourself the trouble of finding this out for yourself.UPDATE
 I 'm pretty tech savy , and This is by far the worst experience ive had with ANY piece of electronica ever . Dont let the low price fool you , theres a reason for that . The drivers are terrible for this , Uninstalling this scanner requires 4 different programs , tech support charges you money for help -LRB- even though I bought this 2 weeks ago -RRB- , and if you actually get the scanner to work it will take a good 25 minutes to get the 1200 dpi resolution scan . Also the software it comes bundled with -LRB- Scansoft Paperport -RRB- is horrible , i have 2 gbs of Ram and it ran as if i had 128 mb . the TWAIN compatibility is awful , and it isnt compatible with any third party software . I wish there was something good I could write about this scanner , Aftr 2 weeks I got fed up , returned the scanner and bought an HP . People please do not hurt yourself by buying this awful piece of junk .
 I was very excited to buy this scanner and was pleased with its size and weight . However , if you have a Vista operating system , like I do , IT WILL NOT WORK ! The company told me that they stopped selling this product over a year ago and there are no driver updates available for this product . If you have an older computer and an older operating system this product might work for you . But as for me it was a waste of money !
 Bought this card to connect my dell 8100 to my ipod remixed . Installed the card in a snap without incident . Tried connecting my Ipod and it immediately started charging so I thought I was good . However , I opened itunes and nothing . Went to the iogear website thinking i needed to update the driver when I stumbled across the statement on the Tech Support Library , document # 10162 : `` Why wo n't my IPod work with the GUF320?Both the IPod and mini-IPod require a Windows Hardware Quality Lab -LRB- WHQL -RRB- certified card to connect to the computer . At this time , the GUF320 is not WHQL certified.We apologize for any inconvenience . `` Well that would have been nice to know before I ordered the card and wasted my time and effort .
 Bought this card to use with an iPod , and was greatly disappointed . My new iPod only comes with a cable to connect to USB 2.0 ports , and the USB ports on this card DO NOT WORK with iPods . I had to go buy an additional cable -LRB- iPod to Firewire -RRB- in order to get my iPod working . The Firewire ports on this card DO work with an iPod , but you 'll need a Firewire cable that new iPods may not give you .
 Though the description states this card will work with G3 and above it wont even fit in the PCI slot for a G5 1.8 Single or a1 .8 Dual I belive its because those slots are PCI-X . I am going to try the Sonnet alegro which says it will work with a G5 also . We 'll see.The Sonnet alegro works !
 Installation and use was easy and good . But the quality of the product was really bad and it was going loose and stopped working in between .
 I 've had this card installed since Nov. 2006 and just now found out that the 2 Firewire ports only work intermittently . I thought my new camcorder was messed up when I tried to use the Firewire port on the Iogear card . But when I plugged into another non-Iogear available Firewire slot , the camcorder worked . Now I have to go through the hassle of trying to get warranty work for the Iogear card . The USB ports on the card have worked okay.Update
 Although the specifications state compatibility with macs G3 or higher , this card will not fit into the pci slot of a new G5 . -LRB- ... -RRB-
 I have had the displeasure of working with this machine for over 4 years . Its incompetent feeder is only matched by the uselessness of the software it comes with . Save yourself the frustration and buy another scanner .
 American Electronics Mart sold me a `` refurbished '' Xerox documate 510 scanner that did not work from the start . I spent two weeks trying to troubleshoot to find out whether the problem was on my end . Then , because I missed the return deadline , they would not take the scanner back . They would not agree to pay the costs to me to ship the scanner back to them . Now , I have wasted $ 250 on a worthless piece of junk sold to me by these crooks . Do n't ever buy anything from these creeps .
 This Documate 510 scanner is sold under the Xerox brand but is made by Visioneer . You should not buy it because -LRB- 1 -RRB- it is a BAD , POORLY-MADE product -LRB- parts of the ADF wore out so badly after 8 months we could n't use the scanner anymore -RRB- , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- the CUSTOMER SERVICE is some of the WORST and MOST ARROGANT I have encountered in a long time . My company bought this item new from Amazon on 4/26/04 ; it was paid for with a credit card on the Amazon web site . As I said , by the end of October it had fallen apart to the extent the document feeder would n't work anymore . There is a 1 - year warranty , so I called the customer service number to find out how to return it , and got Visioneer . I explained the problem and the rep said to fax a proof of purchase and they would issue an RMA . I faxed the shipping label from the original box from Amazon , showing all info -LRB- product , serial number , date of shipment , etc. . I got a call the next day saying the rep 's supervisor would not approve the return , that I needed something with the date of purchase on it . I said how about if I fax the credit card statement showing the purchase from Amazon , made one day before the shipping date on the shipping label . Nope , not good enough . I said we evidently had not saved the e-mail confirmation from 8 months ago , and it would be very hard to get a new receipt from Amazon , since there were at least 5 different people in the company -LRB- 2 of whom are not even here anymore -RRB- , each with a different Amazon user name , who use this credit card , and we could not see the purchase history on Amazon unless we had the username that placed the order . He still could n't help , so I asked to talk to his supervisor , who could not talk at the moment but would call me back . Well , 24 hours later , no call , so I called back , and after 2 transfers and being on hold for 10 minutes and calling back in , I got the supervisor . He said there was nothing he could do . I said , do you think Amazon shipped us this without us paying for it , especially since we have the credit card statement showing the purchase date coinciding with the shipment date ? Sorry , ca n't help you . I asked , what if we got it as a gift . Well , you 'd need a gift receipt , etc. ... I told him if we can find somebody that has the time we 'll try to get a receipt otherwise we 'll turn it over to our lawyer . I guess the new motto is `` the customer is always wrong '' .
 This scanner is absolutely terrible . I have a small home business and I want to go paperless . If you are in the middle of a scan job , say you are on the 30th page already , and something is wrong , there is no recovery feature so you have to start from scratch . In fact , tech support says you will get constant errors if you scan more than 20 pages at a time , yet the document feeder is supposed to hold 50 pages -LRB- ? -RRB- . You can scan and then merge multiple scans to become one , but that is not the point . The point is that out of 900 pages of scanning , i got about two dozen errors which requires me to shut off the machine , close the scanning program and start all over again . I returned the product and got another documate 510 because tech support said it must be faulty , but the second is exactly the same . This scanner is nothing but a pain in the rear . I am shipping the second one back in the morning .
 After having so much trouble with HP scanners , I decided to try another company alltogether and go with Xerox . I needed a scanner capable of handling large amounts of paper 30-50 sheets at a time , was quick , and most importantly , worked . Unfortunately , 2 out of 3 does n't cut it.This scanner is very fast . It takes about 5 seconds to feed a sheet of paper . It can also handle a lot of paper at a time . Those are the only things it has going for it . If you notice from the picture , the auto document feeder is at a ridiculously sharp angle . It almost points straight up , which makes it awkward to load paper into it if you 're sitting down and less than 6 feet tall . My employees that use this always have to stand up to insert the paper because it 's easier that way . The feeder tray is n't very long either so you actually have to hold the paper and use your hand as a guide if you use more than a few sheets of legal-sized paper in it.Without a doubt , the biggest problem with this scanner is that it is incompatible with Adobe Acrobat 6 . It refuses to work with it . I do n't know if this is Adobe or the scanner 's fault but do n't get this scanner if you want to use both . Acrobat 6 refuses to locate this scanner . I have a degree in computer science , spent about 6 hours searching for a fix on the Internet , and still could n't resolve this . The only way to get around it is to either use a different version of Acrobat -LRB- I ended up having to pay $ 400 for Acrobat -RRB- , or use the scanning software that comes with it . The scanning software included is okay , but is like most software in that it 's bloated and has a lot of junk I did n't need . All I want is a simple TWAIN driver , which is not included . I do n't need 50 mb of software and drivers , and four different programs to do simple image scanning.Stay away from the Xerox Documate if you have an interest in scanning to PDF . It 's not even made by Xerox , but by a company called Visioneer , who then sells it under the Xerox brand .
 I have tried several permutations and combinations with this scanner . Here are some of the observations :1 -RRB- Image resolution is too bad for the file size it produces . I used an EPSON scanner before , and could get a much better B&W ; and color resolutions for a much shorter file size2 -RRB- All the images are titled towards one side . So , if you are scanning photographs , this is not the right scanner . A part of the picture will always need to be cut out if you try to straighten it up ! 3 -RRB- When trying to get a reasonable B&W ; resolution -LRB- 300 dpi -RRB- , scan speed is not as great as advertised.Overall , I do n't think this scanner is worth its price .
 Touching on the strong points first I will start by saying that the scanner produces a good quality scan . The automatic document feeder is a great convenience for scanning small stacks of paper . OK that 's about it . Now , for weak points . When doing any quality scanning it is extremely slow about it , when scanning in stacks of paper -LRB- far under the `` max '' paper feed count -RRB- it very frequently feeds the paper in wrong and jams , then many times when it jams , you clear the jam , and then try to start over , and it locks up the program . Then when you go through the whole `` end program '' fiasco , go back into the program and try to scan it will say `` driver busy '' . So you have to turn it off , then back on . Turning it back on requires even more waiting as it goes through its startup routine . OK now you are back to scanning . Not sure how long though , the ADF seems to jam at its own no matter how perfect the paper you are feeding it is . Other than that , its OK . Id give about 10 bucks for it at a garage sale ... maybe . Its certainly not suitable for heavy usage such as at the workplace or at a home office . Overall , its a pretty poor performer .
 My company bought this scanner about a year and a half ago . We have 10 - 15 people who use it intermittently . It does not see heavy use . From the beginning we 've had trouble with it jamming and feeding multiple pages . The cover to open it is very hard to snap open , and it wo n't recover from a jam without us turning off the scanner and rebooting the computer . I discovered that if I change the automatic document feeder pad assembly every 3 months or so , which I should not have to do , it helps the jamming and misfeed issue . Recently I went to order these pads , which were $ 20.00 apiece , and I could n't find them on Xerox 's website . When I called them they said this item was no longer being sold individually , but in a kit with cleaning solution and 2 pads . So what would have cost $ 40.00 - bad enough - now costs $ 100.00 !! As if we have n't spent enough money and frustration on this thing . I am going to do my best to get rid of this thing and buy one that works !
 This scanner worked fine for me for a year , and now with later windows 2000 service patches , it has what appears to be USB problems . I 've tried the latest driver available on several machines , and if they have windows 2000 with the newest patches , it will only work once or twice , then there is a driver error . I can do the normal windows recovery technicques of uninstalling & reinstalling , rebooting , trying different USB ports , etc. but short of re-imaging the machine , it wo n't recover . I am using this scanner with Adobe Acrobat 6 Pro with the latest service patches . I 've researched and not found a new driver for this device for quite some time . Going to try to hack on a visioneer driver after reading some of the other reviews here .
 Apparently my boss does n't read reviews . I requested a new scanner after my ancient Visioneer 9450 started eating paper for breakfast . I wanted a new brand and found one at a different website for a decent price . Instead , this one was ordered . I figured since it was n't the same brand it would be better . Until I found it is a Visioneer . I thought perhaps since it was newer it 'd be better . I was wrong . I use it for the ADF to scan hundreds of old files into digital files so we can get rid of the paper and reduce storage costs.The PaperPort software has OK settings , it allows you convert into a PDF , single page items , or multipage . The scanning quality is fine . The problems start when scanning . It seems to have trouble scanning one or two pages and randomly jams while it tries to feed the paper crooked . If you 're scanning a large mutli-page file and it jams , you have to start the whole document scan over again . PaperPort FREEZES all the time . At first I thought it was neat that you could drag and drop pages onto one another to combine files , but it quickly lost its appeal when it started freezing and I 'd have to force close it.The speed of which it scans is pretty poor , and it 's FAR from quiet . The pin connector that plugs in the ADF is incredibly large so it does n't fit in my oversized desk drawer like my previous scanner.I rarely hate devices as much as I hate this one . When scanning hundreds of sheets of paper it just makes the process twice as long and twice as annoying . I 'm just hoping it breaks soon so I can get the one I actually wanted .
 Firstly , it is incredibly important that you DO NOT use the bundled software for this scanner . The program is confusing and terribly disorganized . I have had several issues with using OmniPage , Readris , and Microsoft Scanning software bundled with Windows . While image quality is good , especially considering the speed of the ADF , the ADF gets jammed during almost every scan with these programs.I strongly recommend that if you have purchased this scanner , use Adobe Acrobat 6 or later . I am using 6.0 Professional and it works like a charm . The file size is extremely manageable -LRB- 300K for 15 pages -RRB- and is quite readable.If you have not purchased this scanner , DO N'T . While I do n't have any recommendations for other models or brands , I will suggest strongly that you avoid this one . It has been quite an experience , causing me to use Kinko 's and similar because I could n't get this scanner to work . Since using Acrobat , most issues have been mitigated to a tolerable level .
 Do n't buy this scanner , if you want to use the ADF to scan multiple pages into one document . The `` SCANDIRECT '' software that ships with this product WILL NOT scan multiple pages into one document . When you feed 5 pages into the ADF -LRB- automatic document feeder -RRB- thinking you 'll get one document with 5 pages -- WRONG . . you get 5 documents with one page each.Just UPGRADE your paperport software for a minimum of $ 100 , and then you can use the scanner as it was designed . When I called to complain to XEROX about this , I was told that they had `` mated '' this scanner and the software -LRB- Version 9 -RRB- before the ADF was added as part of the base scanner . Seemed pretty crappy to me . IT GOING BACK to the store tomorrow .
 I set it up according to the directions , clicked the scan button , and the contraption made a noise but never began the scanning process . Uninstalled it , then re-installed it , and the same thing happened . Complete and utter waste of my time . I gave it one star only because it had all the parts in the box .
 The scanner looks nice but very deceiving , I bought this scanner because of the name Xerox.I had it for about 2 months and scanned maybe 100 sheets , now it died!Xerox after 3weeks of calls now wants me to pay return shipping and they say I will get a refurbished unit . -LRB- Bad company -RRB-
 Jams with 2 pages jams with 10 pages . I basically have to sit here and babysit the scanner the whole time . I could scan my documents faster one page at a time on a regular scanner . Returning it as we speak .
 Bad Scanner . Only with their software are you able to scan in paperwork . Paperport causes more problems with the computers I have it installed on than any other product I know of . If you have anything greater than Adobe Acrobat 5 installed , you ca n't use Acrobat to scan in software . Stay away from the Documate line of scanners !
 For the price -LRB- about $ 200 -RRB- this is n't a bad scanner , considering it comes with an Automatic Document Feeder . It 's reasonably fast and does a good job with things like double-sided scans and converting non-editable files to Word and Excel . That being said , I will be replacing the unit soon because of a quirk that is really getting on my nerves
 I bought this scanner to scan approximately 100,000 pages of literature and it is just horrible . I returned it after a few weeks and got the fujitsu scansnap scanner . The fujitsu scansnap is simply the best non-commercial adf scanner on the planet , and I recommend you take a look at it -LRB- search for scansnap at amazon -RRB- .
 Like many reviewers , I really wanted to like this product . The price/performance looked just right . When I bought it late last year , there were enough reviews that I knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal , but it sounded like a fair tradeoff.Boy was I wrong . Reading the reviews , it looks as though people really love this device for a month or two and then come to hate it . That 's been my experience.If I 'd been paying attention , I would have noticed the 3 month warranty . But I did n't because I 'm used to electronic products having a 12 month warranty . Now I know better . I 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose . A $ 300 device and they skimped on the headphone jack ? So now I 've got to call their customer `` service '' -LRB- of course , no 800 number -RRB- to send the thing back.From the other reviews I 've read , it sounds like that wo n't be the end of my troubles . I fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy.Now let 's talk about the software . Like other reviewers , installation was hell . Subsequent behavior even worse . About 10 % of the time it ca n't find the device when I attach it to my PC . After I had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often I rebooted my PC , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. . Creative 's online support was no help at all . In fact , I 'd have to rate it among the worst I 've ever encountered.Finally , I uninstalled and reinstalled the software , the usual measure of last resort for this sort of thing . To my amazement , even that process was error-prone . It took several days of attempts before things finally `` worked '' again and I have n't a clue why . That does n't leave me with a good feeling about its future stability.I did buy the Notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement . But that 's a moot point now . My gut tells me the Nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40GB portable hard drive , albeit one on which I ca n't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again -LRB- I have their Audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating -RRB- . My gut tells me I 'll also end up buying an iPod . Which means that in trying to save a few hundred dollars , I 'll end up spending more than twice that.Be forewarned . I would have given a 3 to 5 star review in my first few weeks , depending on how mad I felt about the crummy software . Now , even 1 star seems like I 'm giving Creative the benefit of the doubt .
 My Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB only worked for 6 months . I no longer have any sound and the battery does n't charge . When I called customer service I was given the excuse that it was n't supposed to be used in the gym . As you all know it is marketed to fulfill your portable music needs . If you ca n't use it in the gym then it is not truly portable . I know many people who use their ipods in the gym and have had no problems for years . This product has fallen far below my expectations . It is not worth the $ 300 , not to mention the fact that it only has a 90 day warranty . Can you trust a product that is only guaranteed to work for 3 months ? No .
 I 'd like to start off saying that before this product i was using an Archos Jukebox Recorder ... What made this product so great to me was the open source OS called Rockbox ... Based on hardware one could assume the Archos players were horrible -LRB- which by hardware standards ... they were -RRB- ... But because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software , the Archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo ... Now we come to the Zen Xtra ... First I 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good ... The sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad -LRB- but still rather larger than i had expected -RRB- ... What really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software . Not just the transfer software -LRB- which was a hellishly horrible experience -RRB- but also the player 's software . First of all , many actions that the player utilizes do n't make sense . . Bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player ... Rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . . this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks ... The dynamic playlists -LRB- `` now playing '' , i belive Creative calls it -RRB- feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate ... Well , anyway i could go on and on on why this player did n't meet my expectations ... I 'll just say this ... For the average music listener not expecting much ... this may be a satisfactory mp3 player ... But for someone who cares about thier music collection and wants fluid and responsive playback ... I ca n't recommend this product .
 Sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an iPod . But with a low price , comes lower quality . Our special friends at Creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price . The catch is it 's built like a piece of crap . It lasted about 1 1/2 weeks . I did n't abuse it , I charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out . I tried re-setting it , I tried just about every pair of headphones in my house -LRB- 10 pairs -RRB- , and nothing worked . So I contacted customer service at Creative , but they said , `` If the product seems broken , we can not help , '' or something to that effect . Wow . Do n't get me wrong , the thing was like heaven for about a week . If you want a quality mp3 player , splurge on an ipod . If you really need to save , buy this thing on Amazon , they eventually gave me a full refund . I bought myself an RCA mp3-cd player , and I 'm happy with that until a cheap , worthwhile mp3 player coomes out .
 After a little over a year my Zen Xtra has stopped playing sound . Everything else works it just appears to be a faulty headphone jack which is a common problem on Creative 's players . On a dinky $ 30 portable I would n't expect much but on a $ 300 device this is just unacceptable.Their warranty period and customer service is a joke . Go have a look at their forums . Stay away from Creative products . There are other alternatives out there .
 This product is the the first Mp3 Player that I bought and it has turned me off from buying anything from creative again . As others have mentioned the headphone jack breaks quite easily , but not from rough use , it just breaks down . I barely had this thing a month before it started giving problems , and I only used it to go from home to work . This I guess is why people flock to the Ipod , cause you may not be able to replace the battery but it is damn sturdy . This is just a piece of junk
 This product is junk . I am using Windows XP and I have had repeated problems.Here is a quick list :1 -RRB- When I try to copy a file to my Zen it will copy one or two files and then error out telling me that the Zen is busy or that it can not write the file . Some times it will even error out on the first file .2 -RRB- When anything goes wrong the Zen seems to lock up and I have to reset it . So far I have had to reset it about 20 times in 2 days .3 -RRB- The Creative Media Source software that comes with this product also locks up when an error occurs during file transfer and I have to kill the process to shut it down .4 -RRB- I checked Creative 's KB for the errors I received and it was no help . I downloaded and installed the driver updates , firmware updates and all the patches I could fine but I still have the problem .4 -RRB- Creative has no weekend support which stinks and their support line is only open 9am to 6pm during the week . So for those of us that work , I guess we are on our own.I had high hopes for this product because I did not want to buy an IPod but it looks like Creative leaves me no choice . For any one thinking about buying this product , just remember , you have been warned.I only gave this product a 1 because the system does not allow me to give it a 0 .
 this player supports ONLY mp3 and wmaunfortunately , my own-made music format is ogg , and downloaded radio recording is asf format , this player do n't support bothand lack of digital recording is a major drawback too , unlike iriver , it has digital in and out , this is a necessary for mesorry , zen , this is not for me
 I bought the Zen Xtra 40Gb yesterday , taking it back today . The sound is awful . The volume range goes up to a 25 , and even with the EAX or whatever it 's called on , it 's barely audible . I do n't know if it 's the jack gone like you all say or if this is just designed for easy listening . No good for loud music . Prepare to listen to background noise , not your music . This thing sucks . Do n't buy it .
 Mind you I did not buy my Zen from Amazon , however I bought myne back in May - 40gb . Within 3 months , just after the warrenty expired , the headphone jacks died . I have a friend who has been trying to work on the jacks now for several months , and still no luck . Apperently they are attached ON the board instead of through the board . They have apperently been made horribly . For the price you pay for these things , they should work.At this time , I 'm very skeptical about buying another Zen due to this problem . I have read some reviews which states new ones have been made in July with a case with a window . Unfortunatly , it is very hard to figure out if you bought a new one or old one when your buying them.I 'm not sure how trusting it is to buy another one of these machines as they seem to be crafted for 10 cents and sold for 300 $ I 'm thinking spending the extra 100 $ for the Ipod might be a smart idea at this time . You get a 1 year warrenty and you will not have to worry about this jack problem , at least nothing ive heard of anyway.Buyer Beware ... Think and read this before you buy the Zen .
 Forget how this unit works because it has a basic design flaw that will drive users crazy ! The front cover has a release button that allows removal of the front cover to access the removable battery . Forget about the release button . You do n't need it . just tap the lower left hand corner of the case and the cover pops open ! Convenient , huh ? No way ! This design flaw is a total pain in the ass ! And it 's not just my unit . I tested two other new , out of the box units and both did the same thing . Simply bad design and no quality testing . Do yourself a favor and avoid this unit at all costs unless you do n't mind continually closing the case after it has popped open on it 's own .
 Simply not as friendly for functional as an iPod . Even better , iPod integrates perfectly with iTunes so that managing music is a snap .
 The headphone jack on my Zen Xtra stopped working day 40 -LRB- 1st day on a 7-day cruise , no less ! -RRB- While Creative did replace the unit , why have n't they recalled all Zen 's ? This is my second Nomad -- I had a Nomad 2.0 20GB , but it 's screen stopped working . Creative refused to repair unless I paid $ 105 , so -LRB- silly me -RRB- I bought a new unit instead.Never again , Creative !
 After roughly a year of fairly reliable use , I 've also fallen prey to the faulty headphone jack . Now i 'm wondering what to do with an item that I paid nearly $ 400 because the limited warranty conveniently ran out eight or nine months ago -LRB- `` limited '' being somewhat of an understatement -RRB- . No one should ever have to consider `` fixing '' , and possibly further marring something they paid that much money for.A month ago I would 've given this item four stars . After coming here and seeing so many people with the exact same problem that Creative continues to neglect , I 'm outright angry that I 'm not alone .
 What 's going on Creative Labs ? Is it a coincidence that I no longer can get any of your Nomad Zen Xtras -LRB- worst name ever -RRB- at Best Buy and now the 60GB Nomad Xtra is `` sold out '' or more likely `` discontinued '' at the almighty Amazon.com ? hmmmmm ...
 I bought this product about four months ago . I really liked it . It was a little bulky , but I have never been too worried about the style of a gadget . It did everything I wanted it to do
 This player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the Creative MediaSource file transfer issues.Zen Good points :1 . I achieved my basic objective ; my entire CD collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more .2 . Most MP3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous . The Zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if I am not listening for the progress from one track to the next I do n't even notice the click.Flaws :1 . Creative MediaSource software is OK to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but I used MusicMatch to rip my CDs before I bought the Zen -LRB- 278 CDs ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 Gb of music all ripped at 128bps -RRB- and guess what ? MediaSource did not recognize my tags ! My choices at that moment were to manually re-tag my music or re-rip using MediaSource . I do n't think so . BTW , if you * are * ripping your CDs , MediaSource accesses the CDDB music catalog over the Internet and the few CDs I experimented with all provided good quality -LSB- correct & uncluttered -RSB- tag information .2 . Despite most reviewers giving kudos to the Zen for music quality , I experienced a flaw using EAX . After about 45 mins of listening there was audible static in the player . When I turned EAX off the static disappeared . When I turned EAX back on the static was also not present . Creative are * the * sound people for computers , I ca n't understand why EAX would introduce static . Is EAX faulty ? Is my unit defective ? Was I just unlucky at that moment ? Was it a full moon that night ? I have n't figured it out yet .3 . MediaSource is an application with serious user interface flaws . Do not underestimate this in your purchase decision . Many reviewers refer to it as `` clunky '' or `` difficult '' - heed their warnings . Some Amazon reviewers say it corrrupted their music files ; I did n't use it long enough to know , but clearly you need to use it with caution .4 . The Zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk -LRB- they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched -RRB- . In other words , the Zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection -LRB- see point 1 . for some sizing information -RRB- . My goal of using it as a music player * and * data storage device has not been met ; do n't make the same mistake .5 . The Zen does not have a Stop button ! You can stop playback by pressing 2 buttons , first the Pause button , then the `` Next Track '' or `` Previous Track '' button . But this is * not documented * in the Zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the CD version . To discover this I had to read about 10 online reviews -LRB- with many complaints about the lack of Stop button -RRB- before I found one reviewer who was smart enough to both figure it out & document it .6 . The Zen NX battery requires the AC adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by USB cable ; this is not tragic , but USB recharging would be a convenient -LRB- additional -RRB- choice . If you are buying a Zen Xtra check whether the battery recharges via USB ; it does not on the Zen NX .7 . MediaSource did not install on my personal notebook . It referred to a `` Microsoft Jet Database Engine '' error and the install program suggested I download a service pack from the MS website to fix the problem ; I did that and re-installed the software but had the same error . Creative provided e-mail support ; I followed their advice but that failed , too . I experimented with installing MediaSource on 2 other computers at home and it worked fine . So it is probably `` just bad luck '' on my part that the personal notebook I own had this install error . However , it did motivate me to find a work-around solution.Third Party Software To The RescueAfter much frustration -LRB- above -RRB- I found the Notmad Explorer ; cute product name for software that resolves virtually all of the Creative MediaSource FILE TRANSFER & ORGANIZATION problems . I am not associated with the company , I am not providing a URL , but search for NotMad and you should find it pretty easily . This provides drag & drop transfers of music between the computer & Zen ; each time it transfers music to the Zen it asks if you want to generate a playlist ; it allows playlists developed in other software to be transferred to the Zen -LRB- . m3u files are used by most mp3 players like MusicMatch and Winamp , but not Creative - without Notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists -RRB- ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - Creative or any other company - all my 12.5 Gb of music were transferred to the Zen with correct tags - hooray ! Notmad has other features too , but this is not an advertisement so please see the company 's web site for more information ... Conclusion : If I knew then what I know now I would have paid the extra to get an iPod & avoided the Zen . Given that I already have the Zen the only reason I am happy with it is because of the Notmad software . And I am hoping the static I heard when using EAX was a blip ... To summarize , I am using the Creative Zen as a mobile device ; I am using MusicMatch to rip & catalog -LRB- and if I choose , download -RRB- music ; I am using Notmad Explorer to move music & playlists between the Zen & my computer . The only Creative software I am using is the device driver -LRB- s -RRB- .
 I got the 40gb jukebox zen xtra for christmas . So , I 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out . I called creative and they said to send it in and they would decide if it in warranty . It 'll take 10-15 business days for them to decide form when they get it . Nothing but hassle with this company . What kind of product goes out within a month ?
 Having purchased this player as a gift in Dec-03 , I was dissapointed when headphone jack became severely intermittent after 4 months of `` careful use '' . Since I am in technical electronics -LRB- and player was out of warranty period -RRB- , I opened it up to find the problem . The Headphone jack is only secured by three small solder pads , and the metal pad for the left channel had broken between the board and jack , and the right channel pad was almost broken . This jack is not reinforced on the circuit board , so it easily breaks . My repair was to remove the cheap internal jack , and then solder a flexible extention cable through the original jack hole to an external female jack -LRB- available from most electronic shops -RRB- . Works great now ... but looks a bit strange with this cable coming out of it . Future plugs and unplugs of the jack will not place any strain on the player , Creative Labs ... fess up to the poor design , and fix these players that many others are having issues with .
 I love my Zen Xtra 40GB - well at least I loved my Xtra . The player is great , except for one major detail - the shoddy quality of the headphone jack . IT WILL FAIL ! If you get lucky it will still be under warranty . If you are n't expect to pay at least $ 40 for the clowns at Creative to fix it . If you think I am just flaming them , check out their forums .
 I 've had my Zen for over 4 years now -LRB- hard to believe I 've had it that long -RRB- . I still have n't filled up the memory on it , I 've never had a day 's trouble with it , and it 's easy to use . I 'm starting to find it a bit bulky now in comparison to some of the smaller , sleeker-looking players on the market , but I still have the attitude `` if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it '' . The zen is superb , it 's reliable , it 's solid and easy to use , and I just do n't see the point in changing to an ipod purely for aesthetics . I love my zen , and I would n't be without it .
 I took my zen back after a week of problems.It 's really fussy about id3 tags , which is a problem if some of you collection did n't come _ directly _ off cd . I fiddled around with various automated taggers , but never got things working to satisfaction . The player crashes every 3 to 8 hours of operation and frequently takes 20 + minutes rebuilding it 's database of tracks after a crash -LRB- i hear this process is made long by incomplete id3 tags -RRB- . Two days ago the left headphone channel started cutting out , as it has for many other reviewers . That was the last straw . I 'm over it , thinking about a rio Karma or nothing at all .
 The price looks good do not be fooled.Mine also worked ok for the first 6 months reguardless that the software would not transfer a portion of my music . The death of this unit was when I had fixed the ID3 tages to get all my music to be able to be tranfered to the player , I removed the music library and then reloaded the repaired lib at this point the player will not play anything corectly . parts of tracks play and parts are garbled.This is true when playing over headphone jack usb to pc will still play normal . This is not the same problem as the phone jack breaking like happens to 2/3 of the players .
 I bought the Creative Nomad Zen Xtra 30Gb around the start of the new year . By mid May , the player would get hung on the EAX Soound screen and would n't fully turn on . Since it was only about a month out of its warrenty , they would not help with a costumer service line or anything , but I had to send an email to the company . Well , after much hassel and faulty instructions about how to `` update my firmware '' I ended up having to send my product into the company in TEXAS so they could fix it . Now , not only was it a problem because I could n't listen to my music anymore , but I also had to pay a hefty $ 40 fee just to return it , and if there was more to the problem than just my firmware , I would have to pay another $ 40 ! About three weeks later , they sent back a refurbished 40Gb player that works just fine , but now I have the task of uploading almost 25Gb of music back on . Speaking for myself , they were not helpful what so ever , the warrenty sucked and should have been extended so things like this do n't happen , and they tried to buy me off with a bigger player.One a side note , this player is HUGE ! I know you are getting alot of memory and all , but this is in no way sleek or descrete . I ca n't fit it into any of my pockets or just carry it around because it it bigger than my hand ! It may not look so big in pictures , but do n't be fooled !
 I loved this thing until 2 1/2 months after purchase ... The phone jack is not working properly . Now I am very disappointed . Glad I got a 2 year replacement plan from Best Buy . Recommend you protect yourself if you buy this product . I do n't think the phone jack problem is a rare one from what I have read here .
 the warrenty on this device is only 3 months and it breaks quite quickly . the cover kept popping off and when it broke creative said the warrenty ran out
 When I originally bought this item I was thoroughly pleased with its ease of use , generous screen size and scroll wheel but within a month the unit ceased to work.I contacted Creative Labs and they gave me an RMA . I sent the RMA back to them and then heard nothing from them anymore . Then I contacted them again and they created a new RMA and then sent me to fill this one out . I did and when they received it they claimed it was past the expiration date . I explained to them that this second RMA was necessary only because the first one was n't processed but they would have none of it . As of right now they have both my defunct mp3 player and no replacement in sight.DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT BUY FROM CREATIVE.Their customer service is atrocious and the mp3 player is flimsy in spite of appearing otherwise.ADDED ON MARCH 17TH -- 2005 . Still nothing from Creative . Worst company ever.ADDED ON NOVEMBER 12THStill nothing from Creative . Are they the worst company ever ? Well ... there is Enron . But Creative is n't far behind .
 What a junk . Every time NOMAD thinks the file is corrupt the OS freezes . The only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode . So if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen OS you ca n't use NOMAD until you get home . After OS froze twice on me in the subway I returned the jukebox .
 DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT -- I took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended . Nearly 4000 songs went up in smoke . The software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other SOUND BLASTER products , which is very dumb .
 I just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason . In a quick summation , here is what I found . + the memory -LRB- 40 gb -RRB- is staggering . I had downloaded about 1000 songs and had room for another 9000 ! It may have taken several years to fill this up . + I had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit + Screen was good , easy to read + / - Sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great . - The software that came with it was tough to load . I got weird messages about it not being ok 'd by microsoft -LRB- or something like that -RRB- , then I thought it failed to load , then it loaded . - The top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch . Not good if you 're taking this traveling . the top did not fit well into the unit . -LRB- felt defective -RRB- - the cover that came with it did n't fit very well - the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage . I was n't sure how long it would take before it would break . - this DID NOT feel like quality construction and I was n't sure how long it would last .
 Other reviewers have covered some key points - the good voice , timely turn instructions , the bizarre and completely undocumented bracket.So I wo n't repeat all that . What no-one seems to have mentioned is , that you ** can not ** use this device for solo driving . The problem seems to be with Bluetooth . On my HP 2215 , I set the receiver on my dashboard and it syncs up with satellites pretty quickly -LRB- it does n't slide around at all my dash BTW -RRB- . Then I set a destination , plug an earphone into the iPaq , put it in my left ear and put the PDA in my pocket . What I expect is to get timely turning instructions that I can hear clearly even over the car stereo . And that 's what I get . And it * would be * perfect except for two potentially lethal problems
 Can you imagine . ?? when I tried to find points of Interest near Yosemite . It said No POI found . . Garmin has Mapsource that is far better than Navteq.It has the options to create automatic , point-to-point routes on your PC without need of a GPS so that you can create multiple waypoints , routes before your transfer it to your device .
 The product in theory is great -- and is great as long as it works ok . However , if you have a problem with it , you will be out of luck trying to get any support from HP . Establishing the connection between the GPS system and the iPAQ and also the partnership between the iPAQ and your PC or notebook can be finicky . In my case , it worked ok the first time I used it but then later the GPS , iPAQ , and PC refused to communicate with each other . I wanted to re-install my software and start all over again but the airlines managed to lose the bag that had my software and documentation . Nearly all manufacturers have web sites offering software downloads , updates , patches , etc. for their products . Not HP for this product . If you lose your manual or installation software , forget about the convenience of finding replacements online . HP 's support link tells you there are no downloads available and to contact the vendor where you purchased the Nav System . I highly recommend that you check HP 's web site for online support before purchasing this or any HP product to make sure they actually offer support.The concept of an accessory GPS unit for my iPAQ seemed like a great idea . However , after this I would only consider a dedicated self-contained GPS unit from a manufacturer that supports their products.One more comment that I almost forgot . My HP GPS System was obsolete when I took it out of the box . The first thing they wanted me to do was pay for updated maps .
 I have bought 2 of these items for my 2 cars , but it burns the batteries every time ! It even burns the phone , sometimes.Ranieri
 Recently , I went and bought this CD Player , i was going to geta ... Sony one but ended up with this one instead cuz ' it was cheap u know ? Well , this one I bought did n't even have antiskip protection at all ! It skips whenever I go and it eat batteries like crazy ! I had wasted over 10 batteries within a month . What a piece of junk ! I do n't think this product differs either so I recommend not buying it and get a better product . In fact , I just going to get a new CD Player from KOSS which I think will be better . This is not worth your time , and the cd players ugly too !
 I purchased this product just a few months ago and it 's broken already . It was used at a desk with ear phones so it was n't moved , bounced or anything you would expect a personal player to withstand.It skipped at the slightest bump and went through batteries like crazy.I now have a different CD player and would not recommend this to anyone .
 This is NOT Koss at its best . I recently bought its newest model and trashed this one . Do n't bother buying it , a good price-bad deal ! Buy the new one!Recommended Manufactors
 OK , people , all I have to say is this thing sux . The price may be low , but the thing is just plain crappy . And I though CD players were supposed to play music ...
 I am very computer literate . The software provided is not for use with the product . I tried to download drivers so my computer could recognize the camera but had no luck . There are other identical mini cameras like this one packaged under different names . Do n't buy this one .
 ThisSanDisk Sansa e250 2 GB MP3 Player with microSD Expansion Slot -LRB- Black -RRB- came to me as a gift , and was much appreciated , but it 's not my favorite player . I use many other SanDisk products , which may be why I expected better performance.The positives are plenty
 The first one I received the SD card slot lock did not work . The second one literally took 5 to 10 minutes to boot up . I returned it again to Discount Jungle -LRB- Amazon Seller -RRB- and they said they would not charge me the 15 % restocking fee which they did anyhow.All in all , I would n't own another Sandisk MP3 even if they would give me one for free ! I 'm out $ 10.00 for two return shipments and another $ 10.00 restocking fee . Nothing to restock at Discount Jungle , send the piece of junk back to Sandisk !!! Save some headaches and buy something different ! Do a Google search for Sansa View slow start up , boot , or lockup.At least the FM Radio was nice ... that 's why it has a two star rating . I 'd sure hate to see how well the re-manufactured units work .
 When my e280 met an unfortunate end involving water , I had to purchase a new MP3 player . I was hoping I could just replace my trusty e280 with the same model , but apparently , no one carries it anymore , having been replaced with the View . After test-driving the Fuze month -LRB- hated it , but that 's another story -RRB- , I tried the View . It 's like the e280 's snotty little brother that does n't want to cooperate!First , however , the good : * The View is lighter and thinner -LRB- though broader & wider -RRB- than the e280 . Nice ! * The screen is bigger - nice if you watch videos -LRB- I do n't -RRB- or have photos -LRB- again , do n't -RRB- on your MP3 player.Now the bad ... -LRB- I know , only 2 good ! -RRB- * The smooth wheel * should * be an improvement over the raised plastic wheel of the e280 , but it 's not . On both the Fuze and the View , after only a couple of weeks of use , the smooth scroll wheel started sticking , requiring two -LRB- and sometimes 3 -RRB- fingers just to scroll . Not good . * Battery hog ! I usually get less than 8 hours on this thing , listening only to music or audiobooks . My e280 would usually give me at least 1.5 days , usually 2-3 , listening to the same . * Glitchy as all get out . It seems to hate drag & drop AND syncing with MediaMonkey or WinAmp . I do not use iTunes -LRB- worst software ev-er ! -RRB- , and very much prefer drag & drop , but I 'll grudgingly agree to syncing if I have to . But bratty lil ' View did n't really want either . It would accept my drag & drop , sure , but audiobooks could only be found in the Albums - not the Audiobook - folder . I triple-checked my ID3 tagging , tried syncing via both MM and WinAmp , but View stuck its tongue out at me and kept putting the files where it wanted to . Really not good . * Mike placement & recording both stink . I 'm a freelance journalist and loved using my e280 to record interviews -LRB- much better sound quality than my old digital recorder , too -RRB- . With the e280 , I could hook it up to the lanyard and wear it around my neck as I interviewed in crowds ; the mike was a the top by the lanyard setting . The View 's mic is on the side , and there is no lanyard - bye-bye , on-the-fly recording ! Playback of audio recordings picked up every movement of the player , which I imagine is due to the lighter weight of the View - but it could n't pick up audio three feet away like the e280 did . * Rewind/FF is sketchy . It FF better than the Fuze - click once to go the next track , hold down to FF through the track - but not better than the e280 . I foudn the View to FF/RW at about 5 secs per shot - no more , no less . The e280 would FF/RW more if you held it longer . -LRB- The Fuze FF/RW was a joke . -RRB- Last year , I purchased an iPod -LRB- I think it was Nano -RRB- and a few weeks later , they released the higher memory version for the same price . I returned the older model and got the newer , and was greatly disappointed with the `` new '' model - it lacked a lot of the useability of the old model -LRB- mostly that it did n't require me to use that bloated piece o ' junk called iTunes , and the new one would n't even do drag & drop - I was forced to use said bloated software -RRB- and was not an improvement . Sad to say , my experience with the View -LRB- and the Fuze to a lesser degree -RRB- was much the same.I 'll be returning the View and trying the Clip next . Despite its lack of a MicroSD slot , I 'm hoping the Clip will give me back my Sansa joy . If not , I 'm going to have get a refurb or eBay e280 .
 The instructions are bad . As mentioned is someone else 's review the user is directed to place files in folders on the Sansa View that do not exist . Supposedly one can drag and drop WMV files right into the device and they will play . That has not been my experience . SanDisk does provide the SanDisk Media Converter for download but it is painfully slow to transfer/convert video and will only do so if the Sansa View is plugged in . The software puts it directly on the device which is a one way street . I found that I could not then copy the videos back to my PC for later use -LRB- i.e. create a stash of videos to use on the Sansa View -RRB- . I also discovered that the Sansa View , while offering to display Album Art will totally screw up some of the art . I have several CD worth loaded and find that sometimes the art displayed is from a completely different album . I also tried using the godawful Media Converter software to load photos . Within the software are controls to supposedly rotate the picture for optimum display on the Sansa View screen with a little preview display included . The rotation was completely bollixed after transfer to the device . Everything was off by 90 degrees clockwise . In this instance I was able to copy the folder to my PC and fix the problem with other graphics software and then put them back on the Sansa View . Hopefully SanDisk will come up with firmware and software fixes for these problems , but until then I really can not recommend this product to anyone .
 I was a latecomer to the MP3 scene but I finally gave in about a year and a half ago when I picked up the Sandisk Sansa 8gb . The thing was a headache right out of the box . The software was useless . I could n't for the life of me get it to work without crashing or freezing my Sansa . I gave up on that and went with the drag and drop method which was much simpler and faster and , for the most part , that worked fine.However I quickly discovered that if I wanted to add videos and photos to my Sansa , I HAD to use the software . If you drag and drop videos or photos , they wo n't be viewable . It makes absolutely no sense , but I gave the software another shot with no luck . I finally emailed customer support and they pointed me to a download of an older version of the software and , YAY ! It worked ! And about 5 minutes later it stopped working . My Sansa started sporadically disconnecting and reconnecting , interrupting the transfer and forcing me to restart the process again . Extremely frustrating.All that said , if you can deal with the frustration , the Sansa performs FAIRLY well . . I had a handful of incidents where the unit would just freeze up for no apparent reason and the delay when deleting a file or making play lists , for example , was horrid and made the features not even worth using unless you did n't mind wasting copious amounts of time.But when it was n't lagging or crashing , it worked fine . It was a nice , small size and fit into my pocket without being noticeable . The wheel and buttons were responsive and worked well , for the most part . Though I was constantly annoyed at the inability to easily browse through my music the way I want to . I tend to arrange my folders in such a way that I can easily find what I 'm looking for , and with the Sansa there is no option to just browse the hard drive and folder structure . It 's very limited and close-minded , considering how easy it would be to add such a feature.I now own a far superior -LRB- and far more expensive -RRB- Archos 5 160gb and though it 's bigger , it is a beautiful piece of electronic goodness . I 'll never buy another Sandisk media player again . Avoid !!
 While advertised as eight hours of play time , the player did n't make a two hour trip once in the three or four weeks we had it.Now just waiting to get the refund we 've been notified we will receive so we can try something else , hopefully something that will live up to its advertisement this time .
 After about 3 months things started going down hill really fast . After leaving it in the car on a summer day something went wrong with the with the power saver . I 'd charge it over night and the next morning it would be dead . I 'd listen to it for 5 minutes , turn it off , then turn it back on and it would be at half power . Recently the screen broke . That just gave me a good reason to get rid of it.Trust me , keep looking .
 I got this player for Christmas and it immediately had bad screen problems , the LCD screen would freeze or make thick dark lines . The rewind bar does n't work either ! you can rewind it and the seek bar will show it rewinding , but it 'll resume right where it left off ! I only give this player 2stars just because it 's ease .
 I bought a sansa view 8gb from Sold by
 If you have ever had an iPod you will kick yourself for buying this player . Replaced my iPod Nano because the battery life was fading . Unfortunately , there is no way to get the advertised 35 hours of advertised battery life . You should expect 6 to 8 hours.It is crashy . It occationally corrupts the tracks when it crashes . The screen is average . Getting podcsts to show up as podcasts has been frustrating . Forget about video podcasts . You will be spending a significant amount of time formatting them . Of course , you should expect even worse battery life.The reason the iPod Nano is $ 130 ; it works !
 I purchased this player last August and it worked fine for 4 months , even though I did n't play it much . My intent was to use it primarily on plane flights . Suddenly and for no reason , I was unable to easily insert the earphones into the player . With a little effort , I was finally able to insert the earphone , but could not get any sound.I contacted Sandisk and was very disappointed with their response . The player has a 1-year warranty but it 's very apparent that Sandisk is attempting to discourage replacing defective products by making purchasers jump through hoops to test the product and prove it is defective rather than immediately fixing or replacing it . If the player wo n't work as advertised , why should I be inconvenienced as a result.In addition , a senior service person was supposed to contact me about the problem , but has not done so . I would never purchase a Sandisk product in the future -- too difficult to deal with if there 's a warranty problem !
 I 'm on my third Sansa View right now ... The main problem that happened to the replaced two was probably heat . When left in the car -LRB- even under the cover of glove compartment -RRB- , it appears that the Sansa View gets too hot and the rotation wheel expands to a degree that it detaches from the sensors inside . The same scenario happened to both of my previous Sansa Views . They were left in the car 's glove compartment one day when it was a bit too hot and the rotation wheel stopped working -LRB- which renders the unit unusable -RRB- . I 've had other MP3 players before and had even left them on my car seat and they never had this problem.The first issue can be counted as my fault for leaving it in the heat . But another issue with this unit is driving me crazy . I listen to audio books alot . Some of these MP3 files are 1 hour long files . Typically , Sansa View remembers the playing position and resumes the book where I last paused it or turned it off . But sometimes , it resumes the position on the wrong file -LRB- like a previous file/chapter -RRB- , in which case I had to fast forward it to my `` bookmark '' . And Sansa View does NOT have a `` fast '' fast-forwarding feature . I literally had to hold down the fast-forward button for several minutes . That was very annoying . Playing music is fine , but for audio books I 'd try something else next time.On the side note , I do like SanDisk 's return policies and their speed in processing my two replacements . That was good .
 A new 8GB Sansa View , tested with the original firmware -LRB- do n't remember what it was -RRB- and 01.01.06 A . In both cases , repeatedly playing of 128kbps MP3 eats fully charged battery in 8 hours . No extra micro SD memory and no earphones -LRB- that is , no audio payload at all -RRB- . I would understand if it played for 30 hours instead of 35 . I would even understand 25 hours . At least , there would be some connection with the reality . But not 8 . Not 4 -LRB- four ! -RRB- times worse than claimed . Dear Sansisk , you are liers . Your reputation is getting down below the ground level.I do n't believe it is a bug in the firmware , because when playing it noticeably warms up -- very slightly , but quite noticeably . It means the player consumes at least 1 watt of power -- just my rough estimation , but definitely not 0.1 watt . When it consumes 1 watt of power , the fully charged battery must keep at least 35 Watt/hour . In my laptop it 's a 71 w/h extended battery and it 's very heavy . Do you believe such a small thing like Sansa View can keep 35 w/h ? I do n't -- it simply impossible.I do n't care much about this money and will keep using it mostly in my car , with the external power . I 'm too busy and too lazy to send it back . But I want people to know
 This item is one of the worse I have seen in the Sansa family . I have had all the Sansa E200 series mp3 players and those froze at times when viewing video . Good sound when you use better headphones . The only thing that is good about this mp3 player is the large view screen . The conversion software always freezes after the video file has been converted meaning that you have to Ctrl < Alt < Delete to shut down the program . As a ` techie ' , I recommend that you do n't buy this item . Oh ! one more thing ! Do not order via the free shipping that Amazon offers . It 's just ` standard ' meaning you could have you item delivered to you way past the scheduled mailing time or not at all . It 's been a month now and I still have n't recieved my original order alhough Amazon was gracious to resend the item , but I had to get it sent to my job which amazingly got there much faster through the same type shipping . Imagine that !
 I am thourghly disappointed in this Sansas View . It deleted songs all the time wont keep them on wont connect to computer , if it keeps them it puts them on 3 or 4 times and when you detelted the dups.it deletes them all .
 IVE HAD TO SEND TWO OF THESE BACK NOW . THEY SHUT OFF AND WONT TURN BACK ON . THESE ARE DISCOUNTINUED AND I BELEIVE THE BATTERIES ARE SHOT IN THEM.I WOULDNT BUY ONE !!
 Got this about 6 weeks ago . One week into it , the device started getting `` stuck '' on rewind . It 's supposed to stop rewinding when you release pressure on the wheel , which it still sometimes does successfully . About half the time , though , it gets stuck on rewind and the only thing I can do is turn it off , none of the other functions -LRB- like play or stop -RRB- work.Newer problem
 Well , I only write reviews for things I dont like enough . Otherwise dont bother.I previously had a sansa and it worked great . I dropped and broke it . The best thing about sansa is Rhapsody on the go feature and the radio feature . Unlike say an iPod , I can just listen to all kinds of music for $ 14.99 or something.But this new one keeps giving me the wror message ` Your tracks are not synchronized ' . I then have to deauthorize device and computer , re-authorize , re-format , restore factory settings , to get it to work . Mega pain in the behind.Dont know if the fault is with Rhapsody or with Sansa , but I am seriously looking for other options for my music .
 Player was defective . After charging battery , I turn it on and while attempting to download an audio-book , the unit `` locked up '' , All functions ceased , and I could n't turn it off
 I organize all my files into folders . However this device ignores my classification and sort all files by artist and album . There is no way to configure the device so I can browse my music through my folders.Moreover , there is no easy way to create a playlist . To do that you have to install the software that cames whith it and you can not add new musics to the playlist in another computer . All playlists editions must be done in the same computer . This is a huge limitation for me because I use a lot of different computers -LRB- home , office , notebook , ... -RRB- . I have n't bought an Ipod because it has the same limitations . Futhermore , the software that comes with it is terrible , much worst than Itunes.So if you organize your files into folder and would like to use this classification in your mp3 player , and if you do n't want to buy an Ipod because you will be tied on in a specific computer , you SHOULD NOT BUY this device .
 This is my second Sansa e series mp3 player . The first was a Rhapsody edition and lasted about 4 months . I blamed the short life on the R series and since I liked the way it looked and worked thought I would try it again with the e280 . I loaded up my 8 gig with about 7 gig of music and now all I see is Sandisk - a brief flash of `` reading '' and then back to the Sandisk logo screen . It will do that for hours and hours on end . My computer does n't even recognize it anymore . When I first plugged it in this evening the screen did come up to play music , but when I tried to , it said that the player was empty . I have n't tried contacting SanDisk . I think I will just cut my losses and write them off . The only Sansa product I 've ever loved was the discontinued M series players - they 're few and far between and highly sought after .
 I hate this thing . It worked for about a month and that is it . It has driver problems . After 5 hours on the phone with Rhapsody , 2 hrs . with Sansa it still does not work . I have downloaded everything for this . It does not work . Waste of money , time . Very disappointed .
 This player was great ... in the beginning . I 'm not an active user of MP3 players , and only use them on road trips to avoid carting a bunch of CDs along with me , which happens a few times a year . After the first year of owning this player , the scroll wheel decided it did n't want to work properly anymore . Keep in mind that the only way to move through menu selections is with the scroll wheel , and when one day it decided not to work properly , it made it very difficult to scroll to any selection . It just bounces back and forth on the menu when scrolling in any direction . For instance , if I was scrolling down , it runs upward and downward on the menu in a frantic manner ; and vice versa . It 's very frustrating to actually land on a desired menu item and has caused me to write this player off as a disposable hunk of junk . I would not recommend any SanDisk player that uses a scrolling wheel to anybody , and would specifically advise you to not purchase this item . However , since I do n't use the video features of this product , I 'm going to purchase the Sansa 8MB clip and try again
 Sansaview 8 GB doesnt support 8GB external MicroSd card even with the latest F/W . When plugging an 8Gb external microsd all the media from sd card is displayed twice in Sansaview . Forums have reported this problem in 2008 and this issues is still not fixed by Sansa even in the latest F/W . If you connect a 4Gb micro SD this issue goes away.If we remove the multiple listing of same items , I would love this player.The play button automaticaly aligns for landscape photo/video view . After I upgraded to latest F/W could see most of the videos , the firmware which came alongwith SansaView 1.01 could only play audio without showing the videos.To get the device upgraded need to connect in MSC mode which is not visible from the settings and the trick is to keep the `` Previous '' button pressed in `` hold '' mode while connecting the cable to laptop .
 Its just a durable product with great sound quality , but do n't expect anything more from it . The ear phones are too big for my years and the device is not easy to use . You will need to use a software to convert your videos to be compatible with this device . The only good thing is that you do n't need any software to load songs in to this player , however , the folders that you have on your hard disk will not appear on the player . This is what I do n't like . I would like to have a player which will let me create my own music folders and not create the default ones . I disliked iPod because of iTunes , but now I feel iPod is much better than this even though iTunes is not so easy to use , its at least easier than running this device . No wonder , the product is priced so cheap .
 This was a pretty good product until the damn thing just stopped working and just froze up when you tried to turn it on . I had it just over a year and after turning it on the device just went into bootup mode , never actually coming on . As long as I had it , it would frequently exhibit the same behavior . The only thing that would help was to take out the battery out and back in . Finally in the end , that did not help at all.The durability of the Sansa 's line is poor at best .
 I bought a sansa e280 for myself and have not encountered any troubles , so I decided to buy a View for my boyfriend . Right out of the box , the player would not turn on because the power button was stuck . We tried everything but nothing would happen . The customer service people could not turn it on also , so we exchanged that one . The next one we received at least turned on . We went home to charge it and then tried to start loading media on . Thats where trouble came . For video and pictures , you have to convert the file format by using the sansa downloadable converter . I was able to transfer photos with no problem but we never were able to get video on the player . We tried different files , different computers , and different people and nothing . My boyfriend spoke to the customer representatives and had no luck . I have transferred music , video , and photos to my sansa e280 with no problems , but this player has many problems .
 The player is awful if you are using it to listen to lectures ; it only recognizes 25 minutes of an mp3 . Plus , the fast forward function is EXTREMELY slow -LRB- to fast forward 10 mins would take about 3-4 minutes of holding down the button -RRB- . Otherwise , it plays music fine , though the software on the mp3 player is no where near as nice as what you get with ipods -LRB- e.g. if you pull the headphones out of the jack it will pause the file , or it will remember the exact location in a file where you last left off instead of restarting a file if you turn the player off -RRB- , but on the flip side it is also significantly cheaper.Overall , you get what you pay for .
 Bought two units and after a few months one stopped working . Could get no info from the unit it was dead . Contacted Sandisk and ask for quick replacement . Offered to prepay to secure item would be shipped quick . Was told I did not need this . Item was bad and would be replaced with in a few days . After waiting a full month , I had to phone the Co on Ca . Manager told me the order had not been shipped and this some times happens . Had phoned the supply house in another state and player would be shipped.Worse customer support I have seen . Would not buy another unit from this Co. . Manager I talked with sounded like a brain dead stoner . Might be why orders get lost.Order with caution and if you require replacement , prepare to follow up daily .
 I got the View for Christmas for my daughter after her Sansa Fuze died after several years of heavy use . It would never charge right out the box using both the USB or the electric charger I have for my own Fuse . I went online and tried everything the sandisk site said-nothing worked . Got the online chat who informed me that I had to use e-mail to resolve the issue since the View is a `` Legacy '' item . Sent an e-mail and never got a response . Their customer service department needs a lot ... of help . On the plus side , sent it back to Amazon who gave A + + + refund service . Thanks Amazon !
 I purchased the View to replace my old Sansa e200 series player . It quit working after the pc jack soldier joint separated from the board . The View is a sleek looking machine , has good user interface and sound quality . The problem is getting the thing to charge . Sometimes I plug it into my computers USB port and the screen will indicate it is charging , but later I find the battery totally discharged and the player is unable to power up . I have tried flash upgrades , different computers , wall chargers and different cables without success . Sometimes I can reset the player and then it will charge , but even when the battery indicate a full charge I never get the playing time claimed by the manufacturer.I have spent hours looking for solutions on Sansa 's support site as well as numerous forums on the web . What I 've learned from this is that is that there are others experiencing charging problems like mine . As well as a host of other problems too.SanDisk has been the preferred brand of memory cards for my DSLR camera for years . Because of this good experience I chose the Sansa MP3 players . But I will never buy another one . Buyer beware !
 The Sansa View 8GB I received was faulty . The battery would not hold a charge and/or the player would not turn on . This happened within hours of opening the player packaging and attempting an initial full-charge of the player 's battery . The battery is only chargeable via USB and I tried using a PC and an AC to USB adapter to charge it . There is no hard reset button like I have seen on other players -LRB- namely Cowon brand players -RRB- so it could not simply be reset.I decided to return the product for a refund because it did not seem worth the trouble of waiting for a new -LRB- or repaired -RRB- player . I was not very impressed with the build quality of the player . It felt and looked very prone to scratching or other damage if not treated with extreme care . Furthermore , I found another player that suited my personal needs and desires better than the Sansa View .
 I recently purchased a used 8 GB View . It works well as a 8 GB View but will not support an 32 GB SD card . The literature on the internet said that it would support a 32 GB card .
 I was very happy with my Sansa View , until all of a sudden my micro SD chip was missing . I could n't imagine someone stealing just a chip , but then when I tried to put a new one in , I noticed it would only be installed for a second or two before the spring inside the unit would expel the chip . It would actually launch it up 4-6 inches ! So now I know my original chip is somewhere at the gym , certainly vacuumed up by now.It 's a great player , but check to make sure your SD card does n't come out too easily or just send it back !
 I had to return this player twice and finally had to keep the third player as the warranty period expired . This is because I wanted it to work , -LRB- really , really -RRB- and did all I could before giving up on it . It 's a cool little mp3 player and , when it works , the sound quality is great , the screen is very sharp , and it has an appealing and easy to use interface.However it just does n't work . Some may remember this player was originally billed as the `` Rhapsody '' player by Sandisk . It never , ever worked with Rhapsody , and Sandisk never acknowledged the problem or offered a solution , a total abdication of corporate resposibility to their clients . After numerous hours dowloading firmware , and re-booting , re-setting and returning to the store and trying again , I finally had to accept that this player , although a hugely appealing concept with great potential , would never work . I now have a very expensive , -LRB- $ 140 + tax -RRB- portable fm radio , which I really love by the way.Sandisk 's solution to this tale of woe , was to simply drop the `` Rhapsody player '' from the name and continue selling . If you do any research at all , you will find the message boards filled with countless clients complaining of the same difficulties
 Nice player except the microSD card fails to be recognized anymore . The problem is n't the card -LRB- I 've tried several -RRB- , it IS the Player . The disappointing machine just fails to recognize that it even has a card slot . The expansion card slot is meaningless . And what with an appalling 90-DAY WARRANTY , you can see Sansa has little faith in their own products . It is really to be looked at as disposable . Get it really , REALLY cheap , or get something else . The rest of the machine operates fine and it pretty reasonably intuitive . But ... but , the expansion card issue is a massive , strange failure . I would n't recommend this -LRB- or perhaps any SanDisk product . This just SHOULD NOT happen .
 This was my first mp3 player so i did n't neccessarily want anything fancy , just something with a decent sized screen . It worked pretty good for about a year . Then it began to randomly turn off . Usually when this happened i could turn it back on within a few minutes but this too ceased happening . I 've now had it close to a year and a half and it can not hold a charge at all . This would be fine if I only wanted to listen to it while it was charging , however I prefer my mp3 player to be portable . Do not buy this unless you prefer temporary dependability out of your electronics .
 This is an atrocious player if you are interested in listening to podcasts or audiobooks . The problem is that the player 's fast-forward function is unbelievably slow . The fast forward also does not speed up no matter how long you hold down the button . If you 're trying to get to a spot in a 5 minute song , this is annoying ; if you 're trying to find a spot in an hour-long chapter or podcast , it 's a deal-breaker . The only way that this problem will be fixed will be if Sansa offers a firmware update , but this problem has apparently existed for years and still has not been addressed . You can google `` sansa view fast forward slow '' or something similar and see the results . I strongly recommend saving yourself the headache and trying a different player . I 've tried a different Sansa product , the Fuze , two times in the past , and I found the player quite good for audiobooks or podcasts , except that both broke after about 3 to 4 months of use . This is definitely the last Sansa product for me . After some research I think I 'm going to try a Cowon player.One other note , in case you are a masochist and decide to get the player after all -- this screen scratches very easily . The Fuze comes with a cover , which you really should use . The View , for some bizarre reason , does not come with a cover . Yet another reason to avoid this awful product .
 I bought at the end of 2009 and have been meaning to leave a review ever since but have not done so on account of not having anything nice to say about this product . This is about the worst mp3 player on the market . Sound quality is so-so . I can not create or save any playlists . The worst aspect of this player is the battery life . I charged it for one whole day and then when I disconnected it from the power source the battery bar immediately went to RED.Please , please do not waste your money & time on this product . I for one will never buy anythign that has the SanDisk name on it .
 if its not tranferring the wrong music ... its freezing up . . or not liecening properly . . or the device itself sticks -LRB- dail to select with -RRB- . this is my third sansa and will be my last
 NOT at all friendly for a Mac user . The instructions are not at all helpful and tech services are not available on weekends .
 Whatever you do , avoid this product . I was lured by the lower price tag and as a group exercise instructor I needed something to lug all my music around on . I did n't want to lose my ipod -LRB- which I LOVE -RRB- so I got this instead.Well I 've gone through two of them . You name the problem and I 've had it . It has stopped working in the middle of a class I 'm teaching , I 've gotten the white screen of death , the display crapped out and for some reason it just stopped connecting to my computer . If I could give this zero stars I would . It will break if you look at it sideways.Sansa is replacing this for me , for the second time , but I 'm going to buy another ipod instead because I just ca n't rely on this thing at all . I do n't even think its worth giving to someone once the replacement gets here.DON ' T BUY IT , YOU 'LL REGRET IT !
 J'ai achet&eacute; un Sansa View 16gB pour $ 200 CAD il y a deux ans et demie &agrave; peine , et la batterie vient de mourrir . L'estimation pour la r&eacute;paration et le remplecement de la batteire est de $ 80 minimum , vous voyez le topo ? Malgr&eacute; son excellente sonorit&eacute; , je ne recommande pas cet appareil , difficile &agrave; comprendre , parfois il g&egrave;le ... &agrave; &eacute;viter !
 After careful and thorough research , I bought SanDisk MP3 players of varying gigabytes -LRB- 4 , 6 & 8 -RRB- for every member of my family and myself -LRB- five in all -RRB- . After a year , one of them broke . I contacted the company and they basically told me that since the warranty was only for a year , there was nothing they could do . Now another one has broken with the very same problem . Although this one made it two years instead of one , I would expect that for the amount of money these things cost , they 'd last longer than two years.I replaced one of the players with an $ 80 Sony for my daughter and she loves it . I 'm looking at another Sony to replace the broken one for my son . I expect the other three will be breaking down soon and I 'll more than likely replace those with Sony 's . Ignore the good reviews by other purchasers , CNET , etc , and save yourself some money , time , effort , energy and frustration and do n't buy a SanDisk.Update
 When I ordered this item , the Delivery Estimate given to me was July 24 , 2009 - July 30 , 2009 and that was amazing because I needed it for the 31st -LRB- I needed to record an audio session in a business trip -RRB- so I said yeah , this works for me , I 'll place the order with expedited shipping , I paid $ 34.98 for that.I did place the order and to my surprise I received it on August the 2nd -LRB- already too late -RRB- so I contacted the seller and they refunded $ 5 out of the $ 34.98 -LRB- that 's ridiculous -RRB- and I came back to the seller and spoke to the owner of the business , well , he rudely said that there is nothing he can do and that he had already refunded $ 5 -LRB- what am I supposed to do with that when I paid for expedited shipping ? -RRB- Anyway , the mp3 player is beautiful and it gave me a couple of issues but I was able to take care of it , but the shipping sucks , and the way this guy talked to me does not reflect any willingness to provide good customer service/satisfaction , I 'm really upset/disappointed/sad . I do n't recommend you to order anything from this people with expedited shipping .
 Any problem listed in previous reviews , I encountered with mine . At which point I discovered one more weakness of this mp3 player.It does not fare well against a hammer .
 I recently received a refurbished View as a birthday gift , charged it up , set it down a couple of days . When I picked it up I found it was dead . I charged it again , called Sansa about the issue and they agreed it was a bad battery after diagnosing the problem . They also told me the battery is not replaceable and after warranty you throw these units away . Now I need to deal with Buy.com to see if they will give me my money back or replace the unit hopefully with a e200 series . The e200 series has inexpensive replaceable batteries .
 We bought this player for my mother , as I have the same one and love it . But , this player had problems from the get go , being a refurbished model . Sansa support was good , but their fix for the problem only lasted a matter of hours . We eventually had to return it , which was a fast and painless process with Amazon.The player , when it works correctly is great . I ca n't even begin to fill mine up with songs , videos and recordings . The FM recorder is great for lectures , conventions and other occasions . The sound quality is amazing . I also love that , unlike the e200 series you can format and also erase songs directly on the player without using your computer . It also conveniently has a spot for audiobooks and podcasts . Also to note that you can download shows and movies from amazon to play on this player.It was tough giving a star rating as this particular player was broken , but knowing from experience that they can make wonderful mp3 players .
 I 'm frustrated by things that never get fixed on this product . I use the Sansa View to listen to 1-hour mp3 recordings from a class I 'm taking . If I pause the recording in the middle and resume later in the day -LRB- after the Sansa has powered down -RRB- , the recording NEVER starts where I left it !!!!! The most frustrating thing is that I 've reported this problem to SanDisk over 6 months ago and it is never addressed , even though my problem was acknowledged by their tech support.To further complicated things , the fast forward does not accelerate , so when I need to get back to the 30th minute of the recording , I have to hold down the fast-forward button for about five minutes . I also reported this problem over 6 months ago with the same result -- acknowledged by tech support but never addressed.With the amount of firmware updates they 've made , this is clearly a product being beta tested on the customers .
 Worked fine ... until the battery died after one year . You ca n't replace it so essentially the player is useless . Would not recommend .
 The good first
 I bought this unit recently as i wanted a personal media player with good facilities and a large storage capacity -LRB- I bought the 8GB model -RRB- . The unit looks lovely , has a very nice user interface , and excellent sound and picture quality.I bought an 8GB micro SD HC card to increase the total storage to 16GB . Here 's the catch . The firmware in the unit is buggy ; this makes the player unreliable and very annoying to use.After doing a full charge -LRB- 12 hours -RRB- , I loaded up the player from WMP11 in MTP sync mode - this requires you to sync to 2 separate devices
 I purchased this item based on past experience with Sandisk MP3 players . I 've had two discontinued models each of which were priced well below the actual value I received from them . Both were retired after many years of use.Desperate to get another player I researched multiple manufacturers and selected the Sansa View 8GB solely based on its attributes -LRB- 35 hours playing time , 8GB of storage , media card slot -LRB- for expansion -RRB- , compatibility w/Windows Media Player , and the most important
 Despite the many reviews from folks who had to return one or more Sansa Views before getting a functional one , I figured the manufacturer must have cleared up their quality problems to stay in the market . Wrong !!!! My brand new Sansa View 8 totally stopped functioning about 20 minutes into its first use . I 'm very disappointed to have waited for my order to be filled and now must wait again for a replacement . I 'm more than a month into my purchase and I have nothing to show for it but a paid bill.Amazon has not stepped up at all , either . The order was filled by a vendor whom I 've never heard of before . Amazon refers buyers to that vendor 's customer service and takes no part in satisfying the purchaser.Lots of room for improvement on the part of all three providers .
 I purchased this less then one year ago , already the buttons are less responsive . The biggest problem that I have is that it does not play the songs correctly any more . I can hear the music and sometimes the back round singing but not the main singing . This started out as a periodic problem as I was running but now is almost all the time.I am very disappointed in this player .
 Disclaimer - I 've only used this for audio . I have n't tried to watch any videos on it , so I ca n't speak to that functionality.Pro : - Good looking unit , good sound quality - Easy navigation through the menusCon : - It 's not easy to create / maintain playlists on this unit . I 've had other Sansa models before and those were difficult in their own right . This one 's worse . If I 'd known how bad it was before I bought it , I might not have gotten it at all . - Proprietary cable . I know this is a common practice in the electronics industry , but it 's still annoying . Instead of using a common cable -LRB- like a mini-USB -RRB- , they have their own connector . So you have to keep that cable on-hand if you need to recharge the MP3 player . - Locks up once in a while . While playing a song , if I try to skip to the next song or change the volume , sometimes it locks up for 15-20 seconds . It keeps playing whatever it was on , and then eventually reacts to whatever I 'd tried to do previously . It 's minor and rare , but annoying . - The battery died . I plugged it into my computer to recharge it . The battery meter shows 100 % , so I unplugged it . It still thinks that it 's `` charging '' . It was like that for 2 days . I had to hold down the power switch for a few seconds to force it to reboot . Very counter-intuitive ; I would expect that removing the external power source would give it enough information to figure out that it 's no longer charging . Apparently I expect too much.All in all , I do n't think that I would recommend this product .
 I had high expectations for this player . I have the Sandisk m240 and m250 and they have amazing sound quality so I thought , being from Sandisk , it would follow suit . It did n't . Very disappointed with the sound quality . It even breaks up . And forget about organizing you music and videos . You ca n't create folders on your own . Have to use Windows Media Player . And I still have n't figured out how to make video playlists . WMP wo n't accept mp4 files in the Video playlist . Plus , when scrolling through your library , the scroll wheel only goes forward so , if you want to play a song that begins with `` Y '' and do n't what to start from `` A '' and scroll through 8GB WORTH OF SONGS all the way down to `` Y '' but want to scroll up from `` Z '' to `` Y '' , you ca n't .
 I bought this earlier this year , thinking I am getting an upgrade from my Sansa M250.Wish I was not soo quick to throw out my old player.Its really fustrating when it syncs with the computer after disconnecting it takes hours -LRB- by then the battery is drained -RRB- to power off from the connected mode.I hate thisproduct . Get the real deal save yourself some fustration and money . Not worth it.Beware !
 I purchased this MP3 player as a Christmas gift for our daughter only to find out on Christmas Day that is not compatible without our computer despite every update available . While we could see the preloaded video and it is very clear and bright , we were never able to upload any music . My husband -LRB- who is computer wizard -RRB- spent 12 hours trying to get this thing to work , but without any success . Next time we 'll buy an IPod .
 Had no luck , even with latest firmware , getting the unit to resume any of my audio books . I tried changing the tags on the mp3 files but it did not work . The unit would go into auto shut off and then force you to start your audio book file from the start every time .
 IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO BUY THIS PRODUCT TO USE FOR AUDIO BOOKS DO N'T DO IT . I HAVE 2 SANSA FUZE AND A SANSA CLIP I USE FOR AUDIO BOOKS . I HAD NO PROBLEMS DOWN LOADING BOOKS FROM THE LIBRARY -LRB- OVERDRIVE -RRB- AND PUTTING THEM INTO THE AUDIO BOOK CATAGORY . THEY ALSO HAVE A RESUME PLAY TO START THE BOOK WHERE YOU LEFT OFF.I BOUGHT A 16 GB VIEW SO I COULD FIT ALOT OF BOOKS ON ONE MP3 . WELL WHAT THEY DO N'T TELL YOU IS , IN ORDER TO USE THE AUDIOBOOK FEATURE YOU HAVE TO BUY AUDIOBOOKS FROM -LSB- ... -RSB- . I CALLED THEIR SUPPORT AND THEY TOLD ME THEY WOULD FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE BOOKS FROM THE LIBRARY INTO THE AUDIOBOOK CATAGORY AND CALL ME BACK , NO ONE DID . IN THE MEANTIME THE 15 DAY RETURN POLICY WAS UP . -LRB- TEN OF IT WAS SHIPPING TIME . -RRB- SO I COULD N'T TAKE IT BACK TO THE STORE . I CALLED SUPPORT AGAIN AND THEY GAVE ME A BUNCH OF STUFF TO TRY THAT DID N'T WORK . ON THE THIRD CALL THE GUY TOLD ME ONLY BOOKS FROM AUDIBLE WILL GO ON THERE . THE BOOKS I DOWNLOADED FROM THE LIBRARY WENT INTO THE MUSIC CATAGORY WHICH WAS FINE UNTIL YOU PAUSED THE PLAYER OR TURNED IT OFF , THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO START THE BOOK ALL OVER AGAIN . THEY WOULD NOT TAKE THE PLAYER BACK , THEIR ADVICE THIS TIME WAS NOT TO TURN THE PLAYER OFF TILL I WAS DONE WITH THE BOOK . NOW I 'M OUT $ -LSB- ... -RSB- . THE ONLY WAY TO LISTEN TO AUDIOBOOKS PROPERLY ON THIS PLAYER IS BUYING THEM THROUGH AUDIBLE WHICH THEY DO NOT TELL YOU . A TOTAL MISCONCEPTION IN THERE PART .
 Apart from arriving in nearly 2 pieces -LRB- apart -RRB- it did not work and the software did not work either . Going away in a week , so I can not use it . Pissed off .
 Alright so this thing really needs a warning label on it . `` WILL FREEZE WHEN TRYING TO SKIP SONGS '' This stupid contraption lead me in the end to just break it . It freezes up when I try and skip a song , I have to try and turn the damn thing off before I can even go to the main menu after I 've used it for about a half hour . The battery life is great , really , but it 's just not worth it when it 's playing and it goes to the next song , but the screen says it 's one minute into the last song previous it was playing . Basically , you ca n't skip the song if you wanted . Nice going Sansa , you made a piece of crap .
 I had hoped for a more from Sandisk . After about 10 very frustrating days of trying to get it to work properly , the unit stopped altogether . The expansion memory never did work . It would only duplicate what was on the internal memory . Sandisk support was polite and tried to be helpful . Unfortunately , we were not in any way successful in getting the unit to work . After I got the error message on my computer that the unit has malfunctioned and should be replaced , I sent it back.SanDisk Sansa View 8 GB Video MP3 Player -LRB- Black -RRB-
 This player freezes constantly . It 's possible not everyone has this issue . Also the menus can be a bit sluggish . Do n't buy without a good return policy .
 Review
 My daughter received this item as a Christmas gift . About a month ago it just stopped working . We have had several emails and phone calls back and forth to the company , `` Creative '' is an accurate name for them ... they are creative about honoring the 90 day warranty by putting you off until you are out of warranty . They have promised three times to email me the forms to have it fixed or replaced ... and nothing yet . I emailed the company again today . They do not have a customer service number that is toll free , and I am about done running up my phone bill.We were happy with it for the first 60 days or so , but now , I will never buy another `` Creative '' product again , based on their customer service .
 The combination of FM radio , Voice Recorder and less importantly WMA/MP3 player in a small form factor appealed to me and , knowing the risks of such a behaviour , I became an early adopter.Good things first
 This POS started giving `` English font only '' and `` download new firmware from `` www.creative.com '' within 3 hours of using it after it was fully charger . Creative has NO firmware upgrade for this model since it is so new , and support can not help . Search for `` rhomba firmware '' at google and visit Creative 's European customer support forum page - there are oodles and oodles of Europeans with this same fatal error that they can not recover from at all . People are throwing around unreleased firmware in that forum for this thing since Creative still has not released it . * sigh * another bug-ridden thing from Creative . Going back for the iPod 10GB - $ 100 upgrade , but I am sure I will have NO problems making that thing work since it is an Apple .
 I received my new Rhomba , and was all excited to open it and try it out . I open it and go through the quick setup guide and plug it into a USB port on my pc so it can charge up . As I am waiting for the unit to charge I start reading through the manual and come across the following message ... The cables that come with this unit contain LEAD which has been shown to cause CANCER and it is strongly suggested that you wash your hands after every time you touch them ... Say What ???!!!! I fired off an email to Creative asking them to provide a little more clarity on this statement with no response . Needless to say I am returning the unit .
 This is a cute little gadget , but it got broken after only three months of carrying it in my pocket . Seems to be too fragile for being a mobile player .
 The Rhomba is cheaply made . Mine stopped working completely after about two months . Piece of garbage .
 I bought this player for my nephew -LRB- age15 -RRB- one year ago . After the first month it would n't work . called and they refused a new one , only rebuilt . OK . Sent it back and 4 1/2 months later it stopped playing again . They refused him any replacement , partial payment to fix it , no solution to the problem . I am sitting here with this $ 179.MP3 player that does n't work , that I can now get for $ 119 and am not sure what to do with it . Do I throw it away , can it be fixed -LRB- again -RRB- . I would not buy any Creative product again . EVER
 I read the reviews on the Internet the same way you are reading now . When I went to the store I have been misled by the salesman . He told me that the creative is a great brand and no one returned the product so far . He told me '' if it was a bad product creative would have taken it of the shelf by now '' . I bought the product and it stop working after TWO DAYS '' not responding at all . I talked to the customer support and they ask me to send the product to them . It takes along ... . time to get it back believe me I havent got the mine yet .
 The first day I bought this , it did n't work . But then the next day , it worked a gain . I continued to use it for 1 month , and it did n't work completely . Many people used it and said that it is a bad product with errors .
 I bought this piece of crap and found out it 's not compatible with tracks which are downloaded in DRM -LRB- Digital Rights Management -RRB- format which 6 out of 6 songs I downloaded from Napster were in . So , I have basically a $ 200 radio . Worthless . DO NOT BUY !!!
 After carefully opening the player , reading the entire instruction manual and following it to the letter , the player froze up . I can not accurately describe my anger . I bought this thing because reviews said it was the most customer friendly . If it did n't cost me $ 125 , I would have run it over with my car . Do yourself a favor , avoid the Rhomba at all costs .

 Sounds like a great product , but when the manufacturer 's website gives a response like this : ManualsSorry , no manuals are available for the selected query ... it is sad , since it looks like a nice product , but no available manual support ?? Do I have to purchase it , and then go through the manual to decide its not what I want ? And I lose on the return shipping everytime ! Before purchasing , reviewing the manual makes a BIG difference to the buyer to know how this device is manipulated . I had reviewed many similar products to come to the conclusion that when multi-function devices like these are made , the critical functions are given a back-seat ... for example , voice recording . . for those who buy this product for memo recording , if we have to press a number of buttons to get to what we want , it defeats the purpose of having this feature at all.Amazon 's awesome feature of looking at the product manual really helps us decide on a purchase . I do hope more people support Amazon for these litle extras they provide .
 The adapter quit working after 3 hours of use . I returned it and got a full refund . The customer service for the return and refund was excellent , and I would not hesitate to deal with this company again . But I wo n't buy any replacement power adapter for a 4-year-old laptop again . I got a new laptop .
 Picked one of these up the other day , mostly for the slick design and for the wireless keyboard with trackball type mouse controller . But that 's all it has , is looks ... After using the keyboard , it quickly became tedious to use , since not only are the keys hard to push down , they are in a tight proximity of each other and not in the usual places , and the wireless is hit and miss , possibly because it runs at only 49MHz frequency . It will miss keys here and there , so you have to type very slooow , and check your work very often , and with passwords where you ca n't see what you are typing , good luck ! It quickly becomes a tire ... There is no number pad and the trackball mouse is skippy and lacks a scroll feature ... The processor is 2 `` generations '' older than the current dual core intel processors and the RAM is standard DDR instead of DDR2 ... Unless HP updates the components and the keyboard , this is a terrible value and a POS .

 I too got taken in by the `` coiled '' picture . I got a curly cable , not the straight cable pictured `` in a coil . '' Completely misleading , I lost my $ 3.99 that I paid for next day shipping from Prime as well ! Total bait & switch . I did n't read the one review on it . Now there are two . This cable is actually about 2 feet long with the coil .
 I was amazed how poorly these fit in my ear , in fact , after trying for a couple of weeks , I could not tell which one was the R and which was the L as they both fit so poorly . The spiky part hurt my ear after a few minutes of wearing.I threw these out and purchased the Umbo earbud . Much , much better fit there .
 Do n't bother . It is next to impossible to get this product to work . Tried everything -LRB- USB , download driver , etc. -RRB- and nothing worked - with XP Pro . ended up in the trash .
 The whole point in ordering a genuine retail packaged Canon battery is to avoid cheap Chinese knockoffs . Unfortunately , I ordered two of this product and received just that . Make sure what you receive is a genuine Canon product in retail packaging with hologram . Even then , it 's possible that the packaging + hologram has been spoofed.Needed these batteries for a trip to Africa , leaving tomorrow . Beware seller Savings 365
 Comparing with the battery included with the camera , you will realize that THIS BATTERY IS N'T AN ORIGINAL CANON PRODUCT , is a copy with the Canon logo . In fact the front legend is different compared with the original . If you pay attention to details like the the package , the hologram and finishes at junctions you 'll realize that is not original product and is offered like and original Canon product.In any case if you want the original battery go to BB or another store and you will see that the original is exactly the same like the included with your camera , same logo , same legend with a very cool hologram and a perfect package but at $ 60 or more plus taxes each . So I think that it 's not a great discount , the seller claims 57 % off !! for me this one does n't have any discount ; $ 25.95 is the full price ! the people believes that this is an original product with a tremendous discount ... . One -LRB- 1 -RRB- star is my rating for this reason.However THIS BATTERY HAVE THE SAME DURATION OR A LITTLE BETTER compared with the Canon battery included with the camera so is a good deal for the price ; two batteries with a great performance for the price -LRB- or less -RRB- of just one . Five -LRB- 5 -RRB- stars is my rating for this.So three stars is the average rating . ========= UPDATE -- After four months of use : The battery life is now the worst in the world , the charge is completed in 20 minutes using the original Canon charger and , obviusly , the duration is for just a 50 aprox . pictures using the flash and the battery is overheated inside the camera ; sometimes I think that could be explode inside and bye bye my SX230.So , for me , is confirmed that this battery is garbage , the original Canon that came with the camera still running perfect and I can get easily around 250 pictures per charge . Please BEWARE with cheaper imitations and made in china bateries like this one . In my case I wasted my money , $ 45.98 for two bateries.Now , 1 star rating because does n't exist zero starts ...
 The battery I got has a terrible quality . With a full charge over night -LRB- ~ 8 hours -RRB- , the battery only sustained my SD800 IS camera less than 12 hours normal usage , shot around 20 pictures . Versus to the original battery pack with the camera , the original battery can last over two days normal usage , shot around > 100 pictures . I believe the vendor selling degraded products .
 We were surprised and confused when opened up the Amazon shipping box . The battery has been removed from the retail packaging and wrapped in a bubble wrap with a seal labe said `` new '' . When looked closely at the battery , it 's obvious that this is not the same one as what we have in the camera . I 'm not sure if $ 29.94 is a deal for a non-original battery . We strongly urge Amazon to faithfully update the product description , or this is considered a deceiving .
 I just bought a new Canon Powershot S100 and decided I needed a spare battery . I wanted to avoid the cheap Chinese knockoffs which seem to be available everywhere , which usually seem to substandard . So , I thought by going to Amazon and making sure it was a `` shipped and sold by Amazon '' product , saying `` New , retail packaging '' , that 's what I 'd get . No . It was a loose battery shrink-wrapped in plastic with a sticker on it . No retail packaging anywhere . I decided to try it out , and saw the battery itself had many signs of previous use , with wear marks on the plastic . Comparing it to the new battery that came with my S100 also revealed some differences , the key one being the `` Made in China '' on the this one , compared to `` Made in Japan '' on the one I got with the camera . $ 43 is too much to pay for a used Chinese knock-off . I use Amazon a lot and have to say this is the first time I really felt like I got ripped off by them . Reading through the reviews it seems like there are others who had the same thing happen , but not everyone , so this may , or may not happen to you ... Bottom line , it was back in the box for a refund the same day I got it . Very disappointed in Amazon.I 'm going over to the B&H ; website and will order one from there instead , works out at exactly the same price , and I bet this one will actually be genuine Canon , in retail packaging .
 I ordered this battery , thinking that it was a ` real battery ' . Did not charge or work at all - says `` Canon Made in China '' . If this is not a manufacturer 's battery then I paid way too much for it . Oh , since it does n't work at all I paid way too much for it .
 You get what you pay for . I have used these batteries as back up for the original Canon one . After 10 months with only occasional use , battery won '' t take or hold a charge . Do you self a favor , and buy a Canon battery . You 'll save money in the long run .
 I just got the `` New '' battery , but it looks like already got opened before.Also , It 's not working . It ca n't charge the battery , the light is not turn on !!!!
 After about a year of using this generic battery from China , the battery is quickly fading away . It will not hold charges and seems to make my camera actually reject the battery . When using this replacement battery , my camera will sometimes shut off or will not even turn on . I will not ever buy a cheap replacement battery for my expensive cameras . China is producing some really bad products lately , using cheap materials and cheap labor . Those products seem inferior to factories from other countries , especial USA , Japan , Germany . You have been warned .
 I never got the battery and im still waiting on it , I want to know whats going to happen cause im still waiting
 Was starting to swell , which was why I was looking for anotherNo more purchases like this from meVery disappointedToo much trouble to follow up and return but glad I can vent
 I ordered a Canon camera battery . NB-5L . Some company -LRB- not Amazon -RRB- sent the wrong battery.I tired to send it back . Too complicated . -LRB- Many emails , lots of forms . -RRB- I found someone who needed the incorrect battery -LRB- NB-4L -RRB- and gave it to them.Then I went to a real store and bought the correct battery.Bad taste in my mouth remains .
 There is a problem with this battery and the Canon SD700 . The battery is too short and the fitting in the camera is very loose . This creates a problem since many times the camera does not work , and I need to shake the camera , or remove the battery and insert it back to get the camera powered.I will recommend to the Canon engineers to go out and buy a flashligth to learn how a battery housing should be designed.Very expensive . Made in China . Does not work . Not recommended.Is there any one interested in a used Canon SD700 with an extra battery ?
 On paper , this recorder seemed to be perfect for my needs - primarily scheduled recordings of TV programs . In addition to the normal specs for these devices , I particularly liked the commercial skip , its low standby power level , and its 5-year battery backup.But the TV Guide is truly a deal-breaker . In the week I had my unit , it literally chattered continuously as it tried -LRB- with only partial success -RRB- to download the guide . It was very irritating in an otherwise quiet room , and quiet passages in music or TV programs are a thing of the past with this in the same room.I emailed Pioneer ; they said it is normal for the unit `` to make some sound '' when it is on , and the TV Guide can not be disabled.If it worked well , the TV guide would be nice , but it is n't worth the racket . If I could have disabled the TV Guide , I would have kept the unit and programmed it manually.I reluctantly returned the recorder .
 All the features are nice , TV Guide worked -LRB- note that browsing and setting recording preferences is very SLOW -RRB- , BUT when the TV Guide is downloading -LRB- all the time -RRB- or you are recording / playing from the hard drive you constantly hear a grinding sound from the hard drive . These guys must have used a cheap hard drive or something . I have the Amazon return slip on my desk ...
 I bought two of the 633 's two years ago and actually fell in love with the machine - despite the TV Guide debacle -LRB- blame cable companies on that , not the manufacturers -RRB- . After a year and a half the first one stopped working . Best I can tell , the Hard Drive just failed . The cost for fixing makes it smarter to buy a new one - so I trashed it . A few months later the second one stopped working altogether also . I absolutely love the machine but there is obviously some problme with the hard drives . I am waiting until pioneer replaces this line -LRB- 533/633 -RRB- to buy a better one . Do n't know why there is so little to choose from in the industry for this type of product .
 I am now on my second Pioneer DVR 633HS . It 's got to be the biggest piece of junk I have ever owned . They last about 2 months -LRB- or less -RRB- , after that they do not respond to any controls and keep turning on and off on their own . My first one got so hot it could have set the house on fire had I not caught it . The hard drive locks up and keeps sounding like an old pulse tone telephone.Did Pioneer get rid of all educated engineers?I noticed this unit can not even be purchased on - line at any web site anymore . This is sad after only a few months on the market . I will unload this piece of junk back to the dealer and buy any other brand but another Pioneer .
 We bought this last December -LRB- 2005 -RRB- . It worked well enough for the first few months -LRB- some resetting of the TV Guide and blanking for days at a time , but OK -RRB- . Was great to backup our Digital 8 video tapes to DVD.THEN ... two weeks ago the TV Guide went dark -LRB- could not use it at all -RRB- . I left it alone thinking it would reset and be fine.Machine then went into an endless loop the other day when I tried to turn it on . Would not come on . Gave a `` LOADING '' message when powered on - then went off to EPG function - then fired up again to `` LOADING '' then to EPG - etc. . It seems to be frying.Read elsewhere on the web that the TV Guide function has been a disaster for almost all users . New version does not include it!Pioneer asked us to ship it to them and they will repair it under the 1 year warranty . Frankly , I feel it is a lemon and should be replaced with the new version under a lemon law for bad electronics!Buyer beware !
 I own two PIONEER DVR-531H-s DVR/Hard Drive Recorders . I write to tell you about the outrageous repair costs!My problems began when my DVD Burner failed on my first unit . I purchased a replacement DVD Drive online -LRB- not from Pioneer -RRB- but no shop , technician or owner can simply replace the DVD burner or the hard drive without special propitiatory software!I learned this the hard way when I bought a second Pioneer DVR-531H-s on eBay with a known bad hard drive . When I tried to replace the defective hard drive with my known good hard drive the second Pioneer locked-up as well . Now I have two bad Pioneer DVR-HD Recorders.I tried to find a approved repair center for these units and the two I found said that they do n't really repair them on site , instead they send them in to the factory for repairs . They too advised that the repairs would be EXTREMELY expensive.I took both units to to the Pioneer warehouse/repair center in Dominguez Hills , California where they gave me the bad news . NO , the drives can not simply be replaced . If I wanted Pioneer to replace the drives -LRB- or ` activate ' my known good drives in any unit -RRB- the cost is a whopping $ 250 per hour each plus any possible parts . More bad news , if the DVD Burner is bad the replacement cost is $ 225 PLUS the per-hour repair charges and a replacement hard drive is $ 350 for a 80GB ! In fact , the repair technician highly recommended that I simply scrap these DVD units and buy a new one.Why must Pioneer make * any * device so impossible to repair and so expensive to repair even by them?Will I buy another Pioneer * anything * ? Not a chance!I hope you read this before you buy any Pioneer product because you may be facing a ugly and expensive repair nightmare.Anthony
 Sp65 is difficult to program . Detailed instructions are not included with purchased item , and send you to a web page that is unavailable -LRB- www.sonicblue.com/support -RRB- . I think this is a piece of junk !
 This is the first time I post a review because I am compelled to do so.I bought this camera to use during the Christmas holidays . I tried to use it the first time to take a picture of the Christmas tree , all I saw was complete darkness . Then I realized that I needed more light . So I turned on all the lights in the house and it was still darkness . If you plan to use this camera indoor , please forget about it ! No way.It is n't that great outdoor neither . I took many pictures with the automatic exposure setting . It can not handle anything with a bright background . It will just be VERY bright.I tried to use it on the ski slopes . I think it is because of the cold temperature , the camera has to be reset often . To make the matter worse , the pictures turned out literally `` twisted '' . I ca n't belive a HP camera can have so many flaws . Very disappointing . Please do n't buy one .
 I have to agree with the `` lousy '' review . It seems to be a decent setup , but if you need a light more intense than any naturally available , what is the point ? HP needs to get this fixed so it is much more sensitive to light and can operate with a faster `` shutter '' speed to prevent blur and also produce something other than an extremely dark picture . I was n't looking for something that great with a 1.3 MP camera , but this was a total loss . Can you say Return Merchandise Authorization ?
 Camera is only usable outside in broad daylight . Trying anything inside your home/place of business and you 'll have nothing but black on your screen.I am returning the product and will probably try lifeview camera with flash to see if camera aperture allows more light in.I was in rooms that were pretty well lit up ... and viewfinder is dark as night.Should never have been released as a product because of these flaws ... and it does n't have to be this way . Laptop usb cameras offer incredibly bright pictures in low light conditions .
 This product has only one thing going for it . It 's nice looking . Besides that , it 's totally worthless . Cheaply made . Almost impossible to remove without either dropping it or having your fingers slip off of it which usually results in your fingernails scraping across the surface of your lens or lens filter . After 10 drops and 4 fingernail scrapes , I ordered the following product.Mennon Pro Center Pinch 67mm Snap-On Lens Cap with Leash . It 's much better . Sturdily made , snaps off and on very easily , same price as the Canon . Only drawback - no nice Canon logo .
 The item was not fully described . I thought it would fit my Rebel camera , however it did not.Nor
 I would have liked to know that the cord in the picture was NOT the cord that I was ordering . Not only are the connectors NOT nickel-plated , like in the picture , even the shape of the connector is wrong and looks to be smaller than the one pictured as well.My rating is more for the distrust I 'm feeling from this company rather than the product itself , as it does work ... For now ... My recommendation
 I had to rate this low because the one I received was broken or had some sort of short in the wire and did n't work . I 'm pretty sure a working one would be very useful .
 This product does not fit tightly . It tends to fall out of the plugs it is attached to , both at the computer -LRB- the male end -RRB- and at the cable -LRB- female end -RRB- . Complaint to the provider went unanswered . We will have to buy a replacement .
 I had 2 problems with the product . First the sound would cut out of one ear unless I played with the connection and second , using the extension caused the sound in my left and right headset piece to reverse -LRB- right sound came out of the left ear and vice versa -RRB- . I have requested a refund and will not reorder if this is normal .
 i bought this so i can watch tv from the other side of the room . great idea . but some headsets dont work with it . . would have returned it but for the price ill keep it . you get what u pay for !
 Audio playback through this extension is terrible -- constant static . I have used it with multiple sources and playback devices , speakers and headphones , and all have the same result , static . Replaced it with a higher quality cable and the problem was solved . Not worth the hassle of trying to get a replacement when the cable only cost $ 3 shipped to begin with .
 EDIT
 I bought this in November 2005 , used it almost everyday without disconecting it so no wear would be put on the connectors . Last week the sound quit coming through in the right ear . Surprising since the connectors are gold plated , you would expect it to last as long as my headphones which are 7 + years old without gold plating -LRB- and still function pefect . Anyway , it was only $ 2.90 from Part Express when i bought it from here , but the shiping was really high . So if you buy it plan to replace it in a year in a half .
 Ok while it lasted . However this cord stopped working after two months . Save your money -- this is junk .
 Ca n't return , I guess , do n't know how to get a hold of seller . Connections not good , I only get left ear speaker to work w/cord but without it works headphones work fine . So it 's the cord . It 's a shame really as the cord it self seems to be of good quality . Oh well , you ca n't judge a book by it 's cover .
 Product arrived promptly and in good condition . However , the female jack does not fit properly with my headphones . If you insert the male headphone plug fully into this cable , the sound is hollow and nearly silent . If you fiddle with the connection and pull the headphone plug out slightly , the sound is great . Getting it right is a pain and will probably increase wear and tear on the connectors . I 'm looking for another productNote
 Update ... so the workaround described below work for about 33 days ... just outside the return window . The tracks that play in just the left headset channel do not come through . I 've tried 2 sets of ear buds and one set of over the ear headsets ... all have the same issue . Plug the same headsets into the source -LRB- PC -RRB- , all channels play out of both ear.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASING THIS ITEM . -- Out of the box , if I plug my ear buds from my iPhone into the extension -LRB- fully connected in the female end -RRB- I only get sound out of the right ear bud . Verified the same condition with a pair of JVC ear buds as well . I have found if you insert the male end of the headphones into the extender to the first `` click '' -LRB- not fully inserted -RRB- , sound comes from both ear buds . There is tension with it connected in this fashion , so it works but could be better . Others may have better luck with other headphones .
 I ordered the headphone extension -LRB- 1 male end/1 female end -RRB- and got a 15 foot auxiliary plug -LRB- 2 male ends -RRB- . I decided that it would be cheaper to buy a stereo coupler of 2 female ends than it would be to ship it back .
 Purchased this for use with my Tracks HD and as others have stated above the sound quality was greatly lowered for me and my left speakers sound is off with this product . Glad I did n't waste more than I did on this .
 Not sure why there 's such a love-fest here over this charger ?? Fact is , we 're talking about roughly eight bucks in parts & plastic that Canon is marking up too much . After spending so much on the camera , it 's insulting to the notion of `` customer service '' that they are charging this price for a replacement charger . At least they could make it a rapid-charger enhancement or something - after all , why should it take two hours to re-charge your camera?Listen Canon , if you want five-stars from customers , treat us better , and sell replacement parts at cost . No need to take advantage of us just because we lose a part that makes our wonderful camera as useful as a stone .
 I was shipped what appeared to be a refurbished charger . On top of the fact this item was refurbished , it did not work . As if the upset and inconvenience of receiving a product that does not work was n't enough , once I returned this item to sender they had the audacity to charge a `` restocking fee '' . I certainly wo n't ever purchase from this seller ever !
 I would like to say that all of my dealings with Amazon have been wonderful , fast , and not a problem . The only reason I gave this unit a below rating is because the pictures showed a unit that just plugged into the wall , like the one that came with camera . When it arrived , I opened it up and I found a plug-in cable , then a charging box -LRB- gray -RRB- , plus a battery . So I was not happy about the pictures not being the same one as I thought I had ordered , I was expecting the one with the folding prongs . Otherwise , Amazon would get a 5 on this review .
 I needed a charger because i misplaced mine . I an stunned they want $ 36 for this thing that should not cost more than $ 10 .
 The description stated that the condition of the charger was like new . I got it in the mail after about 2 weeks -LRB- from Japan -RRB- , and it had scratches all over it . I would not buy from this seller again .
 Im going to return mine they said it would work for my Cannon Sd1000 and it did n't I wish they did more research before saying it would work . It was cheaper than buying new though but I have the hassel of sending it back .
 The charger does not charge my battery ! And it does not plug in directly into the outlet . Rather , it has a separate cable that goes to the adapter itself and the outlet . It 's junk ! I am absolutely disappointed !
 the battery charger that I received did not have a plug . In the picture it shows a plug thatcan directly be plugged into a power outlet . The chrager did not have the plug nor a cord w/plug . I needed to use it today for a college project and had to go out and buy an additional cord.I would like to have sometone contact me about this problem.Thank you . Silvia Bryan
 They shipped me CB-2LV not CB-2LX , I think a chimp that is mentally challenged could have read the label on the back of the charger and put it into the package . This is pathetic .
 I emailed the company 3 times requesting permission to return unused item and they never got back to me . I am stuck with a product I do not want that I bought by mistake . Bad business .
 I was looking forward to using my canon powershot again as I 'd misplaced my original charger while traveling . I take the charger out of the bag , not box , and plug it in only to find that it does not work - it 's not charging at all . No light , no power when I put the battery back in my camera . Will ship it back very soon for a replacement or refund !
 I feel that I was mislead when purchasing this product since when I googled replacement battery chargers for my Canon PowerShot SD1100 IS Digital Elph , this site came up as having a compatible charger . However , when it arrived it WAS NOT COMPATIBLE !!! It cost me the postage both ways and a huge waste of time . This vendor should be more specific in advertising !! I got ripped off on this deal !!
 This is the first time I buy a product from this provider and I will never do it again , they sold me a charger without a box and that looks kind of used , when I try to charge my batteries they never did it . After a couple tries I went to a local dealer and got a brand new that made a great job in a couple hours .
 Keep getting `` Driver Open Fail '' message . No solution availabe , this renders the camera unusable . Save your money .
 Being a camera aficionado and collector , I picked this up at Walmart to play around with . Even THAT 'S not possible ... see , there 's no support for Mac OS X. Vivitar 's website claims no driver is needed for OS X , that an icon appears on the desktop in Classic Mode . That 's a cynical , damnable LIE ! Until some similarly-wronged Code Warrior writes a driver for this , I ca n't affirm to you that the dynamic range of this sweetheart sucks eggs , but that 's what I 've been told.It really deserves negative stars . I used to love Vivitar SLR stuff . Now they do n't even answer email inquiries and complaints . Vivitar should be cast into the deepest pit of Hell for all eternity .
 This was a Christmas present for my son . I am in complete agreement with the other reviewers . It seemed like a great starter camera for my son and the price was right . But it is completely useless *********** Save your money !!! I followed the instruction on the software CD provided -LRB- more than once -RRB- . It seemed very simple but when I open the Dual Camera software , it will show me the pictures in the camera , but then locks up . The program becomes unresponsive . I have been working with this for hours and am completely frustated . If any one has been able to find a way to get the pictures downloaded please help !!!!!!!!!!!
 Can not get the pictures off the camera . Keeps saying faliure when try to download or go to website .
 Now my daughter will not stop aggravating me because we can not download the pictures off of the dran thing and wants a new camera , so now , I have not only wasted my money , but I have to buy her a more expensive camera that will work that she will break or lose.Thanks so much Vivitar !
 I wish I could rate this camera -9999999999999999999999999999999 . Actually what I really wish is to mound all of the Vivitar Vivicam 55 cameras up in a pile and BURN THEM . Anyway , I found this camera at Walmart thinking it should be good for the $ 20 price tag they were asking . When I first opened this wannabe camera I noticed the buttons were very cheap . More than half the pictures taken were either blurry and/or yellowed . Do n't bother trying to create a video with this thing unless you like a still frame video . I brought it back after I did some research and found the Logitech C310 Webcam for several dollars more here on Amazon -LRB- which has HD ! -RRB- . This is the worst camera i have EVER used . Live and learn , and never buy anything made by Vivitar . Shop around and spend a few extra dollars for a better camera . If not , you get what you pay for .
 OK , I 'll be the first to admit that I 'm mad right now . And one should n't review things when they 're mad . How did I get mad ? I 've been trying to configure an APC AP7930 for a couple weeks , and still ca n't get the device to work . I 've been a network administrator and installer for many years , and I 've never worked with a LESS convenient product that the APC AP7930.Let 's start with what 's good about this product : As a 24-outlet power strip , this device is great . Plug your stuff in and it provides power . You can plug 24 servers into this strip and expect it to deliver power to them all without a hitch . It has heavy duty grounded outlets and heavy duty power cabling . It is rack-mountable , and included the hardware to conveniently mount one on each side of my server cabinets . Bravo . It 's a $ 600 power strip.Now let 's get to the bad part : The AP7930 also has network connectivity . Supposedly you can connect it to your network and then manage each of the power outlets - thus being able to cut the power to a device over your network . Sounds like a great idea , since no one wants to have to drive all the way to the datacenter just to power cycle a stubborn server.The bad part is that you ca n't configure this network interface ! Yes , that 's right . You ca n't do it . Why ? Mainly because of APC 's stupidity . First off , they do n't set the device to pull a DHCP address by default . If it did that , then you might be able to find it on your network and reconfigure how you want it . No , you have to assign it an IP address from the get-go . -LRB- You can turn on DHCP if you want it later , but you 'd first need to be able to communicate with the device . -RRB- But you ca n't communicate with it without an IP address . And you ca n't assign one without communicating with it.So in APC 's infinite wisdom , they gave the device a serial interface , so you could console into the device , much like many Cisco routers . But here again , they screw you . Instead of putting a standard 9-pin serial jack on it , they put an RJ12 jack . OK , no big deal , right ? Cisco does that too . Nope . APC decided that they did n't want to be standard in ANY way , so they gave it a custom -LRB- proprietary -RRB- pin-out configuration . That way you MUST use a special serial-to-APC cable to communicate with their power strip.Here again they screw you
 i received a damaged product I can not return because actually I Live abroad in Central America so is too expensive sentd this item for this reason I prefered waste this shoulder harness .
 It 's $ 39.00 on the apple website , there is free shipping as well , so why buy it on amazon ? I came here looking for a deal and was disappointed .
 Why does everyone rave about this ? One of the reviews even says , `` If you need this then get it . '' Yeah , if you 're travelling you need this , but more importantly why ca n't Apple just sell the different adapaters individually ? Apple must assume that a lot of people have more than one of their products - perhaps a macbook and an ipod , so would n't it make more sense to sell the adapters individually , that way one could buy for example two European adapaters , one for ipod and one for macbook ? Another apple rip-off if you ask me .
 When travelling I seek to minimise the weight and number of items I bring . Technology is one good place where gains on this front can be made . This product bundle is a complete joke . Why so many pieces ? Why bring all of that excess stuff ? If the answer is `` just take the ones you will need for a given trip '' then why not just buy some cheapo country / region specific solution ? If you are serious about travel with your electronics -LRB- not just Apple -RRB- check out this : Kensington 33117 International All-in-One Travel Plug Adapter . It has covered me in Asia , Australia , and Europe and there is only one piece to deal with .
 The quality of construction is excellent , it 's just that the straps are unbelievably short . I 've had Jansports before , and never once have I seen this . At full length , the backpack was quite tight around my shoulders . The straps on my other Jansport -LRB- Samba Trans -RRB- are about TWICE as long ! How and why Jansport could do this is beyond me - 8 more inches of strap and I 'd love this bag - too bad they do n't post strap length specs on their site eh ? If you a small man , a kid , or a girl , you may still be interested , so let me give you a breakdown that you probably wo n't find anywhere else : The `` shockshield '' laptop sleeve
 I bought this backpack when I wanted to have a new bag for my laptop . I got a good JanSport Backpack for my niece a few month ago and she liked that one , so I chose JanSport again . It 's out of question that JanSport is generally a good brand.But this particular backpack is really poorly made . The texture is made by some cheap materials , and definitely looks not as good as the picture shown on the website . There are not many compartments in the bag with poor paddings , and the space is not as big as that was described at all . Nevertheless , the laptop sleeve is too wide for my 15 ' widescreen notebook . So I bought another backpack of Swissgear this weekend when I saw it on sale with only one third price of this JanSport . And the quality of my new bag is Much Much Much BETTER than this one.Don ' t buy this backpack !
 I had a Jansport pack which I dragged all over the world for 12 years . It finally needed some serious repairs , and I sent it in . Apparently they no longer repaired that model , and sent me a Firewire instead.First , the pack is made for midgets . It is simply not long enough for my back . I 'm 6 ' and do n't have unusual proportions , so this is kind of disturbing.Second , the weird laptop pocket in the main compartment is an incredible design flaw . The rigid support at the bottom is about two inches above the bottom of the backpack , so if you load the pack , whatever you put in ca n't ride against your lower back , and effectively pulls the backpack into a curve so you feel the very straight , rather uncomfortable stays at the bottom of the laptop pocket , and the top of the shoulder straps.It 's simply not an acceptable pack for day to day use as it 's designed .
 Normally , I would never buy anything from Harman Kardon . But this DVD player was on sell for $ 100.00 from $ 300.00 . Well , I guess you get what you pay for . I set up the player and placed my first DVD in it . I knew I was in trouble when I hearding a whining , grinding sound . That was n't too amusing . What was even less amusing was the nice blank TV screen . I tried another DVD just to make sure it was n't a problem with the DVD . I got the same whining , grinding sound and blank TV screen.It was n't worth mailing back , in either time or money . I went down to the local Best Buy and bought myself a nice Sony DVD player . It has been working great.I 'm waiting to take my HK DVD player outside and re-enact the scene from `` Office Space '' where the guys beat the crap out of the printer . ; - -RRB-
 This piece of equipment is aweful . It doesnt work period . Just look at the tech support webpage from ADS an be your own judge .
 I have about 20 hours invested in this thing . It DOES NOT WORK!I am running a new install of XP on a new Pentium 4 . The only good thing about this package is the third party Ulead software that is included . As for the ADS software , I continue to get errors when I try to playback video : ADSTech CapWiz Application has encountered a problem and needsto close ... This is the second PC I have tried to install this on , and it is the same story . I have followed the instructions over and over again . What a waste of time and money !
 The DVD maker is easy to setup but the one I have does n't work properly . While converting
 Drivers for XP gave trouble . Had fewer problems with Win ME.However , this baby has problems syncing sound and video . Check all forums on the web , this is a problem everyone has.Doesn ' t look like ADS is about to fix it any time soon.A definite DO N'T BUY .
 Not happy with this product lots problems !!! Not work at all for me . Had a person who is computer nam look at it and everything . He not get it either .
 This product is a good idea . However , the software is not easy to use . Unless you have a very powerful PC , and get installation right the first time , you 'll be in trouble . Included documentation is of little help and Tech support is a dead end -LRB- not to mention arrogant -RRB- .
 I have a 1.7 gig P4 running XP and found this product to be very unstable which is a nice way to say it does n't work . The hardware would always hang my computer no matter which software I used with it . Also a note to their clueless tech support , my Maxtor hard drive was the cause for the sound and video being out of sync , when I reinstalled XP using a Western Digital drive the sync problem went away but not the instability . Believe Microsoft when they say use of an unsigned driver may make your system unstable .
 I bought the ADS Tech Instant DVD + DV after reading some great professional reviews in some of the online magazines . I was really excited to get this product . I now wish I 'd paid more attention to the actual user reviews , as near as I can tell the people writing the magazine reviews must have never actually tried to use this product . Put simply ... it does n't work . Believe the user reviews , this is a bad product.I wanted to transfer some old VHS videotapes to DVD , and I also got the + DV option thinking that it would be a nice way to add Firewire capabilities to my USB 2.0 based system for use with my new Digital camcorder . The Instant DVD box failed miserably to deliver on either of these goals.Using the DV input with my digital camera I had strange artifacts start to appear on the screen . There were weird blotchy sections that started out small , but then grew as the capture progressed until half the screen was covered . While transferring my old analog VHS tapes , certain sections of the tapes would cause the box to completely lock up . When I could get a capture that did n't freeze , I could n't get a capture where the audio and video would stay in sync . I tried multiple tapes , multiple DVD mastering programs , even multiple computer systems , nothing worked . This was simply making DVD 's straight from the captured footage , I was n't transcoding anything . The only thing that worked for me was taking a nice clean analog signal from my digital camera -LRB- since the digital DV capture did n't work . -RRB- That was the only thing that stayed in sync , any input that was less than perfect , like 10 or 15 year old VHS tapes , forget about it.I sent several email queries to the ADS Tech support , after giving up on their telephone support after waiting forever on hold . Other than the automated `` Well get right back to you as soon as possible '' responses , I 've heard nothing else from them . That was six weeks ago ... and I 'm not holding my breath . If you buy this product , you 're definitely on your own.I 've long since returned my box , and chalked it up to a learning experience . Here are a few things to think about , first of all , do you really want a box that converts straight to MPEG2 format ? If you want to change * anything * ... clip out a few scenes , add a title screen , join several clips together ... you have to reencode the file anyway . By uncompressing then recompressing you 're sacrificing quality , and not gaining anything from the built in compression . Also , I did n't realize at the time , but you can get a Firewire card with a cable for almost the same price as just a cable ... it 's cheap , and much better than spending all the extra money for the + DV option.I now own a Canopus ADVC-100 , it 's more expensive but worth every penny . More importantly ... it actually works ! That 's much more than I can say about the ADS Tech Instant DVD .
 I would have rated this minus 5 , but that was not an option . This is neither instant nor is it DVD . It took 2 weeks of intensive work to try to get it to work -- it never did ! I even had to reinstall Windows XP ! Tech support NEVER got back to me , and by the time you finally give up , its too late to return . This will make you homocidal ! Do n't waste your time and energy .
 I was unable to get the driver for Win XP Pro to work . When I had problems I went back , erased my drive and did a clean install of Win XP , twice . The second time I was very careful about the order in which I loaded the driver , but to no avail . The applications that came with it kept hanging and never worked . Instant DVD is a total piece of -LSB- junk -RSB- . I regret wasting this much time on a product that does not seem to have been tested with Win XP . I contract this with Pinnace 's product . I installed Pimmance PCTV Pro and it was easy to install and works like a charm .
 Nearly everything that could be wrong with this device and its software is wrong . First , the capture wizard program displays the file list boxes over the top of the preview screen and control buttons if your advanced display settings use large fonts . So you 're forced to use small fonts which are hard to see on high resolution displays . When you capture , it 's a ... shoot whether it will work or not . Occasionally , it actually will capture a two hour tape , but mostly , it will crash after 10 to 30 minutes with an `` error in clvsd.ax blah blah blah restart your computer . '' You 'll get real good at restarting your computer with this thing . The capture doesnt work at all with Ulead DVD Movie Factory or Dazzle DVD Complete . ADS claims full MPEG-2 compliance , but it 's not DVD compliant so you have to re-encode the files for DVD anyway . Then there 's the audio-sync problems galore ! Another ... shoot . One day in sync , the next day out , and you never changed a single setting . Picture quality
 Was unable to get the USB drivers for this item to install correctly . E-mail to company went unanswered , except for auto reply . Phone numbers were always busy . Returned the unit to the store of purchase for a refund .
 This battery , NP-FA70 , is not compatible with Sony DCR-PC55 camcorder . It wo n't fit into the camcorder . The battery DCR-PC55 uses is the NP-FA50 . The information about the battery is misleading . It states that NP-FA70 is compatible with DCR-55 , which is not correct . This battery is thicker than NP-FA50 and does not fit into DCR-55 's battery bay .
 At first this headset worked well , then it began producing occasional feedback and echo sounds . Now , 14 months later , right after the warrantee expired , I 've called support to be informed that the unit is bad and that a repair will cost about $ 150 . Personally , I expect a lot more from a headset that cost over $ 300 .
 Setup absolutely sucks no install help .
 Been in the computer industry for many years . Trusted ATI in the past , but this card is the worst thing I have ever had to try and install . I spent over 12 hours trying to install this card and make it work . Currently I have been able to get my system back to where it was prior to attempting this installation . If I could only get it to keep from locking up I would be there . To the writers of the latest code for this card , you shoud be hung from the highest tree . I had had high hopes for the functionality of this card , but with this recent adventure , I will never buy anything from ATI again . In summary , I think a perfect acronym for this card is POS , use your imagination !
 OK , amazon.com is completely wrong . It says this card is worth -LSB- $ $ $ -RSB- give or take five cents . The new one , supposedly comming out in August or September , is much better , and is going to be at a retail price of -LSB- $ $ $ -RSB- . Itis MUCH better , and definately worth the wait . HOWEVER , if you must buy a new graphics card now , you should get the NVIDIA ti 4600 by VISION TREK . Not , by PNY , their customer service is very bad , even though they give a very good warranty . -LRB- Even read other reviews about PNY consumers -RRB- . The NVidia 4600 is much better than the ATI 8500 , however again , when the ATI 9700 comes out , that will take the crown . Until than , the NVidia 4600 is proudly wearing it .
 I agree with others opinion that if you get lucky and the card installs properly this product is great . I have quite extensive experience with PCs -LRB- I have put together over 100 of them -RRB- and it took me 6 hours to make this card work . I would give it more stars but ... . First of all , when I bought it , it said on a box that FREE VideoStudio 6.0 by Ulead is included . Well it was n't , instead there was VideoStuio 5.0 which I was n't able make it work . Secondly , when I tried to contact ATI by email I was getting stupid autoreply totally unrelated to my question why ATI company is cheating their customers . I would call them but they charge you over -LSB- X -RSB- a minute for support . So the bottom line do n't count on any support from ATI .
 Used the card for about 4 weeks and had problems with audio which traced to the bad -LRB- ... -RRB- connector on back . . efforts to get service have failed ... This card and its associated software should have been more extensively tested by ATI .
 I purchased this product to upgrade my old all-in-wonder card . I love ATI for their wonderfully multi-functional cards but they really need to do a better job of writing software for them . I tried to install this card on Windows 2000 with all the latest drivers and with the exact instructions -LRB- after reading another review here -RRB- for each driver . The end result was video with vertical lines on both the DVD player and the TV software . Spent 4 more days trying to fix the problem but just gave up in the end and went back to my old ATI card . I might try the Radeon 7500 in the near future -LRB- since I suspect that the `` DV '' output of the card had something to do with my problems -RRB- .
 The device is rated as Windows XP compatable , but it is not . After fruitless hours of trying to get this piece of garbage installed I gave up . Simpletech 's web site and tech support are a joke ! All I ended up with was constant crashes and error messages . Save your money .
 This device should configure a lot easier than it does . I 'm a programmer with many years of experience configuring hardware . I found this one annoying to set up.You may have to download new drivers for this device from the simpletech website . Once you get the correct version of the drivers , and install it following the instructions EXACTLY -LRB- the device can not be plugged in while loading the software -RRB- it eventually works ok.Note that there are two DIFFERENT part numbers for this device . 90000-40388-001 and 90000-40388-002 . The 001 version does not support some platforms that the 002 version does . I recieved the 001 and have had no end of difficulty with it.If I had it to do over again , I would spend a bit more , and get a device from another company that supported more than two media types .
 From what I understand of these types of hardware , they are created in batch by varying hardware component manufacturers and the resold to vendors -LRB- e.g. Simpletech -RRB- who combine them into the nice products we buy for distribution.Unfortunately SimpleTech does n't quite get things right . The driver installation for this product went smoothly on Windows XP . It was a matter of clicking the mouse a few times , a reboot , and plugging in the device into a USB slot.However , what followed afterwards and for succeeding attempts at getting the thing to be recognized by your PC would be what I call my own form of digital gambling . Some days the device works when I plug it in , and some days it does n't . The odds are usually not in my favor.I would have much preferred a more expensive item that worked all the time .
 This card reader is n't any faster or more convenient than downloading directly with my digital camera , and was a lot less reliable . We bought a pcmcia reader and are much more satisfied with it .
 I ordered this card reader along with an Olympus E-20N camera from Amazon as part of a necessary upgrade to meet a professional deadline . Shipping was very fast on both.The card reader did not work after three attempts to install the software -LRB- even though the papers with it say it 's very simple -RRB- . We have an 8-month old Dell computer running Windows ME , we 're fairly up to date , front USB port and all , but the computer just kept asking for a disk to be inserted in the drive . -LRB- The computer sees the reader as another drive . -RRB- Customer support was useless , when we called we had two options - leave a message -LRB- and you know how that goes -RRB- , or push the live body button . Since there was a time element involved , we tried to use the live body option , which immediately sent us to the voice messaging . And an announcement that the voice messaging bin was full.The other option was sending an email on their site , and again , you know how that goes . I could n't wait from 24 hours to maybe never.I had no more time to fiddle with the thing , my deadline was already too close to be comfortable . The card reader was junked and I bought another brand locally.Mine may have been a defective unit , but I 'm not at all impressed and wo n't buy this brand again .
 First of all you must select an adequate tool for opening the plastic package -- i.e. , jack-hammer , cutting torch , bolt cutter , etc. . After extracting it I found a very small operation/installation manual which appears to be roughly translated from Hungarian . I shut down all applications including Norton 's Anti-Virus and then put the Installation CD in the tray and closed the door . Upon following the installation directions with great care -LRB- 4 times -RRB- and working around the warning messages my Windows XP system displayed I finally got to the point where the last window told me to remove all disks from drives and click on the ` Finish ' button . I did , with expectations of finding a new drive icon displayed in the ` My Computer ' screen as the manual said should happen . No such luck . But I did then plug the thing in -LRB- you are warned not to plug it in untill the driver is installed -RRB- and a pretty little green light came on and the computer made a couple of clunking noises like it does when the camera is hooked up to the USB port ; but alas , no icon and no reading of the memory card . I am told that a crazy person will carefully and repeatedly perform a series of identical steps and then be surprised by identical outcomes . That is what this device caused me to do.I shall now proceed to the next level of frustration which I expect to result when I try to get Office Depot to take this item back.One nice thing about it which may justify awarding it that single star is that the uninstall program included on the CD works perfectly .
 The Digital Media Reader may work well with Windows 98 , Me or 2000 , but it failed miserably with XP . To add insult to injury when the SimpleTech web site was queried ; mis-information was the best they could give.During the hardware installation , the media reader -LRB- UCS-200 -RRB- did not pass the Windows Logo Testing . I immediately aborted the process . I went to the Simpletech web site for advice . SimpleTech had a section just for XP and stated , '' just ignore Windows 's warning and complete the setup process '' . What a mistake I made , my operating system was degraded and became unstable . Until I 'm able to recover from this misfortune , my computer shuts down whenever and frequent.The news of bad and mis-leading service will spread exponentially from person to person . I hope that this is the exception and not the rule for SimpleTech.Because of wrong information from the SimpleTech web site , I can not recommend a SimpleTech Product in the future .
 Like some of them for this piece of -LSB- junk -RSB- . It 's fabulous . It solved all of my problems . Next thing you know these fools will be trying to convince you that it 'll eliminate world hunger . I bought one of these and used it maybe 5 times in about 2 months with my smartmedia card . After that it just stopped working . I know it was connected correctly because the drives continued to map to it , but when I inserted either card and tried to access the data on it I was given a message to insert a card . Avoid this product
 I Instaled this at home , and it 's not compatible with windows XP , it crash my windows system , and in the support page from simple tech there is not a good solution for this problem .
 I bought this card to because it is a reasonably priced dual moniter card . I have two CRT 's -LRB- 21 '' and 19 '' -RRB- and wanted to increase my desktop real estate . It does not work well for this purpose . Installation was easy in my Dell 8100 system , but there is only one vga plug on the card , the other is DVI . Great if you have a LCD , but otherwise you must use an expensive adapter ... Anyway , the output from the DVI port is of very poor quality . This may be because of the adapter , but regardless . it does not have a useful second output . Too bad , now I 'm trying to use two separate card , which will be much harder to configure .
 Good parts
 I bought this card , and within minutes of purchasing the card on Amazon.com I tried to cancell it , I purchased the wrong card . I tried all the right way of trying to cancell it , but it looks like Amazon can get a card ready for shipping within minutes of a purchase , but the delivery date is August 15 . I have written you an email , now how long will it take to get a response with Amazon .

 It works in my Sony DSC-S85 camera , but not in my Sony camcorder . It gives a format error . I 'm not sure why the difference because it works fine in the camera . If I would have known that it would work only in the camera , I would have purchased the Sony Stick .
 There are some many memory cards in the market , that I think the list of the camera brands and models should be available with the product description so it will be easier to find the more convenient for the one we are looking for , or when asking for products all of the choices for a specific brand of cameras will be presented in the results.R Limon
 I have n't used it yet !!! The plastic packaging is ridiculous , wasteful and HAZARDOUS as I just managed to cut myself trying to open it . Seriously , what a waste of resources . I ca n't imagine the energy and waste used just for the packaging . Why go through the effort of marketing and sitting around a conference room discussing how cool it would be to package a MEMORY STICK with razor sharp plastic with a neat colorful cardboard backround just so it can be thrown away to forever stay on the face of this earth to injure another person !!!? ah !! For a MEMORY STICK ? Gim me a break !!
 I have had my case for 2 weeks and the leather is peeling off the binding center part . Also , the magnets do n't line up right and I have to give it an adjustment to put the iPad to sleep . And last but not least , when I try to fold the cover back so it can stand , it always unfolds itself . If u want a smart cover , I would get the real thing .
 Ok , First of all , I have only 22 days using this device and Im sick of it.Software : The package comes with the 7.5 version of the Multimedia Center , if you have WindowsXP dont even try to watch DVD with the DVD player that comes with that version ... Tha machine will always freeze . Also happens with the file player and eve worse with the TV Capture.Hardware : Graphics Card was much better than my Nvidia GForce 2 MX/200 . A lot faster , the Cable TV looks very poor but still you could watch your favorite programs , but still poor.BIG REMOTE CONTROL ISSUE !!!!!!! The remote receiver -LSB- is bad -RSB- !!! I dont know why but one day it just stop working and thats not all , my USB Ports doesnt work anymore . My Microsoft Optical USB Mouse is useless now . The only thing that works is my MP3 Jukebox and My Camera , thats it . I could not plug any other device in it . I tried several times to plug the USB remote freq . receiver and then I started to smell like `` burned circuit '' . Yeap , that was all for my excellent remote control ... Right now Im trying to get the people at ATI to help and still no response.Please do not buy this item . Try to find something else in the market ... Im going back to my nvidia card .
 I bought this card for a few reasons , the two primarily were for the TV tuner and the specs on the display adapter . I figured a combo card would save time , money and room . The hardware on the card is great , the software and drivers are buggy . Took me two days to get a near perfect installation . Let me just make a very long story short.I tested with the following OS
 You just want to use your computer as a digital VCR right ? It 's unlikely you 'll be doing so anytime soon with this video card . The TV feature would n't work until I uninstalled my NIC and USB . TV and DVD work fine now , but the capture -LRB- record -RRB- feature does n't record any audio . Yes , yours may be ok , but here 's one more thing
 I purchased aiw 7500 aprox . 1yr . ago . I thought it was a decent card when I bought it at that point would have given it a 4star rating . Within three months the card started freezing my machine while using DVR . Then more reciently the video with the tuner started flashing bright than dark . It happens all the time making the tuner unusable . I have found no resolution to my problems from ati . I 'm not angry just unsatisfied .
 I did n't know much about TV tuners when i bought this but I had to learn since i bought this.This product is for older systems and should be taken off the market cause it 's not up to the standard we expect today . i should have realized thais cause all the good reviews were from 10 years ago . Tech has changed alot since then . Do n't be fooled by the price on this -LRB- It 's not a good buy if you ca n't use it -RRB- . Pros
 I bought this card for a new custom built system and problems from the start . This card caused my computer to crash so often that I had to save games every 5 minutes to make any progress . I wrote an email to ATI and received an automated reply advising me to update the driver . After downloading 5 files and spending over an hour with DSL I updated the drivers . Still the system crashed all the time . Finally the card totally failed with a boot to black screen and I sent it back to ATI for repairs . I purchased a PNY Geoforce Ti 420 to keep my computer going and suddenly NO CRASHING , NONE ! It was so wonderful . I dug up the games that were too frustrating because of the crashes and they were perfect . ATI sent the card back and said that they could n't find anything wrong with it . Well I ca n't find anything right with it .
 I ordered this card as a replacement for my AIW Rage 128 which was working fairly well but showing it 's age . I read various bad reviews for other ATI AIW cards but I decided to go ahead as I consider myself an expert user and would not be dealing with the DV ports that are present in the AIW 8500DV . What a mistake . ATI 's drivers that come in the retail box are nearly always junk and these are no exceptions . The intall process is very tricky as well in that you must remove all drivers , files , etc associated with your previous card BEFORE installing the drivers . The problem is that ATI does not document this process well in the manual . The install crashed my XP system from the beginning . I then booted to safe mode , removed all current drivers , etc. . Then rebooted again and decided to work in VGA mode to update to the latest drivers . Once I had those drivers installed , problems were still present . The system will run for a few minutes but the lock and reboot . I confirmed with Microsoft tech support that this is a know issue regarding the Radeon chip . I have gone back and forth with ATI tech support including making various adjustments to AGP BIOS settings , flashing the BIOS , installing the latest chipset drivers , etc , but still nothing.Just as an FYI , I have a gigabyte motherboard with the VIA KT333 chipset with an AMD XP processor . Hopefully it will save you some grief if you have a similar system.Why ca n't ATI get it together ?! It would be so nice to buy something that actually does what it says it does , and warn of its incompatibility with certain systems . Have to go return this piece of junk now .
 I ended up w / this burner as a warranty replacement for my first VeloCD , which went toes up after about a month . Less than a year later , I have a completely useless burner that stalls at 6 % and then freezes my entire system . After NUMEROUS emails and phone calls to TDK , I finally got `` authorization '' to send it in for replacement . I am so fed up , I am going to buy a Lite-On and wash my hands of it.Look elsewhere ... this burner is not work the carboard box it is packaged in .
 Worst purchase ever!First , this was for audio only , no video required . Receiver and transmitter were about 50 feet apart , with clear line of sight . No walls , no barriers -LRB- let me say that again , 50 feet of air ... -RRB- . Audio had almost continuous , LOUD , pops and crackles in it . Tried the units on all eight channels and NO difference ... Tried adjusting the gain on both units ... Any human movement near the transmitter made the pops and crackles even worse.Second , the unit I received had been opened before . Bags were not sealed , wire ties on power supplies missing , RCA cables were loose . Unit was missing one RCA to BNC adapter!Third , NO support of any kind , either ships with the unit nor is available on line.Failure to work ... Failure to help me MAKE it work ... Failure in sending me a complete unit ... The Terk wireless units are sketchy and cheap and a crap shoot at best , and they are rock solid pieces of engineering compared to this hunk of junk.The ONLY positive thing I can say about this unit is that it comes in a sporty metal housing ...
 The listing states that it works at 1000 ' take away a 0 and it might work at 100 ' . Do n't waste your money if you are hoping on going from room to room . if you need it in the same room that would be fine .
 I bought the system with the amplifier to run from one building to another -LRB- 250 feet -RRB- . It worked fine in the building the transmitter was located , but the quality completely fell apart once I crossed into the second building . I saw a forum where someone recommended a different high-gain antenna and tried contacting the company for suggestions for over a week with zero response . The tech support voice mailbox was full , the operator never answered the phone and I left repeated messages there . I tried e-mailing and calling every department I could locate . Half the phone numbers were disconnected and no response on the e-mails either.The product might have worked fine if I had a little tech support from the company . But as it stands I 'm going on the assumption that RF-Link has gone out of business and so I 'm returning my purchase .
 It 's a great concept ... . connecting A/V devices over a short distance without wires . However , the Rf Link system does n't quite make it a reality . I tried very hard to use the system to connect a camcorder to a TV/monitor . Even at a very short distance of 10 feet , the signal continously drops . I even tried adding the `` optional '' Rf Link output booster . However , any movement near or between the transmitter and receiver -LRB- still at 10 feet -RRB- causes the signal to drop out ... . totally unacceptable and unusable . The only happy note was Amazon 's great customer service and return policy .
 You get audio signal onlt with no picture when you try to capture home movie from comcaorder tape . In very few case , I captured the video footage , but i just get the audio when you paly it back.When you sent the problem to ADS customer service , you get automatical e-mail response said they will respond to your questions ASAP . but , you never get e-mail unless you call them . the phone line is so busy , you would n't be so patient .
 Inserting this card in my new Minolta Dimage 7i -LRB- digital camera -RRB- , I get an `` Unable to use card '' error . The card is evidently incompatible with the 7i . Others have had the same experience . See the digital camera forums.Check the compatibility chart at minoltausa.com before you buy !
 This card worked great in my Canon G3 digital camera for few months , and the ` CF Card Error ' started happending -LRB- as some of the other reviewers have also experienced -RRB- . I reformatted the disk few times and I 'm still getting that error when I turn on my camera . Since it has a life time warranty on it , I 'm RMA it back to SimpleTech .
 The card is n't very good and stores pictures too slowly , especialy as you start to fill up the memory . Also SimpleTech 's customer support is n't too good . Not one person could tell me what the ` Error Application ' message meant when using the Simple Tech CompactFlash Card Reader to get pictures from the card.Stay away from this company .
 I bought a SimpleTech CompactFalsh card of 256Mb to use with my digital camera -LRB- Minolta DiMAGE 7i -RRB- but it does not work ! The card works fine on my PC , but there is a compatibility problem with the digital cam . I guess SimpleTech must be aware of the problem since their tech support e-mailed me that they would post a patch on their website as soon as they would find one , but of course I had no clue of the compatibility issue before buying the card , so I hope this might help some potential buyers ...
 I wonder if the guy from Chicago was on to something when he mentioned the possible lack of good QC with these guys ?! My card did n't lock anything up , but it was n't as responsive as two other brands that I currently use -LRB- I wo n't name them so as to not start a brand loyalty debate -RRB- . I do believe that I wo n't try them again until I hit upon their `` good '' cards though .
 I bought a Simpletech 256 Compactflash card two months ago . I opened the package and put it in my Nikon Coolpix 2500 . I tried it by taking a couple of pictures . Suddenly , the card stopped working and my camera said CF card Error . :-LRB- That was only 10 minutes of using it . Then I tried it with a Canon G2 ... still did not work ... had to return it ...
 It 's very simple , everything I have ever owned by SimpleTech has died on me including this drive , 4 USB sticks , 3 SD cards , and 1 CF card . Not one of their products lasted me more than 2 years and caused me a lot of headache .
 Purchased SimpleTech 256 MB CF card to supplement the meager 32MB CF card which came with my new Canon A80 Camera.After a dozen pictures taken with the SimpleTech card , started getting CF errors on the camera display.Reviewed the Canon owners manual for this error , and acted upon the recommendation to format the card . After reformatting the SimpleTech card , still receive CF Errors when using in the camera after 1 or 2 photos . I am returning the SimpleTech card through Amazon 's wonderful return policy . I really do love this e-tailer ! My `` meager '' Cannon 32MB card is chugging along just fine ...
 ... I bought this card thinking I could install it in my FujiFilm FinePix S2Pro and have no problems , but I got errors that could not be cleared by in-camera or Windows formatting of the media.I have never had a problem with CompactFlash before , and of the half dozen manufacturers I have , including Lexar , Sandisk , Nikon-branded , Fuji-branded and some Brand-x I picked up at Frys , all of them work in my S2Pro , whereas only one of the SimpleTech cards will.Better safe than sorry !
 I purchased the 256 mb compactflash card to increase the number of photos I could take , however after inserting it into my Minolta Dimage 7i , it gives a message of `` Unable to use card '' . I emailed Amazon with the results of my problem , and also asked if others had the same problem -LRB- they did not state there was any problem -RRB- and they promptly sent me another thinking I only had a bad compactflash . The SECOND one also gives the same message . I will be returning both . I have purchased another brand somewhere else and it works fine . So , If you own the Minolta Dimage 7i - save yourself some time and headaches in returning it - THIS WILL NOT WORK !
 It works with SimpleTech STI-UCF100 Reader , but not with Minolta 7i . It says `` Unable to use card '' . Formating does not help .
 Worst product in its class ! Oh , well , you get what you paid for : - -LRB-
 I saw the negative reviews and thought it must be user error or bad luck to blame , but I 'm afraid it 's all true . My brand new Simpletech card has gone mysteriously crazy , within 10 minutes of popping it in my Canon S230 . I do n't care what the explanation is , frankly -- card error is a scary thing to see . Magically , replacing my trusty -LRB- if allegedly slower -RRB- SanDisk cards rectifies all problems . I swear , I did nothing wrong -- it 's idiot proof . This card is just wacky .
 After 6 months of very light use , this card decided to fatally crash while on an importaqnt trip , taking 100 or so important shots with it . Can not afford to use this kind of quality again .
 Sure enough , I tried to get away cheap , and got bit in the you-know-where for it . Three months after buying it , the card is unusable . The lifetime guarantee ? You need the original packaging and receipt . I suppose I can only really blame myself for not saving it all , but hey , it was a well reviewed $ 20 card , right ? So now it 's a holiday , with everyplace closed , and I have no flash card . You get what you pay for .
 It seems nice enough and it 's cheap , but it is apparently incompatible with the Canon Powershot Digital Elphs . For use with those cameras , buy Sandisck instead . Seriously .
 After a few uses , I got CF Card Error during a function at home with my Canon G3 . Going to try if I can get a replacement . Even with that , I do n't think I will be using this for any important events.When I buy a card next time , I have to read each and every review and see how many people with G3 got into trouble .
 After reading some posts , I decided to see for myself how this card performed . I purchased two and put them to the test . I also like to use CF as a quick mini backup system using a usb reader . For reasons I ca n't explain , the first card would cause my whole system to pretty much freeze up . To double check if it was something else , I reproduced the problem 3 more times . I did n't think that would be likely but when I popped in my trusty Lexar , no prob !! So on to the second card . Guess what , no freezes , but the folks in the `` it 's a slow card '' camp are right ! Maybe the company just has a problem with their quality control division or maybe a bad batch got out or who knows ? I just know I do n't feel like saving a couple dollars is worth the headaches . Mine were returned . Good luck , though ...
 I purchased this product new , but I would swear it was used . Possibly UPS is at fault , but I ca n't tell . The box was beaten up pretty bad and I was missing quite a few pieces . I spent and extra 15 dollars and half a day trying to figure out what was missing . I would have just sent it back , but I had paid someone to come help me mount it . And you need help!The other issue would be that the universal mount is n't really all that universal . By universal they mean for some TV 's , but not others . There are quite a few versions of this product and you have to be careful you order the right one . So do n't assume that by universal they really mean universal . There is a CL-L , UCL and a UCL-X mount , but you also have to contend with the adapter . My universal mount adapter is right over the inputs of my TV . When you look at the pictures of them you might wonder how can it block his inputs ? But what they sometimes do and do n't show you in the picture is the adapter that connects to your TV which you connect to the universal mount . While the mounts may be universal the adapters are n't There is a UAL and UAM adapter.I spent alot of time trying to get the right one , but still did n't get the pefect fit . I made it work and it made the install a little more difficult , but for the price I wanted it to be perfect.Now given the above , there is one undebatable issue with this product . The cabling system is not good . I ca n't even fit one HDMI cable through it because the screw for the cabling system runs right through the middle of the cabling system . My HDMI cables are about 5/16 of an inch thick . The end of the cabling system itself is about 1/2 of an inch with that darn screw right through the middle of it . Meaning I can only fit small cables through it . My power cable fits and a composite video for the VCR , but that 's it . I have attached my 2 HDMI cables , 1 S-video and 1 RCA cable to the bottom of the mount with velcro . I wasted alot of time trying to get them to fit only to give up in the end.Also , you can only use 1/2 of the cabling system or else the mount wo n't push back flat against the wall . Which leads to my final criticism and this is dependant on your setup . My TV sticks out a full 7 inches from the wall . No big deal when you are standing in front of the TV . But when you come into the room you are walking along the wall the TV is mounted on and it looks sort of ugly . It 's not that big of a deal to me , but my wife commented that it looks ugly from the side and she is right.Now for the love part ... when we pull the TV out 2 feet from the wall to watch a movie it looks fantastic . The TV sort of hovers in the air and jumps out from the wall making for a real larger than life movie effect.If I had a room where you did n't see the mount when you walked into the room I could be pretty happy with it despite the cabling system . But if you are going to have to look at the TV from the side when entering the room you might consider something else .
 Purchased the Omni Mount UCL-L for my 40 '' LCD . I 'll have to admit that the unit appears extremely sturdy and well built but it does come with one minor flaw - if a part is missing there is no way to get a replacement part . My specific issue was the bracket at the end of the arm that connects to the plate securing the display . The part was not in the box so I called Omni Mount to get a replacement part . They assured me the piece was part of the assembly when it left the factory and there was no way to get me a replacement part . I now have a $ 250 mount that is useless . Got ta think that if they are correct , I wound up with a used or salvaged unit .
 This is a very sturdy mount . It is extremely heavy and as other reviewers have noted , it is complicated to setup . The one big drawback is how far out the TV sticks when you have the mount completely pushed in . We wound up buying another mount that sat more flush to the wall . I would recommend a different mount unless you need something this sturdy that can rotate the TV verticle .
 I purchased this card with the adapter . The card worked fine in my cell phone , but when I used plugged it into the adapter , my computer would n't read it . I know it was n't my computer because other cards work fine . I contacted the company and one rep gave me the run around -LRB- via email -RRB- . So I called them and the man was kind enough to send me a new adapter free of charge . That one did n't work either !! Waste of money !
 This is a good card - if you can not afford the higher priced ones . 64MB DDR , Great - but there are multiple problems with the Gamma . Most of my games need to be touched up a bit by going into the settings and putting the brightness up.I tried to play WarCraft III , Everquest , Age of Mythology and NeverWinter Nights - had problems with all of these games.If you are looking for a good card - to get by on - this is for you.If you are a heavy gamer - DO N'T THINK ABOUT IT.Your best bet is to stick with any of the GeForce cards - I just purchased the Xtasy 64MB DDR GeForce 4 card - what a difference ... Hope this helps ...
 I purchased the Radeon 7000 and found that it was not supported by Madden 2003 , so I went to replace it with one that was and found out that the ATI software was everywhere on my hard drive . ATI makes it impossible to remove the programs . I ended up having to format the whole hard drive !! I would not recommend this product to anyone .
 This card is completely incompatible with Emachines ' Tri-Gem Motherboards . I uninstalled all of my previous video drivers because that is what ATI told me to do when I unsuccessfully installed their card . Their automated Tech Support is useless and their phone support costs -LSB- $ $ $ -RSB- a minute ! I finally talked to Emachines ' tech support and they told me that it would never work with my PC . I told them it was a good thing Circuit City has a No-Hassle 14 day return policy . I give this card 1 star because I ca n't give it any less than that .
 I purchased this item for my son , and it did not work right out of the box . I followed all the terrible instructions , and it still did not work . I went to the Coby website for answers , and there was nothing there either . I then attempted over 20 tiems to contact Coby via telephone , and was never able to get through . I finally returned the product for a different bran . I STRONGLY suggest buying something else with a longer battery life . and MUCH better support and documentation .
 I bought this as a gift for my husband , and he is so disappointed that I did n't choose something of higher quality . I read all the reviews and thought it sounded like a good first mp3 player that he could use to work out . At first , I could n't download his music onto it at all , which turned out to be a simple thing
 Jacket is good to just protect your portfolio , but a handle and/or strap would be helpful to carry your portfolio .
 I did not realize that I needed a PCI Port card and the web site did not indicate this requirement nor that this card was AGI . My son pointed it out to me after I ordered the card . When I contacted Tiger Direct , they did not know that it needed an AGI slot . They told me to call the Distributor - Diamond , who after a 35 minute wait on hold , said it was not his product -LRB- it was -RRB- . When the card arrived and I confirmed that it was not PCI , I was able to return it and get a full refund . It was a hassle taking the box to be returned . I would have preferred to know about this before I ordered it .
 I bought this in particular because I had a USB device that no longer worked and it appeared to be because of a dirty connection . It really seemed like something an IT person should keep handy . Unfortunately , the cleaning heads are too big to clean a USB `` A '' cable end - which is what I really needed . If you want to clean the ports in your computer it will do that , but not the adapters themselves .
 This item is on sale , for a reason . It is not any better than the original one that came with the speaker . Very thin wires . Very dissapointing . I had to go to best buy and spend $ 35 to get some better wires .
 Sharing my experience with a recent purchase of velodyne vx-11Why i say poor product quality ? 1 . Unit not working and faulty which means no quality assessment and checks2 . Volume control knob connected in the ICs are not working which means potential sub standard material . Is this a common issue in china made products and patented in the US ? 3 . Amp was found faulty yet this is a new product.Another example of poor QC check and poor components.Why I say bad service reputation ? 1 . I was upfront when I placed the order that the product will be used in Singapore and even requested for 220 voltage product . My request was declined due to policy though they sell 220 voltage to the local dealer in sg .2 . I placed the order and mentioned that I will use a step down power converter to make it work . I was not informed that the unit is not able to support power converter only later on when I reported that the product is not working .3 . When I received the unit and found that it is not working , I felt they are not committed to help and was told that the warranty has been voided because the product was used outside US . I was informed that the unit is not able to support converter . They even mentioned shipping as possible cause of damage . Any service check will be my cost .4 . Went to see a known service center and found that the problem is not due to the converter . Infact the internal components when the service staff open the sub has a 110 and 230 volts selection . The problem are not associated to shipping because they are internal parts .5 . Requested technical team to call me or write some troubleshooting steps but no response .
 I purchased this because of the good reviews . . but I did n't have a good experience . Putting the card in was easy enough ... but once I got it in , the signal was 14 % ... so I thought ... ok . . we are 2 floors away ... maybe it 's not close enough . So I moved it to the room 10 feet away from the wireless router . . and I still only got 14 % and it kept dropping connection . I messed with the settings for several hours and could n't get any better connection . Uninstalled , returned to Amazon at their expense for a prompt refund . . and purchase the WRT54G . I get over 80 % with that !
 The card did not work . Customer service did not respond . The attenna did help boost the linksys card I ended up installing .
 OK , I bought this card after reading all the nice reviews , but in fact , it sucks . The official website does n't have a driver for windows 7 . It took me hours to find a driver from its chip manufactur . Now the computer finally recognized the card and can be connected to the router , but 80 % of the time , the only thing you see when opening up a browswer is `` server not found '' . It 's on its way back to amazon . If you are eager to try out windows 7 when it 's out , avoid this card as best as you can .
 okay , first of all it works , but the thing is that the antenna it comes with is sort of short , i mounted it to the top of my case , but it just looks sketchy.Secondly , the antenna broke on me today , and if you dont have the antenna connected to the pci screw in-no wireless ... the screw in -LRB- with the little black tape that goes around the wire -RRB- is very sensitive almost to the point where its unfair . and like i said , no antenna no connection . my antenna broke off at the base and it makes the wireless pci care useless.And lastly , like i mentioned before the antenna looks like something out of the 80 's with a little cliche tabletop design , but i just mounted it to the top of my case , and it still gets in the way when i take my case out to work on it.Im sure that this wireless card works fine connectivity and signal and all that , but once your antenna breaks its all over - NO MORE CONNECTION
 did not work with both desktop with xp even download driver from site no help so return it .
 This product constantly connects and disconnects every two seconds . I have an HP and the connector plates do n't line up either . Every two seconds the included program refreshes the network list and connects and disconnects . It does not work .
 This product will come up with the networks in the area . If you put in the network pass key it will connect then immediately disconnect . I bought it because I do n't have alot of money and I wanted to get a wireless adapter cheap . Do n't buy . Fork out the extra money on a better adapter .
 Total porqueria de repente dejo de conectarse , veo todas las redes pero no puede conectarse . lo barato sale caro
 1 -RRB- Too many options to make it run smoothly .2 -RRB- Not a plug & play3 -RRB- Breaks connection haphazardly
 I tried for over a month to fine tune the settings to keep the connection from dropping . But intermittently the connection would always fail . Sometimes after an hour and other times after 24 hours . If I stopped the device through the device manager and then restarted it , it would usually reconnect for awhile . I finally gave up and bought a Linksys WMP54G . Which works great . Maybe I just got a lemon .
 Installation was relatively simple , but the receiver seemed not sensitive enough for the location.After successfully connecting a mac mini with airport at the same location , I was convinced that the problem was the adapter . I installed another adapter , linksys , that worked immediately . Perhaps the super G will work in locations with clear line of site access , but it was not strong enough for my environment . I had to spend the extra money to get a working solution .
 Tried and failed to get my pc set up on our Airport 802.11 g network . Vista did not recognize the card ; XP recognized the card but would only let me join the network when we turned security off . I 'm sure that this is a Windows problem more than it is the fault of the wireless card , but still -- could n't get this product to work and now we have to buy another card .
 Works great most of the time . BUT , keeps losing settings thus my internet drops . I have to reinstall drivers every couple of days .
 I bought this adapter and it is going right back to Amazon . I installed it and the software would not load properly . I have a 6 month old HP machine running Vista . After searching the net , I found Vista drives , but they did n't work , either.What a piece of junk.I bet the hardware is fine , but without good software , forget it.I bought a Linksys WMP54G .
 I ordered this thinking it would be simple to plug it in and go . I 'm above average on wireless network setup , and this thing disconnects whenever it wants to . I 've got three computers on my network
 This PCI card is easy to install , and so is the software . The interface of the software is also good . However , the cable connecting the antenna and the card is too short , making it difficult and often impossible to find a good location for the antenna to have stable strong signal . This is especially true if the PC is located under a desk . The cable is too short for the antenna to reach the desk . My desk has metal legs , which may interfere with the wireless signals . I used this card for a year and was often irritated by the need for tweaking the position of antenna to get stable signal . Since PCs are not to be moved around , if possible , installing a network cable will be a far better solution than wireless . I finally bought an RJ45 crimper , connectors , and cat5e bulk cable -LRB- for about $ 80 total -RRB- to connect several rooms to my router . I wish I had done this at the beginning to save the money on this card .
 We chose this printer because of the network capability . The first printer stopped functioning correctly after three weeks . To print , we had to turn the printer off , then back on , and then print . We had to do this every time we wanted to print . HP sent us a replacement printer , and it worked correctly for 4 days . After over an hour on the phone with HP , I was told the printer is not very stable in a network application , and we should use the printer via a USB connection . If HP knows the unit is not stable in a network environment , then HP should correct the problem , or stop selling the unit .
 I bought this printer and printserver separate so at any time I could switch out the printer without having to buy another wireless network ready printer . Problem is the HP Laserjet 1020 does n't work with either the Netgear or Linksys Printservers which boggles the mind . My customer wa n't happy and neither am I.
 I used this printer for a year , it was working fine , and never got paper jam , and working fine with windows XP , and Vista . However margin is notperfect exact . every time when I print my document out margin is always littel different . I printed out same page 10 times every margin of paper is different . it was very annoying meMy toner was out last week , so I got the other printer -- Brother HL-2070N Network Monochrome Laser Printer -LRB- Black -RRB- -- I think it is better than this one.it is five dollars cheaper than HP.and spec is higer than HP.brother HL-2070N VS HP1020Print speed
 This printer , though mostly functional when connected to a Windows box , did not work without significant amounts of effort when connected to a Mac . Customer support at HP was not helpful in resolving my Mac connectivity issues . I eventually got it working with some 3rd party tools , but then the printer power supply died . I called HP customer support again and was told to buy a new HP printer.Needless to say , this is the last HP printer I will own . I suggest looking at some of the Brother models instead .
 Worked great when I had XP . Now that I 've upgraded to Vista , it 's a $ 200 paperweight with collateral doorstop duties . No Vista driver , Bummer .
 Well after my printer almost lasted one year , and completely became useless just out of the warranty time ... started searching the web for the 1020 support group.I see probably what we all see when our wonderful 1020 dies.Well , it does n't DIE , it slowly comes apart , the piece of gray film , called TEFLON starts coming apart . Your printing will be sloppy , then your printer will start eating paper . Then you will look on here and see that you shouldhave bought the DELL monochrome , OR you SHOULD DEFINITELY BY AN EXTENDED WARRANTY . Buttttt , , , , what is up with those laser cartridges . They do notlist any yield size . I 'm not happy with HP right now , can you tell ?
 It 's not true . when I received the printer , I found that the printer did not have any cartridge . so , I had to buy the cartridge . the information is not true . be careful . I was very upset .
 Buyer beware ! I had purchased at least a dozen of these printers for our office , after nearly 1 1/2 years using these printers , we now only have 2 of these still working . This HP product is nothing more than an expensive paper weight . There is a confirmed , major flaw when you print PDF files to it and HP/Adobe do n't seem to care about resolving the issue . If you check out the HP support forum on this product you will discover that when printing from Adobe Acrobat , it will crash the print spool service and keep crashing -LRB- if you try restarting the service -RRB- . You have to jump through hoops deleting files from your Windows system directory and if you want to print a pdf file , you have to go to print ... -- > click Advanced button and place a check mark in `` Print as image '' for it to work , and it may not work in all situations . The forum members have discussed possible work arounds at length , but the problems still exist.On top of that , I 've had several of these things shedding off thin , plastic or mylar sheeting that must be part of the drum , ruining any chance of salvage . After several month of use , most of these printers in our office began squealing so bad , that I just had to trash them and replace them with something else.HP is really starting to let me down with the quality of their products . We have an HP 4Plus that is at least 15 years old and it is still going strong . I 've had nothing but trouble with HP over the past several years and have now opted to replace our office laser printers with Brother .
 After trying to work around the issue for days , I got on line with HP customer support . This printer will not print a pdf from acrobat . If you want the ability to print a PDF , you have to download a third party program -LRB- FinePrint -RRB- set it as your default `` printer '' to which you `` print '' all your documents , and then print to the printer from FinePrint . As I work in a business in which a LOT of documents are electronic , and in PDF format , the printer is worthless . Even on the HP website , on THIS printer 's data page , there is a `` Printable Data Sheet '' in PDF format . Well , on any other printer in the world , it would be `` printable . '' Not on this little paperweight .
 This printer is inexpensive and fast but does not seem to work with either Linksys -LRB- WPS54G -RRB- printservers , DLink printservers -LRB- DP-G310 -RRB- , or Hawking printservers -LRB- HWPS1UG -RRB- . I went through several phone calls with excellent support people at both Linksys and Hawking Technology to no avail . I upgraded firmware and installation programs but as far as the printservers are concerned the HP does not exist on the network.I have no idea what the problem could be but the HP1020 is not printserver friendly as far as I can tell . It is not as if I am running some obscure printservers either . The printerserver 's company 's products are well known and stable .
 This is a very nice printer and a good upgrade from an inkjet printer . It is fast , quiet , and produces good results . However , it lacks a Vista driver so it no longer works with my upgraded Vista computer . HP is really dragging their feet on providing a driver .
 Much to my chagrin , my new HP s7320n desktop computer began locking up as soon as I connected this printer to it . After two working days of diagnostics , restarts , and even taking the computer back to where I bought it for an exchange , an arcane service bulletin said that this printer is not compatible with this computer.A sign of how far down HP has slid ... an HP printer -LRB- which is otherwise a pretty good printer -RRB- that is not compatible with an HP computer.Seriously.So , before you buy one of these , make sure it will work with your HP computer ...
 Yesterday , HP pulled the Mac OS X driver for the 1022 from its website , most likely because of Mac users buying 1020s and installing the driver to workaround it . I have not spoken to any HP people to confirm this , but I did download the driver on Tuesday , and after deleting it , found out I needed it again . Only today the driver is gone and the date the page was updated was May 18th ! Nice job , HP !
 I 'll never buy a HP product again - sitting here with a Laserjet 1020 I 'll never be able to use again after upgrading to Vista . Tried all fixes and workarounds , no luck.HP LaserJet 1020 Printer -LRB- Q5911A #ABA -RRB-
 Based on the reviews here , in particular the one pointing out the $ 10 driver CD , I purchased the 1020 . After checking all of the driver download pages -LRB- both for 1020 and 1022 -RRB- and confirming the lack of a driver for OS X , I ordered the $ 10 CD off of the 1022 page.Once the CD arrived , it had nothing to install on my MacBook Pro and the printer remained useless . It took 3 calls to HP support to get credited for the $ 10 , at least returning the printer to Amazon was easy . One HP support person even tried to argue with me that the `` 1020 Series '' title used on the CD driver page did n't actually refer to the 1020 itself ! Finally , the 3rd support person stated that their page had a typo and credited me back for the $ 10 . I 've since replaced the hp 1020 with a brother HL-2070N . It installed just as you 'd expect and works great with both my Power PC and Intel based Macs . Only warning with that printer is that it makes an audible buzzing sound even when sitting in standby .
 I agree with the reviewer who said it was inexcusable that HP still has no Vista driver for this printer.It worked great when I had XP , but then I was forced to upgrade to Vista due to other issues and of course the printer has been sitting like a lump under my desk for two months now!I 'm quite unhappy with HP 's timetable of releasing a driver by JULY . Come on guys , Vista was in beta for how long ? It 's not as if you did n't know it was coming.And I tried using the original CD that came with the printer to install on Vista , the way another reviewer suggested . I could n't get it to work no matter what.For that one week between getting the printer and installing Vista , it was great . I would have given it 4 stars out of 5 .
 I love this printer . But it transformed from a great little printer into a useless piece of plastic when I upgraded to Vista -LRB- on one machine -RRB- and XP 64-bit -LRB- on my other machine -RRB- . HP 's customer support was useless . The worst thing is that they actually have the drivers available on the website , but you have to purchase them for $ 20 and wait for a CD to arrive . They might be available for download sometime in 2008 , but I 'm not holding my breath.C ` mon HP , you 're dropping the ball . I just recommended that our office manager buy a fancy , big , expensive Lexmark for our new network printer because I was annoyed with your customer support . So this little decision to ask me for $ 20 for the drivers just cost you about $ 1000 in a lost sale .
 Installing one of these printers is always a miserable experience . The install program constantly tries to load USB printing support FOR WINDOWS 98 , leading to an `` unrecognized object '' . The only way to get a working install on the first try is if you have already installed some other kind - any kind - of USB printer in the past.Doesn ' t work well with network print servers or USB switches.Extremely finicky as to which USB cable it will work with , need to have 2 or 3 cables on hand to find one it will accept . Of course HP does n't provide one.I do n't have time for this kind of nonsense every time one of my users needs a new printer , and have switched to Brother .
 I like this printer a lot and would probably have given it 5 stars , but it gets a major demerit thanks to the fact that it does not work with computers running Vista . HP will not be releasing the drivers until July of this year . So if you want to print now and not wait six months , and you 've already upgraded to Vista , I recommend getting a different printer . Hopefully HP will get the message and release some drivers . Vista has been in beta for a long time , so I find this delay to be inexcusable .
 The LaserJet 1020 is a fine printer for use with older operating systems . It produces high quality output when attached to my Windows 98SE box . But it does n't print at all when attached to my new computer with its XP Pro x64 operating system . The problem is there 's no compatible driver available , not on HP 's LaserJet 1020 installation disk and not on the HP website . I emailed HP Tech Support about the problem and they suggested two workarounds , using x64 drivers for other HP printer models , but neither worked . Tech Support now says to try working the problem via online chat . I 'll try that next time I have a block of several hours free , unless I give the printer away first .
 I ca n't beleive this printer only worked for 3 months . I bought it last Dec , but only start to use it 3 months ago . Now it stopped working . Does anybody know this printer has any warranty ? Thanks !
 The printer arrived in a box hardly big enough to contain it . Thin cardboard , very thin styrofoam and the printer did n't print . I contacted the seller . The seller sent a `` new '' cartridge . Still did n't print . The seller then had me send that printer back and sent another printer.It took a good two months to get the second printer which I have never bothered to open because it is futile.Instead , I used the cartridge they sent in my other HP that is the same model . Normally , one of those 12 A Cartridges lasts me a year of hard use . This one stopped working today !!!! I have not used it for even a month !!! These cartridges cost $ 86.00 ! This was the biggest ripoff I have ever experienced!Do not , do not fall into the same trap I did .
 I was very dissatisfied that the HP LaserJet 1020 installation software did not provide acceptable printer drivers for Windows XP or Vista .
 There is a known issue with this printer when printing PDFs . If you scan an image to a PDF and then attempt to print the PDF the printer spool crashes . Not only do you lose access to this printer but you also lose access to any other printer . The problem occurs with all Windows OSs but happens on a regular basis with Vista . Loaded several different print drivers recommended by HP but nothing worked . So proceed with caution .
 I must have got a lemon , because all the googling in the world does n't help me with my problem . My printer goes to sleep mode and never wakes up , even after a cold restart -LRB- I 'm using WinXP Pro SP2 -RRB- . Print jobs live indefinitely in the spooler and half the time need to be removed by restarting the spooler service . No one else seems to have the problem . However in debugging the issue , I 've had to go through 4 online chat sessions with HP , totalling almost 6 hours , each session being less useful than the previous . I 've tried different USB cables , different hubs , different ports , different drivers , and different computers . I 've tried printing directly , bypassing the spooler , and various print processor options . All at their recommendation and assurance that it would fix the problem -LRB- they must have scripted responses they copy/paste into the chat because all the English and grammar is consistently bad -RRB- . Finally they decided to replace the printer . They asked for my email address , mailing address , phone number , time of day to contact , and credit card number that will be on record in case I do n't return the defective unit . The request for the ccard number is via a phone call , not asked for online . During this call , they conclude my printer is out of the 1-year warranty . I bought this printer about 4 months ago , and its manufacturing date is n't even a year out yet . Now I have to dig up my proof of purchase and fax it to them . They gave me a fax number and nothing else . I had to ask if some kind of reference number would be needed and was first told no , then the rep put me on hold and came back with a case # that I have to put on the fax . This is asinine coming from a company such as HP.Terrible . Unacceptable . Can anyone recommend a non-HP brand that I can have some kind of perceptible competence at customer service , let alone product quality ? I am so sorry I ever laid eyes on this product . The defective unit is one thing , but the hoops I have to jump through when something goes wrong will keep me FAR away from any of HP 's products .
 This is a great printer until you begin to have spooler issues . It prints quickly & the ink lasts a long time ; however , after a short time of satisfactory use you will likely encounter a `` print spooler subsystem app has stopped working '' error message . This error occurred for me when trying to print pdf documents . The error prohibits any printing , the error message will pop up frequently -LRB- even when you have n't sent anything to the printer -RRB- and the issue never goes away -LRB- there are a few temporary fixes -RRB- . This error occurred three times for me and I had to finally replace this printer . The HP website has more information on this issue . I highly recommend researching this if you consider buying this printer ... but really , do n't waste your money .
 The printer produces crisp , clear black and white pages . The efficiency of toner usage is n't too bad.But I soon started having major problems with my computer system -- all peripherals using USB ports stopped being recognized by my Dell Dimension 2400 running Windows XP . What finally fixed the problem ? Disconnecting the HP printer . With the printer installed , nothing else connected to a USB port worked except the printer . With the printer removed , everything worked fine . Other -LRB- borrowed -RRB- printers hooked up to the computer worked just fine and did not cause the system-wide problems.I tried downloading a variety of device drivers and patches from HP , none of which solved the problem . I finally had to get another printer -- foolishly I bought another HP device -LRB- a C4280 All-in-One -- look for my review on that item -RRB- because they employ some people I know . A mistake on my part . In addition , HP does n't make a Mac-compatible driver for this printer .
 this may the only way you can do it . My netgear card would connect but could n't meet all the security imposed on it ... had to buy this expen $ ive little darling . Worked fine but I really dislike being held captive to one vendor to use a network . But it IS CISCO so why am I surprised ? regardless , performs well and is a bargain at half the price .
 I purchased the 350 wireless adapter as a second adaptor for a second laptop on my wireless LAN . My first laptop has a Compaq WL110 PCMCIA adaptor which out performs the Cisco hands down on range and connectivity . The Cisco comes with some fancy disgnostic tools which states signal to noise ratios with no loss whereas a simple ping test clearly displays packet loss . I am disappointed as a IT proffessional and someone who thought that a cisco card would be the best . Not the case , buy Compaq or 3com .
 If I tell the whole horrible story I could right a book , but I 'll give the run down on this deal :1 st TV
 As advertised , the unit is portrayed as an APC OEM replacement cartridge with OEM APC parts . When the unit arrived it was clearly a remanufactured item using batteries from `` ABC '' -LRB- manufactured in Vietnam -RRB- . The advertisement as presented does not mention that the item is a remanufactured part using non-OEM parts . This is my first experience with UnbeatableSale and it will certainly be my last .
 I bought this monitor back in August 06 . This is a very good LCD panel as a computer monitor or -LRB- HD -RRB- TV . All of a sudden , within 2 months , the monitor turns itself off automatically . The symptoms continued for a week and a few weeks later , it completely dies.I called Samsung Customer Service -LRB- 1-800-SAMSUNG -RRB- and they agreed to send a replacement . RMA arrived in a week , I hooked it up and ... viola . . there is a yellow vertical line in the middle of the screen . I called Customer Service again , and they agreed to send me 2nd RMA.I 'm crossing my fingers that I do not have to do RMA again.This is a really good monitor when it is working , customer service is very good too ... but . . very disappointing experience so far.My first monitor is manufactured in July 06 in Mexico.My second monitor is manufactured in September 06 in Mexico.I wonder if there are serious QA issues in Mexico .
 Well , i bought this monitor about 2 months ago . . at the time i also needed a tv . . so i thought this was a great buy . . took it home set it up and boy it was awesome ... the picture was great . . -LRB- internet -RRB- ... evrything was fine until about a month after i noticed that it would just shut down . . then i would try to turn it back on and it wouldnt . . so it takes for me to unplug for a few min then restart . . since then it still shuts down . . or freezez ... i think that this item in general is defective . . i noticed other people had the same problem . . as of right now im waiting for my replacement ...
 Well after my first one started turning itself off and requiring unplugged rest time before it would come back on I called Samsung . They shipped me a refurbished replacement and it worked for four days . Now it wo n't display anything . On to replacement number two ...
 i bought this 18 months ago . i purchased a refurb unitwell about 2 months ago the ps started to act up . $ 90.00 later it 's working again . Many people have experienced this problem with the ps
 I bought a brand new Roadtrek Motorhome that came equipped with this unit . It was hooked up to a TV antenna and a DVD player and Dolby Surround Sound , but had room for several more component and HD connections.It worked nicely with the integrated system in the Motorhome ... for about 10 minutes . It died , no power whatsoever . I tried outside power , etc. , no help.I tried the Samsung website to register it , but it was a Canadian model -LRB- where the Motorhome was built -RRB- , and I could n't register it on the US site , nor could I register it on the Canadian site since it only allows you to enter Provinces , not States.However , I did call Samsung the next day , they asked for the Serial Number , and that was all it took for them to send a replacement to a local UPS store . Alas , my trip is already planned , so I wo n't get it till I return , but I am very pleased with the Customer Service and only hope the next unit -LRB- re manufactured -RRB- works .
 ok product if you only need it for a year or so . Mine stopped working and will not power on . Many similar complaints online .
 This is the worst monitor ever . We bought 2 of these at the same time and have had nothing but problems . We use them for tv and computer monitor . These have both had to have the bulbs replaced twice !!! The first time was within the first 6 months . Now after 1.5 years of owning it , I ca n't wait to take it to the DUMP !!!
 Two weeks ago I purchased this Black and Decker product from my local CVS store in California . Brand-new , out of the package it would n't work . I felt reassured that at least it had a two year warranty , and was a `` name brand '' of Black and Decker . I was shocked when I phoned the Black and Decker service center in Texas , the 800-544-6986 that was included with the warranty info , ... and they told me that since the item had been manufactured three years earlier -LRB- there was a 2007 date-sticker on product -RRB- , and since this product had been discontinued by Black and Decker , they could not honor the warranty for repair or replacement.I informed the Black and Decker service-center manager -LSB- Anita -RSB- that it was not legal for Black and Decker to claim `` no responsibility '' for their warranty , and they could n't refuse to honor their warranty just because they discontinued the item , -LRB- particularly because I had just purchased it two weeks prior , & had my receipt -RRB- . She then gave me a local Black and Decker service-center phone number in California , where the representative -LRB- `` Dave '' -RRB- informed me that because the item was discontinued by Black and Decker , `` I was out of luck '' , and there was nothing they could do . It was just suggested I return the item to the store.Beware consumers ! Black and Decker is setting new precedents in skirting their legal responsibilities regarding honoring their product-warranties . It seems that since the volume of complaints are so high regarding Black and Decker products , not much attention is being paid to this negligence on Black and Decker 's part , -LRB- and who has the time and money to bring a `` breach of warranty '' case to court , for a $ 50 . item ? -RRB- After this experience I will never again have confidence in the Black and Decker name , and I urge you to consider researching consumer-complaints about this company 's customer-service , before purchasing Black and Decker products.Tom , in Encinitas California
 Do n't know if discontinued product was out of commission for some time , but the battery I 've received could not hold a charge -LRB- via USB -RRB- for more than 10 minutes . This was only used to charge a blackberry via USB which product designs mention should hold for more than 10 minutes . After charge , my blackberry only increase 3 % battery power ...
 Generally , it and its wall wart just adds useless clutter . Does n't hold much charge -LRB- might double the life of the average cell phone -RRB- . Three or four times as large and heavy as the average cell phone . Not much in the way of uses
 I have had 3 of these now ,1 was junk straight out of the box new , 1 is still working and I 'm waiting for another replacement since the 1st replacement was bad too .
 It 's a little bigger and bulkier than an SNES game cartridge . It 's about the weight of a shoe . I tested it on my Zune 30 and my friend 's iTouch 8gb . It did n't charge the iTouch at all , so do n't count on that . It charged my Zune , but took pretty much two of these using the USB charging outlet to charge it from completely empty -LRB- non-functioning -RRB- to completely full -LRB- green battery icon -RRB- . I plugged in my Zune AC wall charger into the pocket power AC outlet and had a little more success . It did n't quite take two . It did n't charge my laptop.I gave it two stars based on the Amazon price . I got two for $ 15 , and would give it three based on that . I guess I can only recommend this if you find two really cheap and you have a Zune .
 I bought on of these for $ 5 in the bargain aisle of wal mart , I bought it just for kicks to see if it would charge my Zune , I was happy to see that it did start to charge my zune and was very happy at that point , thinking that I had finally found a USB charger for my wonderful Zune , Turns out there are 2 major problems here , this unit it way to heavy to carry around on only charged my Zune for about 5 - 10 minutes . I figured that I could always take the whole unit apart and wire it up to the 14.7 V system of a car , nope , the battery pack inside is only a 9.6 V pack , bad things could happen if you hooked it to 14.7 v.For an 1800Mha pack , it should give more than a 10 minute charge .
 I have n't even removed this from the packaging - it 's being returned.This is not a pocket-anything , it 's a large heavy brick . Definitely not something to ` slip in your purse ' . I 'm giving it one star because of the misleading description .
 My unit will charge , and power on . However it completely discharges in less then 10 minutes when charging my ipod . This has a 1200mAh battery in it . A 30gb 5th gen ipod has a 450mAh battery . You should be able to get 2 complete charges on your ipod , but my unit wont even get 1/4 of a charge .
 Save yourself the agony of wasting money on discontinued garbage . There is a reason B & D discontinued this , and I suspect it 's because it never performed well and many users complained . Learn from the poor rating you see here on Amazon . Sure , it has an inverter and you can power AC adapter stuff , theoretically . In practice , your money would be better spent on a sealed , rechargeable , 12V battery and a small cig lighter inverter with USB power outlet , available in the Auto section of Wal Mart and many department stores . That way , you can use the inverter w/USB in your car also and even charge the small 12V battery with a cig-lighter charger .
 All I can say is Do Not buy this . Not even worth the $ 8 . Never worked . Not worth the hassle of returning . I looked at replacing the cells inside of it but I can buy a better portable battery unit for about the same $ $ as fixing this thing so I tossed it .
 I did n't buy this from Amazon , but mine is just not useable . As others have noted , it is quite a bit larger than I expected . Also , it seems to charge , the lights come on normally , but it will not charge anything . It wo n't work on my iPhone thru the USB port , and the AC port wo n't power an external hard drive.Mine may just be defective , but since I only paid $ 11 for it , it 's just not worth pursuing a repair or replacement to me . However , just beware that it may not provide enough power to charge anything other than basic cell phones .
 When new , these were great , but everything being offered for sale now has been sitting on the shelf for a very long time , years in fact . Batteries this old can not be charged up again . You 're just buying a paperweight !
 I got one of these a year ago . The issue I had was that the thing only had about 15mins of power before shutting down . That is usb or powering a 7w fluorescent bulb AC .
 i needed a battery back up just in case if i am unable to plug in my wall charger . i tested this unit several times after fully charging the back up unit and it will charge my cell phone for 20 minutes and then it will run out of energy.the price dropped dramatically here on amazon so i am guessing it is being discontinued or it is on clearance.i am going to look for another back up unit
 I bought this hoping to use it with my archos 630 video player . Sadly it does n't even add more than 30 mins of playback time . Its made for less demanding electronics like phones , pda 's etc. . . I would n't use this for portable dvd players or video players . Its rated draw power is about 350 mah .
 DEAD !!!! to long before i use it , they wont take it , dont know what else to say dont know what else to say
 The product was in a very old box and the AC/DC connection was just a bare wire . So I did return this item .
 I received this camcorder for Christmas . While the picture was very good , and the features plenty for my family videos there was an annoying whine in all recordings . I found it was recording the whine into the tape , not just a mechanical whine while playing inside the camcorder . I contacted JVC and was told that unless I had a receipt and proved I received the camera within the past 90 days I would pay for its repair . Even if I got the receipt from the person that gave me the gift I would pay shipping to have it repaired.Perhaps I expect too much , but when I open the box I expect something to work , and if it does n't I expect the manufacturer to immediately accept blame and fix it . Being treated as if I am to blame because I have no receipt at Christmastime is poor public relations . They should at least be able to check the serial number for a manufacture date and then see if my story is reasonable . I had another product fail recently and was promptly sent a replacement without the first question of whether I had a receipt . That company will receive my business in the future , JVC will not .
 The JVC Camcorder Model GR-SXM240 is one of the best I ` veused in years . For the price you pay , you ca n't beat It.Sharp pictures even in low light conditions . I recommend thisCamcorder for every one to use.There is one problem while charging the battery the main circuitboard smoked . This board cost approx . $ 205.00 . I recommend watching the camcoder when charging .
 Got this camcorder for christmas 3 yrs.ago.After storing the camcorder for about 1 yr . I charged the battery and when I went to check a tape that I had recorded 14 mos . ago there was no picture on the monitor and the viewfinder.I had sound but no picture.I called the JVC service division and they told me to ship it to them and they would check it out and tell me how much it would cost to fix it.I also went to an authorized JVC repair shop and was told that this was a problem that JVC had know about and that if I send it to the JVC that they would fix it for free.The JVC service division person I spoke to told me that I would have to pay.I am confused and very upset that JVC does n't standby their product.If I have to by another camcorder , I 'd never buy a JVC .
 I used to have the name of the manufacturer and their website out of China that makes this generic home theatre system . I blv this is the Upgrade Deluxe model of the more popular basic home theatre package for $ ... that came in a black finish and was sold at Kmart with disastrous results . It also is sold at Best Buy under the KLH name but with color variations and little blue LED lights ... but exactly the same thing . I blv Target is now selling this basic model as well for $ ... It goes under the Audiovox logo . But it is the Basic model and NOT the DELUXE model you see here at AMAZON.COM . -LRB- Note
 This system is horrid . Not only have I had problems with it skipping , pausing , and completely freezing , but so has a friend of mine with the same system . I dont recomend this product to anyone unless you dont mind a great movie skipping , pausing out for a second or so , or completely freezing up on you . I personally find it very frustrating . The sound is decent for the little money , but this skipping , pausing , and freezing is enough to make you want to throw your new machine in the trash .
 I 've had nothing but problems with this system . It skips constantly , no matter what movie I play and quite often freezes altogether . I should have known better considering the almost non-existent warranty . Do your self a favor and spend a little more money for a system that will actually play movies !

 You 'll have read all the reviews about the quality of the light from the Softlighter , which is astonishing . The best . Good enough for Annie L . But I 've just ordered my third of these -LRB- had the smallest available , the largest and have just bought the 46in sized -RRB- and each of them , without question , has broken after only a handful of shoots . The build quality and finish is shockingly poor and I would seriously consider a purchase of a Photek Softlighter for this reason - they have repeatedly let me down on shoots .
 I purchased one of these players from Discount Jungle , and would not recommend you do so , too . After the first three test cassettes the machine would not load any more tapes , so back it went . The company was apologetic and sent another shipment right away , but I have my suspicions it was a different player at all , as this one would not load a single tape . In all , I 've lost a month of VHS use and am out nearly the cost of the product itself in return shipping charges , not to mention the inconvenience of repackaging and taking time out of my life to do the return . Do you have that kind of time and money ?
 I purchased this Sony VCR at a Target , thinking you can rely on Sony , well I was wrong . It did not record a very good quality picture from my TV -LRB- cable -RRB- . I tried switching tapes , and recorded in both EP and SP , but there was always some kind of disturbance seemingly from one particular point in the reel/head/whatever . It occurred regularly in playback , about every few seconds at the beginning of the tape , and then occurring in shorter intervals toward the end of the tape . Oh , and I used new Sony tapes , which did fine on my older Sony VCR ... go figure , but do n't buy it .
 I bought this vcr in January of 2002 . It was loud , and had several features that we did n't care for -LRB- for instance , you ca n't `` pinpoint FF or Rew '' ... you can only get it within a minute of the spot you want -RRB- . But the killer was that after having the vcr for eight months -LRB- and using it abt 5 hours a week -RRB- , it started making the picture flip up and down whenever it taped a program off television . It plays back regular tapes fine , it is fine to watch TV through the VCR , but if you want a VCR to tape your favorite TV shows -LRB- and you do n't want to get a headache when you watch them -RRB- , this is NOT the VCR for you !!! I called Sony and they did n't care . I 'm never buying another product from them .
 I have been shopping for a new VCR since both of my much older ones died -LRB- within a month of each other ! -RRB- . My Toshiba and my RCA , both made it to about 8 or 9 years old . In doing the shopping math - my old VCR repairman kept admonishing me to stay away from the Sony - good TVs and other electronics , but VCRs are not their forte , he said . In doing so , I found he was right , as also evidenced by the other reviews from guests . My VCR repairman would know , he repairs what ca n't be returned ! So , now I 'm looking at Panasonic and RCA . Thanks to all of you who tried to warn me - I 'll get over my system not being totally Sony . I had to learn the hard way though ... . still , why ca n't Sony make a VCR that works quietly ?
 Yo i had this sony For about a year now and this thing is horrible it has no user friendly menus and ... it makes a whole lot of noise when it plays a tape it sounds like a vacuum cleaner when it plays tapes !! Im out !!
 1 -RRB- Like someone else wrote , I too get this disturbance at regular intervals when playing back with the SLV-N55 . For me it occurs with some recordings made by other VCRs and pre-recorded videos.Every 5 to 10 seconds , the picture will jitter vertically for a second . I played around with the tracking to no avail . If it 's because of the condition of the tapes or the recordings are a year old , that 's still no excuse because these same particular tapes play perfectly stable on my other 3 Panasonic VCRs , and it should have no problem with pre-recorded tapes ESPECIALLY . -LRB- Side Note
 I have this for about 8 months now and it 's not working anymore . Did n't work after first 3 months , I had to call sony and they helped me do channel auto set up and it worked . -LRB- still it 's hard to believe why that happened in 1st place without changing setup -RRB- and it happened 2nd time now . Does n't play . Called Sony and ca n't get it fixed over the phone . It 's out of labor warrenty . Was never satisfied with this one . I am big fan of Sony but I did n't read all reviews before I bought this one . Never Buy this product .
 I own another Sony VCR -LRB- SLV N-71 -RRB- which is nice . This one was for the kids , but it 's going back . The VCR is noisy - very distracting . Picture is fair . I expect more from Sony products .
 As some have stated , this VCR produces noticable jittery effects on screen during playback and has done so from day 1 . I would not recommend it to anyone , and I have lost faith in Sony QC .
 It plays fine but the rewind and fast forward is a loud motor running . I 'm going to return it for perhaps another SONY or Panasonic .
 Filter is a little narrow , but it worked fine until I unscrewed it during the third use . Perhaps I overtighted it , but it was a little hard to unscrew from the lens . When it finally came off , the two glass pieces separated . Unfortunately I was n't able to reassemble the two pieces , so I tossed them in the trash and thought to myself , `` That 's what I get for -LSB- ... -RSB- . ''
 Do n't purchase one of these - their are better options at Amazon.The first one -LRB- which was shipped very promptly -RRB- refused to accept a charge after a day or so . While Amazon sent a replacement as soon as I reported the problem the second one has now stopped accepting a charge after three weeks.The service -LRB- as always -RRB- from Amazon has been great but needless to say this particular batch of batteries has some inherent problems so look at the alternative brands available at amazon .
 I 'm so sorry that I could n't use this product . I 'm not very good on the computer end and did n't realize that this product would not work with the new `` black box '' and digital tuner etc. . Still do n't understand it completely , but the technician that came to my house to set it all up said I could n't use it . With this new system coming upon us I feel that when things that wo n't work on your old TV should state that it would be obsolete after a few weeks . I 'm a senior and had no idea that this would or could happen . However , the service and cooperation of all was superb . The customer from whom I dealt with was so friendly and helpful and gracious as well as Amazon themselves . No complaints !!! Just think for us who have n't the knowledge the obsolete items should be marked . Something of that importance needs to be known . I truly have no idea on how or if this product works . It was rated very high when I bought it , but for me it did n't rate at all . Thank you !!!!
 Bought new unit thinking it would work because the one I had stopped working , same model . The unit replaced had life time free service . Since service comes though the telephone line I though plug in and new unit would work . New shows coming on had not started yet but when they aired I thought new unit would record them . When they did not record , TiVo TCD649080 Series 2 80-Hour Dual Tuner Digital Video RecorderI knew something was wrong . This was past 14 days and company would not take it back . Now I have Comcast and I lost my money on a unit never used .
 I bought my Tivo Series 2 about 16 months ago and also paid $ 300 for a 3 year term of Tivo service . About 2 months ago , the hardware stopped working and I called Tivo . They told me that the warranty had expired and that I was on my on to buy a new one -LRB- no discounted replacement -RRB- . So I bought a second series 2 at full price , and then recently found out that it is not supported by the NetFlix movies on demand service . Tivo told me that I could upgrade to a Tivo HD but , again , I would have to do this at full price . So the bottom line is that Tivo does n't provide any discounted upgrade options for customers . The lesson I 've learned from this is to abandon Tivo and just get a PC for video on demand and video recording .
 If you purchase this with a Tivo Service gift card , the card is ONLY good for starting a new account , but you do not recieve the card until two weeks after your box arrives . Still fighting with Tivo , Three months now , they say gift card has been voided , not their problem ?! I 've tried posting this warning before . No suprise it never makes it to the list .
 I thought I had read everything about this model of TiVo to understand that it is a true dual tuner DVR , but it is n't one . It is a very clever if not misleading engineering feat to achieve dual-tuners on this TiVo , but the way they did it defies understanding . The TiVo digital transition pages on their web site state that as an owner of a TiVo Series 2 DT , I do not need a converter box to view ATSC digital transmissions . This is fine since I now use FiOS . The problem is that I mistakenly understood this implication that the TiVo Series 2 DT works with QAM over cable . In fact , the Series 2 DT does NOT support QAM over cable and probably requires a converter box for over-the-air ATSC as well.The problem for my needs is that my Verizon FiOS service has NO analog channels at all . The `` DT '' feature of the TiVo Series 2 DT implies that the second tuner can receive basic cable , but that 's not true for FiOS and a growing number of digital cable subscribers . What it does n't make totally clear to you is that the second tuner can only receive ANALOG , UNSCRAMBLED basic cable.If you 're buying this and you have FiOS or Comcast then you are effectively buying a single-tuner DVR . However , this might not matter , because even if this machine did support digital QAM channels , only lifeline basic cable is unscrambled . In fact on FiOS my HDTV tuner tells me that only the local channels and the music channels are actually unscrambled on Verizon FiOS.This is a clever and not completely honest marketing technique . They 're not lying to you but they are not making enough of an effort to clarify what the dual-tuner can do without digging endlessly through the TiVo knowledge base or some of the many online communities . The `` Digital Transition '' information at TiVo 's web site implied that the `` DT '' mark on the TiVo Series 2 DT meant `` Digital Television . `` Now for the use of the TiVo itself , it 's great , and I 've used it for ten years , but the analog S-video connection between the Motorola FiOS set top box and the TiVo produces vertical `` hum bars '' which require a lot of trial-and-error to eliminate.You should get the Tivo HD instead of this . I 'm frustrated with FiOS and the Tivo Series 2 DT and I do n't frustrate so easily with electronics like this .
 It 's my first time to use TiVo . This product is not user friendly . The hardware setup requirs either network -LRB- wired -RRB- or phone line , otherwise it wo n't work . The software designed without exit . If you do n't like any choices or you do n't which one is good for your case , there is no way to skip . It takes hours to set it up . very bad design in hardware and software.Amazon service is excellent .
 I intended to use this TiVo with an AT&T Uverse system ... Although it was advertised to work -LRB- by TiVo -RRB- and I got the model that they recommended ... it would only receive one channel and about 20 % of the time when it tried to record , it would not be able to effectively change to the correct channel .
 This Tivo series2 Dual Tuner has limited surround sound capabilities . If you are NOT using a Cable or Satellite box , chances are you will NOT get surround sound from this device.I was running the coax cable directly into the TiVo , with the outputs going directly to the A/V processor , similar to my VCR and TV . My VCR and TV are both producing surround sound . The TiVo was only able to send a 2 channel signal.I spent almost 2 hours on the phone with TiVo customer support and they were not able to help and just continued to claim that TiVo supports surround . However , on TiVo 's own website in the customer forum , I found dozens of entries with issues supporting surround.This appears to be a design flaw .
 The TIVO arrived in good condition and was easly to install . However to use the device you must have Internet access for your tv and subscribe to a service with a montly fee . I was not prepared for either and have returned the device to the original shipper .
 We were really excited to finally switch from DVR to Tivo , but when our tivo came and we plugged it in , the video quality was awful . Way way worse than the TV ever was . We tried everything , got new cables , called tivo , did the software update . Nothing made it any better . It was so obviously worse than our cable ever looked , we had to return it :-LRB- We decided it was n't worth the effort to try to get a new one . So back to DVR !
 Perhaps by the time you read this Amazon will be clearer in its TiVo description , but in case they are n't , you NEED to know that this is just the hardware for a monthly PAY service . I REALLY felt taken for a ride on this , as they referred to it as a `` service plan '' -- well , I do n't have a `` service plan '' on my oven , and it works just fine . It is completely misleading to call the fee they charge every month a `` service plan '' . Tivo wo n't be getting a penny of mine ...
 Having been a satified customer of Tivo almost since it 's inception ... I was blindsided by them when my cable company switched to digial service , doing away with all analog signals . Tivo did not notify customers and have not addressed the issues on their web page . Soooooo ... save yourselves a whole lot of headaches and hair pulling . Do n't buy this unit . Also consider before you buy the upgraded models with cable card readers ... because I have researched this and have found that there are lots of problems with the cable cards . You have to have your cable company install them , which you will be charged for and there is a monthly fee for the cards . When I called and cancelled my Tivo service , the rep offered me an upgrade model for $ 99.00 ... this should have been an upfront offer to all of those , like myself who purchase the Series 2 dual tuners with the good faith that the service would always be available . Shame on Tivo !
 Tivo is a copmlete scam ! They sell you a unit with a 1 year contract , and 3 month warranty . The day after it comes off of warranty , they turn down your system so it takes forever to respond to button clicks making the unit worthless . Call them up for support , and they offer to sell you another one for 80 $ Save yourself some time , buy a TV Capture card , buy a vcr , buy a DVR from a different company , STAY AWAY FROM TIVO , It 's a scam !
 After years of excellent service from Amazon -LRB- ordering books and Kindle -RRB- , I hope to never order anything that is labeled Amazon Marketplace . The TIVO arrived but after much effort would not work . I called the telephone # on the box and received an electronic reply . No business name or # was presented and the voice said , `` I am busy on another line . Call another # or call back later '' . I called Amazon and they assured me that this company was reputable and gave me another # to call . When I called that # a female voice -LRB- electronic -RRB- said that they were unavailable . Again no company name . I though that this whole transaction was unprofessional and very unlike the Amazon that I was used to doing business with.Ended up calling TIVO and their diagnosis was that there was `` something wrong with the hard drive in the TIVO itself '' . We had to pay an additional $ 79 and received a new machine . We will continue to do business with TIVO and hopefully , never again , with Amazon Marketplace.Yours truly , Karen Silveira
 Bought this product after hooking it up I found out you need a telephone jack behind your tv to plug in a phone connection which would tie up my phone line while the TiVo calls to get the tv programing schedule in your area . I sent it back . If the specs would have informed me ahead of time I would not have purchased this product.What a hassle . Shipped it back .
 I bought this DVR because the sales pitch on Amazon said something like , `` No TiVo service required '' . That was a lie . The description for this item also never mentioned it was an analog only item.Trying to set up this DVR takes more time than most women giving birth.The manual is useless because it assumes you have a cable or sattelite source.If you want to throw you money away , buy this unit.I just wish there was a DVR for sale that does n't require cable or sattelite .
 This was an absolutely useless purchase . I expected the box to provide at least basic functionality like being able to view my home pictures , listen to my music and/or view my videos . None of the above . Unless you buy a subscription from Tivo -LRB- what for ? -RRB- and pay monthly fees of $ 12.95 / mo or $ 129 per year or $ 299 for 3 years or $ 399 for the rest of already not new , rather 4 years used box - the box is DEAD . I mean it - it 's a box which can not be used for anything ... The box has very limited functionality even provided you purchased a subscription from Tivo -LRB- I did -RRB- - because today all cable providers including Verizon FIOS already moved to fully digital channels - therefore you may view only ONE channel at a time ... Absolutely , absolutely useless purchase ... Well , I -LSB- sorry for my stupidity -RSB- can not figure out what the Tivo subscription for unless you can use the unit as two channel DVR ? Even the programming guide today is available for almost free from many sources ... Well , if Tivo offered some low , one time `` unlocking '' fee , somewhere within 30 bucks , just to be able to use an ALREADY OLD box as a media device -LSB- without being able to record from TV/cable inputs -RSB- - well ... then yes , I might consider it fair and pay it to be able to use the box ... otherwise - I 'm sorry - I must qualify the `` business '' that Tivo `` provides '' for used boxes as a pure raping of people who get caught thinking that they can use Tivo devices for anything advertised these devices `` can do '' . No , this is a big LIE , the devices are DEAD unless you pay Tivo the raping `` subscription '' fees for nothing in exchange . I do admit that Tivo used to be a good , advanced company which invented the whole idea of DVR , but since then they have done nothing for consumers nor industry itself ... Since about 4 or 5 years ago - everything they did had been obsoleted by cable/satellite companies . Yes , I read through their entire WEB site as well as lots of advocacy materials ... still - nothing that could justify a raping $ 12.95 monthly fee one must pay on top of what they already pay to cable or satellite service provider.You 've been warned .
 I had heard so many great things about Tivo , but have been absolutely dissapointed . I can not get Tivo to work with the wireless adapter I bought from Tivo specifically for my Tivo make and model . It works 10 minutes out of 24 hours on any given day . It has been extremely frustrating . I do not recommend Tivo if you buy it to run on a wireless router .
 Did not like the idea of paying a monthly fee for something that I already paid for . Returned to Amazon . Return process was handled well . You advertising said nothing about a monthly fee to use this device .
 My Dad bought a Tivo for my Mom for Christmas , and we were all very excited about it . However , eventhough it was easy to hook up , as soon as it was it started conflicting with our HD channels and it messed up our sound . Also , it goes on rampages taping shows at random and quickly filling up the given 80 hrs . I figured the sound problem was probably just loose audio wires which I checked time and time again . I called the tech support where I waited on hold for almost an hour then they told me that sometimes the audio feed would fragment and they offered to replace the Tivo if I shipped it back in its original box ... More effort than its worth . . Should 've gotten the Charter DVR . I dont recommend this product if you have a cable box .
 I bought this so I could share movies and vids from my computer to the tivo and play them on our TV . You still need to pay for a monthly subscription thou . You also need to pay for some software to enable you to do it . I realized it was easier to get a wireless video/audio sender and and send the movies wirelessly to the tv for $ 0 per month . However , I suppose there is a market for this somewhere its just not for me and my house .
 Please be aware - even when you sign up for a `` Monthly Service Plan '' - the plan itself is an annual one - the only thing monthly is the fee . I personally find this nomenclature incredibly deceptive and purposefully misleading to customers , so I would recommend staying away from Tivo .
 ... do not buy this unit . You will not get surround sound ; you will get poor channel separation -LRB- also known as monaural sound -RRB- . I replaced an old VCR that chewed up tapes , but still tuned in to channels and had excellent sound reproduction . When I plugged in the Tivo , the ambience collapsed down to the center speaker in my home theater setup.The Tivo connects to my audio/video receiver . I have a 20-year-old JVC VCR also plugged in to the receiver . When I tuned the VCR and the Tivo to the same channel , and switched back and forth , the Tivo seemed to have swallowed all the spatial qualities that -LRB- for me -RRB- vastly enhance viewing . The Tivo sound reminded me a lot of my answering machine.One more thing , I had a very poor phone experience with a Tivo technician . First he tried to have me rewire the connections to my receiver . I indicated that I did not feel like lifting my 60-pound device and playing with some of the 10,000 cables that were attached . In any case , the sound was fine before the Tivo -LRB- and after , now that I have replaced the old VCR -RRB- , so the receiver setup was not the problem.Then he suggested that I plug the Tivo directly into the TV -LRB- another 20-year-old device , a Trinitron , which only serves as a monitor in my setup -RRB- . Just to be cooperative , I complied . The technician asked if I was getting stereo sound . I tuned to a music station and tried to detect a difference , but I told him both speakers sounded the same . He clearly was trying to get rid of me when he said that the problem was my TV , and that I needed to get the TV manual and find out about the specifications . I was trying to point out that sound into the TV was largely irrelevant , when I noticed that the stereo light on the TV was not lit up . In other words , the TV was not getting stereo signals . After I said that , there was a moment of silence , and then he just hung up on me.Somehow , I expected a little more . Just tell me that this model wo n't work for me , and suggest one that will.TiVo TCD649080 Series2 80 Hour Dual Tuner Digital Video Recorder
 The product works fine , however I was not told that you have to have TIVO service for it to work . I did not purchase it for the TIVO system , but to use it solely as a DVR hooked to my computer . Consequently I had to purchase the yearly service of $ 129.00 just to be able to use it for my purpose which I feel is unfair . I did not choose to send it back due to the shipping costs of returning it and also that they allow you to use it for two weeks without purchasing the service . I did n't hook it up right away due to being on vacation when it arrived . I was too close to being over the return point as well . I feel it was unfair to advertise this product without foreclosing the fact that to use it simpley as a DVR you still need to purchase the high cost of TIVO .
 TiVo , when new is a great toy . But after the first year I questioned it 's worth before renewing the subscription . What did it do ? It copied programs , provided a program schedule , provided speed control Slowmo etc. and would record shows following what you choose . If you have cable or satellite you already have a program guild and after a few months of use I turned off the selective recording , ask it to record football and any program with foot and ball gets recorded and in less than a week your 80gig is clogged . So I let the service lapse figuring that I could record the programs manually , if there was ever any over time it always cut it off . Well no , if you do not subscribe that function is turned off and your TiVo unit becomes a boat anchor . No if I decide to get into the DVR market again I will use the Satellite of Cable DVR , same functionality for the same about the same fee and I do n't have to pay hundreds of dollars for a boat anchor .
 I stupidly bought from the TiVo site itself . This was a gift , so I listed myself as the purchaser and the recipient as the subscriber . TiVo immediately distinguished itself by notifying the recipient that I had bought them a gift . I successfully got them to delete that email without reading it , but TiVo continued to send them lots of updates about the status of the order , the shipment date , etc. . I called to cancel , and was given to a cancellation specialist -LRB- interesting that this is an actual job there , is n't it ? -RRB- so I could get the order cancelled . Surprise ! I could n't cancel the order , but he advised me to put up a sign refusing the order . Unfortunately , he did n't tell me that it would be coming , not from TiVo , but from some fulfillment center in Texas . Naturally , since I had n't put up a note to refuse a shipment from that location , it got through . I was then told to take the product , on my own time to a UPS center and send it back . What I did n't realize at the time was that this was also going to be on my dime . Still , I was happy just to get rid of the thing . Three days AFTER I took it to UPS and shipped it -- which was itself two days after the unit was erroneously delivered -- I was told a prepaid shipping label was awaiting me at some UPS center , identified only by number , not address . At this point , more than a week after TiVo notified the gift recipient that the return had been received , I am waiting for my money back , during which time I am also paying interest for the outstanding funds . So , the outcome was that they notified the recipient of a gift I was giving -LRB- despite everything in the order talking about it being a gift -RRB- , I had to pay for the return , I had to use my car and my gas and my time to return the item , I get to pay interest on money they still have n't returned , and I still have to buy a gift . Since they could n't be bothered to return the funds promptly and I could n't afford to buy things without those funds available to me , I missed out on the Black Friday specials on similar items . I figure TiVo will have cost me a couple hundred bucks when all is said and done -- assuming I ever actually get my money back . If you care about getting actual customer service , do n't buy from these people . The only reason I gave them one star is that I could n't award less . Update 12/14/2007
 The picture thru the tivo unit was fuzzy . Maybe the Tivo unit is not designed to receive antenna TV . The Tivo unit made all chanels come in fuzzy . Also I did n't like that you could not use any of the functions without a Tivo subscription , but it seems that without the monthly subscription the whole thing is useless . I am now very happy with a standard DVR that does not require a monthly subacription and works much like the old VCR used to do but without the tapes . The unit I ended up with is thebrite-View BV-980H Digital HD DVR -LRB- for Antenna and clear QAM use -RRB- , with 320GB HDD Built-in , EPG Supported , Time Shifting - Black . However I do agree with the critiques of the Brite-View unit , there are some tricky quirks that take some getting use to .
 Tivo is a great product but this one was defective and I had to send it back and upgrade . Delivery was prompt and product was packed wll .
 This item is so old you need a network adapter or a phone line to operate . Still having problems getting signal to watch tv .
 Do n't purchase the extended warranty . I purchased a 3 year extended warranty and my tivo broke after 8 months . We put up with the initial Tivo even though it would not record voice on both turners at the same time like advertised , but when the network card went out , we thought we would get it serviced . The network card went bad , so they sent me another unit , which had a hard drive failure within one day . I got a second exchange and was told my extended warranty would not cover the replacement unit and is void after the 1st exchange.Brandon the customer service person was no help at all . I will never buy anything with a tivo logo again .
 For 14 months this product worked great . Then it died . It was not dropped or otherwise abused . TIVO 's response was that they would replace it for the cost of buying a new one.Even though it broke so quickly , TIVO is worth the price we payed for the box and the service . If the cable companies could come out with a DVR that was as capable I would rather rent it knowing that if it broke it would be replaced for free.The box itself is rather bulky for the electronics that are actually inside it . The unit could have been designed a little better to make the overall size smaller.Hopefully you get a better box than we did .
 Stop ! You ca n't get Amazon Prime videos on this ! It 's also has linking problems that TiVo kept sending me to Amazon for , and Amazon then just showed me how to fix it on my TiVo , when TiVo could have told me . And they charge a monthly fee . Roku has no fee , it 's cheaper , and easier to use .
 The dual tuner feature wo n't work on this model TiVo after June 2009 . Do n't buy it .
 Tivo worked for two weeks using the tivo wireless adapter . All of a sudden it stopped working giving a `` network adapter not found error '' Did the usual resets of the router , tivo , etc and nothing . Called tivo and they sent out a new adapter . Plugged the new adapter in and same problem . Called Tivo again , wasted a bunch of time with people who were clueless . Now I have to wait up 10 business days for a new tivo unit to arrive.To sum it up : - clueless customer service-no way to record at a given time without a network connection-froze oftenIt seems like Tivo is a company that has gotten ahead of itself .
 No where on the outside of the box my TiVo was packed in , nor in the sales pitch given me at Best Buy , was there any mention of the price of the monthly fee for this system . That was just a minor irritation , I had guessed there would be one ... just not quite so high . Much worse , neither was there any mention of the fact that if you have a DSL computer connection that the TiVo will not be able to communicate over your telephone line , as it is supposed to . DSL phone service introduces some mostly inaudible noise , reducing the signal-to-noise ratio below the level the TiVo can tolerate . So after ` fessing up to the fact that it probably will not work for you , the TiVo folks tell you to connect it to your computer . So I bought a wireless router and set up a laptop next to the TiVo . But the connection wire they supply was inappropriate for the computer . At this point I called DISH and asked how much their integrated receiver/digital recorder went for ... and the answer was WAY less per month than TiVo , and $ 49 for the unit rather than $ 230 . The TiVo went back -LRB- Amazon was great about the return -RRB- , the DISH unit came and was set up and running in 30 min . Now we are recording all the US Open tennis matches , etc. , and are happy as clams . Maybe we do n't have all the TiVo bells and whistles , but for our needs the DISH system is the way to go . Programming is super simple and it has a 100 + hr.c capacity . Way more than we really need . My main gripe with TiVo is that they should have told me about the potential problems , why make me struggle with it at home for several days before realizing I 'd been a dunce ? Be warned .
 ok ; the dvr has been flawless.I got in on the free 3 months deal.which is great but 6 months into my subscription my cable company offers free hd programming.so i decide would be nice to get a premeire box since i do have a plasma tv.however before i just has basic cable.BUT FREE HD CHANNELS ARE FREEEE.so I contact tivo i want to buy the priemere at my local best buy and upgrade my tivo service.I understand that my monthly cost goes from 12.95 to 19.99 a month and i am expecting to pay that.but the rep tells my that i can not upgrade until my contract expires ? 6 months from now?but they will give me a discount for having two tivo boxes get the premire box fro free but still a 2 year 19.99 commitment.plus my existing 12.95 series 2 box on top of that for another 6 months?HOW DO THEY EXPECT TO KEEP THEIR CUSTOMERS?IF THEY THINK I AM RENEWING WITH THEM THEY ARE OUT OF THEIR MINDS.I CAN GET A HD DVR BOX FROM MY CABLE COMPANY FOR LESS WITH MORE CHANNELS I MIGHT ADD.SORRY TIVO YOU BLEW IT WITH ANOTHER CUSTOMER.the only thing i like about tivo is my amazon video on demand , but their are hd set boxes you can buy like ROKU so i can still get my amazon video on demand .
 It is obsolete piece and requires paid subscription - the little thing I have overlooked . For just a little more you can get DVR with free OTA -LRB- Over the air -RRB- everything - for free . This one will go directly to a landfill . Without the activation it even ca n't be used as a `` VCR '' . Piece of junk .
 I have been a Tivo subscriber for over 10 years , and feel any potential buyers of Tivo products should know this
 '' It also works with VCRs , TV antennas , cable systems , and satellite systems '' -- LIE!I currently have a DirecTv HD-DVR that I 'm quite happy with . I can record a show from my android phone . I can watch my recorded shows on my computer -LRB- as long as I 'm connected to my network -RRB- . It connects to my computer files for video and audio , so all in all I 'm pleased . I did ' t want to order a new one because DirecTV makes you renew a two year contract and charges for the installation . So since this Tivo alleged to do the same things , I thought I 'd go this route.Then I saw this
 I bought this to attach to a slingbox to control when i am on the road . It lasted me about a year before it died and i rarely watched it . I was extremely ticked over the quality of the device . It 's possible newer ones are better quality because this one is defiantly an older model.Pros : It is a DVR and records as well as any one from the cable providers.Cons : Hard Drive - The hard drive is small . I thought the OS of the tivo was firmware on the machine , but its on the HD . If the hard drive dies , you either have to pay to get it repaired , buy a new HD with the OS installed or buy the image online . Even upgrading the HD can cost you , though you can risk backing up the HD to a pc and transfer the image to the new HD . To me , its not worth the risk.Slow - I 've had a dvr since Time Warner came out with them . From the off setting , they are on within seconds . This thing takes MINUTES to turn on . If your late for a show , expect to miss a few minutes of it . If you are setting up a new one , expect to take about an hour . Newer Tivos do n't turn off , they are always on.Money - Its a paid service and its way too expensive . Given the quality of them , a paid service will most likely not pan out for you and the monthly service is an even worse deal . Tivo used to allow you to set a recording up to 3 days in advance on their free service but that is long gone . You can pause while watching live tv though.Ads - When you go to the Tivo main page , there are ads you can click on if you want to . Not only do you have to pay for service , but put up with ads , on top of the tv commercials.Dies - I bought mine new and it did n't last long . It was my first and last Tivo . I 'm the only person i know who has ever had one and for good reason.I 'm sure there are many people out there who love theirs , but not me .
 I gave it a 1-star review because I could n't get it to work . The Dish Network package where I live would n't allow me to connect with the TiVo service . Before ordering this dvr , always make sure it will work with your cable or sattelite provider .
 The Series2 will record only one non-digital station and one digital . Now that Comcast has gone all-digital , your Series2 has become more like a Series0 .50 , since it only records one channel at a time .
 I purchased this tivo from amazon . After hooking everything up I plugged it in and it did not work . No lights or sounds at all . I called tivo 's customer service line and they said it would need to be exchanged . I will now have to pay $ 20-25 for shipping plus packaging materials to send it back and then wait a few weeks for a new one .
 Be advised before you buy a TiVo product.I bought this item from Amazon but when it arrives I find that I need to connect to the TiVo Service to complete the setup -LRB- ca n't use device until setup is complete -RRB- . I do n't have a house phone and the network is on the other side of the house so I go to Best Buy and get TiVo wireless connector.Upon getting the wireless set up it tells me that it ca n't find my network so I call Technical Support . Support tells me that I have to set up an account with TiVo and pay them $ 12.95 / mo so I can use my own machine . I do n't want the service . All I want to do is use the DVR . `` Well , '' the lady says , `` if you do n't sign up for the service the machine wo n't work . ''
 Hello All , If you were ever planning to get a Tivo remember one thing . The customer service stinks ! It is easier to have a root canal than dealing with their customer service department . Once turn on you will have to cancel your credit card to have them stop charging it.Don ' t get me wrong I love the service but do n't expect any help from their customer service department , plus get one of those `` Prepaid '' credit card to pay for the service , because if you use a real one they wont stop charging it .
 When I received my new TiVo I rushed right in to install and play with my new `` toy '' . The instructions were clear and I followed them to the letter . Unfortunately , I was unable to get the second of the `` dual-tuner '' channels working . After many hours and much fiddling I gave up and called customer service . As it turned out my RF input was not working properly ; however , I found out something extremely important . New laws require that all signals be digital beginning in 2009 . Many providers are currently in the process of changing over now , and according to the customer service rep. the second channel of the `` dual channel '' system is analog only and therefore useless in the new digital environment . I was not made aware of this fact when I purchased the unit as it would have made a definite difference in my decision to purchase it .
 When you order a Tivo with a one-year service term , Tivo promises to send you an e-mail 30 days prior to the end of the year before charging your credit card . Well , I never received an e-mail from Tivo , and customer `` service '' refused to issue a refund after I discovered the charge . Remember , you 're not just buying a DVR , you 're buying a service . Tivo 's service sucks . Period .
 This model TiVo is out of date . It will only record Digital and Analog programs and NOT Hi Def . You must have a Multi-Channel tuner card installed in order to receive cable TV channels -- this costs $ 1.50 / month plus a $ 20.00 installation charge from Comcast -- plus the monthly charge from TiVo is $ 12.95 -LRB- as I recall -RRB- -- this is an EXPENSIVE proposition.I 'm returning the TiVo because Comcast offers their Hi Def DVR for $ 9.95 for 6 moths , then $ 12.95 there after.Oh did I mention that if you have Vonage or cable telephone service that you MUST buy a wireless adapter for ~ $ 50.00 ? This is not only an outdated piece of equipment , but a very expensive solution to recording TV programs/movies !
 I was really happy with my TiVo for the first 6 months . Then I received an error message that data would n't load . After researching on the TiVo website forums and finding many others have had the same problem , I followed their instructions and tried to `` kickstart '' it . This process did not fix the box but TiVo tells me I crashed my TiVo . TiVo says I need to return it and they will fix it under warranty , but they will not let me out of the service contract unless I pay $ 200 termination fee since it is under warranty and they 've offered to fix it . Personally , I would prefer to go back to my cable company 's DVR - the box costs me nothing but the monthly fee which is half of what TiVo charges.TiVo has TERRIBLE customer service !!!!
 without internet , an external network adapter from tivo and a subscription the only thing i can do with this is pause and rewind live tv , the dvr cant work without a steady internet connection for the box . Due to copyright laws tivo has to erase cirtain recordings in order to preserve the time limits of cirtain shows . So far i have not been able to get live tv to go through my tivo box provided by comcast , so our provider wants to send a tech to my home and charge us $ 30 to take a look at things . Do yourself a favor and dont buy this product unless you are commited to the idea of going all the way .
 I bought the Tivo Series 2 and optimistically signed up for 3 years of service for $ 300 . I love the interface . It 's very user friendly , has lots of great features and the suggestions have been surprisingly on target . The product itself is pretty great . Unfortunately that 's where the good news ends.Everything went swimmingly until Tivo simply stopped recording . After a few days and many restarts it recorded everything except suggestions . Suggestions was a major reason I picked Tivo over other machines . I did some searching online and found out this was a wide spread issue that the company was completely ignoring . It was about six months before it magically righted itself one day . There was never any acknowledgment from the company of any problem.Things were good for about a year after that . Then the hard drive died . My warranty has of course expired , so there is nothing the company can do except offer to sell me another machine at full cost . They do n't offer repair , and I ca n't recoop any of the cost of the remaining time on my three year service contract.Overall , I love Tivo when it works . But the company could n't care less about it 's customers.The customer service is nonexistent .
 When I bought the TiVo , I was told that this item would tape 2 different programs at the same time . When it did n't work , I called that company and they told me that because I had DirectTV , it was impossible to use the TiVo like I wanted to . I was totally cheated . I then bought the DirectTV 's type of Digital REcorder , and it 's the best thing I 've ever done . It records 2 different programs at exactly the same time . TiVo told me that it only works on Cable . Bah Humbug . This is NOT explained when you want to buy the item . Buyers Beware
 Bought the Tivo 80 hr . Video Recorder to hook up to a security camera . Was advised it should work . Tuner arrived with no instructions and full of previous owner 's old recordings . Could not get instructions on TiVo 's internet site and have not yet been able to get it to work . We keep getting error msg . that we have to be a TiVo subscriber to use it . Will probably just throw it in the trash where it belonged in the first place .
 I do not have any problems with Amazon ... But I have problem with FireWallSalesNew York.I had return this TIVO almost three weeks ago . I had wrote tothem and I told them that I had sent it back due they was going to charge me $ 20.00 a month.I have Dish TV and they harge only me $ 6.00 a month . Ihad wrote to them different times to see if they got my TIVO.They writeback to tell that they will let me know.Now it 's going to a month and stillhave not resolved the problem.I think that I am going to better businessin the state of New York.I am very upset with this company.They have noPride if they did they would of taken care of me ... Noris
 A couple of things to consider . . First , this unit will not have all the features of the newer boxes . Features like the new search , netflix and youtube . Maybe even some more new features will be missing by the time you read this . TIVO is not interested in making these features available to pre Series 3 boxes either . After all they need to make a profit from new hardware sales and subscriptions.Second , as I learned in a previous review , the second tuner is not digital capable which means unless you have a cable company , you may not be able to use the second tuner.Finally if you get a lifetime subscription , be aware that in a few years when TIVO adds more features but neglects the older boxes , you can not transfer your lifetime subscription to a new box -LRB- unless TIVO changes their policy , or makes an exception -RRB- . So what have we learned ? Instead of buying this now ignored-by-TIVO tuner you should buy the newer Series 3 for much more $ $ and not get the lifetime subscription so you can transfer you service in the event you upgrade in the future .
 Tivo is a big rip-off . I purchased a TiVo TCD649080 Series2 80-Hour Dual-Tuner on line and hooked it up for 1 month at $ 9.95 and after a week I found it could only record 1 channel at a time so I called and canceled it . So for that one-week they charged me $ 109.50 and said it was an early termination fee . Even the Cable Company is not that bad beware of the moneygrubbers . Get you DVR from your cable or sat provider their Dual tuners are real dual tuners not pretend tuners .
 Cuando me entusiasme en comprar el TCD649080 en ninguna parte pude observar que para poder grabar los programas de TV nececitaba pagar una suscripcion ni tompoco se me notifico que solo era para uso exclusivamente en USA . Lo compre con una direccion en Fort Loderdale por intermedio de un amigo piloto , quien me lo trajo . El equipo , claro , llego muy bien , pero por lo anteriormente dicho me encuantro muy disgustado porque siente que perdi mi dinero.When I get excited in buying the TCD649080 in any part I could observe that to be able to record the programs of TV nececitaba to pay a subscription neither tompoco I am notified that single era for use exclusively in it USES . Buy it with an address in Fort Loderdale through a friend pilot who brought it to me . The team , clear , arrives very well , but for the previously this thing me very upset encuantro because it feels that I lost my money .
 Fast shipping , but none of the 10 discs I bought worked . I tried different speeds , burners , and ISO 's . I tried to contact Amazon and also the seller but got no response . BUYER BEWARE !!!!
 I thought this product would really come in handy for camping . But after owning it for just a couple of days , I accidentally tipped it over and that was all it took . The lantern would not work . I sent away for a new bulb , but that did not fix the problem.This is a well thought out product that offers many handy features . Unfortunately , with typical Black and Decker quality , do n't expect it to last long or to take even the slightest jarring . It could be a nice emergency item in case of a power blackout , but I would not recommend trying to take it anywhere on a trip because it is bound to break .
 Amazon sent wrong cable to me twice ... the picture and description clearly show a six inch cable . Original order and replacement were wrong .
 I purchased this scanner about 18 months ago and paid a great deal of money for it -LRB- purchased elsewhere -RRB- . I work in a professional graphic studio and needed a large flatbed . The first scanner arrived DOA , and it was returned . The second scanner died within one week . Recently , I started to notice severe color variations . This is after months of other problems , including scans that had shadows where there were none , and strange color patterns most of which I was able to correct in PhotoShop . Talking to technical support was useless , I would email them the scans that had very visible problems and they would claim it would look perfect on their monitor . I finally got hold of a supervisor who told me that the scanner was broken and would need repair , which would cost at least a few hundred dollars , plus shipping costs . Have decided to avoid further aggravation and just buy a new scanner , which will not be Microtek .
 I bought this CD player with a gift certificate I got for Christmas . First of all it ways about 10 pounds , and it only comes with only 3 secound anti-shock `` which they do n't tell you in the review or on the web site '' . I did n't even use it as soon as I opended the box and saw how big it was I repacked it and sent it back .
 Chose this printer because it had networking abilities.This printer has worked about 50 % of the time since the day it was plugged in . Either had to be restarted by shutting off and unplugging or the paper jammed . The simple task of printing a one page Word document has turned into a nightmare . Now , our computer ca n't `` find '' the printer . Plus , The All-In-One software sucks a ton of resources and is always on . Choose something else or regift it .
 We have had our printer for a little for over a year -LRB- also a bit over warranty , of course -RRB- . We have had a paper feeding issue , so I spent two hours on a phone with someone from India trying to correct the problem . They eventually sent me a new one . Recently , we have had a problem with a big black line through our scanned images . Called again and since it was over a year , they would not help us . AAAH . . I will not buy again .
 About 30 % of the time this printer will actually recognize that it does , in fact , have paper in the feed tray ; often paper needs to be fed by hand . It also jams about 50 % of all paper that goes through it . You can not simply tell the computer to print a document and walk away from it ; you have to sit there the entire time , feeding individual pieces of paper into the printer and pulling out the jams one by one . Also do n't even think about running it without both ink cartridges . When my color cartridge ran out , I let it go because I do n't do a lot of color printing . HP apparently really wants me to go out and buy another fifty-dollar cartridge because in all honesty about every two seconds during a print job -LRB- between the constant paper jam and lack of paper in tray messages -RRB- I received a pop-up telling me that I needed a color cartridge.I think I 'll go back to Canon .
 Paper feed is definitely a serious product defect . I called the HP tech support , but they were not aware of the paper feed cleaning kit that some reviewer mentioned . They only suggested cleaning the roller with dampened cloth.Thanks to Michael C Garrett 's ingenious solution , this printer is more or less reusable again .
 I just wanted to add my voice to those who already mentioned the problems with paper feed . Not long after I bought this model -LRB- but too late to return -RRB- it started having problems with the paper feed . I now have to hand feed each piece of paper , and even then it sometimes does n't work . The print quality is fine , but what good is it if you ca n't get the paper in . I now have to replace this `` new '' printer . That was a couple of hundred dollars wasted .
 My experience with HP printers has been good . But this one disappoints me . Find a different model with better reviews . The print quality is good but the paper feed problems are frequent .
 Like so many others , hard to believe this ever made itthrough HP QA - I end up hand feeding many , failure over75 % of the time !!! Find another machine .
 I CAN NOT walk away from a multipage project and expect to return and have the job done . I have to manually insert EVERY single sheet into the printer . It 's a disaster . I 've purchased HP printers for more than 10 years , and this is by far the worst peripheral device I have come across . STAY AWAY , unless you enjoy hand feeding your printer ...
 For those who doubt the user , be assured this printer does have paper feed problems . Some users have good experiences but it the problem lies in the printer . I have been a network consultant for 10 years and I fix all the computer hardware problems for my company . This printer feed problem is not something that can be fixed by reading the manual . For your information , I am using HP Color Inkjet paper . It printed a few pages fine in the beginning then started jamming on every single sheet . I have to manually help it along by pushing each page for it to catch the paper . Sometimes it just grabs a stack of 30 sheets . It has a poor paper pick up design and that is a fact .
 I had the printer for one month before the paper feed problems occurred . I went to tech support and after they asked me re-register for the THIRD time I threw the printer out the window -LRB- literally -RRB- . No HP for me !
 It 's true . The only thing that works in applying hairspray on the rollers with a Q tip -LRB- after first applying alcohol with the Q tip and letting it dry -RRB- . Pathetic !
 This is the second HP printer I bought and frankly the only reason I tried this printer was because of the network connectivity . I have n't written many reviews before , but this product is soo bad that I had to add to the list of angry customers . Getting the printer to load 1 piece of paper is a nightmare . Now i get paper jam warnings when there is no paper in the bloody machine . Anyone see office space ? yeah after I get my new Canon printer , i will re-enact that scene . perhaps i should record it and send it to HP ?
 I had all the same paper feed , paper jam , customer service problems just like everyone else . I fixed the problem by smashing the printer into my wall . Of course I had to pick up thousands of glass shards and buy some drywall mud , but I feel much better !
 This is the worst printer in the world . it scans ok but it fails to do the basic task required of a printer - it wo n't PRINT !!!!! The paper feed is terrible , and do n't buy the crap about `` if you buy HP paper it works fine '' it DOES NOT , i have continually tried to use HP photo paper -LRB- remember this is supposed to be wonderful at printing photos -RRB- it will not grab it , HP need to recall all of these printers in my opinion , the only thing this printer is good for is flying out of my window .
 Please save yourself some money and if you have this printer . . unplug it and throw in trash now before you waste countless hours of your time , ink and expensive paper ... jams constantly and hand feeding required . . RUN AWAY !!
 Update
 I have had good success with HP in the past , but I never had any luck with this printer . Like a lot of the reviews , the paper feed never worked right and I would have to hand feed the pages one at a time . When feeding paper it seemed like the printer jammed half the time . I only tried one scan and an HP error message jumped up . I downloaded the current software , some 165mb and reloaded but never got the scan to work . I went through the supplied ink cartridge quickly and after loading a new cartridge my text prints were coming out with a double image . Luckily I purchased the unit at Sam 's Club and they took it right back after 3 + months that I tried to get this unit to work , thinking it was me and not the printer . I would have liked to purchase my next printer from Sam 's also , but I am going to try the Canon MP600 and they do n't seem to carry it .
 At the risk of repeating everythingeveryone else has already said , pleaseread past reviews.The expense I haveto go through just to get ** 1 ** pageto print is absolutely ridicously!I end up going to Kinkos half the time.Deep regrets about this one !
 The printer worked fine for a couple of weeks . Then the paper feed mechanism suddenly stopped picking up the paper . I found that I could print single sheets if I shoved a piece of paper in at just the right moment . Too early and I would get a paper jam , too late and I would get an `` out of paper '' message.This issue afflicts a good number of HP inkjet printers . So many , in fact , that HP created a help page just for it
 I 've had my 2575 about a year and it is now nearly useless because of paper feed problems . When there is not a paper jam -LRB- which is a worse experience -RRB- , every time -LRB- 100 % -RRB- you try to print it says `` out of paper '' ; then you have to manually feed a sheet and retry . I called HP . They would n't send their cleaning kit to me and insisted on going through a long debug procedure . I was able to print a couple test sheets . They said they 'd call back in a few days to make sure it was still working . It stopped working the next day but guess what , I gave them a week and they did n't me back . So I called them again . They said they 'd send a cleaning kit after someone called me back later to get more information . They did n't call back , again . I called again , and after talking to two people , they ordered one for me . Now , the cleaning kit for this network printer only works using a USB connection . Since I had it installed as a network printer , I moved the printer to where a USB cord would reach , completely de-installed the printer software , and re-installed it for a USB connection ; but no matter what -LRB- like booting up Windows in Safe mode and making sure I can print to the printer -RRB- , when I run the cleaning software , NOTHING HAPPENS ! It will run for an hour or more until I go into task manager and kill it -LRB- `` it '' taking 98 % of my CPU -RRB- . Here we go again , stuck with spare ink refills with no working printer !
 Most egregiously awful piece of hardware I 've ever seen . I 'm about 4/60 on number of sheets of paper that the thing has actually picked up without me hand feeding.Pathetic .
 Sound like a broken record ? It is very frustrating having to load EVERY single sheet of paper into the feeder ; but believe me , you too will have the pleasure if you purchase this printer . No doubt it 's a product defect . Do yourself a favor , save your sanity and frustration ... buy a different one .
 First I am disappointed that Amazon makes you give at least one star . My advise on this sorry excuse for a printer is to save your money ... save yourself from more gray hairs ... save your kids from having to hear you yell obscenities ... and do n't buy this piece of junk ! Unless you enjoy having to load each sheet of paper one at a time every time you print , all the time in hopes that it will take the paper and not jam . If that sounds like fun - then my friend ... this is the printer for you ! Me on the other hand , I will never own another HP .
 This printer is awful . I have researched complaints about the 2575 and found tons of consumers with the same paper feed/jam problems . Not only does it take forever getting something printed because of the thing not grabbing the paper , but once it finally decides to feed it chews it up , causing almost half of the pages to be ruined . Great , more money for hp - paper.And how about thier troubleshooting for the issue on the hp website ? I feel that hp is aware of the issues , yet their support page lists a few of the common things you should check and if those do n't work , they suggest you invest some more of your money in a cleaning kit they sell . That might be ok if you had the thing for a while , but most complaints are from customers who have n't had the thing more than a month.Please do yourself a favor and do n't buy it .
 I had just bought this printer in May and it worked fine to begin with , now it 's having the same paper jam and out of paper issues as almost all of the other people 's printers are on this site . . please , avoid this printer at all costs . . all it does is give a person a headache trying to fix the problem . The only thing good about this machine is the printing quality , but that does n't make up for the fact that it is a completely dysfunctional product . Had I read these reviews before purchasing , I would have never invested in this product . . the sad thing is , I have previously owned a different HP model and it worked great . . too bad this one was n't the same .
 I 've not had paper jams or feed problems in ten years . Now they are back ! In two months I have printed perhaps 100 sheets . Now there is a problem with 3 sheets out of 4 . Every other HP printer that I have or have had feeds paper with no problem at all , but this one does not !
 The constant printer jams make this printer unusable ! And do n't buy the baloney that those of us having problems have not followed the manufacturer 's directions . The thing jams with HP 's own -LRB- expensive -RRB- paper no matter how many pieces of paper are in the tray .
 Wish I had read these reviews before buying this piece of crap . It did great for about 2 weeks , then the paper feed problems began . It does n't pick up the sheets unless I feed them one at a time . If I do n't , the rollers simply do n't pick up the paper , and the message reads `` No paper in paper tray '' even though there is plenty . Then the misfeeds and paper jams continue . It even stops and reads `` Paper Jam !! '' when there is no paper jam!I called HP and they sent me a new one free of charge , with a box to return the old one in . The new one worked fine for 2 weeks , then started up again with the same old headaches . The alcohol/hairspray trick another reviewer suggested for the rollers does not work . Save your money . This printer is the absolute worst . HP should be ashamed of themselves for putting it on the market . They MUST have known about the problems .
 I agree with the others here , HP are useless and I should have known better . Paper jams all the time using laser quality paper kept in a humidity controlled environment . Every copy you have to feed through manually.I couldjust about live with that but it does n't scan either !! It says it ` sscanning , it sounds like it 's scanning - it even says image sent to the computer after scanning but do any images appear ?? Do they heck !! Still under warranty , I 've had a replacement unit and still the same and the HP techie team , -LRB- based in India ! -RRB- ca n't help - it 's going back !!
 DO N'T BUY THIS HORRIBLE PRODUCT !!! I was given this as a gift , so thankfully did n't spend any money on it . It simply will not print . I usually spend about half an hour and end up with at least 30 ruined sheets of paper to print one page.In looking online , I can see that other users have had the same problem . Apparently the feed mechanism is faulty.Very faulty.I find my blood pressure rising just looking at the printer.Please buy any printer other than this one . And I 'm staying away from HP in the future .
 I have actually not yet had the paper feed issue like the rest of the reviewers , but this product has been horribly implemented . I have continually had issues with attempting to install the 160 + MB driver and HP Solution Center software on multiple different computers running different Operating Systems . The scanner is about worn out , as it makes a horrible grinding noise when scanning which started to occur within months of the purchase . HP used to be known for their great quality in printers , but this is unfortunately no longer the case . Do Not Buy .
 Like others I would like to voice my frustration with the paper feed mechanism . It worked fine at first but then it would say that there was no paper in the tray when of course there was lots of it . HP sent me a cleaner for it but it could only be used 3 times . When that option ran out I contacted them again and they stated they could no longer help me with the problem . Disappointing for a large company to put out such a crappy printer and I am definitely going us use reviews the next time I purchase a printer . Not sure if I trust HP anymore . Now I 'm getting the `` No Scan Option '' message and it seems to be a fairly common problem also . DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER !
 Honestly , this printer worked normally for me for a day - the first day I set it up . Since then , I have had to hand feed every single piece of paper I try to print . Then there were the issues of it only printing in color and not using any of the black ink cartridge . The only fix was to replace a virtually new cartridge . Granted , the customer service people at HP , who helped me troubleshoot through instant message , were helpful , but this has been a lemon from the moment I bought it.I do n't think I have ever found a printer that is not a professional-office grade one that works well at home . Any suggestions would be most welcome !
 To begin , the software installation is a headache . I had trouble installing it even though I work in IT . Why do you need a 40MB - 200MB driver that requires you to turn off your Anti-virus during installation ?! The printer jams often and will sometimes shutdown while printing . While I think HP business grade printers are great , this consumer grade printer is junk .
 RUN AWAY , RUN AWAY , RUN AWAY.When and if it works , it looks great.I wish I could rate this at NO stars because of the paper jam or out of paper issue . I guess it 's come to the point where we have to beg , plead and pray just to get something to work as advertised . I purchased this a Wal-Mart for $ 50 , so I would bet that American manufacturers are thinking that `` if they only spend 50 bucks , what did they expect ? '' `` They should have paid more so it will work . ''
 I signed up just to write this review . I have had printers from Canon Epson Lexmark and Hp in the last 10 years . I have to say that this printer is the worst of the lost.I have had all of the feed issues that others have had and more.My printer cleaned itself so often that the sponge under the ink cartridges actually turned into a mountain . The ink is insanley expensive and does not last long at all . The software is bloated and like others the scanner software just stopped working.I will never buy another HP printer again .
 I am in complete agreement with the rest of you who have had paper feeding problems . The printer was fine at first although difficult to set up -LRB- software -RRB- . Now , a month later , the printer either does n't take the paper or jams . It has nothing to do with the quality of the paper . I am also surprised that this was n't discovered in testing . I also noticed that the ink cartridges keep getting smaller . What a rip off . I have had it with HP printers . I will never buy another .
 Update ... HP sent me a replacement printer at no charge!My printer did the same thing that so many others here have reported ... worked fine for a while and then stopped feeding paper . It seems clear to me -LRB- after carefully inspecting and poking at it without disassembling it -RRB- that the roller that initially feeds the paper does n't apply enough pressure . I kept thinking something must have broken , but now I think it is just a bad design and HP should do something about this . My plan is to call them , point out the dozens and dozens of complaints on-line and urge them to replace the darn thing with something that works .
 Like many other customers who have reviewed the HP Photosmart 2574 All-in-One Printer I also have had problems with the paper feed . I originally purchased this printer at Staples in late December of 2005 and started having paper feed problems about a month later . I contacted HP 's tech support and went through all their power down and resetting tests which of course did nothing to help with the problem . I was told I could return it for a refurbished one but opted to return it to the local Staples store where they offered me a new one if I agreed to purchase an extended warranty for $ 29.99 in early February . I have now had the new printer for about a month and a half and am now having the same problem with an `` Out of Paper '' error when there is plenty of paper in the tray , and am having to manually feed the paper again . I contacted Staples and told them of the problem , and when asked what I would like to do replied that I would like to exchange for a different model and be credited the full price of the printer plus the cost of the extended warranty . I was told that I would not be credited for the extended warranty because that is what allowed me to return the printer itself . I find it ridiculous that I paid for a warranty that only allows me to return a product which has an inherent design problem . I plan on contacting HP customer support and if they do not offer me a full refund will never buy another HP product again.I would probably have rated this at 4 stars if I had not had this problem . The ink cartridges are also very small , about a third the size of the ones on my old HP 722c printer , which I 'm sure does n't hurt their profit margins .
 After one month , the paper will not lift from the tray . HP knows about this problem when I called service . They showed me how to clean the paper puller wheel . It works for now . A little dust , and the wheel gets no traction . Stay away from this printer .
 I too have been frustrated beyond belief with the out of paper and paper jam problems of this printer . I read all 80 reviews before mine and concluded , -LRB- as did others -RRB- , that it must be a dirty pickup roller causing most of the problems . Many say that the problem started a month or two after getting the printer , which reinforces this theory.I opened the back access panel and cleaned the single black paper feed roller with rubbing alcohol on a Q-tip . Apparently it does n't take much dust or dirt to cause a problem because it did not appear to be very dirty . I 'm assuming I 'll have to do this every few months . The next time I will probably just use purified or distilled water like HP suggests since rubbing alcohol might be too strong an agent for cleaning the roller.I loaded between 10 and 25 sheets into the printer as HP suggests , and it is now working like it did when it was new . Next I tried putting in as much paper as it would hold and it still works perfectly ! I have always liked HP printers and if it were n't for this glaring weakness , I would give it 5 stars .
 I purchased a brand new HP Photosmart 2575 All-In-One printer in November 2005 . I hardly have used it except to print an occasional e-mail . However , this week I scanned and printed about 30 - 4 '' x 6 '' photos which I have to admit came out nice , but then the printer stopped working and now the paper keeps jamming and I can not print anything . I called HP support and they told me my warranty had expired and they could not assist me but that for a fee I could extend the warranty and they would look into the problem . Hello , is anybody home ? Why would I extend the warranty on something that no longer works and for which I have read a hundred or so bad reviews from others who are also having the same problem with this junk printer ? In any event , after reading the many many reviews with the same problem I bought a Canon Pixma MP 800 that I can not wait to receive . I wo n't let HP waste any more of my time by giving me the run around , but I will report them to the Better Business Bureau for making a faulty product and then not admitting it or trying to properly assist me and solve my problem without first trying to get me to pay more money for a warranty extension . That 's an awful way to do business .
 It looks great , lcd screen with media card slots was nice touch . . but what good is it if it ca n't take in any paper to PRINT ANY THING OUT ... I was able to get it to take in paper using exclusive HP paperand ONE PAPER at a time it works SOME TIMES.My first HP printer and it will be my LAST , when I run out of Ink on the darn thing , rather thanburning 60 bucks for INK I would buy a LEXMARK again .
 Like so many others , hard to believe this ever made itthrough HP QA - I end up hand feeding many , failure over75 % of the time !!! Find another machine .
 I use the recommended paper for this machine and after a couple of weeks began noticing a problem with the printing . Everytime I print a page , the machine fails to feed the paper through . I have to manually hold the paper in until the machine can grab it and pull it through to print . It 's a waste of time and a waste of money .
 Worst printer I 've ever bought . DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER !!!! Constant Paper Jams , thick black line through scans/copies even after troubleshooting , annoying polling every couple minutes . This is probably going to be the last HP printer I ever buy . I was ripped off for a premium-line printer . I 'm replacing it with a cheaper but more reliable Canon MP160 which does everything this one was supposed to and I 've never had a single problem with it .
 HP IS TWO-FOR-TWO AT SELLING ME USELESS JUNK . HPs own installation CD couldnt install this piece of junk , and kept telling me there was no printer connected . So I tried installing it with the default Mac OSX printer utility , and it worked fine , printed in color and everything , but it would n't scan . So after visiting the HP support site , which led me thru a tedious half hour of searching thru files and deleting over 30 files manually , it then directed me to a page where I could download a new HP driver . THE PAGE DIDNT EXIST . I learned an expensive lesson - NEVER BUY AN HP PRINTER .
 Is a copier expected to last more than a year or two ? Purchased in spring 06 - In Oct 06 I had problems with thick black lines in my scans & copies . The fix was to remove ink cartridges , disconnect machine from surge protector , powercycle three or four times , wipe copper connects , put them back in , reconnect to computer , start it all again . It worked . Problem recurred now 5/07 only this time 2 big black lines . Got out my copy of troubleshoot , tried it again to no avail , Warranty is expired and I 'm told it is a hardware problem . I feel ripped off . Stay away from this HP product .
 I have all the same problems as the rest of these reviews do , I thought it was just my printer . . I was ready to throw it out . . says its out of paper , or gets paper jams all the time . . do yourself a favor and do n't buy this one
 As verified by the other reviews , I can honestly say that this copier never feeds paper into the printer correctly . Never . Each time I need something printed I must remove all but 2 sheets of paper and then force them into the tray input so that one will be pulled in . Often both will end up going through and this is the best I can hope for . The engineering on this machine is seriously deficient . You do not want the repetitive agony this has to offer .
 I 'm so glad to see others corroborate my experience with this meshuggah printer ! Nothing but trouble - paper jams all the time , slow , awful - I thought it was maybe because I was using a Mac but apparently not.STAY AWAY at ANY price !
 I am ready to throw this one out the window . I just inherited it upon marriage and now I know why the daughter who owned it wanted her own things when she moved out.I am really tired of Out of Paper and Pater Jam notices.I consider myself to be extremely printer competent but this machine has not little tricks for coaxing it to print . It is just junk .
 This is the worst printer i have ever had ! Every time i tried to print some thing , it 's paper jam , paper jam , and paper jam . stay away ! if you want a printer scanner copier , get the psc 1610 . lasted my 5 years !
 I got this printer for x-mas . Withen 3 months the rollers that pull the paper into the printer had broken , rendering the printer completely useless . I could n't return it , so I was stuck with a large piece of junk . This complimented my HP laptop that broke at the same time due to a manufacture 's recalled power fan . Bottom line , DO NOT BY HP .
 This is the worst printer ever . The other reviews are right ! Tons of paper jams ! I have to sit and babysit it and feed it sheet by sheet because it wont pick paper ! DO NOT BUY !!!!
 The system works great and the clarity is perfect . The problem is when I reboot the computer , it takes 10 minutes . I just get a single flashing dot in the top left corner for 10 solid minutes and then it will finally boot up . If I unhook the printer , the system boots up normally ... HELP !!!
 Unlike some others , I have had no problems with any of the features on the HP 2775xi bought from Costco . The software has done everything as advertised -LRB- printing , scanning , copying -RRB- . However , all the complaints about the paper feed are completely justified . This is NOT a user issue . We had an HP950C for 3 years with no paper feed problems , and the 2575 placed in exactly the same spot , with very good paper -LRB- several brands tried , including HP -RRB- , will only print reliably for about two weeks at a time . The temporary solution is cleaning the print feed roller with alcohol , but the problem is a totally incompetent feed roller design by HP.HP now advertises an '' HP Paper Feed Cleaning Kit '' as the fix , but cleaning is NOT a fix . Until there is a kit that includes a redesigned self-cleaning feed roller , the only solution is to keep cleaning the roller or try coating it with something -LRB- hairspray suggested by one reviewer -RRB- . As much as I like HP , this defect is so glaring and incompetent that I will not be buying another HP printer -LRB- since many other models report the same issue -RRB- . There are too many good alternatives .
 Like everyone else , I had the paper feed problem . However , what 's really awful is the customer support . I service rep in India took the call , and while I knew exactly what the problem was , it was like talking to a robot . All the rep could do was follow exactly what his script said , then he transferred me to someone else who asked the same exact questions all over again.HP was so gung-ho about offshoring all of their customer service . Well , since I can no longer GET any competent service I certainly wo n't be an HP customer again .
 I have owned this printer 6 months . I purchased it based on price , relatively compact size and all in one capability . I have had minor problems with paper jams . The print quality in the first 5 months was good for documents , good for photos . Copy quality was good . After 6 months , I was unable to print black text . I contacted technical support . They were not knowledgeable and I spent 2 hours online removing printer cartridges , cleaning printer cartridges , aligning printer cartridges -LRB- the extent of the `` support '' -RRB- . I was told that the printer would be replaced with a refurbished unit and I would need to provide a credit card number to guarantee the exchange . My confidence in the `` refurbished '' unit is not very high . Luckily I have a replacement policy with CompUSA . Overall , not a reliable unit .
 Things I like
 I picked up this device to replace a ten year old HP Deskjet & a Canon scanner.It did n't print as well as the old Deskjet & the picture scans were horrible with lines in the image & it did n't seem to have enough gray levels as b/w pictures were clipped
 Please do not waste your money . I have had one for 2 years and have reloaded the software to make it work at least 30 times .
 I expected much more from the `` all in one '' HP2575 inkjet based on my experience using HP Office laser printer products . In fact , I 'm still using a 15yr old HP laser B&W ; printer daily . Before this bad experience with the HP2575 I would n't have purchase anything but HP printer 's . I 've been very satisfied with all my network HP laser printer 's used at the office . That being said my personal home HP2575 inkjet failed after appox 3 years of very low usage . It no longer scans or prints yet troubleshooting indicates no error 's . I would avoid this product.That being said I have just purchased a new HP Photosmart Premium All-in-One Printer -LRB- CD055A #ABA -RRB- , supported by user reviews for home use only and it had better meet my expectations , or it will be the last HP inkjet printer product I 'll ever purchase .
 Mine worked well for the first year and then it started thinking that it had a paper jam . The printer would pick up a sheet of paper , feed it half way through then stop , saying there was a paper jam . There was no paper jam . The printer just thought there was . Upon doing a little research I discovered , much to my chagrin , that this is an all to common problem with this model . Do a search on ` HP Photosmart 2575 paper jam ' and you 'll see the same reviews I did . It 's too bad that HP has not fixed the problem or even addressed it anywhere on their website.I 've always liked HP products but you would be taking a big chance if you were to purchase this particular model . It might work fine but it might also render itself useless by the phantom paper jam . There 's just no way to know which route your printer will take .
 HP should reimburse us all for this piece of junk . I have had it for over a year and selected after it researching and reading what reviews there were . Unfortunately , this is a QUALITY issue and there is no quality with his printer . Paper wo n't feed and it jams . All the previous reviews are right on target . The problem started almost immediately .
 PLEASE this is a warning ! Do not buy this printer !!! Avoid at all costs !! HP tech support is useless and clueless . I had it for 3 days when it started jamming 100 % of the time . PLUS , as a graphic designer I need my output to be tru to scale , this junk prints a 4 inch square as a 4.125 inch square ! It does NOTHING good , plus it ran out of color ink after 40 pages !! I wish they had negative 5 stars
 I 've had one of these printers for 6 months , and the paper feed problems have grown to the point where nothing will print without jams , feeding problems and more grey hairs . I spent 30 minutes online with HP 's chat technician which were utterly worthless , and decided to return this today and get a new and different printer . I 've had many printers in the past , and always been very happy with HP products before , but this one has been a disastor . There is apparently a paper feeder cleaning kit that HP will send that may or may not fix the problem , but after 30 minutes of trying to get the tech to send me one , I have given up on it ! I have tried two different brands of good quality paper , and had the same problems with both . Buyer beware !
 Add my voice to the throng of unsatisfied customers who own this one . The features are great , the print quality 's great , but once the paper stops feeding except manually a sheet at a time -LRB- and even then only after several attempts and paper jams -RRB- , you 're hosed . Look elsewhere .
 I received this printer for Christmas . I had it maybe a month and a half and it would not pull the paper . I tried all the recommendations on HP website and it did not help . I ended up contacting HP tech support . They had me do all these resets , etc. which still did not work . They offered a refurbished one for free so I took it . It was like new but again about a month or two later - SAME PROBLEM . Of course , I did not buy extended warranty so I MANUALLY FEED THE PAPER EVERY TIME . It is a great printer otherwise but I recommend NOT TO BUY THIS PRINTER
 I originally bought the printer in November ' 05 , and it worked splendidly for about three weeks , at which point I had it replaced because , as has happened to so many other people , the printer started refusing to take the paper in the tray out of the blue one day.I got the replacement , unpacked it , and it worked beautifully again . As I was away from my apartment during the Christmas season , it did n't see much use during the return period , and did n't stop feeding paper again until I -LRB- finally -RRB- threw the box away three days ago.I 'd never buy a computer from HP , but I thought , `` It 's just a printer , and what are the chances of the same thing going wrong twice ? '' Pretty good , apparently .
 It was great at first , but after a few weeks of light duty , it will no longer feed the paper . It keeps saying it is out of paper , but it is n't . If I `` nudge '' the paper with my finger , it will print.Oh well , I should have known better than to give HP another chance .
 This is hands down the worst printer I 've ever had ... it takes about 5 times the amount of time it should to print anything because of constant paper feed issues ... do not get this product !
 I bought this printer from Sam 's Club , and it worked great for about 2 months . After that , the paper feeder was unable to recognize paper - in order to print anything , the paper had to be manually fed through the printer . Fortunately , Sam 's was great and gave me a full refund . Buyer beware!I bought the Canon Pixma MP600 - we 'll see how that one works .
 I have had HP printers for years and this is the first one I have ever owned that came out of the box giving problems with paper jams and not feeding paper . If I was Hewlett Packard , I would have recalled this junk or offered to give customers credit for what they paid against another printer . I will never purchase another HP printer . Never !
 This printer fails as a printer mainly because paper wo n't properly feed . HP helpdesk requests you to tap all paper , and put in 10 ~ 25 sheets only . This does n't work . Feeding one sheet at a time manually has at best a 1/10 shot of success . Let 's hope HP 's refurb replacement printer is better .
 This is the first review I have ever written , but I am so annoyed with this so-called printer that I had to add my 2 cents.My last HP printer lasted for over 5 years before giving up the ghost . I was happy with its preformance . This one I have had about 2 months and I am ready to throw it out the window.The paper feeding problem is VERY ANNOYING . I find I have to fiddle for many minutes to get it to recognize there is paper in the tray . Then once it does , it has a 50/50 chance of jamming!For HP to call it a printer is almost funny , because I have yet to have it just print without problems.I am in the market for a new printer after less than 2 months !
 I had a previous model similar to the HP 2575 which lasted for 2 years with alot of use . However , after purchasing this model on Sept 21 , 2006 and using it for barely 2 months the scanner mode is now squeaking and sounds horrible . This is the same noise the prior version did right before it quit . I agree that HP support is completely worthless - that 's if you can even get them to understand what your problem is since it may not be in their `` manual '' . Anyone have a suggestion on a decent brand that will do incredible scans of old photos and not fail in the first two years ??
 I also have been a long time Canon printer user , but decided to try this HP after a co-work said she had such good luck . Not a good idea.The printer would not print envelopes , kept giving me the error message that it did not recognize the paper size . It would not print labels , gave the same error message.Just printing normally it would tell me there was a paper jam.I 'm glad I returned the printer before I had to buy ink for it.I just purchased a Canon , ca n't wait for it to get here .
 I have had this printer for about three months and have consistently had the same problems with the printer telling me that it is out of paper when I am looking at a stack of paper . Sometimes it works , more often it does not . It is very inconsistent.Now I have a new issue . The scanner , which is very good , has stopped working . When I press the scan button , my printer says , `` No Scan Options '' which is fantasticAlso , I tried to use some specialty paper -LRB- namely iron on paper -RRB- in this machine and it was a complete mess . For what I paid , this should not be happening . I thought HP made a good machine , but I will NEVER buy a HP printer again .
 I bought this printer from Staples back in January . It was terrific and I really was hoping to take advantage of the scanner , the printer , and the network port . Seemed like a great package . But the paper feed issue is real.I 'm using standard printer paper from Staples , nothing fancy . But the printer simply is n't picking the paper up . If I do n't do anything the `` Out of Paper '' message appears . I literally have to push the paper in when i 'm printing -LRB- of course that sometimes causes the printer to jam known as a lose-lose -RRB- Also , the software the comes with the printer is dreadful . Scanning is good , but forget about it if you want to copy pictures off a memory card you stuck in the printer.It 's too bad , i 've never had such a bad HP printer experience either with an inkjet or laser at work . I 'm dissappointed .
 I bought this printer on a whim after having been a satisfied Canon user for a decade . I learned my lesson and will never buy another HP product . This printer worked well for about one month of light use . After this , it began to have problems picking up paper . I have used only HP Bright Inkjet paper , and the paper is crisp and fresh , so it 's not a problem with humidity or curled paper . It 's reached a point where every sheet of paper has to be individually coaxed into the feed mechanism . Even then , it jams about half the time.It 's hard to believe that HP did not discover this problem during product development and testing . Yet they have put this piece of junk on the market . I 'm having to write mine off as a loss because it 's now too late to return it to the store , and HP 's only solution is to replace it with the exact same printer with the same problem . I 'm hoping someone files a class action suit against HP for the junk they put on the market .
 I 'll add my voice to the paper feed issue . After about a month it has become intollerable . Either it does n't feed the paper or it jambs . Everytime you print you have to get up to fix something . Being a network printer , it would be nice if you could print from your computer and go get the printout but it is n't that easy . It is n't a paper thing either , I use very good paper -LRB- although I do n't think I should have to be wed to HP brand everything to use this . -RRB- Stay away from this one.I had a problem installing the printer . The help from india did not help at all . The person spent 45 minutes to an hour on the phone with me but clearly could do nothing but read from some manual . I ended up not using their software . You can set up a permanent IP address on this printer and use `` add printer '' in windows to print to it -LRB- ironically , choose `` local port '' , then set up an IP port with the address you chose for the printer . -RRB- The software is large and unnecessary , however I did have to install it and uninstall it to get the scanner to work.If not for the paper feed issue , this is a great printer/scanner/copier .
 I did n't buy the printer from Amazon . But because I like Amazon and value its readers is my reason for writing this . The HP Photosmart 2575xi that I purchased was a great machine . However , when you discover its little idiosyncrasies it becomes a royal pain in the neck ! The paper feed does not work correctly and I am not the only one that has had this problem . It completely destroyed my faith in HP when techs tell you turn it off 3 times and then what ? Send it back ... You have to hand feed like a little baby ... then the paper jam error comes up ... wonder what HP Tech 's go to school for ... to learn to say turn it off 3 times and unplug it for 10 minutes ... then repeat it ... sounds like level I techs on the Internet Providers ... Get your act together HP ...
 As with the other reviewers , this printer worked fine for a short while , then I started to get the `` out of paper '' and `` paper jam '' errors . I contacted HP , and was told that I could n't connect the power cord to my surge protector and had to go directly into a wall outlet . When that did n't work , I was told to unplug the printer , wait 30 seconds , plug it back in , then repeat 3 times . At this point I decided to just return the printer .
 I thought this was a great little all-in-one for about 3 months , then the paper feed problems began . When I tried to print anything the first attempt would fail to pickup the paper . After reloading the paper and tweaking it would print.I called HP Total Care , and they had me go through what they call a power cycle . That is turn off the printer , unplug the cable , unplug the power cord , wait 30 seconds , plug the power cord back in , turn on the printer , repeat 3 times , on the last time plug the cable back in . I think they forgot the spin around three times , rub your stomach in a clockwise motion , and pat your head step.They also wanted to make sure the printer was not connected to a surge protector . I can only guess that they are hoping that the printer will be wiped out by lightning , or a power surge , in an attempt to reduce customer calls to support.I did get it to feed for about 5 minutes after cleaning the rollers with an achohol swab.So , after 3 calls to support , I finally outlasted their persistant effort to frustrate me with rediculous tasks like power cycling -LRB- see above -RRB- , I have a new unit coming . We will see how long this works.The only reason I have n't returned the unit , is because the store I purchased the printer , has a 15 day return policy on computer equipment . Too bad ...
 Do n't waste your money . This is the worst printer I have ever owned . If this is an indication of other HP products , no wonder HP stock is tanking . Paper does n't feed , display screen does n't work , error light blinks continuously.I 'm taking this into the back yard and going `` office Space '' on it .
 It is almost impossible to get this printer to print without an out of paper error , jam , etc. . Does n't matter what kind of paper you use . Whether you put in one piece -LRB- still does n't work -RRB- , more then one -LRB- takes entire stack -RRB- It always says out of paper when it 's not . What a nightmare . I 'm finally tossing this item . I will NEVER by an HP product again . There are hundreds of complaints about this problem and they wo n't take the printer back .
 This worked for about a month , then the scanner function ceased to work except by accessing it through the computer , in other words , you could n't put a photo in it and push the scan button but had to go thru the computer . Now even that does n't work . The troubleshooting they have is extremely complicated/pure gibberish.What a piece of junk .
 Pick something else , please . I have had this printer for two and a half years . It sucks up two or three pieces of paper at a time very frequently . Forget double sided printing . I replaced my print cartridge two or three weeks ago and have printed maybe 60 pages and just got a message that my ink cartridge is almost empty . I buy hp replacement cartridges , not off brands . I do little printing and have spent much more on ink than I did the printer . The jams are ridiculous . It mishandles paper on average 50 % of the time . I am shopping for a replacement just to save the headache of dealing with this printer .
 I have to say I 've never had the paper feed problem that everyone else here complains about , and I 've had my printer for well over a year . I came here , though , on a google search to try to find out why the color inkjet just never NEVER works . I do n't use this often , but I was excited to have a color printer . I think the only decent color picture I made with this printer may have been the first one . Since then I 've replaced the inkjets -LRB- expensive ! -RRB- , and clean them repeatedly just to get them to print , but they 're always stripey , making the color printer -LRB- especially for photographs -RRB- essentially useless , making me wish I 'd sprung a few extra bucks for a printer that might have worked better.As for b & w ; printing , scanning , and copying , I 've had no problems .
 I have been using this printer for over a year . This is a very loud and inefficient printer . It ca n't even print doc well . I use top quality paper and this does not help . It is a particularly voracious ink eater as well . Stay away from it , even if they give it to you . . It is huge .
 I would like to add my voice to the Choir of Dismay , Frustration and Anger at this Piece of Crap printer . There was a time -LRB- long ago -RRB- that HP was a good brand that made good printers . Not now , Folks . I have had nothing but headaches with this printer that wo n't print . Paper Jams or never picks up the page , and now it 's making horrible , grinding noises . I 'm looking around for a printer that will actually print . The install was another headache , btw . I wish negative stars were an option - I did n't even want to give it one.On its behalf , I will say that the card reader and scanner are decent . The copier 's okay , too . But , IT 'S A PRINTER . That 's my main reason for needing it ... Duh !
 No piece of hardware should be as painful to use as this was . Not a bad printer when it worked -- but between the expiring ink cartridge issue , which a web search will tell you more about , functions that were dead on arrival , flaky tech support , paper feed issues , expensive ink , bloated hardware , and a scan/copy button that did nothing , it did n't work often enough . It does have an ethernet port , but there 's no point in networking a printer that does n't print . Also , if you get stuck with vague cartridge errors , removing one of the two ink cartridges may be a work around . Not acceptable performance , though.This printer 's about to go the way of Old Yeller , and be replaced with something that actually prints .
 This COULD be a great printer except for the paper handling mentioned before . I will never purchase another HP printer .
 I ca n't believe all the problems with feeding the paper . Glad -LRB- well not glad -RRB- to see I am not alone . I 've tried every and anything to get my paper to feed . If I knew then what I know now , I would have returned the piece of junk . It 's too late now .
 It 's all true about the paper jam issues . After a while , you need to manually load each piece of paper for it to pick it up . Once the paper is fed , it prints fine . It 's getting the paper to feed that 's the issue . It 's very frustrating !! Next time I 'm buying a different brand !
 This item has a number of issues , admitted on the site of HP and other forums.They vary from paper feed issues , to connection and hardware conflicts.I have experienced the printer working without problems for 3 months then suddenly with no hardward or software changes the printer stopped.I got it working again for a short period however there appears to be faults in the actual software from HP.If you want a hassle free printer that is reliable do n't buy this one.When it works it is very impressive but when it goes wrong , you 'll be regretting the day you brought it.Im sure there are plently of people that have this printer and have had no problems at all , however if you do your research there are an awful number of people that do have problems with it.Make your own mind up but check other sites/forums for reviews as well as here .
 I would n't buy this printer again . I have had it about 2 years . I get paper jams but that 's not the worse thing . The `` OK '' button stopped working . So when I get a paper jam , I have to shut the printer off and then back on . Also when I put new print cartridges in , I ca n't use the OK button so I have the message on the LCD to `` Align the cartridge '' . It does print nice pictures.Anyway , I have had several HP printers , they are usually great products . This is the worse printer I have ever had .
 Let me start out by saying , I am very tech-savvy . I 'm not trying to be cocky , but I know what I 'm talking about when it comes to computer stuff . This printer is horrible . I have had it for quite some time now . For the first few weeks it worked great and I thought I got myself a good printer . Well , after the first couple of weeks , I think the glue that they used at the HP factory came undone . The paper NEVER feeds on its own any more , and every time I try to print it jams . The bottom loading feeder takes 50 sheets at a time instead of the one sheet i 'm trying to feed it , and then I 'm screwed . The ink is Horribly expensive -LRB- like all HP printers -RRB- and I end up wasting most of it because I have to reprint everything . do n't waste your time with this one . HP really messed up on this one . Another thing that made me mad was the normal printable margins . there is an inch along the bottom that it wont print on unless you click the borderless printing option , but then it prints slower . Its ridiculous . I can honestly say that I will do everything in my power to avoid using/buying another HP printer !
 Worst . Piece . Of . Equipment . EVER . Oh , how I wish I were exaggerating . After reading many other reviews stating the same problem I 've been having -LRB- paper jam , out of paper -RRB- I can now justify the purchase of a new printer but not before I take great pleasure in placing this one carefully under the front tire of my car , running over it again and again , then packing the thousands of pieces into a box and sending it to HP .
 Printer worked well for about 2 months with light duty printing . Now get constant `` Out of Paper '' errors even though the papertray is full . I 've done everything suggested-cleaning roller , etc. . After cleaning roller the printer will feed paper for about 5 sheets and then fail again . HP support site says contact them for free cleaning kit . When I contacted then on Online Help site , after a bit of useless troubleshooting , I was told that the printer was out of warranty and cleaning kit would cost $ 39 . I estimate that I printed less than 100 pages of text with this pinter . Since I screwed up and bought extra print cartridges , my cost per page is probably around $ 2 per sheet . If you own this printer and are planning on upgrading to Vista-beware . There is a good chance the HP Solution Center will have problems .
 It does nice job of printing after you fight to get it to pick up paper , or it jams . Did the call HP right after buying it and they were really no help , clean rollors or some other thing you should not do with a new printer . bought there best brand of HP paper , that did not help.So I give up and will call this a total waste of money and am looking to buy a different printer , also This is just me but trying to get the drivers installed was a big pain .
 undoubtedly the worst piece of equipment i have ever owned . literally threw it into the street less then twenty minutes ago . the only enjoyable experience was heaving it fifteen feet into the air and watching it splatter in the driveway.paper jams , ink problems and general misery all around.would give this a negative 5 stars if i could .
 I tried online ` live ` support and asked for the kit to fix the `` out of paper '' problem , but they put me through a bunch of questions about it that took so long that I ran out of time . It does not seem to be as simple as contacting them and having them send out a kit .
 New 2575 Christmas 2005 . HP rep in CompUSA approached me when I was in to get a Lexmark cartridge for my old printer . Short sales pitch later I walked out with a new HP 2575 . It printed only 160 sheets before paper feed failed . HP sent a replacement under warranty . The replacement printed 262 sheets before the same problem emerged . Never abused or jammed . Used only HP paper . Stay away from this one . Read the other emails . Clearly a design defect . Sure wish I had n't tossed that Lexmark out .
 Great photos if you can get the paper to load . Paper jam after paper jam . Scanned images below average quality . Copies below average quality . Buyer beware !
 Every time I print ... OUT OF PAPER !! PAPER JAM !! OUT OF PAPER !!! PAPER JAM !!! SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECH.this is the sorriest piece of junk i have ever had the misfortune to purchase . i will never buy an HP printer ever again .
 This is the 2nd HP printer I 've owned . The first one worked like a dream -LRB- another all-in-one but w/fax -RRB- , so I bought this one with a package at Best Buy when they would n't let me bundle my new PC with an all-in-one printer that included fax -LRB- why not ? costs more - if only they had ... -RRB- . Worked fine for about 2 months , well past return period.Now , paper jams and `` out of paper '' EVERY SINGLE TIME I PRINT , and using same paper I always have for years , with this printer and my old HP . It is not worth taking the chance that you will be one of the lucky ones that have reviewed on here that do n't have this problem -LRB- more than likely , they just reviewed before this paper feed problems starts - give it a month or two ! -RRB- . If you like hand-feeding each sheet of paper in your printer , you 'll love the HP 2575 . If you like to print and forget about it , or have large print jobs DO N'T BUY THIS PRINTER . The only bright side so far is that I get lots of exercise getting up from my PC and walking over to my printer , sometimes more than once per page , to coax the paper in . Oh , I ca n't get it to scan , either - despite uninstalling and reinstalling software.It 's got a lot of potential , especially in the beginning -LRB- print looks great , once it finally does -RRB- , but lacks the staying power to get the job done in the end . Save yourself the headache and get another printer - or do n't say you have n't been warned .
 I was very disappointed with the images produced by this camera . I had hoped the ultra-wide photos -LRB- which was my main reason for going with this camera -RRB- also would be ultra sharp , but instead they tended to be soft . The camera has a lag time of about 1/10th of a second , so it 's more of a point , shoot and wait camera.The V705 may be okay for posting internet images or enlarging to small prints , but do n't expect the sharpness typical of better quality cameras . In my opinion , the camera squeezes too much out of a JPEG photo by way of compression and shooting TIF files just is n't practical.I demand better image quality from my cameras and , when zooming in , I like to see detail . I certainly do n't like everything going soft .
 This camera can do an awful lot . Like stitch several pictures together to make one long panorama picture . Great . It has a 5x optical zoom AND a wide angle . Great . It 's got a huge and pretty decent LCD screen . Great.However , it 's basic photography skills are lousy :1 . -RRB- It 's got NO VIEWFINDER . Taking pictures in bright daylight is made difficult , as you HAVE to use the screen to frame your shot .2 . -RRB- Pictures are noisy . No qualifiers here , even in perfect sunlight , there 's a lot of digital noise in the shots , even in the midtones . More than I have seen in any other digital camera .3 . -RRB- The autofocus is terrible . Even after it came back from Kodak , who fixed it under warranty , pictures are still frequently out-of-focus blurry , and that is when we 're talking still objects at moderate distances .4 . -RRB- There 's way too much contrast in the photos , most of them have some areas overexposed -LRB- white , all detail lost -RRB- and other areas underexposed -LRB- black , all detail lost -RRB- . I 'm off to find a compact camera that can do 1-4 , and I 'll do the rest on the computer ...
 As a realtor , I was very excited about this camera for wide angle interior shots at a low price in a very compact package . Unfortunately , the picture quality is very dissapointing . The images are barely adequate for web posting and brochure printing . Pictures are very soft and seem out of focus . I 'll keep using it until I can find a better alternative without dropping over a grand on a digital SLR with a wide angle lense . If anyone know of a better quality , compact wide angle - please let me know !
 I love everything about this camera BUT ... The display is very touchy . I only owned the camera for 2 months and my display broke . I had it in a case and must have bumped it just right . My display shattered . Mind you there is not a view finder so you can only guess what you are taking pictures of . This is NOT covered under your warranty . My camer has been in the repair shop for 3 weeks now and since the camera is so new there is no parts available yet . So I am sitting here with no camera , which is really bothersome since I Love taking pictures . I figured I would spend more for a nice quality camera and have no worries but who knew this would happen ! So I highly recommend this camera but you MUST be VERY VERY careful with it !
 We bought this camera thinking that it would be our do-all `` EuroCam '' for an upcoming trip to Europe . It promised a sufficient range of performance and features to easily meet our needs on such a trip.Sadly , the camera is not up to filling this role . We will need to take another camera along with it . However , we will take the V705 for its wide-angle lens , the reason that we picked this model in the first place . It is this disparity between the advertised and actual capabilities of the camera which prompts me to contribute this review.The need for a true wide-angle lens is both a sufficient and a necessary condition for buying this camera . If you do not need a 23mm lens , or if you do not know if you need a 23mm lens , then you do not need this otherwise mediocre P&S ; -LRB- Point and Shoot -RRB- camera.Good
 I have many digital cameras , thought I would try the V705.The anti blur technology does not work very good , if at all.Doesnt support high speed SD cards.Uses Hi Compression , no way to change it = low quality Pictures.Quick Time Video is not a good mode , I would like AVISCN Custom mode is a joke.I talked to Kodak about these things and they are sorry.I will stick with a Winner , hp R817 .
 While the memorex CD player did impress me with it 's ability to read through scratches in the CD , it had absolutely no anti-skip protection . Simply riding in a car sets it off at least once a minute . I would definitly recommend spending another $ 10 or $ 15 dollars to get a product with anti-skip protection !
 I bought this figuring I got a good deal on a CD player , turns out I just wasted my money . The headphones were horrible , they had a lot of static . And the player itself , well it had to be on a completely flat surface . In a car is not a good place to listen to it . It skips often , and it broke only after a month of purchase .
 I , too , purchased this CD player for my 8 year old daughter . I am really impressed with the sound quality for the price . If you plan to leave this player stationary -LRB- on a desk , etc. -RRB- , I think you will be more then pleased . Also , it 's an excellent gift for a young child , who does n't need a top-of-the-line player . The price is VERY reasonable , and the unit is straightforward and easy to use .
 I bought this product in April . Worked until July . Without reason , display will not respond . I called the manufacture and they said they will not fix after 90 days . Should n't a brand new cd player work for atleast a year before something internal breaks . I guess Memorex does n't think so . For $ -LSB- money -RSB- they said they would look at it . I told them I do n't think it 's a good idea to send good money after bad . I 'll buy a different brand name instead .
 I had this piece of junk for 3 months . When I put in a CD , static was audible in the background . At first , I thought it was the CD . Then I put it in my Aiwa stereo system and the sound was flawless . The radio reception was even worse . You have to turn the thing around in circles to hear anything but static . This so-called machine may be cheap , but I would n't want it if it was free !
 While I expected the CD to occasionally skip , I was disappointed in how low the volume was.I had a Sony Discman and the volume was low on that , but with this player it 's ridiculous .
 If you want a cd player better spend a few extra bucks on a major namebrand product . I received this cd player yesterday and I 'm returning it today . How bad could it be ? Man , this is really a cheap and inferior product . The cd would skip frequently the track it was playing ; there is a lot of static in the sound ; it has low volume ; and it has the cheapest construction in the world . You got ta be extremely careful when inserting a cd . The arm where the cd holder sits -LRB- i believe the lens runs along this part -RRB- will considerably move downwards to the slightest force . I agree with Bruce from NY . I do n't want this cd player even for free . After returning this product I purchased a Sony cd player . Sure it was more expensive , but is working fine . Believe me , you 'll regret purchasing this Memorex MD3020 cd player .
 This product seems to work whenever it feels like it . Loses connection often and is really slow . I had trouble updating my Tivo with this . Ended up just connecting it to the internet directly . Although that meant having the TV at a different location than I wanted , it just was n't worth the hassle .
 I tried getting this adapter to work on my own for a month and half . Every once in awhile it would work . But , very rarely . Unfortunately , there are very few settings you can access in TIVO to troubleshoot any problems . It would also fail at different steps so I think I received every error message TIVO has . I finally called TIVO support . The only thing they knew to try was turn the TIVO on and off -LRB- like I had not tried that a 100 times already -RRB- . They did say they were aware of alot of customers getting N17 error and they had not been able to fix on their end . They said since it had been more than 30 days since I received the device , I would need to buy another one and they suggested not buying a TIVO adapter this time.On a positive note , I called and explained to Amazon that I could not get the thing to work . Since it was a gift , they were having trouble finding the original order . But , stayed at it until they did . They then said they would send me another unit . THANKS Amazon ! Hopefully , this one works better .
 I bought this wireless adapter for my TiVo Series 2 DVR , planning to eliminate the phone line I used to connect to the service and allow enhanced TiVo functions . Unfortunately , it never worked . I followed the instructions carefully . The power was on based on the light on the adapter , but the thing never recognized my wireless network . My apartment complex has many wireless networks . It could not even recognize one of the many I can see in my wifi selection list . This was not a matter of the password being needed . It simply did not recognize the presence of a wireless network.I checked the connection to the USB port , and followed all the troubleshooting suggestions on the DVR screen as well as the TiVo website.I wasted 2 hours on the phone with a TiVo tech support guy . He wanted me to open ALL the ports of my router and a few other things . I have an Apple AirPort networs and a Lynksys network as well . The tech support people at both manufacturers had no idea.I finally gave up . I connected my TiVo directly to the internet with an ethernet connector . Since I have only one internet modem and , hence use only one wireless router , I have to manually connect the TiVo every couple of days and let it download the programming data . Then I reconnect the ethernet cable to my wireless router so I can have internet connection available for my computers.If the TiVo USB wireless adapter worked , I could have constant internet connectivity to my TiVo , making it a much better DVR.As it is , I have TiVo which I love , without the many enhanced functions I wanted . And I wasted about $ 30 and many hours of frustration .
 Our wireless router is upstairs on one end of the house , and the TiVo is downstairs on the opposite end of the house . Even so , when using laptops while watching television , the internal WiFi cards manage to get a `` Fair '' to `` Good '' signal . Even my 5 year old iPAQ gets a workable signal at that location.But , the TiVo AG0100 Wireless G adapter could manage a `` Poor '' connection at best . It could work , sort of , but only intermittently.Faced with either using a repeater or wiring the TiVo directly with CAT5 , I chose the latter . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 I received this as a gift . My receiver is a `` Hughes DirecTV '' box and those boxes can not be connected to a LAN . DirecTV is obsessed with DRM protection and even though it 's perfectly legal to use on a private LAN , they will block that use on any of their boxes . My wife bought the USB adapter from `` Electronics expo . '' When I called them and requested a return , they refused because I had taken it out of the plastic blister package . I would stay away from DirecTV hardware and Electronics expo .
 the set-up requirement for the Tivo wireless connector to my Apple wireless network would require me to change the setup of all the other components on my network . When Tivo worked on the network , my printer did n't . It was less of a hassle to get an ethernet cable and plug it in .
 Could n't get the device to work with my network so it just sits there useless.Vendor exceeded delivery expectations !
 I spent an entire afternoon trying to get this piece of junk to talk to my wireless network . Went through the steps a bazillion times . It found my network and could not get an IP address -LRB- after WEP key entered -RRB- . Customer service were on the phone with me for hours and I think it safe to say we tried everything . Their final suggestion was call your ISP -LRB- Comcast -RRB- who were unable to help.So - I bought a new Tivo specifically to use on my network so I could broadcast my MP3 collection through my AV system and cant . Add to the fact thatthe new Tivo is giving problems switching channels and you can see what a giant step backwards I took - If I could give this zero stars I would !
 I bought this product only to find out it is incompatible with my DirecTV DVR with Tivo service . If this had only been clearly indicated like it was on the box , I would n't have bought it .
 Difficult to rate . Product came with no help at all as to installation and/or creation of a system that would allow the rental of the movies . Neither TIVO nor Amazon has been helpful in solving my problem and the system , therefore , does not work . Can not rate very well .
 We purchased the HD Tivo DVR , which requires only this adapter to get the internet wirelessly . It sits next to my PS3 , yet gets worse reception than it , and even my iPod 's reception , only 2 rooms away from the wireless modem . Watching HD movies streaming from Netflix is nearly impossible , it pauses about every 3-4 minutes for about 7-10 seconds , completely losing you from the storyline of the movie . In order to come up with a different solution for better reception , we may have to scrap the antenna all together , wasting the $ 40 we just spent on it .
 The unit was very easy to install and was added to my home network with no problems . The ease of use is very good for this unit . I did n't have alot of options available since many wireless adapters were not compatible with my Tivo 2 dual tuner system . I am not using the standard encryption system for my network and am using WPA encrytion for my homenetwork . Tivo 's usb adapter is the only one compatible.The signal is very weak whereas my other components in the same location using a wireless adapter read well into the 90-100 % range.The tivo wireless was about 60-65 % . Overall i am satisfied with the unit as there are no other good options at this time .
 We 've connected two TiVos -LRB- one TiVo HD and one TiVo Premiere -RRB- to our wireless network using these adapters and the performance has been lackluster at best . While it 's perfectly fine for retrieving guide data and talking with the TiVo mother ship , most any other connections it can make falter at times . This is n't an issue with actual signal strength connection with a wireless network , per se , but with actual bandwidth and throughput.The `` Wireless G '' protocol is capable of 54Mbps , which is more bandwidth than most people have coming into their home via their ISP . That said , I do n't see how this wireless adapter moves anywhere near that much.When using Netflix , transferring videos between boxes , or downloading content from Music Choice , the data speeds are remarkably SLOW . I do n't have raw numbers , but I can tell you that transferring a 1-hour HD program between TiVos takes more than 1 hour -- and that 's between two boxes that both register very good signal strength with the wireless router ! Netflix movies regularly have to rebuffer while using this adapter . -LRB- Please note that we have several other devices in our house that have no problem holding onto a Netflix stream via our 6Mbps DSL connection . -RRB- The problems stated above were all generally relieved when we recently changed our TiVo Premiere 's connection to a wired one , though box-to-box transfers are still bottlenecked by the TiVo HD 's wireless adapter.If you buy this adapter , realize that you will NOT get anywhere close to 54Mbps . If Netflix , copying videos between boxes , etc. is important to you , try a wired connection , Powerline adapters or TiVo 's Wireless N adapterTiVo AN0100 Wireless N Network Adapter -LRB- Gray -RRB- .
 TIVO G USB Network adapter can not detected by the TIVO Series2 or the Premiere , even though it was advertised that it will work with the TIVOs . I have a Linksys WRT54G Router . In my case , only TIVO N USB Network adapter can be detected by the TIVO premiere.The horror story began like this . My TIVO Series2 often failed to download programs via the slow phone modem . 12/4/2010 I called TIVO service . They told me to buy the TIVO premiere , but they did not tell me that I needed an adapter . During the call I bought the Premiere only . After the call and studying the web info , I decided to buy this G adapter from Amazon . It was easy to connect , but could not be detected by TIVOs . I called TIVO service and they told me to buy another G adapter from Best Buy , since I might have gotten a bad G adapter from Amazon . Again it was not detected . I had to return the second one to Best Buy . More time and energy wasted and plus frustration . All of the above took 3 weeks to find out . I do n't understand why they insisted that I should get another G adapter . Also I found that bad history repeating here , see -LSB- ... -RSB- Finally 1/6/2011 TIVO people sent me the N adapter . I connected the N adapter to the ethernet in my PC . In a web browser address bar , type 192.168.10.1 and press enter . After this setup , I connected the N adapter to the Premiere and it finally was detected . After more phone calls , now I can download programs wirelessly to the TIVO premiere .
 Works as stated ... but I really do not like that I can not just use my own G or N wireless adapter to do the same job . I mean really ! Does your adapter work that much better ? Probably not , its a racket to make us have to buy another tivo product and help Tivo 's bottom line and not the consumers .
 Does n't work even though we have a N router . Wish I 'd tried the cheaper off brand .
 I wo n't go into an elaborate diatribe on just how terrible this product is . To sum it up , it 's useless and was not market-ready . TiVo customer service and support is abominable , and the `` help '' they supply for this product is laughable . My son has been a network systems engineer for over 10 years , he had to come and try and get it to work . After a bit of fussing with it , the adapter was getting poor reception . The wireless router and modem are barely 30 feet from the TiVo box , with open space throughout . My laptop easily achieves 12Mbps without a hitch.For a goof , we moved the wireless router and modem to the kitchen table , and hooked it up to the laptop . Only then were we able to get a decent signal , with the wireless router about 8 feet from the TiVo box and network adapter . Several calls to TiVo got me canned , simple fixes to try . It works best when you throw it in the trash .
 This item will not work with Tivo Basic -LRB- the Tivo service included on some Pioneer and Toshiba boxes -RRB- . We bought a Pioneer 810H several years ago that included Tivo . This is Tivo Basic and this item requires Tivo Plus . You do not have a Media Access Key if you have Tivo Basic , which is required to get this to work . Unfortunately , Tivo Plus is an upgrade to Basic , so it costs extra . Since we already paid a lot for the box -LRB- equal to a lifetime membership -RRB- , we did n't want to do that again and sent it back , so I ca n't really attest to its functionality or ease of use -LRB- although it was a huge pain to figure out why we did n't have a MAK ... that took some serious googling since they do n't make our box anymore -RRB- .
 I have 4 Tivo 's in the house and each uses a different type of WiFi adaptor . I bought the Tivo AG0100 to connect my Series 2 to my Linksys Router in 2007 to replace a Linksys adaptor to get better speed . Never got the faster speed but it worked fine for 2 1/2 years and died suddenly . I giving two stars because it did not last very long . The other WiFi adaptors -LRB- Linksys and Microsoft -RRB- are still working and they are older . I do want to note that the Tivo WiFi adaptor runs hot , while the others are not even warm .
 So many people have given this adapter 5 star reviews that I was expecting great things . It did n't happen . This Wireless G adapter gives less signal strength and NO speed improvement over an old $ 10 Wireless B adapter I 'd been using . And yes , I upgraded to Wireless G from my `` send '' unit , and yes , I 've got a Tivo with USB 2.0 which should allow faster transfer speeds.In trying to transmit about 35 feet , all on the same floor , through a couple of walls , the best signal strength I can get is about 30 % , compared to 45 % on an older Dlink adapter . In testing downloads to a Mac , which is really the only reason I wanted a speed boost , there was no improvement at all.I stand in the minority , but I 'll just say that the adapter I received is overpriced and underpowered . It 's going back .
 I have two older Series 2 Tivos . I had bought these units in order to allow TV show transfers between the two units over the wireless network . Unfortunately , the two units wo n't do this - the explanation I have gotten is that the units take too long to get the info from each other and they `` time out '' and that Tivo is hoping to work out some software patches -LRB- according to Tivo discussion boards -RRB- . Have also noticed that my older Tivos run sluggish with these wireless units which the website also shows to be a common problem . When you switch channels it takes about 10 seconds of the image looking delayed and sluggish before it plays properly . However , in regards to connecting with Tivo for updating programming information it is much faster than dial up . Set up was also a pain in the neck as it did not work right out of the box for me as other posters have said . There was a lot of trial and error before I was able to get each unit to actually connect to the network . Instructions and Tivo customer support webpage could be improved . So if you have an older Tivo which is getting its programming over a phone line without problems , I would not suggest wasting time with this product . Tivo worked better before I bought these things . I 'm just hoping Tivo creates a patch to where I get to see the full benefits of this product .
 I got one of these set up with 4 1TB disk in raid 5 giving me a total og 2.7 TB datastorage . But it is very unstable especialy when handling large or many files +100 MB . The connection is lost and copying has to be restarted.Also streaming runs very slow.When using the build in PnP the mashine hangs and has to be restartet.It is sad as the specs are great .
 The kit I received is not the one in the picture , it says it should fit a 99 civic , but does not even come close . The instructions are EXTREMELY vague and do not provide any clarity at all as to what brackets to remove or use . IT DOES N'T EVEN FIT !!! I attempted to contact customer service and i got what sounded like a crappy home answering machine . Now I have a disassembled car with no radio and no way to mount it . I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN ! Do yourself a favor and find another mounting kit if you have a 99 civic , this is not a mounting kit for a 99 civic . Such a scam .
 Dies after Nano battery is about 75 % of full charge . Excellent sound quality when it works .
 I opened the box , took them out and immediately ran into problems
 After spending a significant amount of time trying to remove the U3 software that comes on this drive -LRB- I wanted to remove it because I do n't use windows , and yet the removal software only works for windows -RRB- the connection between the actual USB plug and the body of the device gradually weakened -LRB- so that to get the device to read I had to wiggle it -RRB- until the it became useless . I would recommend Kingston over this , as I 've never heard of any durability problems with those , and with these you risking getting a lemon .
 I bought two of these drives at the same time . The one is still going strong , but the other crashed , never to be revived , about six months from purchase . I returned it under warranty and SanDisk sent a replacement . It 's not my drive fixed and , of course any information I had on the drive is gone . Okay , I could deal with that , but now that drive has also crashed and burned . There 's no reviving , formatting or recovering my information ... again . This time I trashed the drive ; I 'd kept good back-ups of all the information , I 'm only out my original purchase price and postage to return it the first time . This is my last SanDisk purchase ... fool me once , but not twice .
 My flash drive stopped working after I plugged it on a Windows Vista machine . After that , I could n't even format it . I had to install and uninstall U3 three times to -LRB- luckly ! -RRB- revive it . This drive now is in probation mode until I can trust on it again to keep important data.Just google `` u3 cruzer format problem '' and you 'll understand the problem .
 After using this flash drive for multiple types of files I am very very disappointed . At first my only concern was that the USB felt sloppy . But now I ca n't get this thing to hold any information on my spreadsheets that I use on a daily basis . No matter what I do , I properly eject the device only when I get the message that it is safe . Then I will plug it in again and make sure my spreadsheet is there . Then eject the device again . But when I restart the computer and insert the cruzer my spreadsheets are all kaddywampus with just a portion of the information . It works fine for my word documents and photos , but not spreadsheets . I now purchased a kingston flash drive and pray it works better .
 Sony made a big marketing mistake with this unit . It does not support voice commands , voice tags , voice dialing , or any handsfree calling at all , regardless of what capabilities your phone has . The ONLY handsfree call you can make from the unit is last number redial . All other calls must be placed from the phone as usual , then you must use call transfer to route to the bluetooth unit . This does n't meet the legal requirements in the states or countries for which it was designed and marketed . It 's a big disappointment , and a big waste of money .
 I seem to be having the same problem as everyone else . I bought this DSL modem mostly to get UPNP support for my Nintendo Wii . Worked great for the first 6 months , but I noticed lately it ca n't connect to the DSL provider or when it does everything crawls and eventually it looses sync . Sadly , I had to replace it with my old DSL modem -LRB- SpeedStream -RRB- which works perfectly -LRB- so I know its not my phone lines or other problems -RRB- . Also , I noticed the Zoom DSL modem heats up pretty bad , wondering if theres a connection between that and its failure rate.I would definitely find another DSL modem , especially after reading all the other posts regarding the poor reliability issues .
 Excellent looking and functioning modem -LRB- only for a while -RRB- . I really enjoyed the freedom it offered for 6 months , then persistant connection problems began . It was a perfect unit for me , for me and my wife and the third computer along with our PDA would connect to the internet flawlesly along with our network printer but something happened 6 months after the purchase , the modem stops connecting to the internet and the control panel could only be accessed via hard wire when this happens . When the modem is connected by a network cable to one unit the system starts to work fine again . But this is becoming frustrating as carrying the laptop from one room to another to hookup to the modem in order to correct the connection problem and get back to the living room is a hassle . I can handle this but wife can not . This could have been the ultimate wireless solution for only if it functioned like it used to for 6 months.Although the technical service is very customer friendy they could not manage to find a permanent solution to the problem which is mentioned by many users on the internet , I still like to modem -LRB- partially due to the 110 USD I have paid for it -RRB- , but unfortunatly I would not recommend it due to this commonly occurring problem . -LRB- I gave one extra star due to the efford and friendlyness ZOOM has put in to this unit -RRB-
 Horrible horrible horrible ! I get booted from it every few minutes and then I get `` No response from wireless router or access point '' And it takes me an hour to get back on , just to be on for 5 minutes , then I have to start all over again . I can get 2 bars or signal from it while my laptop is sitting right beside it , yet my neighbors router is shown at full signal so I know it is n't my computer . This is so bad , I 'd rather go back to dial up !
 Will never know if this works well or not . Needed help with set up and Zoom customer service was non-responsive . Asked repeatedly during frustrating email exchange for access to telephone support . Was stonewalled . Finally , gave up , bought a competing product which installed flawlessly . Put Zoom product on Craigslist and took my loss .
 The idea of a Modem and Router is great . I was sold on the idea in which you only need one device to do both . The unit has a wealth of feature , but truely lacking in other.Security-wise it has more then you will ever need for a home setup . Simple to configure and very small footprint are added bonus.The area I find this unit to lack in or perform poorly is the WiFi area . The unit was setup about 25 ' from my computer and the average signal strength I got was low to fair and on some occassion good -LRB- rare -RRB- . Granted there is a wall inbetween the two device . However , I notice signal drops significantly when I 'm in the 30 ' -50 ' range low to fair at best and at times signal completely drops . The part I do not understand is why we are not allowed to change the antenna on this unit.For those who are considering this unit , evaluate your location first before dropping money on this unit . If you plan to have your computer right next to the unit . This is an excellent product . However , if you plan to use the WiFi function as it was intended , might want to look elsewhere . As for me I 'm returning the unit and getting a Dlink or Linksys.Happy Shopping
 It did not pick up the DSL signal from my AT&T High-speed Internet service . I had to return it and get a 2Wire , which AT&T officially supports and which works without any problems .
 After a certain time the modem begins to loose the conection to Internet every now and then , the only solution is to constantly turn it on and off.No lightning have fallen near my house , nor any other extraordinary event have happened.I have looked for help from zoom , internet forums and my ISP company and all of them agreed that it is a hardware problem , apparently a common one if you buy an X6 zoom modem/router . The only definite solution
 Works well when the modem initially connects to the provider CO. . Wireless seems to work well . NAT functionality seems good . However , within minutes to hours , the connection to the CO slows to a virtual stand still . Cycling the power makes the problem go away for a while , if you can put up with doing that every few hours . Firmware upgrades so far have contained empty and unrealized hopes of fixing this problem . You may feel like you 've been taken advantage of by the manufacture if you buy this modem after reading on the box how wonderful the product is .
 I bought this unit to replace a unit sold to me by the phone company . It was to be `` combatable '' to DSL Verizon . Not so said the phone company . You have to by from us , they said . I battled this unit for a month . It changed my IP so many times and would lock up . Customer service from Zoom was as bad as Verizon . One would say , `` Its the phone company 's problem '' , then the phone company would say , `` Its the modem company 's problem '' . I was given a modem from a friend that had a wireless modem from a different phone system . It works great . Buyer beware . It does not work as advertised .
 I 'm using a Mac and a PC with this product . From the start , I could not get it to set-up like the directions instructed . I had to bring it to my local Res-Net office on campus for them to set-up . The big complaint I have with this router is the connection with the computer needs to be reset nearly every day for me , sometimes three times a day -LRB- PC and Mac -RRB- . Depending on how heavy my internet usage is .
 I 've had this item for 3 months , the support people do n't know how to handle wireless connections , they keep referring you to the manual ... and give you no directions ... The unit itself is n't compatible with verzion . . this unit continously goes off the net , and must the software must be reloaded , or Verizon called to reset the signal to your home . .
 The X6 modem , when it works , is a great little modem that does everything that I need . But it will work for a period of time , and then disconnect itself from the internet . I 've flashed it to the latest version of firmware , but the problem is still there.So if you are shopping for an ADSL modem , I would suggest that you to keep on looking .
 I can not believe I paid so much for a camcorder that has such a JUNKIE battery charger built in . If it gets bumped even slightly , or has too much pressure on the cord just laying there , it comes out . You pick up a camera thinking it is charged , and find out it is NOT !! Bought before going on vacation , & called the store upon my return to complain . They said , `` That is just Sony 's way of making you buy a separate charger . '' After several months of hassles , I notified Sony about my dissatisfaction with this , & their customer service rep sent me a smart-alec reply by e-mail . Wo n't buy another Sony product if that is how they take care of customers . Sandy
 The USB software bundled by Sony for transferring images to computer COMPLETELY -LSB- MESSED -RSB- UP MY SYSTEM . The installation is very dicey . You need to do things in a precise order . It is prone to getting -LSB- messed -RSB- up , ... it ca n't be fixed . As usual , the Sony software is a mess.Their instructions for unscrambling the mess do n't work . They just get you deeper into the woods.Be sure to get the extended warranty if you buy this product . You will probably need it . As for the computer , it may require a complete disk wipe and reinstallation . God help you if you have RAID or something else . WHAT A MESS . Sony is big enough that they do n't care . They do n't have to .
 I have had the TV for two weeks . The picture quality is very inconsistent . It ranges from completely fantastic to unwatchable . For me , the most annoying problem is that the TV over processes images to create lot of artifacts . Human skin can look very unnatural and pixelated.I do n't know if I got a poor sample or it is endemic to Samsung TVs . Some posters on avsforum have reported the same problem.Buy at a local store so you can return it , there is a good chance that you might not like it .
 This order was part of a major scam . I never received it and the `` seller '' emailed me to send him cash to a particular account so that he could ship the item . I blew up his email and contacted amazon to wipe the order . No money exchanged . Surprised this item showed up -LRB- 6 years later -RRB- as an item I had purchased . Learned to be careful of the too good to be true offers on Amazon .
 I had this tv for a few months now . Like someone said before picture quality is very inconsistant . It seems the longer I watch it the worse picture quality gets . Especially skin tones look very unnatural . No matter whether its HD or standard programming or DVD . I tried adjusting the picture with AVIA DVD , only marginal difference . It seems that DNIe is the reason behind bad pq however there is no way of turning it off . I even contactes samsung about this , no luck . This is a well known problem with samsung plasmas and yet they refuse to fix it . Stay away from this piece of junk .
 If you look at the specs , this tv does not support the full HD standard . All current generation plasma screens do not support 720p or 1080i . They upsample 720p and downgrade 1080i . I have a 1080i capable tv and can tell you that losing 300 lines of resolution is a big deal . Its about the same difference as 720 to normal broadcast tv .

 EDIT - A common response to the following review might be , `` How can he be so critical ... it 's just a table radio !? '' That much is true . However , Bose claimed for this model -LRB- and still does -RRB- that it rivals systems costing three times as much . The commercials intimated -LRB- and still do -RRB- that this was the end-all , sleek audio solution that takes up virtually no space compared to traditional components . Therefore , this review is naturally more critical than of a standard alarm clock : ---------------------- I inherited the Wave Radio from my dad after he no longer found a use for it . My opinion is based upon my experience with it in a bedroom setting . In other words , you 'll be disappointed if you 're seeking to replace a dedicated home stereo with a tabletop unit , no matter how good it may or may not sound in smaller environments.The unit DOES provide much more sound than you would expect from a unit of it 's size . The drawback is that the bass that it does provide is very ` boomy ' -LRB- not tight , not equally applied to varying notes , all over the place , -RRB- and highs are very ` bright . ' A lot of people look for exactly these traits , and if you 're one of them , then by all means go for it . On the other hand , I prefer a more neutral -LRB- flat -RRB- response . This is how the music was recorded , and intended to sound . Your mileage will vary , and you may love the equivalent of having the bass and treble maxed right out of the box.Placing the unit in a corner exacerbates this effect GREATLY . Ideally , you 'll place this further from a wall for a more natural sound.Along with the mentioned ` coloring ' or ` signature Bose sound ' of this product comes a phenomenon worth mentioning
 I own and use the best radios on the market . I have and use the Tivoli Model One , Tivoli PAL , and Boston Acoustics Recepter among others , and all the ones I just listed sound much better than the Bose Wave Radio , PLUS they are much cheaper too!There is also one called a Cambridge model 88 that is better than the Bose Wave Radio as well.When you are comparing these radios side by side , the first one you turn off and throw aside is the Bose Wave Radio , it is that bad when compared to the rest.If you want a good sounding table radio , I would suggest the Tivoli Model One instead . If you want a good clock radio for the nightstand , then I would suggest the Boston Recepter . Both are available through Amazon.comI do n't work for any of these companies , but I have bought all of the radios exept for the Bose Wave Radio , I borrowed one for a day and had no interest in buying one . Even if it was cheaper , and smaller , but it sounded the same as it does now , I still would not buy it .
 Having just emerged from camcorder-purchasing hell , I will share my thoughts with my pals as Amazon . I may keep this one because it is a good compromise and has the best sound I 've found , but I may take it back . Here 's why
 Just purchased this little gem and went to insert the cassette . The instructions say `` The cassette compartment will automatically lift up and open when opening the lid . '' It Does n't . For $ 1,359 , I 'm back to Circuit City for a new one . If I have problems once more ... then I 'll try another brand .
 I bought the DA-LITE CLASS MATE CEILING MOUNTED PROJECTION SCREEN , BUT GET SCREEN FOR WALL MOUNTED ONLY . AND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO USE FOR CEILING MOUNTED SINCE IT CASE LESS .
 I 'm writing my review on the compact model wave radio/CD player because I could n't find the `` bigger '' one I bought , and I wanted to save people by being SNOOKERED BY THE HYPE , LIKE I WAS !! I paid $ 1200 for something that was FAR FROM SUPERB ! CD 's sounded about like they did on my inexpensive AIWA system , and I could n't get decent FM reception with the flimsy stick antenna that comes with the set ! And , it does n't have any front display , so you have to get up to see what 's what . It does have a credit card size remote that I 'm afraid to put down because it 's so easy to lose ! If I could do it over again , I would take that $ 1200 and shop for some really excellent compact componants ! Oh , and did I mention that it was so poorly packed at the factory that it arrived with the CD lid sprung open ! When I called the company to complain , they could n't have cared less ! I should have just put it back in the box and returned it ! I ca n't imagine the littler version of the CD/Wave radio is any better quality ! All I can say is BEWARE !!
 The product itself is great , but it came in a plain brown box that did n't even fit the telescope and with part of it sticking out of the box . There were no instructions and no star chart . After 3 months of dealing with this company and filing a complaint with Amazon I am still having trouble with them . I will be reporting them to the Better Business Bureau and today will file another complaint with Amazon . I would never order from this company again .
 Discovery Kid 's products are designed to `` look cool '' in the box but they are cheap plastic junk . They break . What 's worse is the manual states that they are warranted by Discovery Store Inc. but if you do not buy direct from Discovery Store , they will NOT HONOR THE WARRANTY !!! So what happens ? You buy your kid a cool toy . They use it for a few weeks . Then it breaks . You have crying kids . You call Discovery . You do n't have an order number , they tell you to get lost.Don ' t buy this junk . It is guaranteed to break . Shop around and find something that is hobby quality or just select a different gift for you kid .
 First off , the monitor is absolutely stunning.On the more substantial , i bought the item in August and by September , I was getting the `` Blue Screen of Death '' on a regular basis . Technical Support was not much help . Of course , I realized this was more than just the new computer adjusting and by the time i brought it back to the store i bought it from , the 30 days ran out , so i had to ship my machine back to Sony.They fixed it fine and in less than 10 days , but 30 days later , I was beginning to have spotty network issues and the cd/dvd drive died completely . After many hours on the phone with tech support , i am once again without my very expensive laptop for the second time in the five months since ive owned it.When it works it is fine , but i would not recommend this computer because it has too many problems -LRB- i have since discovered many of the unhappy sony vaio owners -RRB- and you can get a decent computer for several hundred dollars less.if they offered me a refund , or to buy me a lower end version of a Mac or even a Dell , i would take it in a minute .
 I originally bought this for several reasons , and admittedly i was seduced by the screen and the relative style compared with other laptops available at the time.Several thousand reboots later , and after spending many many hours trying to make sony 's proprietary pre-loaded crapware play nice or get off , I have given up . This computer crashes all the time , does not play nice with Firefox , iTunes , or several security suites . Even after hours online and on the phone with tech support , no good - the beautiful screen is not worth it if all you see are error messages and reboot screens . It runs * extremely hot * the fan operates all the time , it is noisy , the battery stopped taking a charge worthy of unplugging it about 6 months after I purchased it -LRB- even with careful management to try to extend the battery life -RRB- . I would take my old dell P2 back in a heartbeat in trade for this thing . Because of my experience with this heap , I will never buy another Sony product again .
 Bad Computer ... BLUE SCREEN MANIA . `` BREATHES HEAVY '' ... OVERALL.BAD COMPUTER ... DONT DO IT TO YOUR SELF .
 I built a new computer and I used this as my tower , if you want to know the pros well read all the 5 star reviews previously posted and you will see them listed very clearly there . Now for the life in me I could not figure out how to slide the top lid back into place . I studied the slot mechanism that is suppose to fall in place once pressure is applied but the fact is that I could not get enough pressure to slide the lid back in place without bending the metal . I built the whole computer in 2 hours and spent an hour trying to close the top lid . I gave up and decided to test my luck another day . If anyone knows the secret to closing the lid please leave a comment . As for my other complaint this box did not provide an adequate slot for placing a generic media card reader anywhere on it so that was a downside . Apart from that I had a little hard time adjusting my mother board to the power cable provided since they were different from one another and I ended up having to adapt the cable in order to make it work . Good luck to you guys with this great tower . It really is amazing ! now if it had only brought an extra 6mm fan with it.EDIT : I finally figured out how to fully close the top lid . It was bent in a spot , which I easily corrected . However the power button broke and the backside USB port along the front USB port all have broken in half after 2 years of little use .
 I owned many models of Mail Station & loved them from the years 1999-2006 but since then there are no ISP servicers for this gadget . It used to be owned by Earthlink whom was then bought out by Cidco and now there is n't anyone providing service to send/receive emails with this thing which is too bad since it was easy & fun and a way to communicate without the internet without spam or any advertizing . Whenever mailstation has a new provider -LRB- doubtful -RRB- I will purchase another 1 year contract as my gadget still functions it 's just that I can not connect without an ISP . Everyone whom owns this thing knows what I speak of ; it 's obsolete so why buy one ? -LRB- If you read the disclaimer below it states they wo n't supply service to new customers ; so what is the point in buying this ? -RRB-
 Buyer Beware
 Like the other reviewer , I began trying to make this thing work in December , for my grandmother . Since then it 's been one run-around after another . The first had a broken screen ; it took them weeks to send me a new one , then when I got that one and sent it to my grandmother , it did n't work . She spent all these hours on the phone with them trying to get it to work , and it would n't , so finally she sent it back to me . I tried to get a refund , and the Mailstation people would n't give it to me , because I was past the 30 day purchase limit . Terrible .
 My experience with Mailstation started over six months ago . Since then I have had less than two weeks of email service . Just a few of the problems have included a Mailstation arriving with a broken screen , six weeks of phone calls to finally prove the replacement did not , would not and never would work , a month waite for another replacement to find it was in shipping , two weeks later to find no record of replacement , etc , etc. . One technique is never being allowed to talk to the same person twice . `` I will call you on Monday to verify it is working . '' `` This will definitely fix the problem . '' `` Sorry , you can not talk to a supervisor . '' `` We will send you a refund in one month . '' `` The refund will be posted in two weeks . '' `` We have sent the refund to your credit card company but it will take them two or more months to post the refund . '' `` The problem is with your credit card company . We have sent them the refund . '' I do not think so.The Dilbert cartoon is Mailstation .
 This piece of junk was purchased for my mother last Christmas . It did nothing but frustrate her , the thought that counted was it was completely free , provided that a year of service was purchased . But enough about my cheap brother . It has the slowest modem I 've seen since the days of Commodore 64s and Vic-20 's . It can take up to ten minutes to retrieve eleven e-mails . Oh , the excitement of watching the little status bar . . receiving message -LRB- 7 % ,11 % -RRB- , just like watching paint dry !!! It seems as if the e-mail contained even the merest HTML , you got a message saying `` This message contains parts that can not be viewed on your device , please log on from a -LRB- real -RRB- computer at -LRB- webmail site -RRB- to view it in its entirety . '' And usually it was just somebody sending the letter in different colors or maybe even bold text . My mother questioned the steep -LRB- $ 9.95 -RRB- monthly fee for mere e-mail service . Last summer she complained fiercely she wanted to vote on the Star Search competition , how could she do it with that device ? I said , `` You ca n't , it 's not real Internet '' . Oh boy ! It has a calculator on it . So does the impulse item section waiting in the express lane at WallyWorld , just 99 . This device will frustrate even little old ladies , if for the mere fact alone you ca n't look up people 's e-mail addresses , you must give your address to somebody with a real computer or even a WebTv . In closing , when we told bro we were n't renewing it , he said it was a `` good deal '' and we should give it to somebody else . We do n't hate anybody enough to give them this thing and frustrate the heck out of them . It 's only a `` good deal '' because his wife set it up and he just looked at the box while waiting at red lights , driving it home . Just buy Ma a MsnTv receiver , at least she can look up where the Bingo parlors are .

 Like many Sharper Image products , this one is over-hyped , stylish , but under-achieving . It 's cute , especially if you are into the New Beetle fashion . -LRB- I am . -RRB- The CD tray is hidden in the bumper , and there are a total of five speakers
 I owned the alarm clock version , and as alarm clocks rarely have good sound quality , I was not too displeased with the product . It came with a remoted control with a snooze button , which was just decadent . However , when the CD played there was always a soft , high-pitched whistling sound which was just unbearable . This may have been an individual product defect.More troublesome is the idea of buying this to actually listen to music or the radio . Since the music comes out of the speakers on the side , it is difficult to find a good position for this little Bug , so that you can hear the sound well . Furthermore , the speakers simply are of terrible quality.I give the product 2 stars rather than 1 because let 's face it -- it is ADORABLE , and if you need a radio around your desk or someplace where it will mostly be for show , then go for this product ! The controls are intuitive to use -- very user friendly . Just do n't buy this product for real listening -- especially to music , where sound quality matters . This Beetle does not live up to Volkswagon 's quality , nor , for that matter , Sharper Image 's reputation .
 i just got back from the USPS where I had to return this PVR . I am a techno-geek girl and my husband owns the other `` leading brand '' player with a 4 inch wide screen but a bit less resolution . I was so wanting to like this Creative product because my friend owns the Vision
 I bought this from Amazon last week . It 's really a beautifully built device with one enormous flaw . The screen is a disaster . I ignored the advice of some previous reviewers who warned about the viewing angle issue with the screen . Boy were they right ! If you are buying this device primarily to view photos then steer elsewhere -LRB- see my recommendation below -RRB- . First this is a nicely designed device . It has such a solid feel , with a slim form factor , a tightly engineered , elegant interface and button set . It feels great in the hand . Creative 's engineers should be congratulated.Except for that screen.It 's simply unusable . Sure it 's big , and dense with pixels and color . On paper it seems incredible . But it 's not incredible to look at . Just as previous viewers said , at best when you view pictures you must hold this thing at an ridiculously restrictive angle , and with one eye closed or the image will distort and shimmer badly . Essentially incredibly narrow viewing angle and the binocular nature of human eyes will be enough to create shimmering with this frustrating screen . I showed it to my wife and she agrees.Video playback suffered a similar effect though not as dramatic.One other smaller issue was that you ca n't zoom photos so if you want to preview to look for blurring and such you ca n't use this device.What a shame . I really almost considered keeping it because it 's just such a nicely designed piece.Anyway I sent mine back and with some reluctance ordered the Epson P-2000 . The Epson arrived a few days ago . The screen is wonderful . Everything the Vision should have been . Clear , sharp and easily viewed from a much wider angle . No shimmering at all . Same size , same dimensions -LRB- 640x480 -RRB- but has a zoom feature that works very well.The Epson does n't have the same tight build and the device is a considerably bigger in size , with a slightly cheaper , plastic body . Slightly bigger hard drive . Also has an SD/MMC card slot in addition to the CF slot . Essentially the same functions as the Vision but no FM radio . I did n't buy the Vision for the radio.That said I 'm really happy with the way pictures appear on the Epson and will certainly keep it but still miss the build quality of the Vision .
 My wife bought this player for me as an anniversary present . The screen is dreamy and beautiful . Installing the software was a nightmare of 5 nights with tech support then Microsoft then back again ... I tried 3 different computers and finally got the player to be recognized . I transferred all my music over ... and wait ... what is this ? BACKGROUND NOISE ... A constant whirring sound was present on the quiet parts of almost all of my songs . I thought it was a copy protection thing but alas ... BACKGROUND NOISE . After another couple of nights of reinstalling everything , transferring music directly over from CD , and so on ... I still had the BACKGROUND NOISE . We went to ship it back to Creative ... and they charged us a 15 % restocking fee . To me , the player BACKGROUND NOISE is a deal breaker ... AND I SO WANTED IT TO WORK ... I reverted back to my NOMAD ZEN 40 GB player that sounds fine . I do n't know about you , but if you want to pay 400 bucks for music with a very noticable `` whirring '' sound in the background ... go for this player . Otherwise ... stay away .
 I bought this item for a trip to South Africa -LRB- from Virginia , USA -RRB- for two purposes . To alleviate the misery of the 24 hour plane rides there and back , and to use it as a photo storage device so that I did not have to worry about running out of room on my digital camera.On both accounts it failed miserably . And I have to say that it is a software issue that Creative still needs to work on.On the plane ride over , I was literaly listening to the second song on one of the CDs that I loaded into it , when the unit froze . I shut it down , started it up , and nothing but a `` safe mode '' sort of screen would load . I took the battery out , and let it be for an hour or so , and then it fired back up.Only to freeze once again , about an hour later . This time it took several hours to reload . Then it froze again . Solid , for the rest of the flight to South Africa . -LRB- And it is a LOOOONG Flight ! -RRB- Upon getting to S.A. I took the battery out for a whole day , and then charged it back up , and tried to start it again . Nothing but the `` Safe '' screen , and no options but to Reboot -LRB- which did nothing -RRB- or reload the operating system , which I could not do because I had specifically bought this item so that I did not have to bring my laptop with me on this trip.So the upshot was that I did not have the ability to store pictures on the unit , nor did I have the ability to use it as an MP3 player , for the flight over , or the flight back home.This was terribly dissapointing , because I had done a huge amount of research prior to my trip -LRB- not to mention the entire weekend I spent burning all of the music into it that I wanted to bring along ! -RRB- and thought that I had settled on the perfect answer for what I hoped something like this would be capable of.I can only think that Creative has yet to work out all of the bugs from the system that they have come up with for this unit.Interestingly enough , while I was boxing it up today to send back , I turned it on for grins , and much to my surprise , it fired right up.But I just can not justify the cost of the unit , given it failing for me as it did on my trip . I have no faith that I could trust it to work once I got it away from my house , and the computer with the software ! And I would be even more dissapointed if I were to use it for a photo storage unit , only to have to have it fail , loaded with all of my precious pics!I saw several comments in the reviews for this item that touched on issues like this , but decided to buy it when I saw that Creative had issued patches on their website just a couple of days before I ordered the unit.I will say that when it did work , it was a wonderful little player , sounded far and beyond anything else of this ilk that I have ever listened to , with great graphics , and a great interface.I just could n't seem to get mine to work for more than an hour at a time!And as an aside , I thought that the software that came with the player was a bit lacking as well , as it had many problems keeping the tags for songs and albums straight while loading them from my computer . -LRB- Windows XP Pro -RRB- I can not help but think that this will be a great player sometime down the road , but from my experience Creative still has some work to do on the operating system and the interface with your computer .

AND I SO WANTED IT TO WORK ... I reverted back to my NOMAD ZEN 40 GB player that sounds fine . I do n't know about you , but if you want to pay 400 bucks for music with a very noticable `` whirring '' sound in the background ... go for this player . Otherwise ... stay away .
 No matter how good the design of this product may be , and no matter how good the features are , there is an underlying problem with this corporation 's treatment of its customers.I have had a really nasty experience with the Creative Lab Zen Xtra 40G , which convinced me to stop purchasing any of the company 's products . Unfortunately most of my computer sound related accessories are Creative ones.The problem arose when one of the company 's new firmware release bricked the player . After this there was no way to reset the device in any of the ways accessible to owners , it had to be sent back to the labs to restore it.I exhausted every possible way of getting the Tech support department to take responsibility for this bad piece of software and wave the fees associated with the restoration . Even the supervisor I talked with refused to assist and insisted on referring to the warranty , which in my view has nothing to do with a companies responsibility to wards it 's clients.An owner should not be responsible in regards to the breaking of hardware due to buggy software by the manufacturer itself .
 I had my Creative Zen Vision for all of about 3 hours . Having previously owned a 20GB Creative Zen Portable Media Center and being completely unsatisfied with it I was really hoping that Creative had gone the extra mile and learned from their past effort . Well , 3 hours into things I discovered they did a few things right but one thing horribly wrong . The screen quality is just plain awful . If people are finding a decent angle at which to hold their 's then that 's great , I could n't find one at all . You 'll spend more time fidgeting , trying to find an optimum angle than you 'll ever spend actually enjoying a movie on the thing . It 's simply a cheap lousy screen.The rest of the unit is fine . The construction is solid , the interface very easy to use -LRB- though the included software is n't all that great -RRB- , and even the sound is pretty good - but let 's face it , we buy these things to watch movies on and if they ca n't handle that then what good are they ?
 I own the Zen Xtra , thought this was a upgrade , wrong , this unit functions like the ipod , no search function , poor screen vision and after 2 hours it froze had to remove battery to reboot . not what you expect from creative labs
 The performance is ok but they are bulky especially to store and carry . Performance is good but not exceptional and hardly worth the price tag . Other electronics firms lower prices as products get older but Bose seems to have an elevated opinion of theirs which is too bad .
 This was the worst pair of headphones I 've ever bought , and it was not easy to get the local Bose store to give me a full refund on them despite their advertised `` no hassle refund '' policy.Terrible sound , poor ergonomics , medicore `` noise cancellation '' -- never again will I buy another Bose product ! I should 've known better , my husband has a ridiculous Bose Wave radio which he now tells everyone that he `` won at a Christmas raffle at the office '' because he 's too embarassed to confess that he paid half a grand for the thing.My son pointed me towards a pair of Sennheisers which were better in every respect , and at one third of the price .
 These headphones sound good at first but -LRB- a -RRB- they 're very fragile and -LRB- b -RRB- only really cancel out white noise , making the more annoying sounds -LRB- e.g. people talking on a train -RRB- even more annoying .
 I 've had three pairs of Bose QuietComfort Headphones . They are very comfortable ... and very expensive . I have n't been able to get one to last more than two years before breaking off at EXACTLY the same place each time - on the headband right above the earpiece.Clearly , the reason they are not fixing this flaw - is because -LRB- if you choose to still support this company -RRB- it forces you to spend another -LSB- ... -RSB- bucks to get a new pair.Unbelievable . You 'd think that they 'd want people to be very , very happy with their products to the point where they would recommend them . But how can anyone recommend something that breaks in such a short time - at the same place on the headband?Hopefully Bose execs will finally do something about this . Incidentally , I did write the company and never heard back from them . That type of customer service is unfortunate . Do n't bother with these . Find something else that either will last longer for you - or something where you wo n't cringe at the cost of replacing them .
 These headphones sound awsome . As long as you do not use them near
 I 've owned a pair of QC2 's for about a year now , and after about 6 months they started making an annoying squeaking noise if I wore them while walking . Then this morning , I went to put them on my head , and the headband cracked , making them pretty much useless.I 've had $ 50 headphones built much more solidly than these .
 OMG ... Really ? These head phones cost too much to fall apart . Thank you for your comments.I 'm tryin to find the perfect pair of headphones and just because it cost alot it does not nessarly mean it 's made to be steardy enought .
 First the good news
 I 'm on my 2nd pair , and it just broke like the first pair . They sound OK , and the battery life is OK , but you are paying for a fluff . They do break -LRB- usually after any warranty -RRB- . I for one am not going to buy a 3rd pair , but maybe in about 2 months I 'll get these back from repair .
 I 'm glad to see that I am not the only person who has experienced the gradual disintegration of these headphones . The sound quality is excellent , the comfort is good and it does n't eat batteries . However , to my utter dismay , over the past 2.5 years the plastic and cushions have literally disintegrated . The first thing I noticed were cracks that appeared near the junction with the ear pieces . Eventually , each side broke and I superglued them together . That only lasted a few months before it cracked in other areas and the plastic plates popped out , so I was forced to use electrical tape to try and keep it all together . Finally , the right swivel joint fell apart and the plastic inside was virtually powder ! Add to this the cushions on the ears and headband started to became brittle and started to fall off - little bits of black stuff everywhere . It 's so dissapointing , when you consider the near $ 400 they cost to buy . I have some old Sony headphones I bought in 1994 which are still in perfect condition and only cost $ 79.99 at the time . The sound is obviously nothing like the Bose ones , but the fact they have lasted 15 years and still going says a lot about the build quality ! Though , I 'm not so sure modern Sony headphones would be as durable ! In any case , I will never ever buy Bose headphones again .
 with regards to sound , this is a very good headsetThe noise cancelling features are very good -- unfortunately , the ` phones suffer from discomfort and priceI compared these headphones , head to head , on an airplane , against the Sony MDR NC20 , and there was no difference in sound - both performed excellently , and equally , within the airplane environment -- however , the Sony ones were more comfortable and MUCH cheaperDo n't even waster your time with the Bose Quite Comfort -- grab a pair of the Sony 's and you 'll fall in love !
 If you have never flown with noise canceling headphones , they completely change the experience of a long flight , reducing fatigue and stress dramatically . I own a pair of QC2 earphones and , previously , I owned their predecessors -LRB- I do n't remember the model number -RRB- . Bose headphones have always supplied excellent noise canceling , my complaint is with the quality of construction . The first thing to wear out are the foam ear cups . They last about three to four years of casual use . I was able to obtain replacement ear cups for my first set of ` phones -LRB- at $ 45.00 / pair -RRB- , but they stopped carrying them and so my $ 250.00 pair of headphones has become useless . On the QC2 , the build quality is even worse . The foam on the ear cups has deteriorated and the foam pad on the headband is failing as well . Also , the plastic side pieces have broken . When you spend that kind of money , I expect something to last a while , but I believe these Bose headphones are deliberately designed to have a short lifespan , because my first pair failed in exactly the same way as the new pair in about the same amount of time . It looks like engineering for failure to me .
 I owned a pair of Bose noise canceling headphones before and loved them however I lost them and was forced to purchase a new set , problem is I could n't remember what version I had . I did n't think it mattered at the time as I have always thought of Bose as a quality manufacturer and was sure that the next set would be just as good if not better . So I ordered the Bose QuietComfort 2 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones as a replacement . When they came I was excited and immediately tried to put them to use . The issues I had with them are as follows :1 . The cable that plugs into the headphones is difficult to insert . So difficult that you think you might just break them in the process .2 . Removing the cable is as equally difficult and you are forced to pull , tug and jerk -LRB- hard -RRB- on the cable directly as opposed to just removing the jack . I 'm afraid I 'm going to damage the cable in the removal process .3 . the headphones only work with the noise canceling feature in the on posistion as opposed to my previous model that had to operating modes -LRB- normal and noise canceling -RRB- .4 . The product just feels cheap I mean real cheap the plastic quality is poor in my opinion5 . The sound quality is poor as well definitely not like the previous Bose model I had.I honestly thought I might have got a counterfeit Bose product and I 'm actually still suspicious that may still be the case as this product does not compare with the previous Bose model I had . Trash !
 My Bose headphones are extremely lightly used . This is the second time the plastic has broken on the headphones . My husband has had to duck tape them . Bose wants to charge me $ 100 to replace their defective product .
 For $ 500 friggin ' dollars , you 'd think Bose might make some headphones where the wiring does n't fray so easily . I have n't even had mine for a year and now the wires of frayed and I can only hear out of one headphone.And Bose `` customer service department '' basically tells you you 're SOL when you ask about repairs or a replacement.Bose should change their name to `` BLOWS . ''
 I am reviewing the Bose Quiet Comfort Series 1 headphone . I got this set as a gift and used it occassionally for travel . I found the headphones too bulky to take with me most of the time . Still , I found the noise cancelling to be great and enjoyed the sound quality . Unfortunately , the headphones began making loud vibrating noises after about a year -LRB- and 15 total hours -RRB- of use . Bose will fix them for $ 100 or offer me a credit toward a trade in on the Series 2 of $ 112 -LRB- I would pay $ 188 + tax vs $ 300 -RRB- . I am not impressed enough to pay this for a new pair .
 I agree wholeheartedly with T. Gardner . I loved my QC1 headphones , which I bought for use in an office with noise problems , until they started making a noise that I liken to the noise of a nearby helicopter . The noise is not always there , and I can usually make it stop by fiddling with the positioning of the earpieces . Bose support has offered me two options
 In my opinion , the sound quality is quite good . However , as other reviewers have pointed out , these headphones are not durable . I have been treating mine with plenty of care , but today , 6 months after my purchase , they simply fell apart . The headband broke in two places
 This product has a major default . It is badly designed and breaks very easily at the plastic arms holding the adjustable metal railings above the phones due to a design flaw . This is the second pair that bose replaced for me and they are broke again !!!
 The sound quality is good . However , do your research . There is a design flaw in the headband whereby the plastic covering on the sides will crack after 2 + years of use . Turns out , after contacting bose , the headphones are neither factory nor user serviceable . You can exchange them in for a new pair at $ 100 cost . That 's right , if anything breaks whatsoever , you are expected to buy a whole new pair . So instead of just stocking spare plastic headband parts for $ 2 , bose wants you to pay $ 100 for another pair once these fall apart . I do n't know about you , but for $ 300 , I expected them to last a bit longer .
 I 've had to replace the ear cushions twice already at a price of $ 35.00 plus tax . The cushions come apart in less than 2 years of use .
 I got these last December-05 . The molded plastic that holds the ear cups onto the headband started to crack -LRB- right at the L/R labels -RRB- . They eventually crumbled and fractured , causing the cups to fall off . I taped one side up and the other failed as well . I have no doubt that if I replace these , the same thing will happen . My complaint is for $ 300 I expect something other than soft plastic holding these together at the stress points .
 I bought these , they work wonderful for sound reduction if you only use them once in a while . I used mine every day and they did not last 3 months , the plastic above the earpads started cracking and finally gave out . The construction is definitely not worth the price . I just purchased the Sennheiser PXC250 for one-third of the price and while they might not look as chic , the sound is just as good and the fit is okay . Do n't buy the Bose unless you have money to burn .
 bought these for my iPod . aside from the noise cancelling gimmick , the earphones that came with the iPOD sound better.the Bose sounds muffled and tinny , and you have to crank up the volume to the max to get some sound out of it compared to the original earphones . the noise cancelling is a gimmickMy old Sennheiser Cx100 are just better for a 10th of the pricethis was my second and last Bose purchase
 First off , let me say how happy I am that * I * did n't waste three hundred freakin ' dollars on this total POS.No , the hopeless sucker was my EX-GIRLFRIEND , who bought me one of these for my birthday ! However since she bundled in a nice long 10 minute wet kiss with the gift , how could a gentleman possibly refuse , LOL ? Plus since she is now married to a very wealthy man , I figure it was n't really * her * money she just wasted ... in any case it 's the thought that counts , right?Well I have to say , these headphones at least manage to mostly do ONE thing they claim -LRB- unlike most Bose products which are total frauds -RRB-
 Thisis only item i am un happy with amazon.com . Head phones are in very bad shape . They also damageed right head phone .
 Bose is supposed to have a good reputation in innovative audio technology . But , this attempt at `` Acoustic Noise Cancelling '' is a misnomer , in fact , plain misleading . It may reduce some engine noise in the plane , but you hear everything else , including screaming chidren and chatty passengers . The idea is good , but the technology is nowhere there . I 'm returning mine back .
 headphones need to withstand at least some not so ideal conditions . my AKGs and Sennheisers have survived more than 25 respectively 15 years of use . sometimes they got dropped or i fell asleep while wearing them . and they still serve me well 'til this day and still sound perfect . not so the Bose set i bought in 2004 . in 2005 the plastic parts holding the ear pieces to the frame broke . i fixed them on one side just to see them break on the other . then the plastic skin covering the foam padding started to come off . apart from being annoying , the chemical stench coming from the foam was sickening . i gave up on repairing the set and just recently tossed it in the trash bin promising myself never to touch Bose , ever , ever again . i am happy with a cheap Koss set now that at a fraction of the price sounds about as good and it still works .
 Paid $ 300.00 for these about 5 years ago . After about 2 years of light use the ear pad vinyl fell apart and the head bar rubber padding became very sticky , comes off on your fingers and gets on everything . The replacement ear pads do n't fit into the frame well and come out easily . The overall quality of sound and durability was very disappointing . I found several over-the-ear clip ear phones for under $ 10.00 to be superior in every way , including comfort , quality stereo , and I can use these cheaper ear phones when I 'm sweating/exercising
 I got these as a gift , so I ca n't really be as upset as if I had shelled out $ 400 personally , but really , a 1 year warranty on an overpriced set of headphones . . Do n't get me wrong , they 're really good , but not worth the price.After 1 year of occasional use , the plastic supports gave way and snapped off . All I could do was superglue the back in place and hope for the best . And it did . . for another year - this time with even less use . I had them on a flight -LRB- 18 hours + layover to Australia -RRB- and I was n't even - wearing - them per se , I had them wrapped around my neck , so there was no tension in the support frame , when all of a sudden * SNAP * the right speaker just . . fell off the unit ... With absolutely no provocation . Even the earpads started to wear away . I 'd only use the thing a week out of the month or so.Apparently this model had frame issues which were corrected in the later versions by Bose.Honestly , skip this one -LRB- because it 's old , too ! -RRB- and get the newer ones if you 're determined on getting a QC unit .
 I 've had these for a couple of years , used them infrequently , and always stored them in their protective case . The sound is great , but the shoddy materials will soon make them unusable . The hinges on the ear pieces are cheap plastic and will break with even minimal use . Check out all the complaints -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- -RRB- and give serious thought before buying these . It seems that not only is the product inferior , but the customer service is even worse .
 A fellow traveler let me sample his , and I was impressed . I ordered the product , and was happy with it ... until all the issues mentioned above - flaking leather around ears , poor joint construction , etc. . It was in poor shape within the year . . and with not that much use ! No hard case to protect the gear when packing for travel . So when it got stolen ... I did not miss it much ... considering the cost ! After this experience , I have decided to hear and compare headphones ... rather than rely on opinions . Everyone 's ear is different . . and every brain seems to have a preference for a certain timbre/tonal range . The Sennheiser PXC 450 ... beat the pants off the Bose Q2-Q3 . I am going to try a few others at a store , this time , before I purchase . However , I am almost tempted to bypass the noise cancellation option . . and get a higher quality traditional over-the-ear headphone . It is a better value of sound quality for the $ . But it depends on how much time I spend in a noisy environment/aircraft vs in a quieter space , in the next year . Bose -LRB- and therefore the consumer -RRB- spends a lot on marketing rather than product quality , in my opinion . I have noticed the same of their sound systems as well . M&K satellites with a Yamaha subwoofer sounded way better than the Bose systems ... even with the right placement .
 I 'll make this short and sweet . If you spend $ 300 for these headphones you are officially a victim of a marketing machine that conditions consumers to think that they are buying high-quality audio gear when , in fact , they are only priced that way . In other words , GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR ASS ! Bose products really are quite horrible . They create a sound with no prescence , no character . Somebody said , `` no highs , no lows , must be bose '' Have n't heard this cheeky witticism but I ultimately agree . To be fair , the sound of these particular phones is better than that of many other BOSE products -LRB- the cataclysmic Wavradio -RRB- , but I would argue that it is average at best.Besides overrated sound quality , there are technical flaws as well . The plastic arms do break . It takes a damn battery that drains far quicker than they tell you -LRB- 40 hrs my ass -RRB- and when there 's `` only 5 hours '' of battery life left , the power light starts to flash as the audio cuts in and out with an annyoing altering of the equalization everytime it comes back on . And the battery for my phones would only last a couple a days before doing this ! 40 hours ! I did n't know that applied to even when the headphones were off ! Just , Ah ! I ca n't go on . It is all much too painful.JUST STAY AWAY PEOPLE . PLEASE , I LOVE YOU ALL TOO MUCH TO LET YOU GO THROUGH WITH IT !
 There 's a short in the Bose headphones I bought from this vendor , and I 'm going to have to have them fixed . I 'm not particularly happy . The headphones work well in the short periods when I can actually hear through them .
 The sound quality is pretty good and battery life OK but the quality of the plastic used is REALLY poor , the structure complex and fragile . The head-band brakets will brake where it encloses the size adjustment `` sliders '' . When that happens the headphone comes loose and the headset is unusable . The peace of plastic could be sold for a few dollars for a quick fix but in fact you have to get through the repair cycle nightmare and it costs a lot ... not a good deal , I am now looking for something different I can use while sleeping on the plane !
 I 've had this product for over 2 years now and about a month ago the pads around the ears started flaking . It took me a while to figure out where the black specks on my shirt were coming from . They continue to flake even though I tried to remove as much of the loose material as possible . I emailed Bose about this and their response was that I could bey a new set of pads for $ 35 . So basically I 'm going to be out $ 35 every 2 years or so to keep these in usable condition . Sounds like a maintenance plan to me , I 'm very disappointed with the responses from Bose on this issue and based on this and on reading other reviews of this product , have decided that Bose is not a quality product . These are expensive headphones , I paid $ 300 and expected them to last a bit longer than they did .
 The noise canceling feature works well and the sound is good . However , the cheap plastic they are made of breaks easily . First one side broke but I managed to tape it together . Then the other side broke and was not fixable . You would think that something so expensive would be more durable !
 I 've owned my pair for close to four years now and they are starting to physically deteriorate . The sound quality is excellent , as is the noise canceling . I used these in an office cubicle environment and later in a computer room , and the performance on my iPod is outstanding . But at this point the plastic upright on each earphone has broken and needs to be held together with wire ties , and the rubber cover on one of the ear pieces has worn through . Granted , I use them almost every day , but they do n't see rough use - and this is n't the type of endurance I 'd expect from a $ 300 product . The two year warranty is n't long enough to address these issues.UPDATED JANUARY 2009One of the ear pieces finally cracked at the pivot point and simply fell off . When I contacted Boise they did offer to replace them with a new set for $ 100 .
 I am on my second pair of Bose QuietComfort 2 headphones - and like so many in the other reviews here both mine broke . The first time they broke I paid $ 100 for a replacement pair , and the replacement then started to crack in the same place as my first pair ! So I quickly pulled out the black electrical tape and effected a repair before they completely broke again . My self-back-patting was shortlived however when they broke completely at the swivel joint , while I was wearing them . I treated these headphones with the utmost care and they still broke . I fly a lot and the noise cancelling really helps reduce the fatigue from the engine roar so I will try another manufacturer , probably Sennheiser . I always found the sound quality to fine , not great but when you 're on an aircraft you do n't expect much . But I do expect something that costs $ 300 to be able to stand up to the rigours of everyday life .
 Tried one of these in a Bose store , oh my God it was a joke . Drums sounded muddy and boomy at the same time , highs were shrill and unnatural , and voices sounded completely hollow.The Sennheiser PXC-300 , at 2/3rds of this Bose 's price , blows it out of the water in all departments
 Bought it for my 17 '' MacBook and it is inches too big in both dimensions . Ca n't use it without cutting it down and then you lose the cutouts that allow the cover to close . The company never responded to emails about returning or exchanging.A total waste of money , will never buy from this company again . Bad product and absolutely no customer support !
 Hello , I purchased a solid black Protouch by iSkin . I recommend finding another manufacturer which does not use plastic materials which eventually deposit onto your MacBook 's laptop screen -LRB- as it did mine -RRB- . I have been unable to recover from this by wiping the screen . It appears to be permanent side-effects resulting from legitimate use of the iSkin product.I used the iSkin ProTouch for about 2 years . I only removed it from the keyboard for basic maintenance outlined in the User 's directions -LRB- mild soap and water rinse and allowed to fully air-dry -RRB- . The final side-effect is a black outline of the keys edges are shown on the laptop screen . Essentially , for each key , the plastic of the iSkin imprinted a rectangular square -LRB- border -RRB- of black plastic debris which is permanently attached to the screen.Wiping the display surface with a cloth or approved Apple screen cleaner -LRB- and their associated micro-fiber cloths -RRB- does not remove the plastic deposits that are outlining the relative positions of individual keys.In fact , where my thumb touches the space bar , the iSkin developed a rough spot on it 's otherwise smooth exterior finish . This spot produced more plastic material which attached to the screen compared to the smooth edges of the individual keys -LRB- described above -RRB- . Now , above the outline of my entire keyboard , is a thumb-sized fuzzy spot on my display located in the exact position as the splotch on the space bar key.When I reported this to the iSkin company , without even asking me for any further details , their response was the following boilerplate : '' ... please know that our Protouch covers underwent several tests to ensure that the material we used would n't transfer any of it 's material to the screen as we do advise that you can leave the Protouch cover on at all times . `` They went on with their dismissive response to say that they think the presence of human oils from human fingers are to blame.They say
 Would suggest this unless you are in an environment were dust/sand/etc is a major concern . It does cover the keys and for the most part fits , but the typing experience is horrible .
 I ordered a ProTouch keyboard protector from amazon for a macbook pro . I received a cheap , no name brand clear rubber keyboard cover for a macbook white . it came in a bag that said `` Wireless Accessories '' on it . that 's all it said . the same bag that the no name brand cell phone cases come in . certainly not a presentable package . I was displeased to say the least , and no company name was available for me to ship it back to , or exchange .
 According to Amazon , I purchased this about 1 year and 3 months ago so I think that 's a pretty adequate amount of time and usage to be doing a review -LRB- I 've used it on my 1st gen Macbook Pro -RRB- . I would not recommend purchasing this again for the $ 25 as I 'm sure there must be a better cover - here are my reasons why :1 . I noticed sometimes moisture can collect between the keyboard cover and the keys itself . I 'm not sure if that 's due to heat from my laptop , the cover itself reacting to the heat , or what . I would try to wipe down the keyboard every now and then with a paper towel and wash the keyboard cover with a sponge in the sink .2 . After a short while , the cover stretches and does n't fit the keys exactly as it first did . It 's gotten to the point now that if I were to try to lay down the cover completely flat against the keyboard like how it 's supposed to be , half of the cover does n't fit the keys properly .3 . There are now tears that have formed on some of the keys on the cover - namely A , S , D and E and very small tears on R and T -LRB- probably because they are the most used letters ? -RRB- . I do not always have long fingernails nor do I use anything that would cause the cover to tear so I 'm not sure why it would tear -LRB- maybe it is the fingernails but I 'm not sure because my nails are usually kept very short -RRB- . I think maybe it 's just natural wear and tear . Because of this , I need to check under the cover more frequently to see if there is any buildup of dust or dead skin cells and such , which there are and then I have to clean the keyboard , negating the purpose of this cover.I hope this helps - I 'm going to try a different cover now that this one is basically dead and see how it goes .
 I LOVED the iSkin for the first 2 months . Then , it stretches , bubbles over the keys , and does n't give a good fit . I 'm very disappointed . The Apple Store has returned mine a couple of times now and have deduced it just gets heated and stretches . They will take it back now and offer a store credit . I would love a skin that works .
 This is a great idea , very useful to protect your keyboard . I think that computer companies should always integrate this kind of protection to the keyboard . Keyboard are n't cheap , and on laptops if you spill your coffee , your laptop is pretty much dead . So this comes in as an important piece of protection.Unfortunately in low light environment , especially when there 's still enough light for the backlight of the keyboard to be off , you just ca n't see the keys anymore . Because of this issue , 1/2 of the time i 'm not using the protection . The protection is very sticky on the side that goes against the keyboard , meaning that when you do n't use it , it gathers a lot of dust very quickly , beating the purpose of having that `` skin '' on top of your keyboard.Another good idea , that really needs more thinking , as to what material should be used so that it 's fully transparent .
 I was really looking forward to using this product given how pleased I have been with the iSkin covers for both of my iPods . The iSkin cover for the MacBook Pro does not fit well over the keyboard and as another reviewer mentioned it makes the keys hard to read . I plan on returning this keyboard protector .
 As a keyboard protector , it works fine.Unfortunately , the material seems to interact with the LCD display to leave marks.It has stained my screen with rectangles -LRB- one from each protected keycap -RRB- . Water does not completely remove the marks on the screen - they appear to bepermanent .
 does not fit the new 15 '' june macbooks or 17 '' . the F-Keys are in the wrong place , it fits a Tibook g4 BUT NOT THE NEW MACBOOKS BE WARNED . I sent back and had no problems getting my refund and they responded they DO NOT HAVE THE MACBOOK CORRECT SIZE . you have been warned . I give 2 stars for their customer service . understanding no questions asked .
 One of my Pioneer speakers broke so I took the cheapest path and bought Jensen . I should have known better . The magnet on the Jensen is 1/3 the size of the one it was replacing . I installed the one speaker and before I installed the second one I decided to try it out . Not only did it sound terrible but it blew within five minutes . Keep in mind that I have a standard Kenwood 40x4 head unit without any extra amp and I had it turned up up about three quarters . This speaker is week and as I stated in the title you get what you pay for .
 i bought a system like this today -LRB- razor 3d the ultimate 3d experience -RRB- and have tried 3 dvds with it , used all the different settings , and so far it offers more depth perception , but is definitely not jump-off-the-screen 3d . i was disappointed
 I 've had this amp for a few years and have been satisfied for most of the time , but it just quit working so ... now not so happy.I 'm actually on my second one because the first one I received only worked for a week before failing . It was replaced under warranty and the second model worked fine for a few years.I 've been using it to power several sets of speakers throughout the house . I recently moved some components around and after plugging everything back up the amp no longer worked . I checked the fuse and it was blown , so I replaced it but the new fuse blows as soon as I turn the amp on even though I do n't have any inputs or speakers connected.So , now I 'm shopping for a new amp .
 Very disappointed with this amp . It has an auto shut off , which is a cool feature . However it randomly shuts off while in use . VERY frustrating .
 The amp arrived and looked great for a refurbished unit . The price could not be beat . However my unit only ran for about ten minutes before the circuits began shutting off and on . So I let J&R Music World know about the problem and was told to return it at their cost . I received an emailed ups label and dropped it off to go out next day . I got a fast response from J&R and a proper credit was made . So although I did n't get a working amplifier , I did get the kind of service that would allow me to shop with confidence on Amazon.com .
 My GF bought this amp as a present for me , and now she 's very unhappy . We opened the shipping box , which was 5 times the size needed , removed the amp and hooked it up . We could n't get it to do anything advertised ! Nothing hooked up to it produced any sound . Only the green `` ON '' light and the red speaker lights worked . I called the 800 number for tech support at the mfgr . of this AudiolessSource Amp 100 , and , after the normal recorded voice menu , when transferred , the phone just rang and rang . No support or customer service !! It went back today !!
 I ordered this item on November 23rd . 2010 . Through his website . It was was installed as additional power to boost sound and cut-out from two sets of speakers connected to it -LRB- via wall mounted volume controls -RRB- . -LRB- Kitchen and master bath ceiling mounts -RRB- The main amp is/was a DENON AVR-788 receiver.This unit arrived on November 30th . It was brand new . It looked great and hookup was a cinch . It had some heft to it and did n't seem too cheap at all.Today , I turned the unit on and went in the kitchen to start some Christmas baking.The ceiling speakers cut out . Gosh . I said , `` what gives ? '' and I headed to the media closet to see what was up.Low and behold the audiosource AMP-100 was `` up in smoke '' I mean smoking and cooking and smelling and about to burst into flames.I immediately turned off the power , and while I was scrambling to disconnect the speakers and unplug it . It kept smoking more . And not just a little.This thing is DANGEROUS . And a huge fire hazzard.I am sending it to UL and contacting Consumer Reports.I spoke with Tom O'mara , Audiosources ' President . He apologized , and is refunding my money . I still feel I need to warn others of this dangerous product.He says , `` This is rare , '' and is having his in stock units tested . I suggest he start thinking recall.Anyway , this could have been a major catastrophe . If I had gone to shovel the front walk before baking , I 'm certain my house would have caught fire.The night before , I was watching a Bond DVD , and fell asleep on couch . Thank god it did n't burn up then.There are tons of scenarios that could have made this poorly made unit a disaster for me and my family . When I say this unit was minutes or seconds from bursting into flames , I mean it.I suggest you buy this unit at your own risk . What stinks is this would have been the perfect solution for me too . Had it not caught fire , I 'm sure I would have loved it.By the way , no , the master fuse never tripped . The fuse remains intact . !!! UPDATE !!!! Since this post : I received a full refund from Tom Omeara , directly.I have not yet sent the burned AMP 100 to UL.While I was in the hospital for some major surgery . -LRB- 12/15-12 / 20 -RRB- Audiosource sent me an AMP 110 . It appears it has been opened and presumably tested . I have not had the opportunity to consider installing it.Because , now my Denon AVR788 , is fried as well . After the burn , -LRB- and before I went into the hospital -RRB- I hooked everything up as it was before the burn . A simple 5.1 system.After , VERY light use , The speakers cut out and sounded like the subwoofer was playing through all the speakers . This happens on ALL sources.I removed the DENON AVR788 , from my media closet . Set it on the kitchen counter with one single center speaker attached , and an FM antenna . Sure enough , it will work for a minute or two now before it cuts out . Horrible.I am now taking BOTH the burned AMP-100 , and the DENON to the repair shop . I have informed Tom Omeara that I am holding Audiosource responsible unless this third party independent repair specialist , assures my that is not the case.Until I am convinced I wo n't need the AMP100 for my own legal fight , -LRB- ie replacing my Denon , reimbursing my expenses -RRB- I need to hang onto it . Then I will send it along to UL.I have had numerous conversations with Tom Omeara regarding this issue , he seems to be quite responsive . Albeit I wish this was not a issue at all.I sure would have been nice to watch DVDs / TV etc. during my recuperation . This whole thing has turned into one major PITA . Now I 'm lugging heavy units around to repair specialists etc.Shopping for new units.Again , thanks for the PITA , Tom .
 In general , I like the product specs , but getting it home and using it is a different story . The auto-off feature makes it useless.I used it as a second amplifier for streaming music . The sound quality is nice , but it clicks off when the volume drops low . This means you often miss the beginning and ends of songs -LRB- most songs have points of low volume -RRB- and in some cases , bits of the middle . I was so embarrassed when I had people over and the music kept switching off and on , making loud clicks in the process.This first issue is a show stopper for me and caused me to buy a different receiver -LRB- Teac AG-790A -RRB- . However it also has a second flaw
 I purchased this amp based on the great customer reviews . It is the most frustrating piece of musical equipment I have ever worked with . I do alot of recording and it 's impossible due to the fact that the amp does not turn on until there is a signal sent to it , therefore you never hear the first few beats of a song when you press play . It sucks . What a waste of $ 100 . I guess I should have splurged on a higher quality amp .
 Dont buy this if you want good sound and power ! worthless to me for my use ! Did n't work worth a DAMN !
 Upon the third use , I started having the same problem as all the other 1-star people . The problem is with the auto input line sensing circuitry . Even with the auto-sensing switch in manual , the auto-sensing circuitry engages and disengages after every dynamic passage on a center channel home theater setup . When it engages and disengages the sound coming from the speaker connected to the amp also engages and disengages . I just ordered the Niles Audio SI-2125 to replace this piece of junk . Thanks Amazon for picking up the return shipping !
 I wanted to like it . The amp sounds good but it popped horribly every time it was turned on . It would also pop anytime anything else on the same circuit was powered on . Ended up returning it before it had the chance to blow my speakers .
 Works , but nasty click from the speakers when power on or off . What is the point of auto-on if you have to walk up to the box to turn up the volume afterwards ? Company phone rings forever , so support is non existant . At least this amplifier is cheap , but of course there is a reason .
 This amplifier is a good enough design aesthetically for me . Also the amplification provided is enough for my casual use -LRB- hooking up computer or TV to in-wall speakers , indoors and backyard -RRB- . I am not an audiophile so if the sound quality is not as true to source , it does n't bother me -LRB- in other words I ca n't tell the difference mostly -RRB- . Given all that , I was really hoping for this to work out for me - as I am just not comfortable spending significantly more on a simple amplifier that suits my need . But it did n't work out . I ordered it , and right out the box only half the output worked -LRB- I think it 's called channel -RRB- . So whether I had speaker A or B selected , only my left speaker -LRB- say -RRB- would work not the right . I tried to play around to see if the problem was my input , but no it was the amplifier . I was able to hook two speakers by using a common Red connection -LRB- the one side that was working -RRB- while taking the black separately -LRB- which was working on both sides -RRB- . Just as a test , not that I was going to use it like that.I called customer service with a hope that there might be an easy fix . They were great . Within the first couple of minutes they recommended me to just send it back and get a replacement . I would rate their customer service 5 stars , but on this review I want to stay true to spirit and only rate the product - which is a 1 star in my opinion.Needless to say I did n't exchange the product , but simply sent back to Amazon for a refund . I 'll keep looking to find an acceptable solution elsewhere .
 It 's a bummer as initially it worked amazingly well . Started to short out and ultimately failed quickly . Looking for a replacement and am not sure what that will be .
 This amp is absolute junk . I am the Technology Coordinator for a small mid western school district . We bought this amp -LRB- actually , we bought 9 of them -RRB- from our local AV supplier for use in the classroom . They are hooked to a DVD/VCR player and a pair of small Dual brand speakers . Nothing fancy.After less than a year of use I now have three of them that do n't work properly . Two of them have the sound cut out intermittently and one has a loud hum through the speakers whenever the unit is turned on . I was told by the AV supplier to make sure nothing was sitting on top of them because the weight would cause them to short out . For the record , nothing has sat on top of any of these amps since we got them , but I do n't think that says too much for the robustness of this product when you ca n't set anything on top of it . Have you ever seen a stereo cabinet where components were n't stacked?Bottom line
 After setting up and testing for about 24 hours over a period of a week , it went up in smoke ! . I hate to think what would have happened if I had n't been there . In this age this should NEVER happen !
 purchased two of these . one unit worked good for about an hour the static electricity made it go up in flames . the second unit will only produce sound from the left or right channel at different levels . it will not balance out even with the balance nob .
 This product had great potential and it does everything promised as long as you only use 1 source and you attach it to the LINE2 input . LINE2 is the default input meaning whenever there is n't any signal on LINE1 the unit instantly switches back to LINE2 . The issue is with the `` instant '' result . When I play a DVD movie through LINE1 the AMP100 annoyingly switches back to LINE2 every time the audio goes quiet - even in between dialog . The switch makes a discernible `` click '' and usually does not return back to LINE1 right away so some of the audio you hope to hear is lost . Same issue with music tracks - during quiet passages the AMP100 switches back to line1 and if there is anything playing on LINE1 your other audio source starts chopping in and out . I have two AMP100 's and they both operate this way . I spoke with Audio Source tech support and they acknowledged this shortcoming and tried to push me to buy the AMP200 which apparently has a time delay that prevents this undesired chopping of content that is connected to LINE1 . They do n't even provide a switch on the front panel to manually switch LINES , you have to unplug your cables to take control.Otherwise a great product . It powers down nicely when no signal is sensed .
 I bought the AudioSource Amp 100 to replace a 30-year-old Harmam-Kardon that had died - I used it to make cassette copies of old phonograph records . The Amp100 does accept the signal from my turntable and pre-amp and puts the sound on the speakers , proving that there was nothing wrong with my system but the dead stereo amplifier . However , although the Amp 100 clearly has stereo output jacks , the signal there will not provide anything useful to the cassette deck . Way down in the fine print of the instructions I discovered that this `` output '' is referred to as a `` pass-through '' , which apparently means it is unamplified . Phooey !
 i purchased this amp as an add on for one of my customer 's home audio systems . i plugged it in and everything worked fine for a few minutes . i turned it off to add cables to the tv , and while it was off , it caught on fire ! the manufacturer says that was an amazing fluke . the store i bought it from has no more to replace it so they gave my money back . i found another one at a different store and purchased it . that was a month ago . now the website for the store is under construction , i have not recieved the amp , and they will not respond to phone calls or emails . i want my money back !
 This product is a waste of money , everything meaning quality is ZERO in this AudioSource product!I dispensed it !
 An annoying amount of hum and hiss comes from my speakers . The noise is still there without any inputs to the amplifier and it increases as I turn up the volume knob .
 i was wondering if anyone else who has purchased this amp is having the same problem as me . i am using an old advent 300 as the pre-amp . the souce is either a laptop or mp3 player . at the beginning of a song or when the music is slightly muted the amp kicks off , the music stops . it 's very irritating because it give the music a halting quality . when it 's picking up the music it sounds great ... but i ca n't listen to it when it 's doing this . i am not an audiphile so it maybe something in the setup but it seemed pretty straight forward . thanks for any input .
 This AMP is junk . First one burnt out within 2 weeks of running a pair of 8 '' Audiosource ceiling speakers . Audiosource seems good so far , replace the first bad unit . Got the second one , smoked the second day . Same scenario - running background music in small house.Potential fire hazard , as it not only blows the fuse , but also heats up and smokes inside.Look elsewhere .
 We have two reference systems in the home plus digital or analog over ethernet feeds to all of the other rooms . Speakers tend to be high end , source material ranges from digital music fed to dac 's or cd 's . I have two AudioSource 100 's , one in the kitchen driving Energy 's and one that drives a set of B&W ; 's on the porch.Totally devoid of musicality . This amp will kill any source signal you put in it . Compared to any amp we 've had in the past 40 years , this is the worst . The sound has nothing going for it , 0 energy , no low end , sounds like it compresses music , no soundstage , no rhythm , just plain boring .
 This would be a fine product except for the fact that it has this mechanism to cut sound output when the sound level falls below a certain threshold . There is a switch to turn off this `` feature '' but it does n't work . The result is that the sound always cuts off when your music volume gets low . It 's extremely irritating when you 're trying to listen to the soft parts of songs or when you do n't want to blast the output . I want control my volume via remote , buy I have to manually adjust the volume knob instead and when I do n't feel like cajoling the amp , I just let the music periodically cut out but get irritated every time it does . I would not recommend this product as a result of this problem .
 I went to turn the volume down and a static discharge from my fingers went right through the volume control knob and literally smoked it . Seems to me you should n't have to worry about electrostatic discharge ruining your equipment when turning a knob on the front of the unit ! Like maybe using plastic instead of metal knobs ?
 Oh , boy!Briefly , this item is just not worth your time or effort . It certainly is n't worth your money.I bought this for only one reason
 My old stereo amp was going to die , so I needed a replacement.All I need was a simple stereo amp and this product seemed to be the best fit with great price!Well , it has automatic power on/off function based on the input.So , when there 's no input , it turns off automatically to save power.The problem is , even if you turn off the function , it still works so basically it turns on and off all the time while I listen the music.It could have been a great one if it did not have this quality issue.I am returning the product .
 Buy a different amplifier ! I bought this because of the price and the output , but it has one feature that makes it so unbelievably annoying that I 'm glad to be rid of it . It has a gate on it that is suppose to automatically switch between inputs . The way its suppose to work is if you have two inputs it will automatically switch to the one carrying the signal . Instead of working the way it should it automatically shuts off once the input level gets low , causing a clicking that cuts out the quietest parts of your music . During a fade in or out it just cuts out ! If you 're constantly using a high output device this might work for you , but anything less and this amp is no good .
 I really liked the features of this unit . I use it to power some speakers in my back yard , and I feed it either with an iPod or an Airport Express so I can wireless send music from my laptop to the speakers in the back yard . The auto-off feature meant I could have the Amp in my garage and whenever the music stopped , it would turn off and I would n't have to worry about leaving it running . Seemed like a great solution.And it was . For about 18 months , when one day , it just stopped working . Lights come on as normal , looks functional , just does n't make any sound through either speaker.To check things out , I hooked up my old trusty Carver m100t amp -LRB- that 's almost 30 years old now -RRB- and my speakers , the ipod , the Airport Express worked fine.So you may be thinking , it 's only $ 99 . I can buy another one when it breaks . After all , it will probably cost over $ 100 to get it fixed.But it 's an amp . I should n't break . It should just keep working . There are n't enough parts to go wrong . Yet somehow , this one just died on its own . Kind of typical of the made in China stuff we keep seeing that only lasts 1-2 years.Very disappointed . -LRB- Oh , and when I bought it , it cost almost twice as much . So I 'm extra disappointed with the failure . -RRB-
 Wow , pinch me is it really 2011 and we still have consumer electronics catching fire ? Where is CE , UL , BS when you need them?Fortuitously I was next to the amp when the wisps of smoke started , followed by a crackling fire . The amp as spec ` ed is decent and worked fine - until it decided to self-combust . The real concern is that this is configured as an ` auto-on ' device , so it switches itself on when it receives an audio signal on the line-in
 I really wanted to like this amp . It was a great price point and it had A/B channel selecting . But it started smoking and sparking after second use and was toast . Thanks to Amazon for the hassle free return . I may purchase another one hoping this was just a defective unit . There are n't any other comparable amps for this price point.NOTE
 I have read all the reviews , before , and again after , since my unit crapped out ... It lasted 6 months , light use . The signal went out via a audio mixer with 3 pairs of ceiling speakers , never used all at once , maybe two pair , and it just crapped out after 6 months . The fuse was n't blown , the lights still came on , it just stopped working . I had my doubts on a $ 100 unit before hand and ummm and my doubts came true . I am looking at other brands now .
 The fuse blew within minutes of use , not sure what happened . I was running an out -LRB- non-powered -RRB- from my receiver to the AMP-100 playing my exterior speakers . Within about 25-30 minutes it stopped working . At first I thought it was my new receiver but later discovered that the Amp-100 blew a fuse . I replaced the fuse , but it still did n't work . Thankful Amazon 's return policy !
 The problem lies in the cd player . If you are listening to quiet music , there is an overbearing noise from the unit , weather a bad bearing or poor design . It sounds metallic in nature . I tried two independent units and they both exhibited this metallic rubbing noise . If all you listen to is loud music , this is good for you . If you listen to classical , etc. . Stay away .
 I have had these walkie talkies -LRB- Cobra PR 165-2 VP microTALK -RRB- for a couple months now . They work fairly well . Be aware that since this is a dual band radio you need to be careful what channel you transmit on if you do n't have a license from the FCC . The manual tells which channels are FRS and which are GMRS.These radios are small and easy to carry . They work well for kids to use in a limited area.The range is closer to a half mile than the 6 miles they state . That 's normal for FRS radios from what I hear . Near the end of the range the sound cuts in and out , and is hard to understand.One problem
 I purchased these to remain in contact with friends while on a trip to Mexico . They were n't very helpful . The biggest problem with these is the charge time ; it takes 15 hours of charging for less than 8 hours of use . Reception was limited , which I suspect was related the units not the location . I will upgrade to a better set before my next vacation .
 There is an inconsistency . Either the reviews are terribly biased or my unit was not properly refurbished . The radio is potentially fantastic and worth a rating of 10 or five stars . However , the bass is absolutely unaccptable . Yesterday , I was playing the same station on my stereo and the Boston Acoustics Receptor . The difference was mind boggling . The bass on the Boston Acoustics Receptor drowned out the singer and the band . I was thinking of buying one or two more units until the bass really got on my nerves . Now , I wo n't buy another and wo n't recommend this radio to a stranger .
 I have owned for the past 2 years the 1753 Whistler . The 1773 I just purchased gives numerous false alarms , during an alarm , the unit jumps between K and KA band voice warnings , and this is in the most filtered City 2 mode . I ca n't say I recommend this unit . Although this model was more expensive than most others I have seen and used , it is not as good a performer .
 Do not purchase this piece of whistler garbage its cheap for a reason I used it for 1 year long distance and regular city driving , I can visual see the cops before it goes off lots of false alert but very few true alerts your better off steering clear of whistler products period .
 This antenna does only work with old school Sirius devices . All Sirius XM devices use a different voltage that the one supported by this antenna . Buy the Pixel PRO-600 instead .
 Well ... I have bought many items from ebay ... never had a problem ... I bought stuff thru Amazon ... never had a problem . . However , this time I had a big problem . Before I ordered the product -LRB- s -RRB- I made sure the information I was crossmatching it with was 100 % correct such as the phone brand , serial number , type , etc. . I took my time , it probably took me between 45 minutes to an hour to complete my order.To my surprise when the order I was so eagerly expecting arrived it was ALL WRONG !! . . The charger did not fit my phone , , the pencils were not the right size , etc. . the only item I can use was the usb to AC connector . . If I ever need it , the only reason I ordered it was because it was the only way of getting the `` right '' charger for my phone.So , the aftermath ... I am left with 2 items I have absolutely no use for , and 1 item I might use once a year if lucky.Why did n't I say anything before this survey ? ... simple , I paid very little for the items , I probably paid more for the shipping and handling ... oh wait . . That 's right , that 's how they make their money is n't it ? . . Unfortunately If I can not claim my money back for shipping because technically the items were shipped , as far as the items go , well , I probably spend more money and time than what I initially invested . . Including this survey ... I am already investing time as it is ... there you have it . . you asked
 I 've had horrible reception with this antenna . I 've tried all the tricks to get it to tune in to local stations and it only received maybe 2 of them . I decided to try something else and bought a Terk HDTVa antenna -LRB- also off amazon -RRB- instead , and I have to say it is amazing . night and day difference .
 Not picking up signals consistantly.TV Frequently goes into ` Signal Not Found ' mode.My Neighbor has $ 15 UHF Antenna from GE -LRB- i think -RRB- which works much better in consistency and signal quality .
 Beware , although this is advertised an an indoor/outdoor antenna , it is not . It is INDOOR ONLY . So I ended up returning the item and by the time I paid the shipping BOTH directions , I was within $ 15 of what the antenna cost !!! DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU NEED AN OUTDOOR ANTENNA
 This Antenna works better as a non powered antenna then a powered . I had to return mine after a few times moving it around the crimp on the wire gave out and it feel apart . there are better cheaper Antenna you are not getting what you are paying for .
 Possible that I just ask too much but this worked very poorly for me . I live in West St.Louis County and I never did get decent reception of regular TV so I used basic cable . I just got an HDTV and do have an up-converting DVD player -LRB- great picture -RRB- hooked in my excisting cable -LRB- decent picture -RRB- and before I went to a fancy satelite I thought I would try this Antenna . First it arrived with a minor flaw in that the plastic case was not glued well and there was a small gap in the wing , not a big deal but a flaw . It 's possible should I try to return it this would/could be construed as that I had dropped it . I guess I 'm some distance from the tower -LRB- between 10 and 15 miles -RRB- and although I could pick up the local channels , the only one that had a decent picture was the PBS Channel . So for all intents and purpose this was just a waste of $ 40 for me . I guess if one is closer to the broadcast tower but for where I place this antenna it just do n't work `` well '' for me . In general all I can say is that the picture was poor so the review is poor so I guess when they install the Satelite I 'll just buck up the extra $ 5 for my local channels . From other reviewers it seems like it works if you are closer to the towers but from my point of view , or reception it 's rates only 2 stars tops .
 unable to get any clear signal my apt faces south and near the windows . Antenna totally ineffective
 This antenna may work for some people , but for me it was another regrettable purchase . The assembly is fairly easy , but the results proved a letdown . I bought the Terk in hopes it would work perfectly with the Samsung DTB-H260F set top box I am using to bring in free OTA digital and HD stations . But I tried two different positions with the Terk and its 10db amp was only able to bring in three or four local DT stations at best . Analog reception proved even worse . When I took off the Terk and replaced it with a coventionally-designed , less expensive indoor antenna with a 45db amp in those same positions , the difference in performance was amazing ... I could get between 12 and 15 DT channels . In conclusion , my advice is to avoid the hype about unusual antenna design and go for maximum decibel amplification . It 's that extra power that made the difference for me . Sorry Terk ...
 The antenna pictured is made by Winegard -LRB- model number SS-3000 -RRB- that is normally sold everywhere on the internet for substantially less . So you are paying a lot more for the same antenna with a TERK name on it , it appears .
 I bought this antenna based on good reviews here , but I really found out it works even worse than inserting a piece of wire to the coaxial jack of my TV . Returned promptly , but had to pay round trip shipping fees . Think twice before buying it .
 I bought a set of these for my kids for Christmas . They were so excited when they opened them ... that I had to try and get another set when the first did n't work ... and then ANOTHER set after that . This THIRD set worked so-so for a day but the battery life was short . We recharged them once and used them again then when the batteries died again they were put aside . A couple months later the kids wanted to use them again but one of the batteries would n't charge . I called customer service where I was rudely told that I needed to buy a new battery from them for $ 17 and `` that 's why we sell them '' , uh-huh , that 's what I figured ! Even after speaking to a supervisor I was told there was no way they would replace the battery that I needed to either send them in under warranty for $ 7 or buy the $ 17 battery . Funny one battery still works fine and the other does n't but they claim the battery is n't faulty . Whatever happened to good customer service and manners ? A sad lesson for my kids .
 They worked well for a few months and now the sound does not come out of either one . Customer service has not been called yet to figure out the problem .
 The battery is the problem . I wish I just stayed with conventional walkie-talkies for my sons . Stay away from this product until they fix the problem .
 Do n't waste your money on these unless you have an old computer . They will not fit over the keys on newer models .
 we should be very much thankful for providing this type of shopping and making the life still more pleasent then before .
 im usually a fan of sony walkmans , , , this one had the potential for greatness , but the design is sooo flawed , that the clip often comes off , sending the walkman flying and the batteries fly out . often times , when i pull the walkman out of my bag , the battery case has opened , and the batteries are out of the walkman , forcing me to reset my 10 preset stations . might seem trivial , but having had to reset the 10 stations probably 50 times in the few months ive owne the walkman , gets really annoying . good news is -- given as many times as the clip has come undone sending the walkman flying -- it takes a licking and keeps on ticking
 I just purchased the SRF-M75PM and have had the same problem as everyone else with the belt clip coming off . I was jogging and the clip separated and the Walkman hit the pavement!As far as the unit as a radio is is awesome . Especially with the mega bass and pulse monitor.So if you run or jog , do n't buy this unit.I called Sony and they have no fix for the problem . This Walkman is going back to the store .
 Yes , I had to tape my battery hatch shut too . Even then the hatch jiggled the batteries , turning it off and restting the time etc. . I had high hopes for the design but the grip put my fingers over buttons that I kept accidentally pressing during runs .
 Had problems with the clip coming unattached from the unit . FM reception is mediocre , although probably on par with most walkman type devices of its class . Perhaps related to my unit in particular , but the socket connection became loose , making it possible to hear through only one channel .
 This product is not typical of Sony quality . I ca n't believe that Sony can sell this product with a straight face . The problem is when you drop this walkman while running or excercising the batteries fly out and you lose all your preset stations . The clasp that holds the batteries in the radio is flimsy and not designed to sustain an average drop . The old Sony design use to have a heavy duty screw that locked the batteries in the walkman and you can drop it all day long without your batteries flying all over the place and losing your preset stations.Why did Sony re-design something that was already great ? There are many better Sports Walkmans out there . Do n't buy this one .
 The flimsy belt clip does not work properly . It pops off continuously . My first time using this walkman while on a run , it popped off of my side three times and dropped to the floor . Currently this is worthless for the sports enthusiast .
 These batteries last approx 1 hr which is the same recording time from the originals plus these are considerably larger
 Purchased two of this batteries in September of 2007 . They worked fine for a while . Stored them fully charged for about 3 months . When i tried to use them again both batteries had fully discharged , after charging them they each ran for about one minute each and died . Tried to recharge them but they would n't hold a charge no matter how many times or how long i put them on the charger . By comparison the original battery from canon only lost about one quarter of its charge in three months and is working the same as new . DO N'T BUY THIS PRODUCT , they are unreliable . You would n't want to miss videotaping an important event due to battery failure .
 I was unable to use product because apparently the adaptor did not fit my laptop , even though I had the right spec . Shipping was expensive so i did nt return product .

The connector does not fit . I had to find another connector that would fit tightly into my computer and splice it onto the Adapter so I could use it .
 Not an exact fit for my Acer laptop . I have to press it in hard to keep it charged . :-LRB- U get what you pay for
 The worst charger I have ever had . Was getting heated up everytime ... and finally blew up one fine day ... I will never recommend this to anyone ...
 This piece of $ # ! t NEVER worked a SINGLE time . They would n't let me return it , and I 'm surprised these guys are even in business . Horrible , Horrible , non working product .
 Bought in May 2000 -LRB- same month produced -RRB- - used 3 months , then went away for year . Returned in Oct. of 2001 . In December G3 card failed after only 6 months of use on a $ 1600 + set . Card is about $ 400 plus labor of about $ 300 . Quite a bill for a $ 1600 TV set used 6 months . When working liked picture quality , ease of operation , and overall look for average size family . Really disappointed in Sony - thought we were buying quality product that would last for years .
 I only had this TV for 8 months , when the picture went on me . I had spent the extra $ 300 to have in home service , but it was too broke to be repaired in home . It took the repair shop THREE weeks to fix it . Besides the fact that I only had the TV for 7 months , according to the nameplate data it was only 9 months old .
 SPEAKER FAILURES
 This camera comes with no instructions or warranty information . The zoom feature does n't exist as indicated in the technical data and editorial reviews . It does n't even seem to be the camera advertised , but then who knows for sure when no written information is included .
 Installed this and two new drives and was quite happy with the new disk space available . However after a while I noticed that my system speed had been reduced considerably . After troubleshooting and removing the card from my system , everything was back up to speed . It works but at a price .
 Well I bought this PSU long time ago but I forget to write a reviewThis PSU came DOA at the same time that mobo , both I purchased here on AmazonThe PSU never turn on , so I cant ' talk so much about it OCZ has good quality on PSU 's but sometimes the quality it 's just relativeBut thanks to the Customer Supoort of Amazon they help me , so thanks so much to Amazon Support 1000/10

 Sadly this product performs admirably with supplying power but where it fails is its stealth . Check out OCZs forums for many complaints about it being quite loud . Apparently they 've kind of messed with all their customers and created an extremely loud product that is difficult to return to most e-tailers . FYI some retailers have newer revisions of these units that are much quieter but the UPCs are exactly the same so good luck finding one . Buy it amazon or B&M ; or better yet , just stay away .
 Below is a review of this product : OCZ StealthXStream 600 Watt Power Supply . Amazon may display this review on the page of another version of this product , for which this review may not apply . After reading this review , please click on the link so that you can be assured that the product this review applies to is the same one you thought it was for . -------------------------------------------------- I bought this power supply unit -LRB- PSU -RRB- on July 19 , 2007 for $ 94.99 from Micro Center in Westbury , New York four days after I bought all of the other parts I used to assemble my own computer . It came with a 36 months -LRB- 3 years -RRB- manufacturer 's warranty . So , of course , it chose to die on February 24 , 2011 , which is 43 months -LRB- 3 years 7 months -RRB- later . It 's like OCZ manufactured it to last just long enough for the warranty to expire : - -RRB- Some other reviewers here have had their PSUs die in 10 months , 8 months , 2-3 months , or even 2 weeks ! So it looks like I was actually lucky that mine lasted as long as it did . Still , I 've owned computers since 1992/1993 , and none of the PSUs in them have ever died . This OCZ unit was the first to die . So , that alone , does n't rate it very high in my book , in spite of it lasting longer than others have reported.The new PSU I just bought from NewEgg is a Sigma Focus SP700B 700W -LRB- 800W Peak -RRB- ATX12V power supply , which set me back $ 69.94 -LRB- $ 59.99 + $ 9.65 shipping -RRB- . NewEgg claims that it has a 3 years manufacturer 's warranty , though I can find no proof of that on the packaging or on the Sigma website . Of course , I 'm hoping that it lasts MANY years - a lot longer than three - so I should n't have to even worry about the warranty .
 I installed this power supply in late November , early December of 2009 . In August of 2010 it completely died on me.My PC setup includes a Radeon 4870 , 4 fans , 4 HDs , and a DVD drive . I would not recommend buying the SXS600 if you have a similar GPU because I 'm pretty certain that 's what killed it . Fortunately , there 's an excellent selection of new cards that are n't as power hungry as the 4870 . Any of the 5XXX series should be fine -LRB- or earlier cards , certainly ! -RRB- Anyway , that being said it 's a decent PSU with everything you 'd want for connecting peripherals , but it 's something of a gamble from what I can tell . There 's lots of reports of these power supplies dying , so if you can afford a better one by all means please do so.The saving grace in all this is OCZ received my RMA 'd power supply and dropped another in the mail the same day , so kudos for excellent customer service and a very generous warranty .
 Pretty good PSU , cables are shorter than my previous GameXstream , which is good thing for me because it was really hard to fit those cable on my Antec P180 . so far it works pretty goodUpdate

 I bought one of these players two years ago . Within two months -LRB- fortunately during the warranty period -RRB- , the lens knocked itself out of alignment , keeping the player from even seeking to the beginning of the disc . The Sony repair technician replaced the lens assembly , and all was well for about 6 months , after which the player developed a problem in which it would abort playback , clear memory , and reset the player . This happens when the player moves at all suddenly - not good at all for walking , and I would n't even CONSIDER jogging with it . Great sound , average battery life , almost unrivaled skip protection , but little to no reliablity in my case .
 I love Mac OS X , but I 've found my ibooks not worth the hassle and sacrifice I 've had to make to keep using them . On 3 ibooks in 2 years , I have had 6 logic board failures -LRB- the computer crashes and will not boot , and repair takes weeks -RRB- , two broken CD drives , and I have had Apple twice break my computer -LRB- they offer to re-repair it but it takes weeks usually , since they tend to be out of parts every time I get something repaired -RRB- . I 've called Apple a million times but they refuse to replace the computer or offer any type of refund . As nice as ibooks are when they work , theyre not worth $ 1000 plus frequent repair and many weeks a year without a computer . I recommend a Dell or something until Apple gets its act together .
 I recenlty purchase the iBook out of the curiousity of Apple since I read a lot of reviews about how great the machinee is . But after I tried out , I have to say it is not that great.The OS X claims that it is unix base and seldom crashes . But when I use some Java based chatrooms , it does crash . It also crashes when multiple applications are used . it maybe the small rams that comes with it . -LRB- 256MB -RRB- . The dock is good , but it gets too complicated when you have a lot of windows open . and they stay there if you do n't close them . It gets kind of confusing sometimes.For the hardware , it is a beautiful machine . But there seems to be missing a microphone plug . I happened to need a webcam . But it is hard to find compatible webcams for mac . Most compatible ones are expensive , of course . It seems like a lot of mac related products are more expensive than windows products . So this will not be a low cost machine to maintain . I was pretty frustrated with the search for a compatible webcam . I really do n't wan na think about other peripherals I want to buy in the future.Maybe it will gget better when Mac is more popular . But for now , it is probably better to wait for a bit longer .
 Bought an ibook and when i cleaned the screen with plain water and damp rag it left many small white spots.Calling them was terrible . Ca n't get an RMA and it 's only 2 weeks old .
 With all the hoopla surrounding the Ipod , I somehow managed to delude myself into buying this piece of junk a year ago . Here are my observations :1 . Apple will forever remain a niche producer of computers simply because they have this obnoxious habit of gouging cutomers . Every Apple accessory is almost 30-40 % more expensive and one generation behind . Case in point being the combo drives -LRB- optimistically called ` super ' -RRB- and the terrible godawful screen .2 . The Base Station -LRB- or the router -RRB- has a much shorter range than my Belkin 54Mbps G router and costs 3 times as much .3 . There is a reason why most Apple owners -LRB- including myself -RRB- will fervently advise you to get extended Apple Care - You will most definitely need it . Most Dell lappy owners -LRB- and I have owned/used 7 laptops extensively - over 3 months each -RRB- and none have needed the kind of attention this guy needs - not even close . Local apple repair service is expensive .4 . OS X is a work of art - and the UNIX spine is a joy to behold . It is absolutely the best operating system I have ever used - hands down . I come from a old school UNIX background - and using ls and ps is a way of life . The only problem is that I am unable to enjoy this brilliant OS with such a crummy screen and underperforming rickety hardware . I run a server farm and compile various linux distros regualarly - compared to any consumer linux version , OSX is absolutely magnificient . XP can not compare .5 . Speedwise , the only comparable advantage Macintoshes enjoy is for video . If someone has very little use for advanced rendering capabilities , one should seriously reconsider buying this machine .6 . So far , I have called Apple Service 7 times in the past 14 months . For the record , I currently own 3 laptops -LRB- Toshiba M2 and a Dell 700M - all bought in the past year -RRB- - and I have not called customer support at all . Come to think of it , these 7 times are more than all my previous support calls combined .7 . Most Mac Ibooks are extremely picky about the type of RAM they use . Mac owners like to call this ` bad RAM ' - but without going into technical details - this smacks of gross negligence in Apple 's design . This is akin to a car company making a car that runs on only premium gasoline .8 . No free Office suite will ever come close to Microsoft Office , and the Macintosh platform is no exception . Mac Office is very nice , and there are zero compatibility issues.For those who are still interested in this machine -LRB- and OS X -RRB- , I would recommend the dell 700M -LRB- with win pro SP2 and Antivirus -RRB- . Much better screen , responsive keyboard , standard hardware and literally thousands of applications . If you are still interested in the Apple platform , the new Powerbooks should be given serious consideration .
 Let me qualify this review by making it clear that I am not a Mac user . My only experience with Mac 's is a few mins spent each time I visit Apple store . I am writing this for those thinking of a switch from XP to Mac . I know it will be unpopular with Mac fans but hope it helps you XP users make the right decision.iBook pro 's ,1 . It looks sleek , smooth and sexy . Nothing in PC world is this well designed .2 . No weekly patches coming from Redmond to apply .3 . No anti-virus or anti-spyware needed -LRB- ? -RRB- 4 . Longer battery life than PC laptops but not by much .5 . Ca n't really think of anything else other than the different and coolness factor.Con 's ,1 . Screen , screen , screen . The 12 '' pbook/ibook just look awful with Mac OS X 's anti-aliased fonts . XP 's Cleartype seems really really clear in comparison . -LRB- Search for `` Quartz Extreme '' for more details on Apple 's website -RRB- 2 . Need to spend $ 160 + to put in 1GB RAM -LRB- in contrast XP runs similarly fast on just 512MB , about $ 30 expense for an extra 256MB stick -RRB- .3 . All accessories are extremely high priced . How about $ 60 for a mouse ? 4 . No upgrades , everything except RAM slot is very hard to reach . 2 dozen mini-screws before you reach hard disk ! 5 . Need to buy new softwares , I have almost everything needed for XP already .6 . Non-scrolling & single button touchpad .7 . Paying atleast 30 % premium compared to similar hardware with Wintel laptops .8 . Stuck with propreitary things Apple does , no innovation or competetion like in PC world .9 . Need to buy Apple 's extended warranty because very few people can open or repair it . And laptops ca n't be fixed at home unlike desktops .10 . Lots of softwares and devices just do n't work on Mac . >> What good is a laptop that would give you strain with its tiny fancy fonts ? >> What good is wasting your hard earned money for nothing special ? >> What good is a fancy laptop if it can run only propreitary software from Apple and very little else?In short , do n't fall for that iPod `` halo effect '' that Wall Street analysts are talkin about . The iBook/Powerbook look very good but are no good for most XP users , unlike iPod . XP itself is very stable by now , just needs lots of patches/updates . Do n't waste your time & money on this .
 Apple makes some of the best computers in the world . Many years ago this was one of them . Today it is an outdated piece of plastic . I bought this computer about four years ago and it was low-end then . I just replaced it because it crawled like a slug . I guess in order to have a `` low priced '' computer Apple figures it can just keep selling it 's most out of date systems until people catch on . Oh well , I recognize that like any big company they are in this for the money.The only plus I can give it is size . If you do n't want to use a computer and you need to keep it in a small drawer , then this may be what you are looking for .
 I took these new headphones on a cross country trip this week . Here 's the results :1 -RRB- There is no noise cancelling to speak of -LRB- aircraft engine noise was exactly the same with or without the headphones on -RRB- .2 -RRB- Volume level was so low I had to stop watching the DVD because I could n't hear the sound loudly enough .3 -RRB- When I was on the ground I switched to my MP-3 player and again the volume was very low -LRB- I took off the extension cord connector which helped slightly -RRB- and worse yet the sound quality was tinny , almost no base at all.There is nothing to recommend purchasing these headphones . I am frantically looking for my receipt so I can try to return them as quickly as possible .
 I only bought these because my cat chewed on my sony fontopia headphones and I was low on cash , and these were on sale for $ 25 . I figured they hold me over for a week or two . A minute into the first song I regretted buying them . First of all , they 're ugly as all hell . The only reason i got them is because they said they were noise cancelling and the original price was $ 70 . The noise cancelling consists of a distracting static frequency , and there is no bass whatsoever . These are honestly terrible headphones . I should have gotten $ 15 sony earbuds , i would have been much happier .
 They hurt the top of your ears after an hour ... sound quality is not anything special ...
 These headphones do not stay on your ears . Maybe if they were like the other wrap arounds.A good idea but more of a hinderance of keeping them on the ears .
 After reading what this headphones could do , I was excited and could n't wait to get one for myself . It turns out to be just another cheezy headphones . The quality is horrible , and it 's not comfortable as it claims to be . Bottom line , `` Save your money ! ''
 I thought this was going to be a great tool to have so I could watch and work . I put my iPod in the case and then the iPod started making this crunching sound like an old hard drive , and the screen went black and it never turned back on . I emailed the company and they said they would refund my money if it was still in the packaging . A -RRB- Of course is was n't in the packaging !! B -RRB- The $ 17 I paid for the stupid case was not what I was worried about ! It was the several hundred I had paid for my iPod.DONOTBUY !!!!
 There are two catches you need to be aware of with this product . First , the map is City Navigator 2008 , which was produced somewhere mid 2007 , it is not up to date and produces some funky auto routes . No problem , if you navigate through Garmin 's difficult web , you can get a 2009 update free within a week or so . The second catch is that both the old and the new updated maps are City Navigator , intended for the older GPS models , and not City Navigator NT which is the latest compressed software . The maps are the same , but use a lot more memory .
 Most of the time it wont turn on or when it does turn on the film u are playin either stops/crashes after an amount of time or the player turns its self off.This piece has a horrible sound in DivX , MP3 and CD audio.For more jump to UK site -LRB- hope they wo n't change link -RRB- . http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000A03LU/ref=pd_rhf_p_1/026-3649119-7157254
 I bought 2 of these cables and they 've both totally crapped out on me . I used one for my Xbox 360 and the other for my Motorola DVR -LRB- Comcast cable -RRB- . I connected them to my Samsung 50 '' Plasma TV . In both cases , they cause intermittent audio and video problems . When there is a problem , the sound disappears and the screen shows thousands of pink pixels . Sometimes the screen will have pink pixelated lines running across it horizontally . Recently , the entire picture goes black and my TV says , `` Searching for signal ... `` I know it is the cables that are at fault because I bought a new cable for $ 15 and it works fine . Cables from places like Best Buy are a rip-off at $ 40 for a 6-ft cable , which is why I wanted to get the cheapest thing out there . I bought these cables for something like $ 1.86 each , which I initially thought was a great deal . Not so . I would not buy these again , as they are worthless.I originally rated this item with 2 stars because I thought only one of the two cables I purchased was a dud . It turns out , they are both worthless . If I could change my rating to 1 star , I would .
 This cheap HDMI cable seemed like a great deal , but do n't be fooled by the low price and `` Full 1080p '' description . I tried this cable on both my Xbox 360 and PS3 , the picture quality was bad on both , it skips and creates lines going up the screen when I tried to watch a movie , and it makes games and Blu-rays look very washed out and fuzzy . The cable itself is also made very cheaply and feels flimsy . While it 's true some cheaper HDMI cables are just as good as the $ 50 ones , please do n't make the same mistake I did , if you buy this cable you will not even be close to getting the full experience of what your HD devices are capable of .
 you get what you pay for on this one . my hdtv looked better with my old cables . i do not recommend this product . standard definition looks terrible by the way . just looks ok with my blu-ray player . i was not impressed .
 Hooked myPlayStation 3 80GBup to mySamsung LN40A650 40-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV with RED Touch of Colorand the screen flickered really bad while playingCall of Duty
 this is unbelievable , i got this HDMI cable only for 1 month and a half and it does not work anymore . During the time that it did work , it often black out at times ! i DO NOT recommend this to anyone , this is a unreliable cable !
 I 'll start by saying I 'm usually skeptical about name brand products being all that much better than cheaper generics . I 've recently learned that while that holds true with some items , it 's not true with HDMI cables -LRB- to an extent , Monster cables for $ 100 wo n't be much if any better than a $ 20 cable -RRB- . But this is my second order of bottom of the barrel cheap cables and I 'm embarrased to say I got burned AGAIN -LRB- the others were from a different company -RRB- . These cables seem to work fine connecting my 1080i DirectTV receiver to my 60 '' plasma , but when connecting my plasma to the PS3 with full 1080p I got a random flicker every 5 seconds or so.My conclusion is this
 After two years of using component cables for my Xbox 360 , and a year of using a Monster HDMI cable for my PS3 , I decided that the difference in quality between the two was noticable enough for me to go out and buy another HDMI cable for my Xbox . After shopping around , and seeing the price and reviews for this cable , I bought it , and in all honesty , this cable is much worse than even my component cables . I tried a few different movies , and a few different games , all to no avail . Characters in my games are choppy , and pixelated , and all of the movies , even in HD quality are blurry . I decided to switch the two cables to see if it was just my Xbox , and immediately noticed the difference . This is a poor cable and I would not reccomend it to anyone who cares about the quality of the graphics on their screen .
 I 'm really ticked off about this cable ! I bought it in November . And now on August 1st it stopped working today . I took the laptop downstairs to another HDMI cable and it worked fine . This Cable on 2 different tvs did not work all of the sudden . I connected a Blue-Ray today and the connection was going in and out . I thought it was my wireless connection until I realized the video out to the tv was not working on the laptop where an internet connection was not necessary . No warranty.It does n't matter if it 's a good deal if it does n't even last a year ! I have HDMI cables that have been connected from receivers , etc. to the tvs for over 5 years ! I wo n't buy from here again ! .
 This HDMI cable occasionally crackles . If the connection is jostled , the noise goes away but it works itself loose again . Our other cable did n't have this problem with the same DVD player and so I 'm blaming it on the cable .
 Do n't let the cheap price mislead you ! I 've ordered this cable the other day and one of the cable 's tip came broken ! Believe me , you 're better off with a name brand cable that goes with whatever system you 're buying it for !
 Do not waste your money on this HDMI cord , one day it just stopped showing the picture . It is poor quality and will break on you .
 This cable worked well on my PS3 for a total of about 30 minutes before the picture became jumpy and skipped . Tried games , DVD 's and Blu-rays all with the same result . Completely useless .
 Not sure why it did not work for my Samsung HDTV and Mac book pro hook up . However , it did work for my Sony HDTV and regular HDMI hook up . Not too happy because I have another better quality HDMI cable that works for both set ups . Sticking to the better cable .
 Cable works with some combinations of devices but does n't work at all with others . Works on one TV with my Xbox , another it works with the computer but not the Xbox while one of my other cables works flawlessly . I 'll be buying a slightly better cable next and trashing this one .
 after hooking it up the connection produced blue flickering spotsi ended up going to costco paid a little more but the reception was perfecti threw the sanoxy outi guess you get what you pay for
 I got this for my Apple TV1080P . It works just fine on my older 720P Apple TV , but cuts in and out on the 1080 ... spend the extra couple bucks and get a better cable . Because I believed my cable to be capable of full 1080P , I brought my Apple TV back to the store ... I should have known better
 Got two of these cables for my Samsung 52A650 television . The HDMI cable from my cable DVR works great 99 % of the time -- a couple glitches here and there , so I may replace it in the future.The HDMI cable from my Blu-Ray player to the TV had problems from the beginning . Would be watching about 30 minutes , then * poof * just static and snow on the screen . Bumped the cable a couple times and it would be ok ... until the next time . That one finally went into the garbage and I replaced it with at $ 29 cable from Philips , which works flawlessly.At the price , it 's an ok deal , but buy at least two for each device you plan to hook up as it 's likely one of them will be defective .
 Unsure how a cable can stop working after 3 days but this one did . Wasted a bunch of my time figuring out what went wrong only to find it was the new cable . Total junk .
 Bought two of these HDMI cables and took one to the cabin to hook up dvd player to tv . The cable did n't work . Do n't know if the other one works . I will check when I get home . So far looks like you get what you pay for .
 Bought it to use with PS3 but it didnt work -LRB- you could hear no audio when plugged in -RRB- . It only cost a few dollars so I didnt bother me that much , but it was part of a gift for someone else so I did feel bad that I bought it in the first place .
 This cable worked for 2 days , then quit . Save yourself the hassle and buy a better quality cable the first time . It seems that you get what you pay for ; do n't go cheap !
 It was n't what the picture advertised and did n't fit my tv . I would 've called and complained then I realized it was a dollar what could it hurt .
 I bought 4 of theses , once connected quality was good and all worked well , after only disconnecting once and reinstalling the continuity in the cable all broke they fail even with the smallest bend ! all four have now become u/s
 These are the worst cables I have ever bought . I have a 63 inch plasma TV and the picture is COMPLETELY CHOPPY ! Ruins the entire point of having a big TV . DO NOT BUY THESE CABLES !
 It may have been a fluke , but when I got this cable I hooked it up to my TV and my PS3 , set everything correctly , but no HD . We tested it out several times , even using a different TV and a different PS3 and an Xbox 360 . Cable just did n't work . I 'd recommend dropping a few dollars extra and just picking up a better cable .
 I bought this cable just so I would n't have to change out my HDMI cable from my xbox to my ps3 . The cable will work `` as long as you make sure you do n't play in HD . '' But who wants an HD cable that does n't let you use HD . I had to play my games as if they were from the ps2 era on my HD tv . Maybe I got a bad cable but I doubt it .
 I bought 2 of these cables , one for my XBOX 360 and the other for my digital cable . I was charged for shipping and handling -LRB- `` S&H '' -RRB- on each cable , although they came in one padded envelope relatively quickly . My first complaint , therefore , is that I was charged $ 5/cable for S&H for a total of $ 10 , when the only real cost the distributor incurred was one S&H cost of $ 5 . To make matters worse , shortly after I hooked up the HDMI cable from my XBOX 360 to my new Samsung HDTV , the screen display for my 360 glitched out and I suffered the Ring of Death shortly thereafter . I bought this cable specifically because the distributor said it was 360 compatible , and I am frustrated that using it has forced a general hardware failure in my 360 ... It has caused me to suffer without my 360 for the past 3 weeks , and I expect to wait another 2 weeks for Microsoft 's repair center to fix my console and send it back to me .
 Ya these worked out well when I first got them , it went all downhill from there . My games looked good , but my blu-rays on my Toshiba were terrible , the picture was jumpy -LRB- it was jumping between the current picture and a picture 1sec ahead -RRB- and you could n't enjoy the movie at all . And on top of all that , 2 weeks later I turn on the PS3 and pictures gone , cables were fried , I 'm using the A/V cables included till my Sony brand component cables arrive
 I bought this cable thinking that at the worst I 'm wasting $ 2.50 on a potentially good cable ... and I ended up doing just that . This cable is crap . Poor audio quality and the picture was abysmal . There were wavy lines all over the picture and it had very poor clarity -LRB- where there were n't wavy lines . -RRB- Used with 40 '' Samsung
 when i got it i plugged it into my xbox and worked fine about two weeks later i went on a trip and came back and it didnt work it is just too low quality i would sugest gettin a $ 10 or $ 20 one .
 When trying to use this cable with my PS3 and my HDTV , it did not work . When using a different HDMI cable , everything worked fine , but this cable did not show up as anything.The company selling it does have a very good policy , however , and I was given back my money for the product .
 Hdmi cable defective . Cable shorted out my netgear streaming player and my Roku player . Never did hear back from seller .
 Well , quick delivery . . works . . but if you are n't using a tv with 1080 static specs will appear . So only get it if you have the right tv .
 Beware
 PS3 can not reach 1080p with this cable , everything else being equal , the same PS3/HDTV works fine with the Monster cable . Of course , the price is in no comparison anyway .
 I bought this cable for my Xbox so I can get better picture quality on my TV when playing . I received the HDMI cable fine , but when attempting to put this in the HDMI port on my Xbox , the cable would not fit because of my AV cable . Cable should be a bit thinner so both the AV cable and HDMI can fit at the same time .
 the game works ok and the kids seem to use it a lot . I had to buy a flat screen to play it on cause the old tv would n't work .
 I owned this CD-player for 2 days and then returned it . I 'm sure mine must have been a lemon , cause they can all be this bad . It took anywhere from 1 to 5 min . before it would play the first song , then after about 8 songs , the batteries went dead . So I put in a new pair , and again 8 to 12 songs later - dead batteries . . , it also would n't play all the songs on the cd.Even the sound quality was poor !
 D-Link should stick to networking products ... the moment i put batteries on this mp3 player , i knew something was really wrong with it ... sound quality was horrible , battery life was horrible , skipped all the time , even when i pressed any button , it would reset itself all the time ... i give it 1 star because i ca n't give it any less ... DO NOT BUY THIS !!! ... i returend it the next day and bought a RIO CD-MP3 player ... MUCH MUCH BETTER !!!!!
 Me and this MP3 player never seemed to hit it off . It skips everywhere -- even in the car -- so the music I 'm listening to gets interupted left and right . The battery life is horrific , the sound quality is ok , but man , what 's the point if you ca n't walk around with your portable player if it skips ? I would n't recommend this if you like to actually move around .
 This company 's customer service is the worst . I bought an MP3 player from them in June of 2002 . I 've had to send it back to them twice in 11 months for replacement and/or repairs . The last time it was `` fixed '' , it came back in worse shape than when it left.Attempts to resolve this matter have been frustrating . Phone calls are not returned , tech support seems less than concerned with customer concerns . Proceed at your own risk . Maybe you should look at a nice Panasonic or Sony . .
 I was very satisfied with the product in the beginning . I could burn my collection to about 4 CD 's , and then I could go wherever I wanted , and be able to call up any song I wanted . I was especially impressed with the T-Digit function ... That was 9 months ago . Things have since grown progressively worse . Now , I find that it does n't play MP3 CD 's anymore ... It only plays Audio CD 's now . I tried to contact the D-Link support people , and got a prompt , but unfruitful response . They told me to return it to them , and to do so by contacting the RMA department ... so i cantacted the RMA department , and recieved no response ... It 's been over a week , and still no response ! So much for customer satisfaction ... If they had created a descent product , I would n't be dissatisfied , and I would be writing this review with a seriously different tone ...
 Not only does D-Link make cheap generic imitations of real network products , but now this . Worst of all they are still in business . The earphones are extremely uncomfortable and it chewed up a 5 dollar pack of Duracell Ultras in less than 1.5 hours and it skips ! Welp , you get what you pay for ! Thank goodness for my Sony MZR-90 Minidisc with 35 hours of playback and sounds better too !
 I used it for two weeks . but now , i do n't know why , I put in a disc -LRB- Audio CD or mp3 CD -RRB- and the LCD screen shows `` NoDisc '' .
 I bought this unit at a Circuit City about two months ago , and I 'm sending it back this week . The best thing I can say about this player is that it 's cheaper than the others.The faults with the CD100 are many
 I also bought one of these ... It is cheaply made and gotexactly 1-hour of play on a fresh set of batteries . When I calledD-Link for an explanation , there answer was `` Yeah , that 's aboutwhat you 'll get '' . No wonder it is so deeply discounted , they ` retrying to pass off their mistake on you ! I took it back after severaldisappointing days .
 About 4 months ago I purchased this player since I wanted to have a mp3 player and burning the music on a cd and being able to play them as well as other cd 's was/is a very cheap and attractive alternative to what else is out there . Also the player was much cheaper itself and if it worked it would had given me 650 mb of memory on each cd for less than a dollar . Well , here is an old wisdom , if it sounds too good to be true it probably is not . That is my experience with this player . It skips more than my first cd-walkman I had purchased in 1986 ! This is a sad story because I wish I could tell you more about its sound quality , but I ca n't because all I had was skip , skip , skip and guess what a little more skip even with original cd 's . Besides the fact that it did not play , one could see the quality of technology used for this player from its very primitive LCD display . I returned the product within a week and purchased a Nomad II MG -LRB- I have a review of it too -RRB- . The final word is , if you can wait a little longer for mp3 to be included in a portable way into your daily life , do so ; but if you `` need '' want it right away , stay away from this good looking but low quality player that does not play .
 Ordered this charger and was told it was 1 month on backorder . Then , I never received it .
 My 9-year old grandson is really into outdoor adventuring , so I looked long and hard to select some gear for him for Christmas . I was a bit disppointed by the general look of the kit , but the actual gear looked okay . BUT -- the strap that holds the kit onto a belt broke the very first time he tried to put it on ! He was so disappointed to not be able to use his new gift right away . I took the case home and re-sewed the strap -- but was not at all happy to have to do so ! Since then he 's taken his kit with him to his outdoor club and enjoyed using it .
 They are n't what I expected . Looks they are made kinda cheesy.Expected a little better quality . Would not recommend to buy .
 The binoculars didnt work for myself well or the kids . Optics in the lower price range rarely do . The flashlight sucks . The whistle is cheap compared to the orange safety ones you can find in camping supply stores for a few bucks . The compass comes with no instruction valuable to preteen age kids . I can not find anything nice to say about this kit . Buy your kid something else . Maybe one nice item , with a book on how to use it .
 Poor quality product . Great idea - my daughter was super-excited to get this one , but flash light broke right away , binoculars are not strong at all , thermometer on the whistle does not reflect outside temp-re properly . Very disappointing purchase .
 Bought these as they looked good and the one previous review was positive . I bought two sets for my sons -LRB- ages 9 and 11 -RRB- , primarily because I wanted binoculars , everything else was bonus . At twenty bucks my expectations were n't very high but I did hope for something functional and useful for their age group . The compass and flashlight are a bit cheap but OK , hence the single-star rating . The binoculars are a complete waste of time for kids of this age ! The items is rated by the manufacturer for ages 7 + . I think that a more reasonable age rating for the binoculars would be up to seven . The level of magnification was almost imperceptible . If you want toy binoculars for your little kids then these are the ones but do n't think your older kids are going to have a great time hunting or bird watching with them because they are n't . This was my first Amazon purchase and I will be much more careful in future and will only by if I know exactly what I am getting .

 I would not recommend this product to anyone - it simply does not work - a waste of money . When I asked the company for a refund - they refused without reason !
 I have the origanal HP black ink cartridge never been refilled also the color I purchased from you , the color refill kit it works fine . the black took in the ink as did the color cartriage , same amount added to both . But the black will only print real light then none at all . refilled again but was full ! have to take it out and shake it for it to print dark but that only last about 2 pages!I feel I was ripped off!They said it would work great with the origanal HP cartriages Not So !
 Foremost , I like the idea a lot and having been using it frequently about a year -LRB- been refilling my own cartridges for 8 years -RRB- . However , the results are inconsistent - sometimes it fills completely and other times it does not -LRB- even after repeatedly pressing the pump -RRB- . My first choice is to try this drip system and let it sit for 2 hours . But I now always check the handy calibrations on the tank . When it does NOT fill , I revert to the manual syringe -LRB- yes , messy -RRB- filling . The Dataproducts system is quick , but not consistent .
 I used this to refill an HP brand cartridge . It worked fine for awhile , but after a few days , my printer stopped working -- showed as being offline . After unplugging it for several hours and rebooting my system , it printed exactly one page and stopped working again . I bought another new HP cartridge and everything was fine again once I installed it . The clerk at Staples told me horror stories about how bad these refill kits are , but I took those with a grain of salt . When this cartridge is empty , I will try again .
 I have purchased many ink refills and this one turned out to be very disappointing . The ink dries up from the cartridge very quickly and it does n't print full letters . It was a total waste of my money .

 Straight out of the box I could not play any record on this turntable without the record grinding at the base of the deck on every rotation . It seems like mine has the same flaw as another reviewer 's , which is that the silver base of the unit is not attached firmly enough to hold . I 've tried raising the platter with a piece of felt , which prevents the record from hitting the deck , but then the pitch is still a bit unstable and wobbly on many records . I am sure this could have been prevented if Numark had used some screws instead of glue to attach the parts of the deck to one another.However , I am still in doubt whether I am going to return it because I like the overall design and features so much . Hence , two stars instead of one . Maybe I am going to try fixing it with some super glue ... if anyone with the same problem has tried this , I would love to hear in the comments whether your attempt has failed or succeeded .
 The turntable feels cheap and flimsy , especially the stylus . It would not play large LPs properly because of uneven platter . Tried to have Numark/Ion stand by their warranty , but they would not respond to email in a timely manner or respond by phone . If you google Numark support , it seems many people have this problem . I will not purchase another Numark or Ion product , and I strongly encourage you not to do so either . Try the Vestax Handy Trax portable turntable instead .
 I want to love this little Numie , I really , REALLY do . It fits perfectly in a record crate , and has an overall good feel to it . It can run for quite a long time off of batteries , which is neat . And somehow , it manages to get HUGE sound out of its little built-in speaker . It 's held up very well over the past 80 or so hours of usage , even after being toted around and tossed about.HOWEVER , however , as others have mentioned , there is a very noticeable audio quality difficiency with certain frequencies . It 's apparent when using the built-in speaker , and totally overwhelming when using headphones or recording -LRB- and do n't worry , I tried all the outputs , at all different levels with types of equipment -RRB- . I have n't taken the plunge and replaced the stylus -LRB- or even the whole cartridge -RRB- , because that 'd be about 40 % of the cost of the entire unit right there . If I knew for sure that that 'd solve the problem , though , I 'd go for it!Another odd quirk is trying to play records with the unit plugged in and batteries installed . It seems like the RPMs are more apt to drop when in this configuration . It 's absolutely not a dealbreaker , as it 's super-easy to pop out the batteries when you 're not using them , but I thought I 'd mention it for anyone else experiencing the same issue . I get pitch-perfect speed when using just the AC adapter - or - just batteries.Ah , Numark PT01 ... you 're such a neat , neat record player . Why ca n't you just sound a little better !??
 One of my greatest mistakes that I made recently is to purchase NUMARK PT01 item . I have few hundred of LP , EP and SP records so that I really wanted to convert into digital files for all of them and pt01 was so fascinating for me.Upon purchasing , I realized that turntable revolution speed is completely inconsistent especially for 33 rpm LP . I tried to switch with a couple of electric power however the problem does not resolved.Lastly , I realized that the turntable matrass is not attached properly on the turntable so that I demounted and attached very carefully with both-sided tape , which makes the problem a little bit resolved , however basically the problem still makes me crazy.I have contacted manufacturer but I do not expect any of positive reply from them since , as longas I understand , the service of NUMARk is well know to be horrible.This morning , I checked about the detail specification of PT01 and realized that the maker does not mention any of `` wow and flutter '' term on the specification . As well known , `` wow and flutter '' is the critical specification which guarantee the consistency of the turntable.Usually , turntable makers basically guarantee the consistency of the turntable speed based on the wow and flutter spec. , which I thought it is just the common sense , but it unfortunately was not common sense to the NUMARK !! . . One of my questions is how NUMARK still selling this item ??? I do not care NUMARK 's company policy and philosophy because I will never buy any item of NUMARK in my while life !! Bye , Numark !!!
 if your looking at this to buy to play on your house stereo you will probably be disappointed this is a portable player and should be used as such . it has a very tinny sound no depth at all do not be cheap when it comes to purchasing a record player
 On nearly the second anniversary of receiving this player , the table stopped spinning . I called Numark and since it was out of warranty there was nothing they could do for me . The player was awesome . It one of my favorite belongings . The sound was pretty good for a built-in speaker . None of my records were damaged by the player , and the speed never seemed to waver . I gave it one star for every year of enjoyment I got . I 'll be buying a crosley next , and if that one craps out I would probably buy another Numark . I just wish it had n't have broken in the first place .
 I 'd always heard great things about numark products , so I decided to roll the dice on the PT01 , a big mistake . The good , is that it is a light weight truly portable turntable . The built in speaker provides pretty good sound for being a small speaker . Why the 1 star ? b/c the player is poorly constructed . The shiny top piece is poorly glued on , and pops up rubbing against the record while its playing . This causes the record to wobble and creates a very poor sound . I had to put a weight on the player to keep the piece from popping up in order for it to play properly . Little to say I will be staying away from numark products , and I highly recommend that anyone in the market for a player such as this look else where .
 The large silver colored base around the platter would NOT stay in place . It is only held down by a sticky material underneath it . The one I purchased was raised up just behind the platter and rubbed on the record . Very poor quality construction and no final inspection at the factory . Good luck if you buy one . I returned mine to Amazon . It 's been over two -LRB- 2 -RRB- weeks and I have not received any acknowledgment from Amazon regarding the return .
 I bought this for my roommate as a Christmas/graduation present . When she opened it and threw a record on we noticed a distortion in the sound which we initially attributed to the record being warped . Several more records later and we discovered that the felt on the turntable was unevenly applied , causing a `` hump '' in the record 's path under the needle , distorting the music . To be fair , we have n't contacted the manufacturer yet to see if this is something that could be repaired or replaced . It 's still disappointing to give a gift that 's nonfunctional however .
 Problem # 1
 On the back of this record player , it was manufactured in January of 2008 and now in October of 2011 it is dead . Pretty sure the belt just died on it.I had it set up to play through my computer speakers and as long as you have a decent system it should sound good . I played records on it quite often , but I still think it should 've lasted more than 3 years . I also had the same issue other reviews stated about the bottom plate sticking up , but I just taped it down and that worked fine.Probably should just pay a little more for something a little better than this one .
 I have a massive record collection , and had continued buying records even after the Aiwa turntable I had stopped working . I saw this on Amazon and saw it was small , reasonably priced , and had a pitch control . Initially I played my 7 '' records on it , and it was just fine . Once I started playing my 12 '' records the trouble began . About halfway through any record I play the pitch begins to waver -LRB- subtly speeds up and slows down -RRB- . I contacted Numark and told them about the problem . I got a response telling me I needed to buy a different needle to play 78 RPM records on the turntable . This was a confusing response as I had n't even mentioned 78 RPM records in my e-mail -LRB- nor do I own any -RRB- . So I write again and explain that my question was n't answered . So then I 'm told I should try to balance the arm properly . I write back again and say that I mentioned in BOTH my e-mails that the unit I was inquiring about was a PT-01 , and this model has a pre-balanced -LRB- non-adjustable -RRB- arm . Numark wrote back `` oh you 're right , just return to dealer '' . Unfortunately it 's too late for that , and Numark was NO help . Their customer service ` team ' could n't even be bothered to read e-mails and answer accordingly . Do not buy this unit , I wasted $ 100 and now I have to buy a new turntable . I assure you , it wo n't be a Numark !
 Mine came today and I was very excited because I have a fair number of 78s and this is one of the few reasonably priced turntables that will play them -LRB- or is so advertised ... -RRB- Unfortunately , it is junk . The top is coming off just like noted in some of the other reviews , and either the belt is loose or the motor is shot because it not only does not play at a consistent speed , but even if it did it would not be at the right speeds ... with the pitch compensation at a full 10 % positive , it barely reaches the stated rpms . I tried both 33s and 78s , and the AC adapter.Now I am going to have to go to the hassle of returning it to Amazon and waiting for a -LRB- more expensive -RRB- replacement . I sure doubt it will be a Numark !
 I purchased this turntable to listen to records . However , the speaker is so faint it 's barely audible . I 've returned it and am back to looking for a good one . This turntable is perfect if you 're looking to transfer audio or use external speakers ... just do n't count on it to stand on its own .
 Ca n't say too much about the product itself - it was a gift and I have n't heard anything negative about it , so it may be decent . What irks me to no end is that two weeks later I got a call referencing my purchase of this product and then an `` amazing offer '' of some coupon books where they would charge my credit card $ 1 now , then a monthly fee until I unsubscribe . Every time I steered the conversation towards that charge , opting out , or not wanting to participate , the lady on the phone drove it back towards how great the offer was . It took several tries to get them to take `` no '' for an answer.If you purchase this item , be wary of where your information could end up . I do n't know if it was the company directly , or if they sold it to a third party , but apparently they already had my credit card information on hand , which is a bit unsettling . I will be monitoring my credit card statement closely .
 This item is filled with gratuitous functions that should be removed to improve the model overall . For example , battery operation ? Is that really necessary ? How many people are actually going to take this to the park and play records . To me it was designed only to transfer vinyl to digital format . That 's it . With that said it really does n't need a built-in speaker either . Finally , my biggest complaint is that the unit tends to fluctuate in pitch . This is terrible for djs that want to go digital as it is essential to maintain a constant pitch in order to mix another song . That problem REALLY needs to be addressed by Numark and until they do so I would advise against purchasing this model .
 I still did not get the item yet.What is going on?Please let me know ASAP.Thanks , Yong
 This is a consistent complaint among people who have purchased this unit
 I received this same record player as a gift a few years ago , and it works fine for me . But when I bought another record player for my roommate , it played for 6 days and then completely died . Flip the power switch , no light , and the machine wo n't turn when you move the needle . I asked for a return , but wo n't be receiving any refund because the box it came in is n't the box it was sent back in , because I 'd already recycled the cardboard . Apparently , the company values the cardboard box much higher than the machine , so be super careful . It 's a piece of crap , and they know it .
 I bought the Numark PT-01 USB portable turntable in January of 2009 and was pleased with it at first . I had n't used it for about a year and today when I tried it the turntable did not play at the correct speed . There was no difference between the 33 and 1/3 , 45 and 78 rpm settings , and even at the 78 speed the rate was slower than 33 and 1/3 . I have no idea how to get this fixed . When I was using it it was also very difficult to get replacement styluses . I do n't think Numark still supports this product and would n't recommend it .
 I ordered a 2m USB download cable for a Nikon Coolpix Model 4600 digital camera . The item that arrived had the wrong connector for my camera which made it worthless for me . The item cost about $ 5 and I did n't think it was worth the time to send it back .
 Sure the cable costs `` 1 cent '' , but the shipping is 6 bucks . Kind of overpriced for such a small item , and this pricing strategy is deceptive . I would be happy paying $ 6 for this cable with shipping included , but I do n't appreciate the seller trying to pull a fast one on their customers by pricing it this way ...
 I am looking for a cable for my Nikon Coolpix 4300 camera . It does not use a standard mini-B connector . The information supplied on the website for this cable is not sufficient for me to determine whether this cable is the correct one .
 It was my understanding that this would work with any Nikon Coolpix camera , however , it did not fit with my specific model of the camera . I was disappointed as I felt that due to the description it would work . Ca n't complain too much because the cost was n't unreasonable , just did n't work as described .
 I do n't know what the deal is , but this thing has been slowly dying for us . First the power off button stopped working . Now the Record Light on the front will not stop blinking and no matter what I do -LRB- including unplugging it -RRB- it blinks , no commands work , and weird numbers are displayed across the screen . Just poorly made I guess .
 We purchased this TV at Best Buy ... within two weeks the VCR player quit working ... we took it back & got another on exchange ... within a week the VCR player quit working on the exchanged TV ... we are taking it back this weekend and requesting another brand of TV . I do n't think we will be purchasing Sylvania products for a while . Once bitten , twice shy ... Twice bitten , a lot more smarter.I hope this review saves you some hassle . I do not recommend this TV .
 I have a Nokia 5190 from Cingular and eagerly ordered this unit . Cingular charged me a flat rate of $ ... a month just for datalink service , and then minutes on top of that , but that 's not too expensive for wireless internet access.I got it installed and running in about 45 minutes and proceeded to try it out . I got so annoyed with the speed , the bulky cable , the connect time -LRB- ~ 30 to 40 seconds -RRB- and the intermittent service , that I gave up and returned it.Don ' t bother .
 If I could give it zero stars , I would . Plain and simple , it does n't work . I plugged the unit into my Visor Deluxe , connected the cable to my Nokia , tried connecting and received the error message `` No dial tone . '' It also seems to crash my phone in that half of the time it tries to connect , my phone ends up shutting off.The Xircom website has little by the means of support for this product and nothing specifically addressing this issue of not connecting , let alone crashing the phone.I 've spent nearly an hour looking for support manuals and trying to connect without luck . The only review I can find on this product is one here on Amazon . I would also like to make an observation
 Not until I was putting the darn thing back in the box did I see the sticker on the box . This module is compatible with 8 , count 'em , 8 phones . The Xircom website does not list them when you click for the listing -LRB- it takes you to their 56k modem module page instead -RRB- and the Amazon site simply says that it is compable with Nokia phones.According to the sticker on the box
 Well , the module seems to install just fine -LRB- make sure you move Mobilelink into flash or you 'll crash your unit -RRB- . I 'm trying to use mine my color Prism . The only problem is that my Nokia 5190 does n't want to cooperate , so I still have n't surfed with this thing yet . I get a `` Check Operator Services & quit ; error on the screen of my Nokia , and it disconnects . Even so , I bought it because it was a lot cheaper than a wireless web module -LRB- hey , why buy the wireless hardware again - it 's already in my phone -RRB- , and I avoid a -LSB- monthly -RSB- charge for service . I just use my cell phone minutes , which is fine for brief email uploads/downloads . We 'll see what happens to my cell phone bill once I get sucked into online surfing of the PDA-enabled websites . So , once I get around to calling Xircom for some help , I 'll report back on this thing actually works .
 Alot of stuff for Nokia is GSM only . Pull off your battery , and take a look at your Nokia phone . The older phones that alot of people carry is TDMA/CDMA , like the 5185 . Guess what ? It dose n't work .
 After 3 different units , I have not been able to get one that does n't have a slight shake . For three months I 've sent units back to Sony 4 times , with no satisfaction.I have three other monitors in the same room , a samsung , a princeton , and a smaller sony , and they are all rock-solid . What does it say about the quality of this ... unit if it shakes , sometimes a lot , when these $ -LSB- money -RSB- models from other manufacturers function perfectly.Sony has told me they are `` finished '' with me , as it must be my problem , not their equipment . I feel that they should stand behind their stuff , as it did n't work correctly ou of the box . Some were worse than others , and the last one only shakes a little , but still , it 's a $ -LSB- money -RSB- piece of equipment !!! I returned the first unit , one day after I got it , to their local -LSB- Boston -RSB- repair site , and got back a REFURBISHED unit , which was not only against their own stated policy , but illegal in Massachusetts , and probably other states.After talking to innumerable people , Scott Lake , the supervisor , decided that Sony was not going to really stand behind their product , and informed me that they would not attempt to find the problem , replace the unit again , or refund my money , as I believe the law in Mass says they have to . I informed him that I was a totally disabled veteran , and this would be a terrible hardship for me , but I was told , basically , to buzz off.I 'm sure that many people are very satisified with SONY stuff , as I was with my GDM 2038 ... but when you are the unlucky one , you could end up with an eye-bender like this one , and an eye-opening service experience like this one too ... almost 3 months of waiting , moving , repacking and reshipping ... trying hard to solve the problem , and to be treated like this yeech ... . SONY should be ashamed ... When I try to sell it , I 'll take a $ -LSB- money -RSB- hit off the top because it is `` refurbished '' rather than a new replacement.This is just a word to the wise . The shine is off the SONY star for me.I think that Small Claims Court is my next stop .
 The company that employees me purchased 5 of these monitors a few years ago . 1 was blurry and we never could get it sharp . 1 was blurry and the guns never wanted to work right -LRB- so the color was never very good -RRB- . They are VERY susceptible to magnetic fields , and will shake severely when near a power conduit . We had to move our desks when we moved into a new office to keep the monitors from driving us crazy.We have had Sony Trinitron monitors before , and in general we have liked them . These , however , do not seem to come up to the standards that one expects from Sony .
 My Sony 520 's have the shakes too . I 've had four of them in my lab and they 're terrible . Text and vertical lines appear to squirm , it is extremely unpleasant . I tried everything to cure the problem , I made sure there were no other electronics near the monitors , downloaded the latest drivers , ran on UPS , moved to another building , nothing worked.I managed to return two of them before and Sony is working on a pro-rated buyback for me , so that 's good . I do n't understand how these monitors can have this problem !!! They 're all used on brand new computers with four different video cards -LRB- the better the card , the worse the problem ! -RRB- . Including GeForce4Ti4600 , GeForce4Ti4200 and Radeon9500pro.I 'm going to go to LCD 's from now on , or another brand if I want the big screen for much lower price -LRB- 20 '' LCD 's are still cost prohibative -RRB- .

 I followed the directions to the letter for refilling an HP 95 cartridge . The cartridge had not dried out , and only had 25 maximum DPI prints made from it , so the printer head should have been fine.All the colors filled , but the cartridge was only good for four prints and then the blue and red colors stopped printing . I attempted to fill it again , but the blue and red colors would still not work .
 FOLLOWED THE CRAPY INSTRUCTIONS THE BEST WE COULD.WHEN WE PUT IT IN OUR PRINTER THE PAGES CAME OUT A TOTAL MESS . THEY HAD TO BE THROWN AWAY . THEY DONT TELL YOU HOW MUCH OF EACH COLOR TO PUT AND YOU HAVE NO GUIDE LINE . I THREWTHE KIT AWAY IT WAS NOT WORTH THE TIME OR MONEY .
 I was disappointed again , the quality of the color ink refills just does n't not come up to pare ...
 Poor design . Speaker works ok , but the wire is dangling just waiting to completly break . I have tried tie wraps , electical tape and nothing really can hold . Just a bad design .
 Ese angulo de 90 grados del chupon es malisimo , aparte me costo un mundo poder enchufarlo , no queria entrar y tuve que forzarlo ...
 THe connection to the Garmin 276C via this cable is at a 90 degree angle . It is not made well . This results in breakage of the wires at this point . The rest of the cable is made well and voice clarity is pretty good . I have given up with the `` pretty '' `` new '' look . The cable is held together with electrical tape , gum , and duct tape . I thought it was me at first so I replaced them . I do n't what the designers were thinking . The unit is designed to be used both on the boat and in the car . It 's moved around alot . Even with the greatest care breakage is inevitable . Despite the problems with the cable , I like the GPS very much . Unfortunately at a cost of $ 70.00 in stores -LRB- I 've gone through 3 cables in a year -RRB- , I will have to look to other products in future .
 Unless you catch it , I 've unplugged the until from a rental car and not noticed the end screw holding the fuse has come off and I 'm left with a worthless cable after I discover the situation when I get home . Yeah it 's my fault but it 's still poorly designed -- I 've had two other units just stop working -LRB- after the warranty of course -RRB- .
 eventhough the add for this charger speaker said it would fit several garmin models including the 478 which is what I have , it does not work with my unit . It will plug in and if I want to hold the plug in place , will work.However if you are not able to hold the cable and the unit together , it will fall out . comparing it to my existing charger cord , it is missing a flared out area close to the end of the cord which would allow friction to hold the cord in place . This cord does not have this , it is not the same as the cords that I have purchased in the past and therefore it is useless to me.It was a good price and I liked the fact that the cord did not have a 90 degree turn at the plug but it still does not stay in place and can not be used .
 Like the previous reviewer - great product because it allows you to hear the directions from the 276c , but given the bend in the attachment point , it will break . I have one that 's broken and after a call to garmin about warranty -LRB- they said one year , so i 'll have to keep this receipt and send it back before the year is up if there 's an issue -RRB- , I 'm having to buy another one . I 've got a direct wiring kit for a motorcycle but in the car in unfamiliar places it 's nice to have the voice tell you where to go without having to watch the screen.The garmin 276c is a great piece of equipment but the subpar accessories -LRB- garmin proprietary card and poor power cable -RRB- really make me want to look for another GPS .
 I do n't know what happened but when i plug it , the speaker did n't work . Maybe this device came damaged from the store . It 's the first time that i received something damaged . Very Dissapointed .
 Followed the instructions just like it said . My pictured all came out in a pinkish-red , had tothrow the cartdridge away . A big waste of time and money . I wont buy it again .
 This was my first time with this product . The black refill didnt work at all and this color refill left all my color printing coming out in a red/orange shade . There was no yellow whatsoever . I looks like a mixtur of all 3 colors . I would not recommend this product .
 I have an HP Officejet 6210 and I figured I 'd try this refill for my 94 ink cartridge . Filling it up was a pain because I had to hold the refill needly just barely into the created hole and let it drip in there slowly . My biggest problem was that after I refilled my cartridge , my printer would not let me use it anymore . I kept getting an error message that said `` Please remove and check your black ink cartridge '' . I tried cleaning it , resetting the printer . . tried everything to no avail . I contacted the manufacturer of the refill system and they rapidly sent me a new one , which I have n't tried . Now I need to buy a new ink cartridge for my printer to even operate ! Very disappointed .
 My visioneeer scanner broke down after 3 months of use ... Visioneer is n't standing up to its warrenty claims .
 There is no other way to put it . All Visioneers are garbage . Purchased my 2nd one -LRB- after first one died for no reason after a year -RRB- and have experienced many problems . Lately it wo n't let me scan anything because of an error saying to `` unlock your scanner '' . There is no Freakin lock on the darn thing !!! After contacting the company many many times -LRB- btw - there customer service sucks ! - No telephone number , unless u pay $ 2 per minute , just a computer-generated machine that unsuccessfully helps you called SARA -RRB- . I finally put a claim in through the Better Busines Beaureau , there response was that they could n't send me a new scanner cause it was after 1 year of my purchase , but they would be so kind enough as to let me purchase a new one and give me 25 % off of their price -LRB- which was probably an elevated price -RRB- . I told them to kiss off ! Anyway - please do n't buy this product or any Visioneer product - they Suck !
 I bought this scanner because of the simplicity and ease of use . But after less than a year , the scanner became practically useless . Scans would take up too much disk space , copies were crappy and the software was confusing to configure and use . Also , Visioneer software loads itself into memory at boot up and slows down system performance . It would not operate properly on certain Windows operating systems and worst of all , Visioneer would not provide new driver for it . Also , though Visioneer makes a decent scanner , despite the flaws , they do not provide any support that is easy on inexpensive to access . You can not email them , there is no 800 number and the long distance number that you must call has a significant wait time at your expense .
 This is one of the easiest scanners I have ever used . The quality is great and I was extremely pleased with my purchase . Then , after less than 2 months of use -LRB- and believe me , I did n't use it that often ! -RRB- it broke ! It prints squiggly lines on anything I attempt to scan . I ca n't believe it broke now that the warranty is no longer good !
 The plug into the GPS 276c will not stay connected with the gps on a table or upright on the boat ; where I planned on using the etrac . Both the a/c adapter and the car charger have the same attachment plug ; I returned both to Amazon when I returned from Central America .
 I bought the Pico for my wife , and was pretty excited to put it to use on a recent long car ride , but I was very disappointed in the sound quality . After following the directions closely -LRB- being careful to tune to a channel that was indeed empty static -RRB- the music came through , but the frequency response seemed truncated on both the high and low ends . We also noticed that unless we placed the transmitter in a couple of select -LRB- and somewhat inconvenient -RRB- locations , the signal was somewhat crackly . Overall I 'm disappointed , although if you have low expectations for sound quality , this product might be for you .
 I WISH I HAD NEVER BOUGHT IT.IT DOES N'T WORK AT ALL IN THE CITY , AND BARELY IT DOES ON ROUTE.TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY .
 The outdoor fireplace is well equipted with a rack and a trough . My one comment is that it rusted almost immediately and had to be spray painted with special heat resistent paint . We like the idea of an outdoor fireplace . It also looks very caldron like and midevil . Not very 2007 . More functional , and I would like to say practical , but the engineering in design is n't that good . All in all , not worth the $ 180 some odd money it cost .
 I 'll keep it short and sweet . This product is garbage . I purchased a vinyl cover to further protect the item , but it became a rust bucket and fell to pieces . The company 's response
 I purchased this product to safely burn cuttings and branches from the woods on the property . To do this efficiently and safely , one needs to be able to remove the top to feed in the cuttings to the fire . It can be dangerous to open the side door because embers and buring logs can roll out of the fireplace . When this happens , one can get in the situation where you ca n't get the door closed back with burning material in the way.I purchased this unit to replace a similar model from a different company that I had used successfully for years . It just rusted out over time.For this Uniflame unit , the problem with feeding from the top is that the top is designed to bolt down to the wire-framed side walls . In fact , the top holds the frame walls in place . The side frame is far to flimsy without the top in place . One has to provide additional bracing to hold the side frames togther.As such , the unit is a big disappointment to me and I would not buy this brand again . There are other fireplaces of this general size and appearance on the market where the top can be removed for safer burning .
 Purchased two of these units from Amazon . Both died within a few days of routine use . Attempted to contact the `` manufacturer '' , Telespial , for several months . They do not provide a telephone on their web site , only a contact form and an email to which they do not respond.Finally I found a telephone number elsewhere on the net and began leaving messages . After several months , I received an email from the company and successfully obtained an RMA to return them for repair.Again I heard nothing for several months . Finally after many more emails and phone calls , one of their technicians emailed to say `` yes they are dead , but now they are out of warranty and you will have to pay for new ones '' . I began trying to contact Telespial the first month I purchased the Trackstick Pro units and they simply did not respond until the warranty had expired , and I pointed this out to them when they told me they would not stand by their products . This is a very , very poor way to do business and I would not recommend anyone purchase anything from them.Incidentally
 The company I purchased it from was fast and quick . The company that is the importer for this device has a lot to learn about manners and how to treat a customer over all.They act like they designed this instead of just importing it from China under their name.I asked to speak to someone in the tech department about some changes to the software that is when I learned they ca n't do the changes without going thru there Chinese manfacture and paying for any software rewrites.I did notice after the fact that you can find many many more devices like this and over all better . I would n't recommend this device to anyone . Save your money and buy a different device from someone else . Trackstick is on the road to the garbage dump .
 I purchased this power cord for a Garmin 276 gps . I specifically wanted the one clearly pictured on the website that has the 90 deg bend at the end . I bought 2 . I received the item and it does not fit the 276 . The contacts are correctly placed but the rubber type product that is meant for a press fit into the gps is too small in diameter and the cord immediately falls out . The end of this cord is straight and not the 90 deg . It is packaged as a Garmin product with the 276c clearly on the package so I do not know where the problem lies . I tried to contact Antonline but they do not provide for any human to contact to explain/rectify the problem so I ended up sending the cords back and eating the shipping each way . Will never buy from Antonline again.Garmin 12-Volt Adapter Cable for GPSMap 276C -LRB- 010-10516-00 -RRB- I would personally verify with any vendor offering this product .
 I recommend the product if it is for your specific GPS!I purchased a Garmin GPS 76CSX , and Amazon said people who buy this product also buy , and all the also buys were for different model GPS 's and did not work with that unite , so be careful when ordering .
 I thought it was for the Garmin 296 . Probably my mistake . Will trade it off for a Garmin 296 cable .
 The powercord sent was a straight connection rather than the 90 degree one and would not stay plugged in to the unit . I wish I would of tried it before cutting and soldering to my motorcycle connection . Tis junk and ca n't use it . Money wasted .
 DOES NOT FIT ! Product is branded with the GARMIN logo . And further states for use on GPSMAP 396 -LRB- our model -RRB- . As another review states ... `` The contacts are correctly placed but the rubber type product that is meant for a press fit into the gps is too small in diameter and the cord immediately falls out . `` Before ordering , I visited the GARMIN WEBSITE to grab the SPECIFIC PRODUCT NUMBER FOR THE CORD - to make SURE this was the right cord on the Amazon site ... and IT DID MATCH.You 're forced to cut the plastic packaging to get it out to try it . I 'm going to attempt sending it back ...
 I read the reviews before ordering this product but I assumed the customer who written the review stating that this product was different than the one which is shown had simply ordered the wrong cable . I ordered the cable for my 276C GPS Map and the cable that was delivered , -LRB- unlike the picture shown on the web site -RRB- , did not have the 90 degree turn where it goes into the GPS . Just as the other customer had stated ... the cable would not plug into my GPS . I tried it and returned it . Now I do n't know where to order one to get the one that I need . Amazon was very cooperative in the return process but I still do n't know what to order to get a proper replacement .
 Both the original and the replacement cable did not work for my 276C . Do not waste your time or money . This cable will not work .
 THE CABLE IT 'S NO SAME TO THE PHOTO , DO NOT HAVE A TERMINAL CIGARETTE CONNECTOR , I LOST MY MONEY . I think you wrong the part , I receive Part No . RB , have a wiring diagram for make a Gilsson RB cable for install a DB-9 serial connector , but no , I buy to you other cable whit 12 volt adapter cable .
 I spent a lot of money for this unit and got about one year of use out of it before it started constantly beeping and overloading . I replaced the batteries with new ones plugged it in and it still overloads with nothing attached to it . I deduced from reading all the other reviews that this is a poor design on cooling the circuit board . The unit runs hot with nothing attached . I guess the cheap fan does n't last too long and you ruin the warranty by replacing it . If you go to the APC site the unit is discontinued thank goodness they retired it . This will be the last APC product I buy .
 This UPS has an internal 24 volt fan -LRB- with no fresh air intake or exhaust ! -RRB- that makes the whole case buzz . Mine looks nice but when the power goes out it just lights up overload -LRB- on what it says is a 216 watt load in the Windows application -RRB- and the computer instantly turns off . Too bad I voided the warranty on mine trying to replace the fan with something more quiet . I used to be a big APC fan but this is a poorly designed product .
 I should have paid attention to the negative reviews . This unit expired shortly after the warranty did . It reported an &#34; Overload &#34; condition ; resetting the unit cleared the condition , but it came back a few minutes later . APC tech support attributed it to a circuit-board problem that would require replacement of the entire unit . Elsewhere on the net , users attribute the problem to a faulty fan . Either way , a unit that cost almost $ 200 is now bricked .
 I wish I had seen the reviews before purchasing this unit . It has lasted about a year , started buzzing , then just cut off with only my desktop , a phone and and small lamp attached .
 This product is an unfortunate one . From the very beginning since owning it , it must be plugged in all the time to maintain the battery and take a great deal of power to do so . After owning it for less than two years , beeping has started anytime you turn it on -LRB- annoying that you ca n't turn it off -RRB- , which suggests that its battery is about to do . For being such an expensive unit and not even being able to find a battery to replace it easily , I am thinking this may be my last apc . If you search apc 's website , there is n't even product info or manuals for this manual , so support is lacking .
 I bought the XS 900 unit after owning several of the Back-Ups 300 and 500 model units for our office and at home . I wanted one that would give a longer battery lifetime if needed . This unit is n't all bad , but unlike the Back-Ups 300 , 500 and 650 models , there are n't any fine tuning adjustments available to the user . The others have 4 micro switches on the outside back panel that you can adjust for minor voltage changes so the alarm does n't beep due to minor utility line voltage drops . You can also adjust whether you want to hear the beeping alarm at all or just shut the beeper off . The XS 900 has none of these options and seems to have a will of it 's own . For it being a more expensive unit than the 300 , 500 or 650 , you get less convenience employing it . It does the job , but you better just get used to it beeping everytime there is a minor voltage drop from the utility lines , because there is nothing you can do to adjust it besides shutting the unit off completely . The next time I need to buy one of these I 'll definately get the 500 or the 650 model because I like the convenience of fine tuning the performance of them compared to this XS 900 that does whatever it wants to do . : -RRB-
 The product is misrepresented in the picture . It is shown as one stick of RAM . This CLEARLY implies it is a single 4GB memory module . What were shipped were two 2GB modules . What 's more , the Technical Detail for the item say
 I was originally sold highpoint rocketraid cards from a company that I buy my hard drives from . Highpoint implements a technology where one must use a browser to log onto the hard-drives in order to mount them , format them or do anything else with them.The trick is that sometimes the password works , sometimes not . So I am locked out of my own hard drives . This has happened several times to me . So far today I have been sitting in front of a dead computer for 8 hours waiting for Highpoint to return my tech help call - I have left 5 messages.In order to switch cards I must wipe out all my data . Which I am going to do as the frustration level of not being able to access my own hard drives is horrific . This company is basically holding me hostage . I have offered to pay them money just to answer the phone - no luck.Be warned . Stay away .
 Elk will not honor their warranty for purchases through non-authorized dealers . They have a list at elkproducts.comThe Elk M1Gold is an awesome product , I just had a new customer today for service who purchased the panel from a non-authorized dealer and had to give them the bad news . SOL !
 Does n't fit the average 10 '' subwoofer . Edge of grills sits on surround , does n't even reach subwoofer basket . Do n't waste your money .
 Yes , it is -LRB- very -RRB- cheaply made , but it does play CDs and the sound is OK for not much $ . Even the Bass Boost works . From my perspective it has three glaring problems :1 . When plugged in the wall and turned off , it hums . Not exactly confidence inspiring so when I 'm finished listening to CDs I unplug the thing and sleep soundly .2 . The instruction book says not to try to move the player/radio when a CD is playing . Not believing this I grabbed the handle and lifted it off the table while listening to a CD . Sounded like a hard drive crash ! The instructions are correct . Do n't move the player while listening to a CD or even jostle the table it 's on .3 . After carefully making sure the CD function was off , I picked it up by the handle and found out that the player faces downward at a 45 degree angle while it 's being carried !! That really sucks BTW and also looks stupid.In summary , you 'll enjoy listening to it and I got my $ 35 worth , but maybe if I had spent more I would have gotten a `` portable '' CD player that I could actually carry and listen to CDs .
 This product is very very cheaply made and very awkward to use and handle.The reception is terrible I seriously doubt it would last a week without breaking if you actually carried it around .
 I purchased three of these for my firm , and all had severe focus problems that plagued them within three months . When new , they were beautifully sharp , but they started to `` drift '' in and out of focus , so badly that text at higher resolutiuons was a mere gray blur.Sony service has been very reluctant to cure the problem , returning the monitors with the same problem after claiming they were repaired . I would recommend the NEC units instead ; we have had good luck with all 5 of the flat 21 inch units we have.FYI , Sony service is extremely difficult to contact . Plan on spending hours on hold queues , often to be transferred to busy signals or dead lines . This has been consistent over my two months of experience with them . Very dissappointing for such a large company.By the way , nobody at service can give you a direct line , so you must wade through endless -LRB- and changing -RRB- teleprompt menus and wait through multiple hold queues -LRB- each one at risk of killing you with the busy or dead line -RRB- every time you call just to get an intelligent update on your repair orders .
 I posted this review at other sites as well . I feel obligated to do so . I hope it helps to `` warn '' consumers a bit . Here goes : I recently bought a Sony GDM F520 . Right after it arrived , I had it returned.It had bad geometry , bad convergence , yellow `` stains '' at the right side of the screen . So did the second I got . And so did the third I got . Only the third now also has about 15 bad subpixels and an effect at the right side of the screen that looks like condensed water , I dont now how else to describe it . I have tested the screens on multiple systems , so the problem isnt caused by the videocard -LRB- tested on 3 systems containing a matrox g400 , a Radeon , an asus geforce2 gts -RRB- Sony -LRB- The Netherlands -RRB- does n't `` see '' the things I point out , and say the screens were perfect . Allthough they obviously were not . I am very disappointed about it all . I now still have a faulty screen and no service . Not a screen I would recommend to others . Next time it will be an Eizo for me , or a Mitsubishi / Nec.With kind regards , Rick -LRB- the Netherlands -RRB-
 ... only when it has been new.I bought mine in the end of 2001 . The superb technical data and the extremely positive reviews you could find in that time were the reasons for spending that much money -LRB- about US$ 1600 -RRB- . And indeed , the picture quality was just great -LRB- using 1600x1200 at 85 Hz and working mainly with text based applications -RRB- , I was very contented with it.But at the beginning of the year 2005 -LRB- i.e. only a few months after the expiring of the 3-year warranty ! -RRB- the problems began : - Whenever the CRT is cold , it flickers extremly bright red and sometimes also blue , but no problem when it has once warmed up itsself -LRB- that means after about one minute or so -RRB- . - This phenomenon has at first started only a little bit but has gotten worse day after day . Now it sometimes even powers off due to self-protection -LRB- so I have to repower it a few times -RRB- during its `` warm-up phase '' because it flashes up too bright . - For a few weeks now the picture has been getting blurrier every day . Reading small letters for a few minutes is now causing me a headache . I have to switch the resolution down to 1280x1024 . Also the edges are now sometimes in strange colors instead of white.I 've also looked into the device , cleaned it from dust and it seems very much that the tube itsself is the cause of the problems -LRB- perhaps sparkover between cathode and the heating ? -RRB- . But due to the blurry picture repairing will most probably mean to exchange the tube which I can not do at home . So it 's too expensive and therefore not whorthwhile anymore.After only about four and a half years it seems that I have to dispose it - I just ca n't use it any longer , mainly because of its blur that I do n't want to expose my eyes to.Now I am planning to buy a TFT screen very soon . I am thinking about a Samsung 214T -LRB- 21 '' -RRB- or 204Ts -LRB- 20 '' -RRB- . In conclusion I can say
 Have had the monitor for 5 years . Excellent up to a month ago ... after being on for 5 minutes , blurry to the point where text is unreadable . For $ 2000 USD , I was hoping it would last longer ... the issue I 'm sure exists with the 520 model ... GR , Windsor , Ontario , Canada
 After installing drive and software with ease , I sucessfully burned 2 audio cds and 3 data cds . Now for some reason it only works for data -LRB- pictures -RRB- . Every time I try to burn a list of songs it errors out after a couple of songs resulting in many thrown out cds . I am definitely returning this one .
 I purchased this product as a 2nd cd recorder . My first is a Sony , a great product , but I thought I would compare them . DO N'T BOTHER with this one ! It gets one star b/c there is n't an option for negative numbers here ... The product is supposed to * work * with the Nero software they package it with , which is GARBAGE . It is difficult to use and the support number is in GERMANY ! I have an extensive background in computer technology and have never been so disappointed in a product . Please do n't waste your money . I returned mine .
 Less than three months after purchase , it 's in the shop ; an authorized repair center . Picture started `` snapping '' 'till no more picture . They replaced the picture tube and something else . I took it home . Then , it started displaying flickering white lights across the top of the screen and a vertical rectangular discoloration on the left side of the screen . They 've been working on it for a week ...
 I really liked the size and design of this TV ; I sometimes used it in my study while on the computer -LRB- which means light use , not my main TV -RRB- . The tuner failed after a few months and Toshiba helped pay for it to get fixed -LRB- yes , I liked it enough to fix it once even if it is an inexpensive TV -RRB- . Well , the tuner failed again 15 months after the original purchase date . This time it 's off to Mount Trashmore and Toshiba wo n't be on my list of replacements .
 We have had the tv for about 8 months and we have already lost our picture.We also had alot of trouble with the remote , it would not work all of the time . We are now in the market for another tv .
 I have had two of these drives fail . Neither had more than 30 hours of use . In fact I barely had all my applications installed . What was really nice was finding out the second one failed the morning of April 15 when I was attempting to boot up and submit my tax return.Very disappointing . They 'll send me another drive but I 'll not be installing my operating system or any critical files on it . Just too unreliabe . In fact I do n't even know what I 'm going to do with it . Seems silly to have a backup drive you have to backup onto another drive.I do n't do any gaming or use any apps that place high demand on the hard drive . In fact the computer has n't even been plugged in for three months . I used to like Seagate but they have lost a customer for life . When two units fail like this in less than 80 hours total use I believe its a pretty good indication of how good the product is.I should have listened to the reviewers before buying . But in the old days I had a Seagate last ten years without fail so my judgment was clouded . Clearly quality is a thing of the past with Seagate . These drives effectively wasted 30 + hours of my life.Buy this drive if you like to talk to people in India otherwise try another vendor .
 I bought thru amazon this Seagate ST3500641A-RK 500Gb drive , but less than a week after I installed it in my winXp pro system , it crashed the system during a simple drive to drive copy procedure . Concerned , I ran a disk utility program , HDDlifePro-2 .9.105 , and the health and performance were rated at 47 % . Speedfan , another HD health check program , confirmed these readings via an online evaluation . While the drive is still reported as healthy , it is not yet a month old , and I have many other disks several years old at 90 % or over health and performance ratings . Health later rose to 51 % but how can a BRAND NEW DRIVE fall to HALF its health nearly out of the box?I contacted Seagate support , and a reply took weeks , asking me to run again their mediocre utitility scan , which merely reports it as healthy without percentile numbers , and they labeled the issue as SOLVED . Great for them.I had copied 350gb of data to this disk , so I am loath to return it , specially since they may say that 51 % is still healthy and I should accept it at that . But really , this is the second Seagate drive that has given me problems , while drives for Western Digital and other brands always performed fine . So Seagate may have the hype but not the delivery . I will never buy from the again.J . Rapalo
 I purchased this product and used it for a couple months ... and the click of death happened.I UPS ` ed it to the Seagate specified RMA center and received UPS confirmation that someone signed for it at their reps facility.Unfortunately whoever signed for it misplaced it and SEAGATE , is stalling on sending me a replacement drive . The drive was received 11 days ago and they ca n't get any confirmation from their shipping and receiving dept.I did n't purchase this from amazon , but wish I had n't purchased it from anyone else either.SEAGATE customer service is the worst , a five year guarantee attracted me to seagate , but it does n't appear to be worth much .
 I could not get these to form a single image of a star or planet because the two tubes are not exactly parallel . I do not know whether that was a quality control issue of the pair I had , or the overall quality specification is so poor that misalignment is typical . Mine went back . A properly aligned pair would be a considerable bargain . If you buy these , buy them from a place with a good return policy . Keep the packaging and invoice .
 It came on time , but it is a very heavy unit.Definitely you need a tripod stand capable of holding a binocular of some 5 pounds.I put it on a tripod stand , aimed at a marquee some quarter of a mile away , andI could NOT see many details.Since I can not use it , for what I bought for , I called the seller and asked for a RETURN LABEL.He said that I have to pay for returning it.The POST OFFICE would charge me some US $ 20.00 to return it.From now on , any time I buy items from a store or on the NET , I will ask about their return policy , and if any , who pays for shipping it back.I decided to keep it for the looks of it .
 The binoculars were too heavy and would require a bearer to be used effectively . The sale article did not clarify the weight -LRB- Although calling them &#34; supergiant &#34; should have been a clue -RRB- so when the box arrived , I opened it in disbelief then repackaged it and returned it the same day . The cost to me was incovenience of having to return the binoculars .
 The item was promised to me a month ago and I still have n't received it !
 I bought this item based on what I thought would be a seemless transition from my ATT DSL provided modem to this modem . What a nightmare . 2 days of telephone conversations with ATT and Zoom and I finally got a connection . . kinda . Each side said `` it 's fine at this end , you need to talk to the other guy '' . I now have a connection that works sometime . This thing is going back .
 this product is not what it advertises . could not connect to internet , when i rearranged ALL my pc settings , it finally connected . only to find out Zoom does n't recognize my ISP . this is a piece of junk that i ended selling on ebay .
 I am currently using the modem provided by my broadband provider . It is problematic though , shutting down for no apparent reason , and not resetting for hours or days at times . I saw this modem , and thought it would be a good idea for a replacement . Zoom claims the modem is compatible with my system and provider . I hooked it up as soon as I got it , and nothing . I contacted my provider , and there was no problem with the connection , but my modem was n't configuring to the service . I called Zoom several times without luck . I finally contacted their tech support through live chat , and made several attempts to resolve the issue . The modem just will not work , even though it is completely compatible . The tech I talked to finally gave up on being able to help me . I hooked the old modem back up , reinstalled it , and it is working properly for now . I 'm still not satisfied with it 's reliability , but it is working much better than the Zoom modem , which I now have to return . Thanks Zoom . My advice to anyone who reaches this page is to run away as fast as you can .
 This dsl modem installed very easily . It was completely plug and play after the software installation . It worked perfectly for 2 or 3 days then stopped working . The lights on the panel indicated all was normal but I was unable to access the internet . I turned it off , turned it on , unplugged it , plugged it back in , held my breath until my face turned purple but nothing helped . I plugged my old , intermittent , unreliable dsl modem back in and regained internet access . The defective Zoom unit was returned to amazon for a refund .
 this camera is great as a toy or for children to practice with . The software is also pretty nice and lets you do quit a bit of editing . the photos though are terrible . usually they ave a blue or brown cast to them and even on a tripod the images blur . not recommended for saving photo memories .
 I just wanted to report that `` usually ships 24 hours '' is an inaccurate description of reality in mid June . I ordered one and the order page said that expected ship date is 8/22/06 , which is 2 months away . So whoever is thinking of ordering this capable , well-reviewed printer just be aware of this .
 I bought this harness for a 1997 Camry -LRB- 5th gen -RRB- , but ended up not using it at all . Turns out the 5th generation Camry has a dash part that already fits snugly around modern radios . Behind that dash part , there is already a bracket for mounting the radio . That renders this dash kit totally useless if you are trying to install a modern radio . What most cars will probably only need is a `` pocket '' . I suggest opening the dash first to see what you need and checking out the following if you have a Camry like mine :[ ... -RSB- Pros : - this kit will allow you to mount really old radios that have different form factors than todays radios . - this kit will probably work with 4th generation CamryCons : - quality of the kit is poor - manual is poor and wrong for the 5th generation Camry ' 97 - faceplate that will slide over radio is wrong size and does not fit over modern radios
 This kit is a `` universal '' kit therefore you will need to modify it ! Do n't waste your time or money with this kit . It was to wide and tall for my 95 Camry and nothing fit correctly , the radio can not be mounted to the adapter at all and just sits there , I purchased mine on ebay for 25 and it came with the wiring harness adapter so I did not have to cut my factory harness , that worked good but for this kit just stay away .
 This item will need to be modified before installation.The design seems like it is for older radios.I had to cut and grind/file the insert to install the new radio.I also cut the bottom of the kit because it was crooked with to muchspace below the pocket.Also note
 This is worthless it 's so outdated really is a waste of time . do n't bother getting this .
 I was driving from Atlanta to Chicago when I was told by my GPS to take a right turn . So I did . I woke up in the New York , New York hospital where they told me I had hit a tree ! Plus in the wreck , my GPS broke when it flew out the window ! This is a waste of $ 2,000 . You could get a good Garmin GPS for $ 200 and it would n't make you drive into trees!By the way , I ended up in New York , not Chicago .
 I bought this with the hope of boosting the signal from my large attic-mounted outdoor aerial antenna . I have a 3-way splitter sending the signal to the TVs in the house . My house is ~ 30 miles from the antennas on South Mountain with clear line of sight . Things were fine before June 2009 , but since the digital changeover a few of the Phoenix channels -LRB- 12 , 15 , 45 , 51 , 61 -RRB- have become weak and sporadic -LRB- available one day , not the next -RRB- . One of my TVs has a signal meter . It read `` 75 '' before I installed the booster , and `` 67 '' was the best I could get after I put it inline between the antenna and the 3-way splitter . Since installing the booster I no longer get 12.1 -LRB- or subchannels -RRB- on one TV , and can not get 15.1 -LRB- or subchannels -RRB- on the others . On all TVs channel 45.1 and it 's subchannels stutter as if half of the digital bits are coming through .
 This RCA 10 dB amp did not work for me . I had it hooked up straight from an indoor antenna to a converter box . No long cable runs or signal splitter . With such a straightforward rig thought for sure I would see a signal boost . However , I ended up losing a couple channels like ABC and FOX . I also did not notice any signal improvement on channels that I did get . Bottom line , signal worked better without this amp in the circuit . It 's a mystery to me why it did n't work .
 Bought two of these based on reviews , which I now see was an inappropriate measure as the units are useless . Picked up nothing different-new than before , with the only difference being that I lost five of the twenty-four stations I was picking up from my outdoor antenna before installation.Junk .
 When I received my order , it was obvious that it was repackaged -LRB- a previous return -RRB- . That was my first hint . At the very least I was hoping for some marginal improvement on a couple of channels . However , after installing this device , I actually lost a couple of channels.It could be a defective device , I do n't know . This definitely is n't worth the money .
 Wanted to split my DTV Antenna signal to go to another DTV in the house . Barely made any difference at all only allowing reception of a few of the stronger DTV channel signals on the second DTV and no difference on the orignally connected DTV .
 This product reduced my signal . I used it for a week , adjusting my antenna only to loose signal strength and channels . Once I disconnected the unit my signal strenght increased and I received more channels .
 I installed this inline between my indoor antenna and the TV . I already have a decent signal on most of the channels , and this device made the signals worse , rather than better . Very disappointed in RCA .
 The RCA 10db cable signal booster did n't have the strengh to maximize my cable TV picture quality . 10db is low but the big problem was it does n't have a return path . This is needed so the cable company can talk to your digital box , but w/out return path the digital box is unable to talk back , -LRB- send information back to cable company -RRB- . Did order 18db cable signal booster with return path , thank you .
 The stickers came off within two months of use . They peel off easily and move too much for my taste .
 This is noisy CD player it makes a whiring sound when CD 's are played . Terrible fast forward and backwards , goes to slow . Awkward to use . Worst CD player I have ever owned . Do n't buy it , you 'll be sorry .
 I bought this cd player a year ago and I have been very disappointed . The cd changer is noisy when switching cds and the sound quality is very low . My dvd player puts better sound out than this unit . The unit is attractive and having a 5 disc player is nice at times , but this unit is not worth the money .
 I was very intrigued to see that RCA was offering a CD changer that played MP3 . While RCA received mediocre reviews online , and I could n't find any reviews of this player in specific , I took a gamble and ordered one . It arrived -LRB- single boxed -RRB- , I unpacked it , and immediately noticed its light -LRB- cheap ? -RRB- plastic construction . Plugged it in , popped in some disks , and ... nothing ! It recognized the disks , but would not play them . Amazon graciously agreed to send me another unit second day , and paid for the the original 's return . The second unit arrived , this time it would not even accept disks . I was wary of RCA 's reputation when I ordered this unit . This experience has buried it for good . A definite do not buy .
 I bought mine at the local Best Buy . Wish I had bought from Amazon instead-read on to find out why.It played great at first . Then I started to hear an occasional squelching sound , like a giant water ballon bursting . At first it was once every few days , then every song , then constantly . Then it quit reading disks period , both storebought CDs and MP3s . All were scrupulously clean and played fine on my old cd player.Because it was over 30 days , Best Buy would not refund my money . Swapped unit number two is hooked up to the stereo now.I hope this one keeps working . -- Vance In Denver
 I had this machine for about 10 days . Although it plays MP3 , its CD changer functions are significantly flawed . This is what I found : Up Side :1 . It plays MP3 , although on some occasions the music blanks out for a few seconds on my mp3 CDs -LRB- not too often , so it 's tolerable -RRB- .2 . The programmable playlist function is pretty cool . It allows you to select the songs you want to listen to or skip those that you do n't like.Down Side :1 . Biggest problem that made me return this unit
 It does in fact play mp3 pretty well , and is pretty neat.However , it is a horrible cd player . Why ? Well , my main beef with it is that if you play a cd , there is a slight pause between tracks . Many cds have songs which flow from one track into the next track , and in fact , most of my cds are like that , being a fan of dance music -LRB- and a DJ -RRB- . But that does n't happen with this cd player , as you get a half-second pause between tracks.If you 're listening to a mix cd , this is quite jarring . As all my cds -LRB- just about -RRB- are either mix cds , or stuff like Pink Floyd or the Moody Blues -LRB- which have tracks together -RRB- , this player is completely worthless.It also does n't let you fast forward or back , because again , it plays track by track , not the whole disc.It 's also pretty loud when it changes discs , which is generally not a good sign of a long life ...
 I 'm seriously into MP3 compatible equipment . I have a rock-solid Sony MP3 CD player in the car . I also have a Toshiba MP3 compatible DVD player.The first thing I noticed about this particular unit was the big 15 character display on the front which clearly shows information about the song file . The track info scrolls across the display showing the name of the disc -LRB- if any -RRB- and the COMPLETE name of the song file . What 's more , there is a button on the unit and the remote which will scroll the entire track name across the display on command . If you want to see what other songs you have on a disc , you can skip through the tracks and display the name of each song on the disc without playing each one.Unfortunately , the unit does not read CD-RWs consistantly which makes it useless for many MP3 discs . I have already encountered a number of previously recorded MP3 CD-RWs which the RCA simply WIL NOT READ ! My Toshiba MP3 compatible DVD player and Sony car unit read the same discs with no problem.This is totally unacceptable ! The old saying is , `` You get what you pay for '' . That is certainly the case here . I ... will wait for a high-quality from a solid brand such as Sony , Kenwood , Technics , or JVC.Do not be tempted by ... this unit !
 Well I just got the bad news that this camcorder had a recall & I just missed the cutoff date for a free repair courtesy of JVC . An error code of E01 appears on the LCD screen indicating it is in `` safe mode '' rendering it inoperable , GREAT ! I 've used it maybe a 20 times and now I have a usless camera w/a tape stuck inside , oh wait , it 's gon na make a great paper weight ! I 'll never buy another JVC product ... Ever !! Other than than that worked great .
 I purchased this unit from a Radio Shack in town -LRB- for way too much money , might I add -RRB- and was very upset to discover that by `` 140watt '' they mean `` 70 watts per plug '' -LRB- the device has two AC outlets on it . -RRB- Plugging in my Dell laptop adapter -LRB- which pulls exactly 70 watts -RRB- caused the unit to overload , and it popped the fuse inside of the cigarette lighter itself . Furthermore Radio Shack would n't take it back because they claimed I damaged it . Anyhow , the unit feels sort of cheaply constructed , and when it was `` on '' , it smelt like burning electronics . I would n't trust it as far as I could throw it.Go with another manufacturer , this company makes garbage .
 Philips FW-i1000 IssuesOrdered Dec 6 , 2002 , BestBuy.com , -LRB- $ $ $ -RRB- , -LRB- $ $ $ -RRB- rebate available -RRB- , free shipping.Delivered Dec 11 , 2002 , appears to work as intended.Here are the problems that I found during the two days that I owned it .1 . MP3 CDs wo n't play .2 . Requires a program `` iM Jukebox '' running on a Windows PC to play computer-based MP3 files.i . The program is buggy and prone to crash or freeze -LRB- under Windows 98 -RRB- . The program 's task lives on after the program is exited and has to be killed with CTRL+ALT+DEL . ii . The program requires acceptance of an end-user license agreement -LRB- EULA -RRB- , and the submission of personal information . It also requires acceptance of a privacy policy that allows monitoring of listening habits . It also requires Internet Explorer , Windows Media Player -LRB- WMP -RRB- , and Real Player - all with their own EULAs . It also requires that the user -LRB- claim to -RRB- be 13 years or older.iii . Many MP3 files that work on other software and portable MP3 players wo n't play . All MP3 files converted recently with CDEX wo n't play.iv . User can not fast-forward or rewind or pause when playing an MP3 file.v . No ability to play files on a Linux or Mac computer .3 . It is circuitous and cumbersome to add an Internet radio station , and only streaming MP3 stations are available . This function , like others associated with iM Networks ' website only work with the Internet Explorer browser .4 . Unit takes 30-60 seconds to start playing music when powered up by pressing connect . Sometimes it claims `` No Internet connection '' when PCs have Internet access . Unplugging the power cord and reconnecting does not seem to help .5 . Stations that play flawlessly on a PC player have dropouts on the unit .6 . All aspects of the Internet radio and network MP3 player function are dependent on one small company
 Hello , I 've just gotten one of the production units as a review loaner and I want to warn people who are expecting to use this unit to listen to Internet radio
 It 's good Stereo . I must be the ONLY person who actually bought one . You can still find a couple of working IM stations , mostly non-USA and mostly pop music.I really wanted to be able to play MP3s from my PC hard drive , but the promised software to let that happen is nowhere to be found . And the maker appears to have abandoned the whole project .
 ... I think this thing is sortof nice the way it has an integrated Tape and CD , but generally I think it is really crappy compared to the Turtle Beach Audiotron . Granted that unit is designed to be connected to a real stereo , and not imitate a real stereo like this unit , but the support for formats , and features is 400 % better on that unit.The Audiotron is also able to play icecast and shoutcast ...
 Again the wrong item . Discription is vague and not consice . You think you 're getting one thing and wind up with another .
 Ok , how do I explain ? I 've been picked up off and on during the years . Each time I 'm picked up , I get probed . And not just by a little gray . And not just once or twice . The whole darn ship of 'em line up to probe me . Repeatedly.So , I bought this device , thinking that if it went off , I 'd have time to escape to my lead-lined safe room , or at least grab a weapon . So what happened ? Not what I expected . It did n't give me any warning at all . The range is extremely limited . Only later did I see the disclaimer
 After my first abduction I sought out to arm myself with something that would prevent this from happening to me again . Alas , the UFO Detector.Since then my microwave , TV , radio , and cellphone have been causing the device to alarm several times , sending me in a state of panic where I 'd hide under my bed for days . Next time it went off it was no false alarm . And I was , again , on board an alien vessle with probes hanging from every opening of my body.I 'd guess that for this `` Detector '' to work you 'd need to be in an environment free from all electrical interferences . Above all , I DO NOT recommend this product .
 Seriously ... After like two times it breaks . The first time , upon encountering the UFO the device started to shutter and shake REALLY bad and then lost all power . The second time , well ... that time was mostly okay , but the third time it did n't work at all . I had to get out of bed with a flashlight and when I finally got the UFO to come over , the device just sat there like it was a toaster or something . Seriously , if your looking for a GOOD UFO detector , look elsewhere .
 While there is no question that global warming has caused a rise in alien visits and , consequently , a greater need for UFO detectors , sadly , I tend to agree with the other reviewer that this may , very well , indeed be a homing device made by aliens in order to find humans who are `` gadget-minded '' and , consequently whose well-developed brains can be utilized for alien study.Or it could just emit a very high pitched noise that humans ca n't detect . I 'm not sure.I could hardly wait to crank this baby up when I got it in the mail -- I was sure the government would have intercepted it like they did my last one that `` got lost in the mail '' -- Anyhoo , I turned it on , and waited patiently.Nothing.I walked it by the garages of neighbors who seemed `` quiet and kept to themselves '' and , thus , made me obviously suspicious of what they could be hiding ... nothing.Disgruntled , I fell into bed ... and awoke a few hours later to see glowing eyes surrounding my back windows . I sprang from my bed in much excitement -LRB- and , I 'll admit slight terror -RRB- that the foreign visitors I 'd read so much about about were mere feet away ... as the UFO detector let out a faint `` pip pip '' ... and , as I flipped on the porch light ... I saw ... a family of deer , 3 raccoons , 4 stray dogs and one possum.Now either the aliens have gotten far more crafty in their UFO building now that we humans all have cell phone cameras , -LRB- aka these were animal-shaped crafts -RRB- or this thing lets off a high pitched sound that works like a deer bleat and attracts critters.I have a slight suspicion that hunters eating venison may be creating their own @nal probes without even realizing it seeing as how the deer could really be a UFO if this detection I experienced was correct.Those aliens are tricky like that.Word .
 Ok , I bought this stupid thing and I 'm driving along feeling safe and peaceful when all in a sudden my engine stalls and my ford starts floating towards saturn and THEN the stupid detector goes dead and it hits me . Electronics fail when a UFO approaches anywhere near!Besides that I do n't need some gadget to tell me I 'm beaming up again!This thing is like buying those silly weather rocks - by the time the rock is missing , the tornado is already there!At least the rock is environmentally `` Green '' , not like the batteries this thing requires .
 I read that Aliens like to do Anal probes so I thought if I hid this in my Bum I could detect them before the got me . Well needless to say I am writing this on my way to Epsolon Epsolon Ack Ack Bivivito 7 . I am amazed at how good the Interweb is in space but disappointed that the detection kit did not work as intended .
 I was fishing at a lake not far from me and had the device with me . It failed to detect a UFO , and before I know it , they scooped me up in a giant glowing fishing net and carried me to Neptune where I was then probed , injected with I have no idea what , and mercifully , fed quite well . They gave me steak , they were quite nice after the probing actually.I would not recommend this detector , I would not want anybody else to get probed by it .
 I bought this to see if there were any aliens here , but since I was in Texas near the Tex/Mex boarder , my alarm would not turn off ! Every time I went to home depot or walmart it would go off and I could never get it to turn off ! Also when I take it near my vegetables and fruits it goes off , so I have to wrap them in tin foil , which is a hassle . I wonder if there going to release one that detects immigrants ... misc was here ...
 I 'm very upset . Sure the device works fine and immediatly detects all UFO 's in the area . Unfortunatly , once the UFO 's are detected they no longer qualify as unidentified . How am I supposed to keep believing in UFO 's if they no longer exist ?
 Product works as adverted . It gives me plenty of warning to clear out the house of all unwanted guests . When the aliens arrive i prefer to be alone . They are so courteous now , they hover over my home for a few minutes to give me time to `` set up '' before the arrive . Every time i hear the alien chime go off i get a flutter in my nether regions . Its like a doorbell to my back door!But after months of visitations it has been getting old . They never call back and now i think at least one of them has been videotaping it . I went to the company 's website to search for accessories to better defend my nether regions , and no luck ! I would think that with such a fantastic product they would at least offer a sternly worded keep out sign in the aliens native tongue.Due to the lack of proper defensive accessories i now have to sleep with a butt plug that i had to purchase from some grimy third party vender . THey should have saw this coming and included one with the product ! that 's why i only give it 2 starsASIDE : Not for use in homes with children or pets , trust me little fido has not been the same .
 Ok folks , here it is . My friend claims to get abducted usually once a week ! Usually every Thursday night at 11:30 after his wife falls asleep . She wakes up in the middle of the night and he is nowhere to be found . They have a small studio apartment and he 's a pretty big guy , so he would not be hard to find . He explained to his wife that he has been having `` strange dreams '' but he did n't really think they were dreams because he would usually wake up in some motel and then stuck having to take the bus or a taxi home . He went to a hypnotherapist who told him he was being abducted by aliens , and used in a reproduction program to help breed human/alien hybrids ! Well , that explained why he was gone , but his wife was still getting upset and still was n't sure if she should believe it -LRB- the hypnotherapist happens to be his best friend -RRB- . So , she bought this device in the hopes of setting things straight . Whilethe UFO-01 Detector works , there are some serious design flaws -LRB- that hopefully will be corrected in UFO-02 -RRB- . The first problem is that every time the microwave is turned on , the thing goes off . This is n't so bad , but it turns out that my friends wife is red/green color blind , so she sees green lights and thinks everything is safe and fine ! We got her to see an eye doctor and he confirmed her color blindness . She is now a believer . Unfortunately , she is such a heavy sleeper that by the time she wakes up , he 's already gone ! Also , she complains that this does not work all the time , and only beeps sporadically . It seems like the plug does n't work well , as she says that she often finds it unplugged , and , `` it seems like the plug falls right out of the socket ! '' I will update this if they give me any more information .
 Quite contrary to what 's advertised , this UFO Detector is not an official Images SI Inc. product . After referring to the Images SI Counterfeit Guide , I discovered a few questionable defects that made me realize Amazon was selling a bogus UFO Detector.Here are some common things found on the fake UFO Detectors claiming to be an official Images SI Inc. product : - Lack of trash can symbol next to the the serial numbers and other official regulatory icons . - unsmooth edges in the plastic body . Official UFO Detectors from Images SI Inc , will have the frayed edges smoothed out before leaving the factory . - Lighting when turned on is distributed unevenly with one bright light dominating the illumination . An official product will have the light evenly spread through the interior.If you see any of the above , you have a fake UFO Detector from Images SI Inc. . Now you may be thinking , `` So what ? It 's cheaper and it works . `` Sure , it works . For now . But what are you going to do if it breaks ? You ca n't get Images SI Inc. to honor the warranty . You get what you pay for , people . Beware of what you buy .
 Really ? The other reviewers bought this piece of & * % $ ? Can you say shills . Rather than buy this why not take your money and flush it down the toilet as a way of communicating with the little green men ?
 In spite of my effort to ascertain that this product would work with my 40 G color IPOD , it does not . Big disappointment .
 The main thing I bought this for is to control my Ipod . Which you can do but no menu on the tv to control it . It is very hard to see an ipod 10 ' away . Also there is a high pitch sound when you change songs , that lasts for a second or two . I have everything hooked up correctly and settings set .
 I was really excited to get this product , as it billed itself as a one-step integration method of bringing your ipod into your home theatre . For the record , i 've got the Yamaha RX-V2700 . The reality is that the manual is lacking at best , and the functionality is rather quite limited.There are two ways of controlling your ipod when it is in the dock . From the iPod itself , and from the Yamaha remote.If you want to use the remote , plug the ipod in , switch the input to v-aux , and change the remote 's method from `` amp '' to `` source '' by the little sliding button on the right hand side of the remote . Hitting the `` display '' button will bring up Yamaha 's onscreen display , allowing you to access most of the ipod 's goodness . Controlling the iPod in this manner , you will only be able to hear the sound from your movies / music videos / tv episodes . If you actually want to watch those , you need to control the iPod from the device itself.Furthermore , if you control your iPod from the Yamaha remote , you will need to have your TV on to see the on-screen display to select your playlists/etc , as the iPod 's screen goes away and is replaced with the Yamaha logo.I have a Logitech Harmony 880 universal remote , and was able to get the remote to `` learn '' the commands to fully integrate it into my system , which was a plus -- but overall , the basic functionality seems to be lacking -- and the manual -LRB- if you even want to call it that -RRB- is a joke at best . Depending on your needs , the Apple Universal Dock that comes with its own little remote might be a better deal .
 I have not yet received this camera ordered at beginning of September , my emails to mike@nextpower.com are bounced back to me , and I can not find a way to contact Amazon regarding this item ... so I guess I am just out the money sent .
 I am a little confused . The camera I ordered that was advertised online , is not the camera I recieved via UPS . I was aware that the camera might not come in the color advertised . But it was certainly suppose to come in the same style . -LRB- The Minolta Freedom 70 QD Date 35mm Camera -RRB- Instead , I recieved a Minolta Freedom Zoom 70ex . What happened ? I did recieve the camera bag at no extra charge . Thank you . But my concern is not recieving the camera I ordered !
 this camera is so behind its unbelievable . . bad pictures , not enough featuresi gave mine to my 4yr old neice

 I received this item in November and used it maybe two or three times . It should be noted that the scanner functionality never worked , after repeating the instructions multiple times . I confirmed it was the fault of my individual unit by comparing it to a model purchased the same week by a friend . I went to turn on the unit a few weeks later -LRB- sat idle most of the time , power off -RRB- and there was simply no sound output . Lights and display worked fine , but no sound of any kind . I removed it from my car for a few months , and finally contacted Cobra . They instructed me to ship it to them -LRB- at my cost -RRB- and they would repair or replace at their discretion.I received this item last week -LRB- 2/17/11 -RRB- , reinstalled it that same Friday -LRB- 2/18/11 -RRB- at which time I tested it . Both the scanner and the audio worked ! I turned the unit off , and drove my vehicle normally over the weekend . This morning -LRB- 2/21/11 -RRB- on my morning commute , I smelled a plasticky sort of melting smell , one that turns the hair of anyone with any tech background . I was afraid it was from my car and did not make the connection . This evening I turned on the radio ... and no sound . Just for kicks -LRB- as I was already pretty furious -RRB- I tried the scanner . No scanning functionality . The unit up-close smells of burned electronics , the same as it did the first time.I would rather not have to send this in again , as I have absolutely no confidence left in Cobra . The return period has long since past , and it costs me about $ 9 to ship this back . The features of this radio are great on paper , but the quality is not there . I will likely go to Midland for my next CB.Remember , caveat emptor .
 I was very pleased , when I first installed this unit . I liked the size , it fit well in my Jeep Wrangler . I liked the CB channel scan feature . I liked being able to monitor 2 channels at the same time . I also liked the NOAA weather radio.This radio had great reception , until ... it just pooped out . I contacted Cobra , they said , just send it back , we 'll fix or replace it . I sent it and got it back in less than 2 weeks , with a note saying that it had a broken wire . I took it out of the box and tested it . I had the same basic problem . The weather channels were not clear , did n't match the channels that are operating in my area , and I had to turn the volume all the way up to hear it . It did n't work this poorly when I first got it.Also just to make sure it was n't me , I checked this against another Cobra CB that I installed since this radio broke . I simply unplugged the antenna and swapped it over . The tune was the same , the environment was the same , but the Cobra 75 WX ST did n't perform as it did when I first bought it , or even as well as my other Cobra 29 WX ST NT.I 'm still working to resolve my issue . Customer service was great . Maybe they 'll fix it right , the second time around .
 2 1/2 hours of routing and hiding wires flipping and twisting beyond anything God intended for one of my size.Got everything mounted just so , all nice and pretty ready for the big reveal and I spin the switch on , ready to measure SWR and bloop!Nothing.Lights come on but only faint static from the speaker . Not sure what 's wrong but Cobra customer service is nowhere to be found.Perhaps if I call the factory direct I 'll get somewhere . Anyone know the number for Cobra in China ?
 Bought this in April and installed in May . Received great but COULD NOT get anyone to acknowledge receiving . Bought it because we are leaving tomorrow for 2 months in Alaska towing an RV and I thought this would be good for road info and in case we have a breakdown . After trying everything to diagnose the problem I sent it back to COBRA for repair . Turns out it was off frequency . So they tuned it and returned it . Upon return , it would not receive as well and I only got acknowledgement of transmission twice out of about 50 attempts . This was even on major freeway with big rigs going by with the CB antennas on them . It also would only scan occasionally and would stick on stations where there was no transmission . Called them and told them I was leaving in a week . They authorized a return and included a UPS label but for REGULAR GROUND service from Pacific Northwest to Chicago . I told them at the time I did n't think it could make the round trip in time and he assured me it would . We were supposed to leave today but delayed a day waiting for this and other items . A week after shipping there was no phone call , no email and no CB radio . I strongly urge you to stay away from this unit and COBRA in general . Local sporting goods store told me they stopped carrying COIBRA FRS/GMRS radios because of all the problems and now I believe it . Pretty disgusted .
 Handset is bulky and not comfortable to use . Speaker in handset sounded terrible while it worked . After two weeks the radio no longer produces any sound . Everything lights up like it thinks it 's working but there is no sound at all.I hope I can just return this item for a refund
 Purchased Cobra 75 WX ST All-in-handset Mobile CB about 1 year ago . Easy installation , up-front controls , very convenient . Six months after installation speaker in mike failed , could only get sound through external speaker , using external jack . Repair shop said it would cost almost as much to fix as the unit cost .
 This is a great concept . I put jacks in three cars so I could easily move it from car to car . The thing worked nice , though the control dials are awkward . The squelch dial on mine was nearly impossible to turn but I put that up to the usual lack of quality control in China.Happily I talked for three weeks . Then it stopped . No audio output.The speaker went dead . Chinese garbage.So after several ignored email 's I 'm sending the trash back to Cobra with a receipt and a letter and we 'll see if they make good on their warranty . Maybe the next one will last a little longer.UPDATE
 i bought one of these . it worked fine for about 4 hours and all the sudden it went off of freq very scrachey sounding sending back asp .
 I was looking forward to using this product . When I received the CB Radio I find that it does not plug into the cigarette lighter as I thought , it connects directly to the vehicle battery . Ca n't do that so it is going back . I give Amazon one star for not making this clear .
 I have a Canon G9 and I would not recommend the wide angle lens in this kit since the corners of the photos are cropped . The cropping can be eliminated by zooming in , but to the point that the viewport is the about the same as the stock lens , thereby making the wide angle lens useless . I 've found other reviews -LRB- after my purchase -RRB- claiming that the Canon wide angle lens does not have this problem.I called 47th Street Photo to send this back and they are going to charge a 15 % restocking fee for a product that I feel is defective .
 This lens set will fit the Canon 650A according to the seller . What it fits is the adapter tube you buy from them . Poor quality and not worth the money . Cost too high in restock fees to return . Gave it one star because they look cool . If you like the circular corner cropping , well these are the lenses for you as long as picture quality does n't matter . Buy a decent set . Keep shopping .
 After reading several reviews , I ordered these , but they never arrived and I was reimbursed the purchase price , so I went to a local sporting goods store and compared these to theNikon 10x42 Monarch . After comparing the two , even though the Monarch 's were more money . The Monarch 10x42 is a lot better quality Binocular . And I have been very happy with them .
 The right eye piece was falling off of my binoculars when it arrived . Careful inspection shows that this was only weakly attached ever and it looks like glue or whatever was supposed to hold it on melted during shipment . It is 110 degrees here but binoculars should hold up to that . I agree with the other reviewers that comment on the lack of quality in the manufacturing of this product . I think I will go with Leupold or some other brand . With binoculars I think you really do get what you pay for and these were too good of a deal .
 Simple . It was an open-and-shut case . I got it out , tried it for a few seconds . Its chromatic aberration made my head spin . I shoved it back immediately and sent it back.By the way , there are too many pockets that may retain water . I would n't call this water-resistant , let alone waterproof.This thing sure made it easy for me to decide.I ordered a 10 x 20 Zeiss Conquest . Obviously , the two belong to two different categories , but the image quality of the Zeiss makes this Nikon 's lack of image quality look like a 25 toy from the vending machine .
 I purchased these binoculars from Amazon based on the Nikon name and customer reviews . I suppose my expectations were too high . The optics were respectable , with well lit imagery . The disappointing part was the made in China construction , they felt cheep . They were bulky and heavy and the focus adjuster felt crappy . I returned them , and purchased the Bushnell Legends , they are constructed in China as well , but they are very nice for the money . The glasses feel great and work exceptionally well , plus they come with a great case and extra goodies . The truly amazing part is you can get such incredible binoculars these days for such a little amount of money , does n't seem realistic . No candy coating , just callin it as I see it .
 Received radio 2 days ago -LRB- 12/1/09 -RRB- Installed the next day . Has not functioned properly yet . Had it checked out by a professional radio installer and he recommended that I return it and ask for a replacement .
 Do n't believe the last review . I had mine about a month before I tossed it out the window somewhere near Charlotte , NC . Nothing but problems , barely recieved or transmitted and was extremely weak when it did . I actually had truckers ask me to stop transmitting because all they could hear was squealing when I keyed . Tossed it , kept my K40 antenna , bought a Uniden Pro538W and have loved it ! Much better radio ! Do n't buy anything Cobra makes !
 I like the scan feature , I like the Weather feature.I picks up too much RF noise ie : Power line noise , engine noise
 I have three CB radios
 I was n't able due to schedule to install this immediately , I suggest you take off work if you do n't want to take off then I suggest purchasing a refurbished unit to start with I am on my second one that squeals when you key the mike I can not return it to Amazon , because of the excessively long time it took to get it from Amazon and Cobra to return any correspondense telling me it was a radio problem I can not return for a replacement Amazon says I ca n't , I have to send it in to Cobra to get it repaired so I have a pair of brand new repaired radio 's I could have purchased a refurbished radio a lot cheaper and got as good warranty else where INSTALL THIS IMMEDIATELY I am using a Cobra antenna on channel 1 I have 1.25 swr and channel 40 swr 1.25 it changes so little the eye can not see it the antenna works great just ca n't say anything to anyone because the tranmitter just squeals I just today got this back 10-10-07 from Cobra does the same thing and now they started the same ole procedure I started in the first warranty claim BEWARE I am going to can this and mark it up as never buy cobra product again
 I ordered this radio , after my midland 1001z broke , and I really wish I did n't . This radio is junk ! I had a good antenna hooked up to it , and the radio signals were weak and came in and out constantly . The mic is cheap and bulky ! The soundtracker feature is useless . Fellow CBer 's could not hear me when I talked to them . The only good feature is the weather band , other than that , do n't even waste your money on it !
 A `` birdie '' is a spurious signal generated within the radio , such that this signal can be heard by the radio . In this case , the 18WXSTII has one channel that seems like it always has a signal on it , and that signal is the birdie . I think it was channel 4 . The birdie signal was loud enough that it would block out any medium or weak real signals . Now , in other wide-band general-coverage radios that use synthesized frequency generation , it is common to hear a few birdies . But , since CB only uses 40 channels , you 'd think they could design it so that there would not be any birdies on those frequencies . When I talked to the Cobra technical support person , he admitted the birdie was a design problem and all the units have it . This was several years ago . It may be fixed by this time . Anyway , the tech agreed to exchange the radio , and I ended up getting a slightly more expensive model . I was happy with their support but sad about their design problems .
 I 've had this CB for 10 months now . The main reasons I bought it for are the compact size and multi-scan features , which work well . However two real big gripes about this radio are no RF gain control and it 's `` super shiny light reflecting '' black tinted face which makes it extremely difficult to read what channel you 're on in daylight . I often have to have the squelch set so high to block static -LRB- from everywhere -RRB- , that I do n't get reception anyway . It also makes a little static `` tick '' noise as it does it two channel priority watch scan , which I find very annoying . In fact , I no longer turn the radio on when I 'm in the vehicle . I would not buy this model radio again and am planning to replace it .
 here is why . 1 . the frequency wonders on this like crazy if your on chanel 22 you are heard on 21 and 23 as well .2 . this cb dont like other mics at all ! it wont work .3 . the sound quality is crap at best put a couple marbles in your mouth and talk and thats what you sound like3 . front facing speaker is a great idea so construction and design is okay4 . digital anologs just plain dont give accurate info5 . this `` sound tracker '' kills your output -LRB- ive tested this -RRB- 6 . everything feels cheapto back up my claim that gos against all other reviews read this as well -LSB- ... -RSB- my advice , this is not a bargain buy get a real cb not this plastic paper weight
 when i considered buying this for my car and started looking at the reviews i knew it was going to be a toss up wether it was going to be a quality product or not , i liked that it had the front firing speaker and the soundtracker system , which the radio i have in my tractor for work -LRB- cobra25 -RRB- also has the soundtracker system and it works great , but when i recieved it and set it up with a 2ft wilson antenna its performance was less then exceptional , radio is very noisy even with the soundtracker system on . this radio constantly freezes -LRB- when i turn it on it will be stuck on ch9 and you wont be able to change channels use the weatherband or anything , you have to turn it off and hope for the best next time you turn it on -RRB- and the front firing speaker is very quiet . i should have went with another cobra25 and just bought an external speaker
 Ok , So I setup this radio in my 09 toyota tacoma . I set it up with a 5 foot firestick antenna , and firestick cable . I had to ground the sheet metal on the toyota and the mount to bring my swr down . I got it to 1.1 to 1 . I only used it for testing the SWR and receiving until it was kosher . I didnt want to burn it out . So after 2 weeks of use once the Antenna system was all setup it burns out . It was a slow steady burnout . Over the course of an hour . I started hearing a LOT of static that progressed into a hiss and when I keyed up it flickered and was done . I checked the fuses and no such luck ... Its done . So should I bother taking it to a cb shop and getting it repaired ? Well over the last 2 weeks I learned something . First off a gain adjustment would have been wonderful , It would allow me to fine tune reception to eliminate the Electro Magnetic Interference that I hear when driving by the malls or under power lines . Second I had been eyeing the cobra 29 wx as it will interrupt and bring through weather warnings . I commute 140 miles a day and go through some canyons that reach 4500 feet , they are prone to snow in the winter . . So should I spend money to get it repaired or buy something better ? Buy something better . Kick down the extra few bucks and get a more durable radio with a few extra features . Buy quality the first time and it lasts a long time . Buy cheap and you replace it many times . My 2 cents ...
 This item rattles like crazy in my jeep now . I 've only had it for 6 months and I have not abused it at all . The item is obnoxious . I 'm thinking about taking it out of my jeep . Reception is not great and I have a fire stick 4 foot on my jeep . Too bad ...
 Sleeve is good , does NOT include cable pouch . Seller will not respond to my emails . Beware !!! Cable pouch is listed in the description but is NOT included . Otherwise sleeve works well , protects and does not scratch macbook .
 This is a good radio dont get me wrong however , let me explain . I have had one for about three years then the problems started . The main thing is now it transmits intermediately and the problem is in the new design . It seems to save money -LRB- not yours -RRB- they have put a couple of small circuit boards with non repairable components on the main board . eventually with the bouncing and jarring these crack . My tech . can not repair it and cobra doesnt want to sell him the parts . So i basically have a small boat anchor . Plus he told me that the sound tracker models are mainly junk . the only two he recomended were the classics and he told me that for the money the unidens are best deal and withstand the abuse better . -LRB- he doesnt even stock a cobra -RRB- . I am a truck driver and the radios do go through some rough riding . I have switched to uniden !
 Get something else . This is a USB 1.1 , not USB 2.0 . So , it does not work well with , say , a USB 2.0 flash drive . And , it may not work at all with a USB 2.0 flash drive . Normally , I could plug my USB 2.0 flash drive into a USB 1.1 port and use it , even though I get an initial alert saying a detected device will perform better on a USB 2.0 port . However , a PNY USB 2.0 flash drive I own would not work at all with this USB hub . I can plug the flash drive directly into the same USB port on the computer and use it but it will not work with this hub.The cable on this hub is only about 18 inches long , so you 'll probably need to use an extension cable if you want to connect it to the back of a tower PC sitting on the floor .
 I received this radio last week and I thought it was a great price . The signal reception on this radio was excellent even though it has a rather `` stubby '' antenna and the model I received included batteries.It took a bit of time to program the radio for the S.A.M.E. county alert codes , frequencies , etc. . The first problems occured during the Wednesday 's S.A.M.E. test transmitted by the National Weather Service each Wednesday from 10:00 AM - 12:00 Noon -LRB- under most circumstances -RRB- . The signal was strong , but no test code was received . On the weekend we received several radio weather watches and warnings - nothing showed up on the S.A.M.E. indicator ...
 only worked right the first set of batteries . never worked right after that . got mainly static while my `` cheap '' weather radio on my $ 20 walkie/talkie works fine - all the time . very disappointed .
 I purchased this radio about five years ago . I noticed recently that I was n't getting any of the S.A.M.E. alerts . I called the company and was informed that WR102 was recalled . To the company 's credit , they offered to replace it with a WR601 . The current price is about half of what the radio originally cost , so this is a great price but a very bad deal since the radio has problems serious enough to be recalled . Not exactly on the up and up of Amazon and participating companies to keep selling this item .
 Save your money.Upon receipt , I installed the batteries as instructed . Result
 There are newer models for portable weather radios that fix some of the problems in the reviews listed here , including the WR113 that includes a charging dock , and the WR601 that has non-volatile memory and a dock , so you do n't have to input your SAME codes after the battery runs out .
 I 've had this radio for a couple years . It works OK in the city . When I went camping in the Adirondack Mountains all I got was static . OK , I was n't too surprised , although I would think there would be service up there for the mountain climbers ' safety -LRB- The ADKs have many peaks and is home to the Army 's 10th Mountain Division -RRB- . But I was sure it would work on Cape Cod . Not in the campground in Orleans . Not even on the docks in Provincetown , surrounded by big commercial fishing trawlers , whale-watching ships catering to the tourists , and private luxury vessels . Now , WHERE , you might ask , would be a more likely place for NOAA to provide weather radio service ? Oh , did I mention that Cape Cod is also home to the Woods Hole Oceanagraphic Institute?Now that I 'm home with a roof over my head and surrounded by brick walls , the darned thing wo n't stay off , it has to keep warning me about the thunderstorms currently rattling my windows . Now that I do n't need it , it works great .
 We sail our boat on the Great Lakes in the summer and have been overwhelmed by the watches , warnings and alerts coming over the WX channels on our typical VHF marine radio . These messages do n't necessarily reflect the weather in our area . Therefore we decided to get a portable S.A.M.E. radio for the cockpit . The WR102 was an easy choice several years ago as it was the only unit I found claiming to be weather resistant.The unit worked well for several seasons and provided what I was looking for
 This is a waste of money . It eats batteries . Three AAs last about three weeks . During the last storm , it was useless . Do n't waste your money on this one .
 This purchase was for a second identical unit that I could carry with me during the day . Weather can change rapidly here in Eastern North Carolina . This Oregon Portable Weather Radio has great reviews . I personally give these radios high marks for there service and durability . However , my radio was defective upon arrival . Amazon.com true to their policy shipped me another unit and prepaid for the original unit to be returned to them . I am very pleased with their customer service .
 - Very short battery life -LRB- a few days -RRB- - No key-lock , so the buttons get pressed if in a bag or on belt -LRB- which means you may miss an emergency alert or you may find the batteries dead -RRB- - No memory when you replace the batteries -LRB- have to re-program and set clock -RRB- - Belt clip/holster not strong enough -LRB- keeps falling out -RRB- - Poor reception -LRB- missed alerts -RRB- I would not recomend relying on this radio for backpacking or receiving emergency alerts .
 This is my first review - I just thought I had to warn people about this monster.My two huge complaints are ; 1 -RRB- BATTERY LIFE - ok , the original batteries lasted about 3 days , fine . New set of Duracells lasted about 2 weeks . Repeat about every 2 weeks -LRB- 3 AA 's -RRB- and do n't forget to re-program your same codes . Yes , it will store the codes for a few seconds . If you 're lucky and fast . I have started using my rechargeables - still only lasts about 2 weeks , but at least its cheaper . This is on standby mode too , I rarely listen to it unless we are having some weather -LRB- here 's a concept - how about being able to turn it `` off '' to conserve battery life ! -RRB- 2 -RRB- EASE OF USE - Ok , the instructions are only partly useless , but unfortunately they are necessary , as this is the most un-intuitive piece of electronics I have ever had to use . I deal with computers and digital cameras all the time at work and am known as a fix-it kind of person , but this thing is just a joke . Luckily it is durable , because it has been thrown a few times.On the plus side , the SAME codes work fine for me -LRB- even though the radio reception is not the best -RRB- , and it has successfully warned me of the 3 tornado warnings for my county so far this year -LRB- which the sirens in town only went off once of the three - guess they do n't work on Sundays -RRB- . Living in a trailer park , it does make me feel better having it around , so I guess it does it 's job . I recommend having one , just not this one .
 I am the unfortunate owner of both the Oregon Scientific `` base station '' weather radio WR196T and the portable weather radio WR102.Both devices use the same inscrutable , user-hostile interface for programming in the channels , counties and SAME codes , although the WR196T is arguably worse , as it has additional options and buttons to confuse the issues . I own lots of electronic devices and I 'm what some might call a geek -- in addition to having a background in having written software for low-level hardware devices . So I 'm both not dumb about how to use such things , and also well know how much better than can be made . These 2 radios are difficult to use.Both devices also use similar user manuals -LRB- documentation -RRB- . Poorly written and organized , and printed in incredibly small type , they are unpleasant to read and figure out -- and you WILL need them , because the controls are non-obvious , as I mentioned above.Lastly , the quality is seriously inferior . These radios only get use during the tornado season in Minnesota -LRB- April to September , at the longest -RRB- . The rest of the year , they are carefully stored . They are always carefully handled by an adult , kept clean and otherwise not abused . Mostly they just sit on a shelf , waiting to announce the half a dozen per year tornado warnings . Hence , they are not stressed or well worn.Yet , after only a few years of usage , the WR196T 's display light has failed , and the WR102 's audio capability produces only static . It appears the WR102 is still receiving the NOAA signal -LRB- the green light blinks when NOAA is turned on , and behind the roaring static , one can barely hear some audio -RRB- . But it appears the audio detection circuitry has failed . This is not rocket science ; we 've been building transistor AM radios for 50 + years . Such a radio should last nearly forever . But the WR102 , which gets even less usage than my WR196T , has failed after just a few years.Nor were these radios particularly cheap.Weather radios are very valuable to have in parts of the country subject to weather-related emergencies , especially tornados . But I highly recommend shopping around for other brands than Oregon Scientific . I hate them and wish I had something else .
 I was never really able to get this unit working . After thinking I had installed weak batteries , I discovered that the only way to keep the unit powered was to apply pressure to the battery cover compartment . Additionally , I found installing batteries annoying due to a very thin peice of weather stripping that easily falls out of place and is not amenable to being replaced . I returned this item .
 the kreisen 37 '' flat screen tv arrived . plugged it in , does n't work . buyer beware , amazon does not accept returns of televisions over 27 '' . had to wait over 2 days for a reply to our numerous phone calls to kreisen , television was shipped back to them . we still have not recieved a working television .
 The silicone portion seems durable , but it 's terribly hard to get on and off , which seems to be common with these types of cases . Button access is adequate , but if you charge with a dock daily this type of case is terribly impractical . The screen cover is a plus but it 's bubbly , murky , and sticky -LRB- ? -RRB- . The immoveable knob on the back for the belt clip is in the way when lying it flat on a desktop . Moving on to metal cases next !
 I bought this Toshiba DVD Player -LRB- 3750 -RRB- seven months ago and now it will not turn on . Of course this is conveniant for Toshiba since it has a 3-month labor warranty and 1-year parts warranty . The local authorized repair shop says labor will cost ... -LRB- adds up to the cost of a new dvd-player -RRB- . So this TOSHIBA dvd player will be going straight to the TRASH and I hope to find a different brand dvd player with a longer warranty.Until then I will suffer with my VCR.P.S . This dvd player had a great picture and sound until it broke .
 I purchased this player about five months ago . Recently while playing a flawless DVD , the picture froze up while audio continued to play . Powering down the player and restarting it solved the problem . MP3 playback is a problem on this unit also . The instructions include a nice `` disclaimer '' about how certain types of MP3 media may not work . All MP3 media sounds terrible on this machine . Playback is interrupted by `` pops '' and `` chirps '' . MP3 discs also cause the unit to freeze and not advance to the next song -LRB- though you can advance it manually by pressing the skip button -RRB- . Picture playback is good and the unit has many features not found on other players , such as screen capture -LRB- allows you to use a scene from a DVD and select it as `` Wallpaper '' for your TV -RRB- and zoom capabilities.I have not utilized the player 's progressive scan output yet .
 A wonderful product that worked right out of the box for all offour months ! Now it is stone cold dead -LRB- it died in the middle ofan instructional demonstration lesson with a room full of evaluators leaving me sweating it out for a full forty minutes -RRB- and now I am stuck between everyone -LRB- Amazon , credit card company , Toshiba -RRB- trying to get the warranty honored . Obviously , I am not happy with this -LSB- money -RSB- purchase and can not recommend that anyone else buy it . Something that was supposed to be very good should last maybe five months ?
 You should realize initially that progressive scan dvd players will have a better picture , even if you do n't own a HDTV . So the picture and audio quality were a nice improvement when I first got this player ... and at a great price . However , it does not age well at all . I 've had it a little over the year , and the freezes when it switches layers -LRB- many movies use 2 layers of the DVD disk -RRB- are becoming more pronouced . It is becoming more frequent that you can not see the dot or highlight that lets you know what you are selecting -LRB- you can select , but it becomes a guessing game -RRB- until you power down , eject the disk , and start all over again . Finally , it is starting to completely freeze ... and I mean completely -LRB- you ca n't even power down from the front buttons , you have to pull the cord at the back -RRB- . Do n't waste your money .
 This product was rated by the owner as being in `` very good condition . '' This was a total lie ; this man 's offerings are not to be trusted . When I received this `` very good '' DVD player it failed to load successfully any dvd , professional or otherwise . In short it was broken . When I wrote the owner I received no response
 Worth twice the price ? Not when it quits . This unit played DVD 's very well , sound was clear , pictures were crisp , and operation was simple . I can recall only three times when a movie froze , and we watched lots of movies on this little machine . CD playback was fine as expected , but CD-R 's and especially MP3 discs rarely played up to par . Many errors and garbage noise made it not worth the trouble . But the biggest downfall for me was the customer service . After eleven months of faithful service the player gave up the ghost , -LRB- literally , no reason , no explanation , no damage , it just stopped working , even had a CD stuck inside -RRB- , and Toshiba was not , in the least , prepared to satisfy this customer . The cost to repair the unit was estimated at least 50 % the original retail price ... . With no interest in fixing a time-lapse factory `` defect '' , I chose to purchase a new unit , with a REAL warranty , from a different company . If you currently own one of these , or are thinking of buying one , think twice or be prepared to deal with the consequences .
 We bought this DVD a year ago , and it 's absolutely not worth what we paid for it . The DVD picture and sound are Ok , but this is the case with most DVDs . Now for the fun part
 I had high hopes for this unit given what we paid for it , but have had MANY problems . About half the DVDs we have played in it have had serious sound problems , as if you were turning the volume up and down randomly . It makes many movies unwatchable . Plus , you get plenty of picture freezes . Most cdr/mp3s that we have tried in it also had serious audio problems , lots of pops and the like . These cdr/mp3s play fine on other players.I 've had lots of problems with other Toshiba products lately , so my advice would be to avoid them .
 I would love to know more about this DVD player . Amazon has almost no description of it , but the Toshiba site has even less . I called their customer service number yesterday and had to prove to them that they had mentioned this player in a press release . Pretty sad.I went into one of my local brick and mortar stores that distributes Toshiba so I could learn more about the SD5700 and HDCD . They had no clue about either one . After I explained HDCD and that the SD4700 and SD5700 were progressive scan DVD players that were supposed to come out this summer , I was ready to bolt and find more info on the net myself . They persuaded me to wait while they called their distributor . They relayed the message that the distributor had just came from a trade show in Vegas where he had been told that the 5700 had been canned before it hit the market and that it had been replaced by the SD3750 . They said the 3750 and all subsequent Toshiba DVD players would be equipped with HDCD and the 3750 would be $ 249.99 plus tax . They also told me the distributor said not to buy a SD5700 even if I found one since Toshiba was replacing it with the SD3750.I found a mention of the 3750 in a June 28 , 2001 Toshiba press release and as an item on Amazon . Other than that , you would think this product does not exist.I called the Toshiba customer service/contact number . After I proved to them that they were marketing this product , they gave me a few specs . I was told the 3750 plays DVD , VCD , CD-R , CD-RW , and MP3 formats . DAC is 10/54mhz . Resolution is 540 lines . Has N 2 2 surround . They said it does not have Dolby Digital -LRB- I asked if that meant that it did not have a built in Dolby Digital decoder or it does not support Dolby Digital ... but they had no clue what it meant -RRB- . They also had no idea about DTS capability . Optical Audio out , S-Video , Component Video , and Composite Video outputs . Toshiba said this product will be in stores on August 29th and so will the SD4700 and SD5700 ... so much for the replacement theory.The most disturbing thing is that they said it does NOT have HDCD . I told them what the brick and mortar company said . Toshiba said the specs they had there were not set in stone and that it may have HDCD after all . That calls everything they said about the 3750 into question . How can customer service for a company not know `` set in stone '' specs for a product that will hit the shelves in one week ? I love Toshiba DVD , but they must be pretty dense .
 I have to agree with the other reviewer . This supposedly forthcoming model is n't even listed on the Toshiba Web site . Furthermore , the SD 4700 JUST APPEARED . This model was announced almost a year ago , and still is n't available . First it was due in June , then July , and I still challenge you to find a dealer that actually has it.It 's too bad that Toshiba is failing so pitifully in bringing these seemingly good products to market . These players do supposedly have the essential features
 I just bought a kodak 3.2 megapixel camera at walmart for $ 88 . this is VERY overpriced , It looks like it should cost $ 25 or less
 With this camera I was able to making high quality pictures only outside . Inside of any house or room pictures are ugly . They are in very bad red-light or orange-red color . I do not use this camera as I expected and I ca n't return because package was opened . Of course , I opened to see how this camera work . But requirements for returns by mail does not aloud to return this useless camera back to their place : - -LRB-
 I got mine in a `` it 's got to go '' sale at a local big name computer/office supply store for about $ 29 . The directions are less-than-stellar ; you 're going to have to experiment . The photo quality is n't all that bad for a cheapie . Getting an updated driver from the Micro Innovations web site seems to be a chore for many buyers as there are NO drivers available as of the time of this posting . Get something good for your money .
 Do n't buy this camera . It 's truly terrible and the support was non-existent . The manual does not even explain how to turn on the flash , let alone how to trouble shoot any other problems . I spent several HOURS trying to get this to work . Do n't even bother .
 Do not buy Canon G6 . Buy Sony V3 instead . I have done the research and paid the price for you.When I buy cameras , the most important thing to me is picture quality . I have owned two digital cameras -LRB- 3 MP and 5 MP , both are Sony -RRB- and I was upgrading to 7MP . I narrowed my search to Sony V3 and Canon G6 . I thought G6 may deliver better picture qualify because it has a bigger lens . I found out in a hard way that in this case , SIZE DOES NOT MATTER!Here is the story
 I have now bought 3 of these and all three have failed to work . I would install the software on win 2k AND win xp home but neither system recognizes the device once I plug it in , this is the same problem I had with all 3 card readers ! This `` product '' does not even deserve a single star but that is the lowest rank I am allowed to use.I tried to call dazzle for support only to find that the phone has been disconnected . I now have to find something that actually does as advertised ... good luck is right !
 This product is NOT recommended . I was unable to successfully load the drivers and hardware and thus was never able to use the device . The instructions are clear but they do not work . Waste of money . Unfortunately , your choices at present are to buy more than one reader if you have multiple media types ... or await a 6 in 1 type device that actually works .
 It does n't work like it supposed too , so do n't buy it . I have tried with win2k and winXP . It can read fine , but I ca n't delete files on the memory cards . It kept giving me error messages . And seem like their web site does n't even support this product !!! So , do n't buy it . Get a better brand that would support their products!Good luck ,
 Purchased this recently - works fine for my Smart Media card - but ca n't read or write to my 128MB Memory Stick . Still waiting for a response from Dazzle Support -LRB- 4 days after submitting query -RRB- . Will wait a few more days before returning the item.Overall - quite disappointed - had the potential to be a very useful product !
 This item had lots of promise , but it falls completely flat.I purchased the item , followed the instructions to install it , after I restarted my windows 2000 system twice , it did n't work . It kept resetting my powered USB hub.Turns out , this device does * NOT * adhere to the USB specs ... and does not work if plugged into a USB hub.I called thier tech support people , and was told that they only support a configuration where the devices is plugged directly into the USB port of the computer , no hubs.Unforunately , for me , that 's not an option ... the USB on my system is way in the back and I do n't want to be reaching back there to swap USB devices around .
 I shipped this product back the same day I received it . Even when using a brand new DVD , it skipped . Sometimes it would not even play at all . Please do yourself a favor and avoid this product .
 Beautiful picture if you can get it to play . I have experienced constant freeups . After I returned the player to the manufacturer , they sent me a new one which I had just received this week ; however , this one is worst than the original player . This not an isolated problem . Before I purchased this player , I read several reviews about the same problem ; however , I did n't listen , I found out the hard way .
 Did not have good luck with this unit ; after only a couple of uses on car trips with kids , screen went blank , could not get picture back . Hooked up to TV for a few days , then it started skipping and freezing up . Got as a christmas gift , so now we have to figure out how to return it for a refund . Would not recommend to others .
 I bought this after considering all brands and thought that for the price this would be a great player . The next day I sat on an airplane for 5 hours . The only problem I had this day was that it would skip once in a while and sometimes the picture and they audio were not in sync . On the return flight there were major problems . I turned the unit on and it worked for about 2 minutes . Then the monitor went out . After planning on relaxing and watching a movie this made the flight very long , boring , and frustrating . I took this player back when I got home and purchased a better brand . For anybody considering purchasing this I have just this one piece of advice . Forget about it .
 This is an attractive player . The accessories were what sold me on it , and I was pleased with the package . I was disappointed , however , when I tried to play rented DVD 's on it . It skipped very badly . I contacted Audiovox and was told that this is a low energy laser and that DVD 's need to be clean to play in it . The same DVD 's that skipped so badly in this player played fine on my husband 's Toshiba laptop .
 We purchased this unit for Christmas of 2002 . In July 2003 the player quit entirely ... disc would spin but the screen was flat gray . No picture . Called Audiovox , they had no idea what the problem was and said to ship it back . Spent $ 10 to return via ups . They could not repair so sent a replacement . The 2nd one worked until January of 2004 , then quit also . This time I was told that because the 1 year warranty had expired -LRB- from the date of purchase-not the date of replacement -RRB- I was out of luck . I could send it back for repairs at my expense . Fortunately I had the foresight to have purchased it on American Express which automatically doubles a warranty up to one year . Amex is going to refund my money so that I can purchase a new unit . The next one will definitely NOT BE AN AUDIOVOX !!
 I bought this Portable DVD player at Super Target on sale and when I got it home it played very well and had a nice picture until I tried to watch a complete movie on it . It seemed like it got really hot about halfway through the movie and when I tried to adjust the brightness of the screen it was unresponsive . Then the movie froze and totally locked up so I had to unplug the unit and replug it back in to get it to work.I took it back to Target the next day and got my money back . Target gave me a little hassle about paying a restocking fee but I talked them out of it . If it locks up the first time you use it what 's going to happen a year from now ? Buyer beware !
 I purchased an Audiovox DVD1680 prior to a series of trips across the country . It remained in its case whenever not in use , and I was very careful with handling and precautions.Just as with the previous reviewers , all of a sudden the unit started freezing up . . then refused to play ANY DVDs . Further , the spinning of the DVDs in the unit started to make a squeaking noise , and I was concerned that continued attempts at getting it to work would probably only result in damage to the DVDs themselves.So , back to Target it went , where it was cheerfully accepted back , and my credit card credited .
 I purchased this player and it worked fine with movies , but was incapable of playing a music CD all the way through without pauses , glitches and other problems . I wound up sending the first back , got another and had to send IT back due to the same problems playing audio CD 's -LRB- store-bought . -RRB- I also found the Audiovox info-helpline impossible to access either by phone or internet . Too bad , because it played movies just fine .
 Well , I 've gone through two of these and both malfunctioned repeatedly . The first unit was a Christmas present . Worked the first time , then would not load dvds -LRB- several were tried -RRB- and once I got to work again it was very inconsistent , froze up , and often would not load . Put it in the car for our kids to watch in the second seat of our minivan and it took many tries to get it to work.After return to Target got a new one and while this one worked the first few times , it was not possible to hear it at full volume on a plane , a big disappointment . Once overseas , it started freezing up and doing strange things again.I 've learned my lesson on this one . The Audiovox is not ready for prime time and i would recommend being very wary of this product .
 Audiovox should be ashamed of selling a product this unreliable . I think it worked for the first month and then completely went downhill . One out of twenty DVD 's -LRB- maybe -RRB- will work in it and it 's practically brand new . I 'm super -LRB- mad -RRB- at this waste of money !!
 I have never been so disappointed in a product . Thank goodness for -LSB- Amazon.com 's -RSB- convenient returns service . This product froze and skipped right out of the box on Christrmas Eve and continued the next day until we raised the white flag . Then we began researching other customer reviews , here and at other sites and the Audiovox 1680 , plus other Audiovox models clearly have a pattern and history of freezing and skipping and being unusable . We are amazaed and appalled at all of the reviews we found from frustrated buyers who bought an Audiovox 1680 or another Audiovox unit and sent it back over and over until giving up . The question is this - how can they continue to market a product that has fatal flaws for at least half its buyers . One wonders if they have a conscience , cotinuing to sell a product based on either poor technology or poor design . We were so excited to purchase a portable DVD player and now are so scared by this awful experience , we are skittish about trying any brand . We have , since sending this unit back -LRB- and again , Amazon has far and away the best return policy -RRB- , purchased a Panasonic LV70 and it works perfectly . It 's pricier but it does n't skip and freeze . Bottom line - even if you get stuck with an inferior product from a manufacturer , using Amazon is worth the peace of mind .
 I purchased this DVD player and the first one I received malfunctioned immediately out of the box . Amazon . -LSB- com -RSB- accepted my first return and sent me a new one . The second one worked the first few times , however this one has also begun to malfunction . After inserting a DVD , the player will simply not play the movie . Amazon . -LSB- com -RSB- would not accept my second return and passed responsibility to the manufacturer.My experience has been very frustrating . I would strongly recommend not purchasing this product .
 ... I found that it played maybe 1 out of every 3 dics I put in it , and even the 1 it would play it would sometimes freeze up or slow down . Well , I thought that every assembly line is entitled to one lemon , so I returned it to Amazon . Well the 2nd one has been no better . The first couple of discs did play -LRB- one with a couple of slow downs -RRB- , so that lulled me into a false sense of security . Since then , no disc I have put into the unit has played . Tonight I put a brand new disc of the `` Great Escape '' into the unit 26 times and it did not play once.I 'm 43 years old and this is without a doubt the single worst consumer product I have ever purchased . As I said above , I 'll give every manufacturer one bad product , but not two . And to top it off , I waited too long to really test this 2nd unit out and Amazon wo n't let me return it . This is the biggest piece of -LSB- junk -RSB- I 've ever purchased .
 I purchased the 1680 for the holiday for my kids . I read all of the reviews and even called Audiovox technical for some advise on which model to purchase . He suggested and I decided on the 1680 . I purchased the model at Target on a great sale . After the holidays we used the unit for the kids in the car . We had a few problems once in a while with the unit recognizing the dvd . However we decided not to worry about it . The kids always used headphones . Then one day I decided to show the guys at the office my new toy . The unit would not play sound out to the the speakers only by the headphones . Well back it went to Target . I received a new one from Target . We just came back from a President Day trip , the unit froze up twice during our 6 hour drive and the display was hard to get working . So it is going back . I have already ordered the Panasonic unit . I have n't read one negative review on the Panasonic unit . However it cost me $ 200 more . . I surely hope it works . It is life changing experience when traveling with kids and headphones .
 I bought this dvd player in the beginning of November this year . I got to play about 2 dvds before I startede seeing trouble with it playing movies . Then around the beginning of December , it stopped working . It just loads up and says invalid entry . Now I 'm stuck with a broke dvd player and I cant return it because I bought it at a Target across the country .
 After owning this product for only 6 months , the DVD player stopped playing . The website for Audiovox was difficult to navigate and find answers to my questions . The customer service department was rude and not helpful . I had to pay $ 16.00 just to send it back to them to be repaired !!! I think I 'm stuck with a very expensive paperweight . What happens if it breaks after the 12 month warranty ? I was very disappointed . The really bad part was it was a gift ... how embarrassing .
 i RECENTLY PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT TO USE FOR AIRLINE TRAVEL AND FOR USE IN MY mOTORHOME.i PLAYED DVD 'S AND CD 'S AND FOUND BEAUTIFUL SOUND AND PICTURE QUALITY.hOWEVER AFTER ONLY 3 USES THE UNIT COMPLETELY STOPPED WORKING.dISCS WOULD SPIN INTERMITTENLY AND NOT LOAD.i LOVED THIS PLAYER WHEN IT WORKED BUT I 'M AFRAID TO TRY IT AGAIN.tHE PLAYER HEATS UP WITH EXTENDED PLAY WHICH MANUFACTURER SAYS IS NORMAL BUT IT MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE BREAKDDOWN .
 My husband bought me this player less than 3 years ago for mothers day . The screen died while my son was watching it . I could get sound and a faint picture but mostly black screen . It was still under warranty when this happened . I dealt with Audiovox customer service regularly for 4 months before they replaced it with the D1730 stating that it couldnt be repaired . I was upset because I lost some of the features I liked about this DVD player ie
 I reacieved this machine from my company as a prize . Right from the start it would skip and freeze up , tried several different dvds with no avail . Eventually stopped working completely , dvd would not load `` invalid entry '' . Since I got it as a prize could not return it . I did however send in the warrantee card and contacted the company for repair . No suprise they did not have me on file so I had to get a letter from my employer stating it was given to me!Customer service does not know the meaning of service ! several calls and three weeks later I still do not have it back or any confirmation of when I will recieve it . Do not purchase this item , wo n't work and Audiovox does not stand behind their products ...
 I just purchased this thing one week ago . I tried a dvd given to me by a friend . The dvd kept freezing up . I thought it was the dvd . When I tried 2 brand new out of the box dvd 's . They both were freezing up . This is not the dvd player for me . Maybe this is a bad unit , I just do not know . I think I will look for something else .
 This player is the Best ! I was n't sure how well it would work for the price , since others I have looked at were `` considerably more '' . My son was thrilled with it . The quality of the picture is excellent , the sound is perfect , and it doesnt get hot . We have gotten over 3 hours on the battery , and the unit has not froze once . I would highly recommend it . Definitely got my money 's worth ! And Thank you Amazon.Com , as , you promised and delivered exactly like you said . Just in time for Christmas !
 This unit was a waste of money . After 2 days , it began skipping and would occasionally even freeze totally . The remote control did n't work properly , even within inches of the unit . The included ear-bud headphones only produced sound on one side . Made in Taiwan ... . Better go for the Japanese players .
 I personally did n't like it beacause of the strange color , it was rather ugly , and I used it twice and the speakers fried .
 picture is very bad sound not that good eather lacks lots of inportent features havey and bulkey almost like a notebook feels vary clumsey in your hand whorse of all whit slith tuceh dics door will open while playing
 We purchased this unit about 3 weeks ago and noticed the very first day how incredibly hot this unit gets ! We have only watched about 4 movies on it so far , but every time we do it gets very hot in the base near the AC/DC adapter , and the last time we used it , very hot in the upper left corner above the screen . It works fine so far , although the volume could be louder on the speakers . I can not believe that it is good for the unit to operate at these temperatures , and with all of the bad reviews , I plan on trying to return mine to Wal-Mart .
 After a single day 's use the DC adapter quit working . In order to get the necessary replacement , the warranty requires that you mail the entire unit back to Audiovox.This is a hassle that I did not anticipate having to deal with the day after receiving the player in the mail.Thanks for nothing Audiovox .
 I bought this for long trips and expected way more than what we recieved . After one hour it started to freeze , play for a few minutes , and then freeze again over and over . Finally it skipped all the way to the ending credits from the middle of the movie . I heard great reviews , but it is a lousy machine . I 'll wait for better quality at a lower price .
 The product was a good price so we purchased it as an intro to portable DVD players . Not worth the aggravation ! Has a terrific picture . Easy to operate . Sound/Volume is definitely too low for some situations . BUT this player gets hot way to quickly ! We have placed it in well ventilated areas , raised it , kept the lid open when playing it thru the television -- ALL to keep it cool . Not long after purchasing this , it started to malfunction - freeze up - misqueue dialogue , skip . Then very soon after it simply would n't play most DVD 's . Discs would spin intermittenly while attempting to load - never loading - no way would movies play . Then a few days later , it might work for a full movie or part of a movie . Then nothing . Exchanged it for another . EXACT same problems . It a shame . It had a great picture the few times it operated properly . DO NOT BUY !
 I bought this model new 2 years ago . This player was treated with kid gloves and never abused and only played about 100 hours in the last 2 years . It worked great for 18 months . Gradually I started noticing that some DVDs would not play on it . None of the newer Disney movies will work . Most new DVDs wo n't work I am lucky to get 1 out of 5 to play . and ... all the DVDs I have tried are new DVDs - not rentals.I took it back to the place I bought it and they cleaned everything and it still does not work ... In addition , this player is ok to listen to on audio if you are in a quiet place , but try to listen to it when there is noise - like in a car - forget it . The few times I took it in a car - I had to buy external battery operated speakers to be able to hear what was being played on the DVD!I spent alot of money on this and it is out of warranty - so I am out of luck . PLEASE . . if you are looking for a portable DVD player - do n't buy this piece of junk . Buy another brand.I 'll never ever buy anything with the name Audiovox on it again. : - -LRB-
 I was very disappointed in this product . The keyboard and mouse itself look great and feel high quality . The keys on the keyboard are ultra-quiet . However , the keyboard never worked -LRB- the mouse did work great and is the only reason I gave this product 2 stars as opposed to 1 -RRB- . Technical support for Memorex has very funky hours , but when they were open , they could only tell me that indeed , my keyboard did not work . Thanks guys . Office Depot/Amazon was great in returning the product even though the return period was up -LRB- which makes me wonder if this is a common problem -RRB- .
 The keyboard is n't too bad . Never had any trouble with it . The mouse is another story . It frequently needed to be reset with the receiving base . I used this combo to control my home theater PC , so I placed the receiving base by the computer about 5 feet away from where I sit . Everytime I needed to reset it , that involved playing with cabling to pull the receiving base out to a position where I can hit the `` reset '' button . Anyone who has an intricate wiring setup for their PC/Stereo/TV can appreciate that this is a hassle . Eventually , I grew bored of playing this game and stretched the receiving base out to the coffee table . Sure , there was an ugly cord stretched out in the middle of the room , but I was sick of having to dig it out.Another problem with the mouse is that it seems to go to `` sleep '' after 20 minutes of inactivity . Which means moving it does nothing . You have to click a button to wake it up . I 've had a screensaver running and having to click a button to wake up the mouse has ended up sending that mouse click to an application running under the screensaver . I try to use the keyboard to turn off the screensaver before waking the mouse.If that was n't annoying enough , the mouse NEVER EVER worked ! It was flaky . I 'd right click on the desktop , not move the mouse at all , and by the time the menu popped up , I was unable to move the mouse pointer . Distance from the RF base had nothing to do with this , as I was able to duplicate this 1 '' away from the base . In the middle of a mouse operation , the mouse would stop working . This happens every time I use it . Imagine the frustration of trying to control a DVD app , hitting the seek button , then having the mouse stop working when you need to hit play again . I have never owned such a difficult to use mouse , wireless or otherwise . I eventually lost my temper with it one day and through it down the stairs . Remarkably , this seemed to fix it , although temporarily.I have since paid up for the Gyration wireless combo and am happy I did . The keyboard may find another use in my house , but I can not get the mouse out of my sight quick enough . Basically , if having a mouse is important to you , walk away from this combo .
 They keyboard is great . After successfully installing and connecting it to the computer , it works like a champ . However , I would do something about the icons on the keyboard . They are n't always easy to interpret quickly.The mouse is another story . I could never get it to install via PS/2 . Plus , even if I had , the shape is not comfortable , as in the center front of the mouse , the shape rises to a high peak . Really high , and forcing my fingers to feel like they 're curling down .
 I have had this keyboard for 4 months . I never did like the mouse so I did n't use it other than to verify its function . It worked , but lacked 100 % every time precision that a cable-connected mouse has . The keyboard however , worked like a champ for about 3 months . Then for the last several weeks of its life I would have to re-initialize the transmitter/receiver . It would work fine for a day or two , then I would have to re-init again . Then finally it stopped even re-initializing . I did the normal troubleshooting , checked the batteries , connections , interference from other devices that transmit , etc. . I believe it has bought the farm .
 I purchased 2 of these items , on one of them , the LCD display does not work perfectly -LRB- the 0 as a part of 12:00 pm is missing a line of the 0 on the display - see my submitted pictures -RRB- but this is no big deal - the item still works OK.The other product arrived damaged since it has a battery compartment door that is made of cheap plastic at the bottom of the unit and UPS damaged it during shipping.It took me filing a complaint with Amazon just to get a response from this company , and the situation is still not resolved , they have not offered to send me a free return label to send it back to them.I will never order from Elmosworld again . Terrible customer service .
 This radio is insanely over-priced . You can get worse , but you ca n't pay more for it.The Oregon Scientific WR-8000 is a true piece of crap . Do not purchase it.I bought mine brand new in the box for two dollars at a church yard sale . Boy am I glad I did n't pay more for it.The Oregon Scientific WR-8000 is cheaply constructed all the way around . Everything about this shoddy radio is cheap cheap cheap . Want poor reception ? You got it ! Want brittle plastic that breaks easily ? You got it ! Want a compass that does n't work ? You got that too!Be prepared to do quite a bit of research to find an emergency radio worth owning . If it says `` Made in China '' avoid it if you can . If China does make anything worth owning they certainly do n't export it to the USA . `` Oregon Scientific '' is another term for cheap piece of Chinese crap.You will regret it if you buy this radio.Caveat emptor .
 Mine quit working a few days after buying it . The radio portion will only work for 3-4 seconds before volume fades to zero . Tried to contact Oregon Scientific for warranty for over three weeks -- no one answer the phone and e-mails go unanswered -LRB- not returned as undeliverable , but simply not answered -RRB- . I will never buy anything from Oregon Scientific again .
 I bought this product to put in my work truck . I was having issues of hearing my cell phone with volume . I was not able to clearly hear the phone , music , or GPS . I saw this item on amazon . It was exactly what I needed . I was small and compact with plenty of power . I was so excited when it arrived . What I got was a big and bulky speaker . No problem . I can adapt . I can still mount it in my work truck . I did just that . I put it next to my head rest . Now the moment of truth . I turned the phone all the way up . I plugged in the speaker . What a disappointment . I found no difference in the volume . This wonderful speaker made no difference in the amount of volume . In fact I 'm not sure if the phone speaker was not louder . I disconnected the speaker and threw it into my shop . What a piece of poop !
 Dear Manager , I ordered this product after viewing the picture , but was disappointed to receive that it was n't the one which I ordered for ... Zulfiqar
 Dear Amazon ; I placed this order pictured above ; Cobra HG S300 and I received a Cobra S300 instead . I have been greatly to all lengths dissappointed in the handling of this situation . I requested for UPS to come to my house -LRB- call tag -RRB- to pick this wrong item up and did not get any results from it . Therefore , I Will No longer place another order from ya 'll again . If I had received the correct order , I probably would have been a satisfied customer , but like I said , I am greatly dissappointed and would not recommend ordering from amazon . SORRY !!!!
 The speaker is great , but it looks nothing like the picture included with the item description . There is really nothing about that photo that is even remotely similar . I do n't know if I got an earlier version of this speaker or what . Amazon really needs to correct the photo on this item .
 Speaker they sent was a cheap imatation . A real letdown from amazon . They should change the picture .
 After about two years this weather radio has finally broken . All I get is static on everything . I called Oregon Scientific and they said there is only a one year warranty . While it worked , it was good but did not receive every warning or watch . Just bought the WR103 and hopefully that works better .
 I bought three of this particular model of NOAA radios in November 2000 . Within a week period in July 2001 , all three LCDs went blank , the memory failed , and the radio went haywire . When I contacted the company about this , I received no reply . If there was trouble with a specific batch , it should have been replaced . If this is their normal quality , I would stay away .
 I purchased my WR196T just last year . Despite rather confusing instructions printed on one sheet of extremely thin paper , I finally was able to get the radio working . That lasted less than a year when , suddenly , the unit failed to activate/respond to NWS alert signals , both real and tests . Trying to recode the radio , I discovered it would no longer accept any SAME codes.Oregon Scientific , manufacturer of the radio , says it does not offer any repair services and will replace a unit only within a 90-day warranty period . Since the radio is a rather expensive bit of electronics , you might be better served by buying a unit from a more responsive company .
 I ordered this unit because I wanted one radio that would both receive AM and FM , and also provide weather alerts . Surprisingly , the WR196T is one of the few on the market that combines these features . I ended up returning it to Amazon after 24 hours , for the following reasons
 It quit working completely after a couple months . Of course this was after the warranty ran up . It was used very little if at all during those months . Must have been defective , but what can I do now except buy another one , which i wo n't .
 Sorry everyone , I really wanted to rate this high , ... It came with no antenna , standard . Without an antenna , it picks up few neighboring countie warnings , and lousy radio reception . The radio stinks , sounds cheap , like a ... 4 transistor I had 40 yrs ago . Hard to program -LRB- I work with computers -RRB- , hard to operate . The alarm works half the time , probably due to no antenna . Save your money .
 This product has the most difficult programming instructions I have ever seen . Even changing the clock time -LRB- which you have to do 2X per year -RRB- proves to be a major challenge requiring the manual . The manual also must have been translated from Chinese as it is also difficult to understand ... even for someone like myself with a technical degree ! I tossed the product out after 6 months .
 I was initially quite happy with this drive . It is used in a Mac G4 for Final Cut Pro video files . The drive crashed without warning after less than 2 months . IBM has it right now . Hopefully they will replace it , but 120 gigs is a bunch of data to lose ! Most of it is replaceable , but some is gone for good . I 'm buying a Seagate to mirror the IBM with just in case !
 I recently ordered two of these antennas and have not yet had the opportunity to set them up on my CB radios for a test run . However , I did want to comment about the packaging for the products which I purchased from Amazon.com . The antennas arrived inside their original Mgf display packs which had been placed inside a narrow rectangular cardboard box with a strip of plastic air bags on either side for packing material . However , this did not prevent the cardboard box from collapsing & bending during shipping , which in turn bent the stainless steel antennas inside their packaging about 20 + degrees . I have spent the last couple of hours trying to straighten the antennas - the stainless steel material is not easy to straighten by hand , and I still am not done working with one of the antennas . It would have been nice if the packaging had been better -LRB- and/or the boxes marked as fragile -RRB- so this would not have happened . I am confident that these units will preform very well , but am not happy with the shipping - thus the 2 star rating .
 This is a very poor product ! On my first trip , it fell of my car roof at 40 MPH . Not nice.It is clear that the base is insufficient for an antenna of this length .
 No matter how well this antenna was tuned I could not participate in conversations over 1 mile away . Makes for a difficult caravan.It did stay perfectly on the suburban roof for the 3,000 mile road trip never once coming off . Buy a better antenna .
 Just like a lot of you i had the same problem happen to me i got the wrong cb antenna . It upsets a lot that amazon false advertised this item i was looking forward to the 1500 but all i got was a bottom of the line antenna . Before you buy this item please read the reviews and make sure if you going to get this item you 'll get the wrong one .
 I read the reviews and everyone had received the 1000 instead of theordered 1500 and I thought surely that problem had been fixed by now.Bad guess -- I received my 1000 instead of the ordered 1500 today 17 Jan.So it seems that Amazon is making no effort to correct the problem . Itdid n't even matter that the shipping order indicated a 1500 and the ordera 1000 was shipped . Do n't know yet what to do with it as others havereceived the wrong item more than once . This is unlike Amazon .
 I ordered the A1500 and received the A1000 . I opted not to send it back when I read the other feedback on this page . I did n't want to lose shipping costs and not get reimbursed -LRB- as the other fellow did below -RRB- . Amazon is usually pretty good , not this time , and not on this product.If you want , you can call them at :1.800.201.7575 -LRB- Toll free , US and Canada -RRB- 1.206.346.2992 or 1.206.266.2992 -LRB- Outside US and Canada -RRB- 1.877.586.3230 -LRB- Canada only -RRB- UK customer service
 Ordered an antenna the middle of Nov , 05 . Received wrong item with in 10 days . I let them aware of problem then I mailed back wrong item . Within 14 days I received duplicate of wrong item . After I emailed them to let them know of problem , I heard nothing . I had to send an ugly email , stating `` what 's up ? '' . They cancelled my order , then refunded original amount charged to credit card , plus .11 cents . Still fighting for them to reimburse me for my cost to send back 2 wrong items .
 I ordered the Cobra HG A1500 High Gear CB Antenna . They keep sending the Cobra HG A1000 . Now I 'm stuck with a antenna I did not order nor do I want .
 I have not used the antenna ... because I feel the magnetic mount is TOO WEAK!I like the size and it might work well , but I may never find out , since it feels like it would just slide off the vehicle .
 Cobra HG A1500 High Gear CB Antenna has an Item model number
 I gave this one star because choosing zero was not an option.This unit is extremely slow to begin with , but when you are in the mountains , or any type of tree cover -LRB- and possibly clouds -RRB- ... forget it . You would be better off with Ray Charles leading the way.I thought about purchasing data cables to upgrade the software , but the cable is almost as expensive as the unit .
 I 'm just an average consumer looking for a good deal with some quality . I did n't expect 5 miles , but I hardly got 1.5 . I live in the country in Wisconsin with few hills and no buildings . I liked the look of the unit . I thought , hey this will withstand the abuse and outdoors and no doubt after using it - it will . However , for anyone that goes through the process of getting an FCC license as required , this unit does n't perform as a GMRS unit should . Granted , you get the use of licensed frequencies , and it will tell you the temperature , but at .5 watts , its range leaves a lot to be desired ... I 'm just an average consumer with little knowledge of the radio world . But from one consumer to another , if you 're looking for something with the power to perform , this unit is not for you . If you 're looking for a durable radio for about 1 to 1.5 miles then this is a good buy . That 's my review and I only took the time to write it , because I do n't want others to buy something that they might not be happy with ...
 I bought this item , and I am very very unhappy that its power level is equal to that of any other average FRS radio , however , this is a GMRS and it should have two full watts of power going out the antenna , but it does not . All the literature indicates that its real power level is a mere 500mw , or half a watt.Why waste money on another 1/2 watt radio ? The features are nice , but not great , and the power level is very low for this kind of radio , so keep your money unitl Uniden realizes that features are important , but so is power.You have to wonder if newer technology is running up against established technology in the world of business radios .
 This fan * is * very quiet , when I hold it in my hand . However , when I mounted it to my Antec case 's internal exhaust tunnel , the thing buzzes like crazy . I think it must be something out of balance , and that the exhaust tunnel serves as an amplifier for the noise . I even bought Antec 's `` NoiseKiller '' product , which did n't help a bit.I also have a Zalman fan on the same exhaust tunnel , and it is ultra quiet .
 $ 129.99 is a `` hot buy '' ???? I bought this on clearance from the Belkin website 2 months ago for $ 30 . I would n't even recommend it at that price.The firewall will not close off everything it leaves `` port 0 '' open no matter what . And the only way to stealth port 80 is by redirecting it to a fake ip address.It also slows down such that browsing the web becomes an excruciatingly slow experience . The only way to fix it is to unplug the power and plug it back in whenever it goes slow . I have read reports that turning off the router 's DHCP server might prevent that from happening ... but DHCP is not something you should have to do without.This is an out of date product . Badly put together . Definitely not worth what Amazon is asking for it.Try to find a good deal on a Linksys or something ... do not walk , RUN away from Belkin products .
 This router slowed my PPPoE internet connection down to a crawl , both wirelessly and even when directly plugged into the router . After multiple calls to Belkin tech support -LRB- with horrendous hold times -RRB- and several firmware upgrades , I finally gave up . Got a Linksys instead , and it works great , no slow-downs or dropped connections .
 I have owned and have friends that own different routers then this one and none are as bad . Two major problems with this router :1 . Wireless range is BAD -LRB- I own a cheap router and it has twice the range -RRB- 2 . Router loves to disconnect from the internet when multiple PC 's are accessing the internet at once.I have the latest firmware which states it addresses the disconnect problem but does n't . Hopefully they will come out with a new version soon !
 This router will take a legitimate connection to a web site and turn it into an ad for belkin products ! The older models do n't but if you update the firmware -LRB- like maybe to close a security hole in the future , or for compatibility of a network game -RRB- you will start getting ads ! There are a couple of articles that are at popular news organizations that confirm this . BOYCOTT , DO NOT UPGRADE THE FIRMWARE !
 I have been using this router for six months now , first on Cable , then on DSL , and I can say without a doubt it is the worst router I have ever owned . With 3 computers on it -LRB- 1 wired and 2 wireless -RRB- , it needs to be reset every hour . The signal quality and range on the wireless is about half what its specs say that it should be . If this had n't been given to me free , I would demand my money back . I would recommend getting a Linksys , or better yet , save your money and get a real Cisco switch . This is a typical example of poor quality end-user junk .
 I bought this unit after my Linksys wireless router died ; I can therefore only compare it to the Linksys.Setup was EXTREMELY quick and easy . I got it up and running in just a few minutes . The UI of the admin app is very straight forward and I notice is strangely similar to the UI of SMC routers . I find it to be somewhat easier to work with than the Linksys UI.I am unfortunately not pleased with the transmission range of this router . I placed it in the exact same location that the Linksys had been in . A computer that was getting solid 100 % connection strength with the Linksys is now only getting 50 % with this unit . Another machine that was getting around 70 % on the Linksys would not connect at all to this unit until it was moved to a different location.This would be an excellent unit were it not for the range problem ... Perhaps there 's a fix ?
 I purchased this router to set up a home network with two wired computers and one wireless laptop . Setup was fairly easy , although there are no good instructions as to how to configure your computer or printers . The range is about 20 feet in my house . After that it gets below 21 % and loses its signal . I had to call Belkin customer support for setup help , and the best I can figure , the customer support center is in India . I do n't have a problem with that , but one of the guys I talked to said he did n't have a computer with XP on it , only W98 . I thought that was bizarre . They were never able to even comprehend what my problem was , but I finally solved it on my own . I would consider another product rather than this one .
 I have had this router for a month and i still ca n't get it to work . I get recognized all the way up to the part where I have to activate it over the net then nothing . this stinks I do not recomend
 The setup was easy enough , but the reliability of the wireless signal to my laptops was not acceptable . Speed drops dramatically for unknown reason and I had to reboot the router at least once a week because speed was so slow . After turning off and back on , speed was back to normal .
 From the first day I bought this product it had problems ... I called my service provider and we established that my connection is fine ... its definitely the router !! I called Belkin tech support and they tried to sell me service support in order to fix my problem !!! I managed to fix the problem for a few weeks but it RETURNED !! The thing keeps losing connection and i have to unplug and replug the darn thing to get it going again !! Its a pain ! i wish i had spent a few dollars more and got a decent router !!
 It seemed like a good idea at the time.But these are the old - 1st generation ? - routers and this one just flat out failed.Plus , the package had been previously opened so it might have been a return .
 This router has good functionality and ease of use , but reliability is more important for me and this router hangs about once a day , so I 'm giving it 1 star . You need to unplug the power cord and plug it back in every time to get it to work again.The range is a bit disappointing , too . About 30ft indoors.On the plus side , 128bit WEP and ability to limit access by MAC address are nice , and it 's very easy to set up.Reading around some forums makes me think that the hanging problem is not universal , so if you 're lucky enough to get one that works , it 's not a bad router if you do n't need long range wireless.For me , I 'm returning it for a refund .
 -LRB- ... -RRB- DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.It 's a lousy piece of hardware . I gave it away and bought a Linksys router that actually worked as advertised.The Belkin tech support guy actually told me to `` call Microsoft because their having a lot of problems with their browser '' . True story .
 Previously , I had always purchased and utilized HP printers and had been very pleased with the performace and value based on initial purchase price and cost of replacement cartridges . But when it came time to purchase a new printer I decided to review comparable printers available from other manufacturers and became interested in the Xerox P8ex due to it 's features , additional memory , price and the Xerox name . To be fair , set up was basically a `` no-brainer '' and I have no complaints regarding the quality of the printing , but these 2 ` qualities ' are not adequate reasons to purchase this printer . First , it 's much `` noisier '' , than other printers , it jams frequently , and it runs out of memory frequently despite the additional 2mb of memory than comparable printers . Based on the above you might think `` fine '' , it still sounds like a decent printer for the price . However , let me assure you that when you need to purchase that 1st refill cartridge , you 'll regret this purchase decision to the extent that like me , you 'll start looking for a new printer to replace it ! First , good luck trying to locate the replacement cartridges for this P8ex model at your usual retail and/or online stores , even your favorite superstores ! Be aware , the P8 model requires a different cartridge than the P8ex . I 've spent hours on line searching for replacement cartridges after being unable to locate at my usual office supply stores . As if this was n't disturbing enough , believe me when I state that once I located them at a few online stores I was horrified ! I have found the replacement cartridges to range from $ 115 - $ 145 each ! And that does n't include shipping if purchased online ! Maybe you can find a way to justify the price , but I ca n't . Especially when I became aware during my search that Xerox manufactures replacement laser cartridges for most every model of HP printer and they 're only HALF the price of the replacements for their own printers -LRB- at least the P8ex -RRB- ! So , here I am with a new Xerox printer and the realization that it would be cheaper in the long run to replace it with a NEW printer , than to continue to buy new replacement cartridges for the printer I already OWN ! In fact , considering the cost of the refill cartridges , the actual printer is MORE DISPOSABLE than the cartridges ! And NO , you wo n't be able to find the refill cartridges at the typical `` refurb cartridge '' site or find a `` no-name '' generic replacement either , I 've tried . So , I 'm in the market for a new printer , an HP . My only question is whether I 'll take advantage of purchasing the Xerox manufactured replacement cartridges for my new HP printer since they 're such a steal for the price ! But I doubt it , since why would I want to support a company that provides a product for the owners of another manufacturer 's printer at a reasonable price , while their customers are bleeding money to purchase replacement cartridges to enable them to use their Xerox printer ? HEAR THIS XEROX
 Please be careful ! This is a printer of 1999 !! , and ` THERE ARE NO DRIVERS ' for Windows 7 , Vista and even for Win XP ... How is it possible that they sell a printer that is no longer compatible with any current operating system today ?? , and that also Xerox ends to give support and software to this printer , for over 12 years ?? ... . Sorry for my english .
 Ok , so Windows XP might be a bit advanced for such an inexpensive camera , but I wanted a very basic webcam I could talk to my significant other with for a few months while we 're apart . This camera did n't come with drivers for Windows XP . I went to the website and downloaded what they said were the XP drivers , but still could n't get it to work . I had my partner try to get it to work on my computer , he could n't get it to work , and he 's a computer guy ! I finally sent it back and my brother-in-law and partner told me to go for the Logitech . I gave this one star because it did n't work for me ... it might work perfectly well on all other OS 's , but not on XP .
 Ca n't blame Amazon , but this webcam does NOT work with XP no matter what you try.I 've waisted hours trying to install it , downloading drivers that do n't work from the company 's website -LRB- and other sites as well -RRB- , speaking with customer support -LRB- who promised TWICE to e-mail me the drivers , but never did -RRB- , and after all that trouble , it still wo n't work.I would n't even try any other Micro Innovations products , due to their terrible support and service .
 The product is most likly good . But It when I try to install it to my computer , the class install manager denied my request to install it . This was very frustrating beacaues I have to return it . The Micro Innovations customer service was terrible , the people would lie over the phone just to get rid of you . The man said he would e-mail me the drivers I needed to install it to my computer with windows XP . But never sent them . Non of this is Amazons fault but I wish that they show weather its compatible with windows XP .
 This Camera DOES NOT WORK FOR WINDOW 'S XP . If anyone knows how to get it to work please add a review . I have tried 3 + hours to get it to work with no luck . Micro Innovations needs to take down the `` XP Driver '' they claim to work from their website . Do n't buy this cam if you have XP !!
 I 'm having lot of problems with this camera . Picture quality is poor . Software with this camera is not good for XP . There are drivers issues too .
 ok now i have had problems in the past with companys but never like this when a company says that they have an XP driver it means that it should at least work on window xp unless theres another OS named xp but hey dont buy this not even if you life depends on it .
 Ca n't blame Amazon , but this webcam does NOT work with XP no matter what you try.I 've waisted hours trying to install it , downloading drivers that do n't work from the company 's website -LRB- and other sites as well -RRB- , speaking with customer support -LRB- who promised TWICE to e-mail me the drivers , but never did -RRB- , and after all that trouble , it still wo n't work.I would n't even try any other Micro Innovations products , due to their terrible support and service .
 I downloaded XP driver from their website and patch also . Now XP doesnot complain about new hardware but I dont see ANYTHing on my camera . I dont know whats the problem . It run very well on my old PC but does not work on new one that has XP . SO as I changed my PC , i will have to go buy some other new webcam now .
 This thing is a huge pain in the -LRB- ... -RRB- to set up for XP . The drivers available online do n't contain all the necessary files , and I 've been trying for about an hour just to get XP to see that I have a camera connected . In this day and age , no hardware should be this difficult to set up , especially on a new computer running the latest OS . Luckily for me I got this camera free after rebate . And I think I overpaid . : S
 Works great out of the box . Problem is you ca n't configure it using the web based interface . You need the wizard ... that 's a problem the manual is worthless . Everyone withing a 500 radius of you will enjoy their `` free connection and bandwidth '' and that sucks .
 It worked wonderfully for two weeks using it to browse the web and moderate downloading , but when I tried to transfer a 1GB file over my network , it developed a 23 % packet loss that has persisted since . Presumably it overheated , but what a waste of $ 20 if I ca n't use my device without it breaking .
 I 've owned a Hollywood DV Bridge for more than a year , and also a Canopus ADVC100 . The DV Bridge is adequate for importing analog video into Adobe Premiere . Just adequate . But having the benefit of owning both products , I have no hesitation about recommending the ADVC100 over the DV Bridge . The ADVC100 allows you to lock audio to video during capture , the image quality is superior to that captured with the DV Bridge , and I have yet to drop a frame during capture with the ADVC -LRB- even with older vhs tapes -RRB- . The DV Bridge might look cool to some -LRB- I thought so when I bought mine -RRB- , but it 's simply not as functional as the ADVC100 because it tends to fall over when it has cables plugged into the front and back of the unit , whereas the ADVC100 is a nice looking box that sits flat and cables fit snugly . Snug cable fit is an issue with my DV Bridge because my S-Video cable fits somewhat loosely and works best if I wrap scotch tape around the unit and plug to improve the integrity of the S-video input connection . Finally , the ADVC100 has a built-in on-off switch while the DV Bridge does not . It 's a small thing I suppose , but I 'd rather not have to plug and unplug the DV Bridge 's power supply from my power bar after each use . It can get dusty down under my desk sometimes . Since getting the ADVC100 , my DV Bridge is officially retired . In my opinion , the Canopus product is superior to the DV Bridge in every way , and is the way to go for those interested in purchasing a product for capturing analog video .
 Please , I beg you , do not buy this product.The reason why ? It was a waste of -LSB- X -RSB- . I had an analog camcorder and was looking for a way to get the video on my computer . I sure was n't going to buy a USB capture device , so I figured a stand-alone Firewire -LRB- IEEE 1394 -RRB- capture device would work good , and Dazzle was pretty much the only brand that made one . Or so I thought . What I did n't know was that just about EVERY DIGITAL CAMCORDER has an Analog to Digital converter -LRB- before you buy one , make sure it does - it should say it somewhere on the box or webpage , as it is a popular feature -RRB- . So , for an extra hundred bucks , I could 've bought a decent Digital Camcorder that , along with being able to digitally capture video without being hooked up to a computer , converts analog video to digital MUCH better than the Dazzle Hollywood DV-Bridge . If only I knew that today.Why do I regret buying the DV-Bridge ? I have had mine a little over a year , and it did n't always work the best . It makes it extremely hard to capture segments from my analog camcorder . It will often drop frames , making the video you are trying to capture worthless . When the Hollywood DV-Bridge drops a frame , that frame is a mess of colors and a loud noise will accompany it on the audio track.When it is capturing regular , the video it captures is just OK quality - nothing spectacular . I also stopped trying to output video using the DV-Bridge , as it just does n't work . The longest I was able to get it outputting without stopping or the picture becoming distorted was around 40 seconds . However , I tried outputting the same exact DV file using the same program to a Sony Digital-8 Camcorder , and it worked fine.I would call Dazzle to complain or to see if maybe I got a defective product , but phone support is only free for 30 days - after that you have to pay -LSB- X -RSB- . The support it provides online is worthless and did n't help me at all.So please , learn from me and absolutely do not buy this product , as paying -LSB- X -RSB- for peice of garbage that gives you a headache just is n't worth it .
 Top Five Reasons NOT to buy a Dazzle Product :1 - Technical Support is non-existant .2 - The video editing software sold with the bridge is buggy , and you need to immediately order an update CD from -LSB- website -RSB- . -LRB- The only way to discover that you need the update is by going to their web page after you start experiencing problems with the software that is supplied with the bridge . -RRB- 3 - Hollywood Video Editing Software -LRB- The updated `` non-buggy '' version -RRB- frequently locks-up for no apparent reason ... but it does work better than the `` buggy '' version . My PC is a 1.8 MHz P4 with 256 MB of RAM , 37 GB hard drive , and 32 bit video . My Windows-XP task monitor does not indicate that I am using up my system resources , however I need to save my storyboard everytime I make an edit because the software locks up with no warning .4 - Audio/Video Output is poor . Audio playback is slightly faster than video , and by 20 minutes you will feel like you are watching an old Chinese Kung-fu movie . This is true when watching the video on the PC , or after it has been recorded to an external device .5 - When you FINALLY get the software/hardware to output to a VCR , you will find that the picture is poor , and audio is plagued with occasional high-pitched `` pops '' . I have not attempted to burn a DVD yet , but I am prepared to be disappointed because nothing else has worked as advertised . -LRB- Oh , did I mention that the technical support is non-existant ? -RRB- Dazzle does provide a users forum that you can subscribe to after you purchase their product . The advantage of the forum is that you will learn that you are not alone . The disadvantage of joining the forum is discovering that you are not alone , and there are few solutions to the many problems .
 The device I purchased is only capable of capturing about 1-2 minutes of video before it starts dropping frames from older tapes . The Dazzle forum is full of similar complaints . Dazzle has done nothing to rectify the problem , and they blame PC setup as the cause . I tried all of the tech suggestions for Win XP and the problem was not fixed . Some newer tapes captured with only minimal `` choppiness '' problems , but the majority of my tapes are older and caused the bridge to lose sync and produce a choppy , noisy , unwatchable DVD . After a month of troubleshooting , I replaced the Dazzle with a Canopus ADVC-100 . The price is similar , but the results are far superior to the Dazzle bridge . No lost frames anymore , even from the older tapes , and the picture quality is superior to the Dazzle Hollywood DV Bridge . I just wish I would have done the research before I bought the Dazzle unit . The Canopus ADVC-100 is an outstanding performer , and it actually delivers what is promised from Canopus , unlike the false claims from Dazzle . If you are smart , you will steer clear of the Dazzle unit .
 this is a great product in theory . i was only able to get it to capture a few minutes of video at a time before the product would shut down . goto dazzle website and read the pages ! and pages ! of customer complaints . be wary !
 The Hollywood DV-Bridge was easy to set up and use , but it will randomly disconnect from the 1394 bus . In my case , it disconnects every 10-40 minutes . This seems to be power related - if the source is on the same supply as the bridge and computer , I can up the disconnect interval to several hours ... > The worst part is support . My original complaint to Dazzle was submitted 2 Jan 03 , and the first response came 13 Feb 03 !! Today I tried calling tech support this morning and hung up after being on hold for more than an hour on their toll number.The two responses I 've had from them so far -LRB- via email -RRB- have only repeated information in the database you can search yourself on the web plus one reference to an irrelevant Microsoft knowledge base article.The support alone should be enough for anyone to avoid this product .
 I read all the reviews first and took a chance . Big mistake , but fortunately Amazon is pretty good about the returns . I had the same problem I keep reading about . It works for a minute or so , then it just quits when I 'm in the middle of capturing video . That makes it pretty much useless .
 Email from ADS tech support will tell you the clips are not compatible , with any of iLife software , try to find that in writing before you buy the product ...
 This player is great for DVDs , unfortunately I bought the player for its 5 disc cdr/mp3 playability . The player makes 2 second jumps on every song of every cdr I own . I took it in to get fixed . When I got it back , I plugged it in and still does the same thing .
 As others have mentioned this player is extremely slow to operate - slow to load DVD 's slow to start playing , slow to change discs . Any command from the remote takes 1-2 seconds to initiate.But the main problem for me over the past 2-3 years has been progressively worsening skipping and disk errors . Brand new DVD 's simply will not play on this player . Some will play flawlessly , but I have not made it through a single movie without the DVD player freezing or locking up . There are some cases where the player will shut itself off!As of now it will not play 75 % of my DVD 's , saying `` disc error '' . I am replacing this unit and have decided never to buy another piece of Toshiba consumer electronics again .
 I have had this DVD player for 15 Months . About 3 MOnths ago , it started to take to skipping . It does not happen on all DVDs , but most . Usually it takes about 30-40 Minutes , and then you have to turn the playe off and on to get it to stop if you are lucky . Also , it sometimes does not read DVDs in the tray . Pretty poor in my opinion.That being said , the one positive I will give it is that the Picture is really nice . I do n't know that I would buy a Toshiba DVD player again .
 Just forget it . Do n't buy it , period . I 've had two in the past year . The first broke within one week of receipt and it took Toshiba Customer Service more than TWO MONTHS to replace it . The replacement unit broke within a month . Toshiba Customer Service was awful - a totally anti-consumer attitude . Thanks to this inferior product , I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM TOSHIBA EVER AGAIN !
 A couple of months into owning this DVD player , it started to skip on some DVD 's . Eventually it got bad enough to where it would n't play any disc 's at all , it only gives me an error on the front saying `` disc error '' even with brand new dvd 's . doh !
 Would have been zero stars if they 'd let me . this is the single most disapppointing piece of consumer electronics I have bought in a decade or more . For starters , while they call it a changer , if you want to use it as a five-disc CD changer and have it automatically switch from one disc to the next , you have to turn on your TV eash time , go through a menu and reprogram the thing . the company tells me that this is because the CD player part of it is only an `` added feature '' and not the main purpose of the unit . Secondly , it is extraordinarily slow to respond to any inputs ; if you power it up , it takes 30-45 seconds before it will accept any commands at all . And it is pretty choosy about what commands it will take from the remote even from two feet away pointed right at it . My own unit had a major catastrophic failure of the sort that they tell you is the reason not to by cheapo DVD players -LRB- which is why I bought a fairly pricey one -RRB- but that might have jsut been this one . Might have . I thought the manufacturer 's attitude , whcih was basically `` tough if youdo n't like the way it operates , and we had no responsibility to tell you in promo material that it would n't really work as a CD changer '' was pretty irresponsible , but that 's just me . I 'm gon na unload it . Anybody want a used one , a fter i get it fixed ? I 've put all of 15-18 discs sthrough it .
 I 've had this about a year and a half . I liked everything about it , but a few months ago it started skipping sometimes when playing CDs . I tried using cleaning disks but it 's just gotten progressively worse , now it 's just too annoying to play a CD . I called Toshiba and they said the CD lens probably needs to be replaced , I called an authorized service center and that would cost $ 150 . haha.We had a Sony before that likewise died after about 2 years ... From reading reviews , it seems that anywhere from 30-50 % of even high-end CD/DVD players wo n't last more than 2 years.It really is ridiculous .
 I 've only had this a few days , so I ca n't comment on reliability . I 'd probably return this if it was n't so close to Christmas and did n't have time to get another gift.Things I like : - The picture quality is pretty good - The screen is large - You can put your camera 's SD card in , and it finds subdirectories on the card and displays the picture -LRB- or at least it works that way with my Casio -RRB- . Things I do n't like : - The resolution is NOT 640x480 as described . It is 800x480 . Wider than 640x480 , but nonstandard . So if you upload a picture with standard 4:3 image ratio , there are dark gray -LRB- black but not true black -RRB- bars on the side . You really have to crop the pictures to have them look good . - Only holds 20 pictures on internal memory -LRB- not dependent on size , it has a hard limit in the UI -RRB- . Plan on buying an SD card . - The directions are not very good . - The UI is hard to work with , but eventually I got through it OK . - The USB port is just to connect to a thumb drive or similar -LRB- not to your computer -RRB- . This turns out to not be such a problem , because you 're going to have to get an SD card anyway so the USB is not very useful.Things I did n't try : - Multimedia features
 I bought both the Axion AXN-9700 7-Inch Widescreen LCD Digital Picture Frame and Coby DP772 7-Inch Widescreen Digital Photo Frame with MP3 Player in the same time.Comparing it to Copy its just not the value for money , the colours arent that good so if you want to put the frame on a desk or table the people around wont have a good luck unless they take it and stare at it to realize whats the pic . about.in summary you dont want to spend this money on something not that value.try other brands i suggest
 I 've only had experience with the Pandigital 7 and 8 inch models and the Axion 9 inch - so this all have have to compare with . The Panditigals are SO easy - just link to your computer and your done . Do n't need a memory card at all -LRB- as long as you reduce the storage , there 's lots of built-in storage -RRB- . The 7inch widescreen automatically adjusts the photos to widescreen so there are n't any bars on the right and left sides.After saying that about the Pandigitals , here 's what I have to say about the Axion . I bought this because it was only $ 99 - `` What a deal , '' I thought when buying it in May 2007 -LRB- compared to the $ 80 7 '' and $ 130 8 '' Pandigitals -RRB- . But if you are going to show more than 20 photos -LRB- regardless of size -RRB- , you HAVE to use a memory card - so figure that into your costs if you need to buy a new one . Here 's are some of my thoughts : The Look - It 's a widescreen - a little less than 8 '' by 5 '' . The `` wood '' frame is plastic and I do n't really care for it . There 's a black plastic inner border that is nice to help mask the photos that do n't come all the way to the edge.Uploading photos - If you do n't care about black blank `` bars '' being on the right and left side of your photos , then this is a great deal for you but you really do n't get the full advantage of the screen size . If you bought an 8 '' screen , you would n't have to deal with this model 's widescreen `` bars '' issue and you get about the same screen space in the end . I found the `` bars '' distracting and could n't not figure out how to fix this consistently via the frame 's program . Therefore , I took the time consuming effort to edit each photo to a wide frame size . Shutterfly Studio -LRB- downloadable for free -RRB- allows you to do this at 16x5 . Then I reduced the resolution to 72 dpi . I even changed my portrait sized photos into landscape widescreen size since they really look better . The slide show mode does not shuffle the photos . However you load them is the same order they are shown , over and over . One nice thing about this unit is if you saw a photo that you want to see again and want to go back to it , it 's easy to press the back button to see it again . When in the slide show mode , the fading between one photo and the next is the same it scrolls on from the top to the bottom . There 's no variation -LRB- the Pandigitals offer variation -RRB- . The Mechanics - It comes with some kind of chord but it does n't fit into a computer . Not sure what you 'd use it for but you ca n't directly connect with the computer to the frame . I guess since you really need a memory card to put lots of photos on , it does n't matter . I needed to connect my computer to my camera , load the photos and then pull the disk out and put in frame . The remote control is nearly completely useless . The receiver is behind the unit and you need to point it directly at it to make it work . Fortunately all the buttons found on the remote are on the back too . There 's no spot to store the remote in back of the frame . I found maneuvering through the menu functions rather difficult and frustrating . Once you get the photos formatted , loaded , and running , it 's nice but it 's lots of effort to really make it look good . The screen is like a screen on a laptop - you can touch it -LRB- there 's nothing protecting it -RRB- and when you touch it , it 's kind of springy.I hope this helps you know what you might be purchasing .
 I got this a couple of days before Christmas and found it did not come with a remote . I was also VERY dissatified with the unit not havining the USB ports.It works nice with black and white photos after resizing . Microsoft has a nice FREE resizer.Overall for the money I guess it is a good buy if you know what to expect . If I had it to do over I would pay a little more for a unit that had all that I wanted ... I guess MOMMA was right , You get what you pay for ...
 I ordered this digital frame for a friend of mine for Christmas specifically because the brown color shown in on Amazon web site photo matches color of her furniture . There was no other color option when I placed the order so I was sure that brown was the only available color . However , the one shipped to me was in black . When I called the company that sold the item via Amazon , I was told that the long retired old model was only in brown color and the new model is only in black . Since black does n't match my friend 's furniture color , I have to return it . I wish that Amazon had updated the product photo and description to reflect it 's actual features so that I would not waste my time ordering and returning the item with incorrect color .
 Very disappointed in the quality of this product . The screen is extremely dim , and additionally it has other rand issues that will come up . I 'd recommend a Ziga screen instead .
 1 tiny page of instrustions , printed on just one side . Very frustrating.Also , as another reviewer pointed out , you cannont connect this to your pc ... only a thumbdrive . There is no software included with the frame.This screen is nice and big , but overall its been a frustrating experience .
 I have been very disappointed in this frame . The display is dim and blurry . This frame has taken my 8 megapixel photos and made them look like old grainy photos . The aspect ratio is wrong which means that you are not getting the benefit of a 9 '' screen unless you crop every picture . If you display them straight from the camera , you lose an inch on each side due to the aspect ratio . At least it does n't stretch them to fit and therby distort the image but the screen does n't have the correct resolution for pictures .
 My husband ordered this frame at a local electronics store as a Christmas gift . After a month and a half , I was very excited to pick it up today . My excitement was short lived . In the box was the frame , an ac adapter and a small 1 pg manual . The manual inside the box stated that is comes w / a remote and a usb connector . At first I thought they were just missing form the box , but after looking at the frame I noticed that there was no place for a usb connector.I took it right back to the store and requested a refund !!
 Ordered two of these as gifts - expected to easily be able to transfer pictures from my computer to frame since it was advertised as coming with a USB port adapter . Not so . The adaptor included is not a USB standard size but for a flash file . Also , one of the two boxes arrived with no adaptor at all .
 After a lot of agonizing over which digital frame to get I chose this one . I guess its OK but it is n't what I expected it to be . For one thing it did n't come with any instructions or info on how to set up the photo 's on the memory card or how to put some of them into it 's limited internal memory . I read reviews that said it would show several 100 to 1000 's of photos on one 512mg SD card . I cant get it to show more than about 120 photos and only those on the card that are not in a folder and only in one long slide show . I cant get it to show anything in separate folders or sub-folders . As for the mp3 playing I have n't tried that yet.Picture quality is OK and it only takes extra time to load them if they are very large . If you re-size them for the size of the screen they load OK . Overall I 'm disappointed in it for what it cost me . But I guess that we are n't supposed to want very much out of something that 's a little over $ 100 any more .
 Just opened to get ready for christmas and was disaapointed . No remote , as discribed , no instructions to get the pictures to fit `` full '' frame . RETURNING this frame . Went and got a similar frame for 10.00 more and just put the SD card in and I had to do nothing . A review below tells you how to size your photos , but what a hassle . This frame will be my first return to Amzaon after many purchases .
 I bought this for my wife at Christmas after doing a search for frames with a USB port so that she could load some of the pictures that she has stored on her laptop . The original description said it came with a remote and the port , actually it came with neither . All in all the picture quality is decent for the price , the flash storage is something that you usually do n't find on frames in this range , and now I see that I was n't the only person taken in by false advertising .
 Length :
 Bought 1 Item and got some cheap junk ... . item was completely different from what was pictured ... . picture quality was like garbage !!!!!
 yes it displayed all of the pictures once , in a wide format that is not very high and is a bit grainy . I have owned a Philips from several years ago that had a much superior display . Then the real disappointment
 First off , the frame was black , not brown as displayed in the picture , which was a major reason why I bought this item in the first place . After we had plugged in the memory card and turned it on , it only worked 3 times before it stopped displaying the pictures . It would say slideshow but show a blank blue screen . I do n't know if we just happen to buy a lemon product , but as a result I will not buy any Axion product ever again .
 I sent an email with the following question to customer service : `` Which formats may I play on Axion AXN6079 7-Inch Twin Monitor Portable DVD System ? `` First email answer : `` This unit will play most formats . '' Signed by Reginald K. Johnson.Asked again : `` Will you be so kind to tell me exactly which formats does it play ? There are more than 30 video formats ... Textual Answer : `` All excerpt VCD 's . '' Signed by Reginald K. JohnsonThird email
 When you load it up with pictures , choose you custom settings , and give it to your granny ... You will find that your custom settings are forgotten every time it is unplugged . This is inexcusable !
 This digital picture frame is probably the biggest money-waster you will ever have . I have just received one as a gift and nothing works on it . The screen is supposed to be touch-sensitive but it is not ; the buttons have response time of well over 2 seconds ! By the time the `` copy '' button activates the `` copy '' screen , the picture I wanted to save on the digital frame has moved on ... furthermore , once the option does come up , it wo n't go away and I can not even see the next 2 pitures showing . I have not been able to save any of my pictures on the built-in memory ! The picture quality is very poor ! In the age of flat screen monitors , this is a BIG junky ! Save your money !
 Reason why this product is not recommended by me : The transitions between photos takes too long -LRB- 2.5 - 3 -RRB- seconds.It is not as smooth as the other brands I 've seen in stores.I put 2 different kinds of SD cards in the unit to view my photos.After taking the cards out , all of the photos were destroyed and can be only viewed by using the axion unit . I tried every means possible to retrieve or fix the photos . I tried Bad Disk Pro , various card readers , everything . I also did everything I could to figure out where I could send the unit for repair , but Axion has very little to no info online . Stay clear of this unit and this company .
 The product was very poor quality . The refresh of the pictures was very slow and not worth it . I had to return it - it was a gift and was going to be embarrassed.I have since bought a Kodak and liked it very much - the idea is good however this is not the frame to buy .
 For a cheap first try into digital frames , this one 's not too bad . However , there are reasons why it 's cheaper - most importantly , the screen quality is nowhere near good , at all . Pictures are blurry and colors too shiny . Pictures also take a good 5 seconds to show up in the slideshow mode . Other than that , the frame itself is cheap plastic , and there is no USB port , which is a huge bother . I guess it 's a cheap mistake - but it 's sure a better idea to spend some more money and buy a frame where pictures show up as they should .
 I have two 8 '' picture frames that are other brands , and they are GREAT and I use them for Open Houses all the time ! I got this one as a gift from a friend , and it is terrible !! The instructions are difficult to understand . The wide screen makes everyone in the picture look FAT and distorted ! This is a weird size and I am not happy at all !! I do n't recommend it .
 When I bought this , it was the most affordable digital picture frame so I thought to give it a try.Unfortunately , the pictures did not turn out as good as I had hoped.I even resized it so that it does n't have to resize itself but 480 x 234 pixels does n't really help.I realized that I had to go for about an 800x600 pixels to get a quality that I can accept so I returned it.The only good thing was that you can put batteries in it to make it mobile unlike many other frames .
 It appears that the Netgear MA401 802.11 b Wireless PC Card will not work with this network adapter.Belkin 's site claims : Q
 This is a terrible product . I have had the device not working error -LRB- 10 -RRB- and have tried every configuration . Buy something else and not Belkin networking .
 I thought I would be smart and go the route of buying a PC card for my Lappy and then the adapter for my desktop so that I could use my PCCard in a PCI desktop slot . I got the F5D6020 like the info tells us to do to use the above product . The PC card works great for my Lappy and I am able to connect to my wireless network no problem . The issue though is that I have installed the PC Card reader that yall see above -LRB- i.e. the F5D6000 -RRB- on my Desktop and plugged in the PCCARD to the adapter . Upon install everything goes great . It looks like everything is a go , but then I get an error . The error says : Device Can not Start -LRB- Code 10 -RRB- I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers , even tried installing the PCI adapter onto another desktop . All results are the same ... I get the Code 10 error and the device will not start . I am at wits end and tried to contact tech support . No answer at all !!! I have been to MS Support and even fished the Belkin online support and still nothing stating anything about the product and whats going on . The only thing I have come up with is the fact that my F5D6020 card is a version 2 model , what ever this means . I have Googled my heart out and nothing seems of importance . I am stuck and no help forth coming and no support from the site at all . Why would Belkin create an identical PC CARD and name it the same freaking thing if it would not work in this reader . Also why are places allowed to sell these two items with no concern that a incompatability might exist .
 first of all . . it aint compatible w/windows xp and even if by some miracle you got it to work , it only uses the version 1 pcmcia card which belkin dont make anymore . ! man what a nightmare . ! luckily I only paid 10 bucks + $ 5 s/h and was able to pawn it for the same amount THANK GOD so my advice is try another route .
 This product is not compatible with windows XP even though it says it is . Their customer support is horrible they have no idea what thay are saying , they can not speak engligh , they do not know anything about their own products . they will give you a run-a-around if you call them and they will blame you for the product not working . They hung up on me several times . Very Very Very Very VERY RUDE ! If you can at all avoid belkin , please do .
 I agree , this is a piece of crap , and does n't work with XP . Belkin also does n't have any updates or fixes on their website . And I still have n't received my $ 20 rebate for purchasing this thing from Office Max , and that was nearly a year ago . In fact , I do n't think I 've ever received a rebate for things I purchased at Office Max , but it is hard to say for certain , because their advertised rebate specials are never in stock.On the flipside , the laptop card works fine .
 The radio looks good and has nice features , but there is a problem that can not be overcome.You have to press the PTT button for at least 2 seconds before talking . Why ? The PTT button is a dual-function button . Obviously it is a PTT , but it is also a Monitor button . This makes it necessary to hold it down for at least 2 seconds before talking . Getting people to realize this and have them remember to do this is next to impossible.This made the radio very frustrating to use . I eventually sent them back for a refund .
 ... but who knows , because software & manual ABSOLUTELY is worth nothing , the people who 've written the la-la-la happy comments above are either 1 -RRB- employed at Belkin , 2 -RRB- fortunenate enough to have a configuration of Win XP/2000/98 that by chance worked with the dreadful driver & configuratin software or 3 -RRB- have probably learned by now that this product is , to a degree rarely seen , a piece of c++ p !!!
 The card itself seems to work okay . After following the installation instructions , it installed connected first time on my Win XP notebook.However , Belkin 's software is , as usual , quite poor . In the first half hour of testing , their control program froze up once and went wonky on me another time -LRB- all the tabs just vanished -RRB- . I never could get the profiles feature working correctly - it 's supposed to save different network profiles for different locations , but it did n't work . The worst part , however , is that the WEP password feature just would NOT work with my Apple Airport base station ... if I had a password enabled on the station , it would not connect at all . I 'm no dummy about this stuff , and I tried all the options -LRB- including entering the password in hexadecimal -RRB- . The software , to put it bluntly , is broke.Fortunately , the installer gives you the option of using Windows XP 's built-in card control software . After uninstalling the Belkin stuff and reinstalling -LRB- selecting the Win XP option -RRB- everything worked fine , including the WEP password stuff.I have a Belkin UPS on my computer , and the software for it is very poor as well . You think I would 've learned my lesson about Belkin , but I got this card for really cheap . I figure I might as well keep it since I got it working . You , however , have been warned .
 One word
 After hours of trying to get this card -LRB- version 1 -RRB- to work with my win2000 laptop I finally in a desperate attempt installed the driver for the Compaq WL100 , which is also based on the PRISM-2 chip set . To my astonishment it WORKED !! For the first time my card connected to the access point . After this I could use the Belkin configuration utility to configure wep etc. . Moral of the story
 Card installed , but never worked correctly . Tried upgrades from Belkin , had assistance from tech support . Nothing worked . This was on a Sony z505hs with windows 2000 . Everything else works fine in this computer/pc card port , not the Belkin card .
 I 've spent countless hours both on my own and with Belkin tech support and this card will not work on a machine with Win98SE . I went and got a Netgear card and BOOM , it worked right away.Belkin tech support is HORRIBLE . It is overseas and the people on the phone 1 -RRB- do n't know computers and 2 -RRB- have a tough time with the English language and tech terms.Do yourself a HUGE favor , do n't get this at any price .
 1 -RRB- Both the driver downloaded from the website , and the one comes with the CDROM work for WinXP without any problem at all .2 -RRB- Stop working whenever it 's hot -LRB- usually after 30 minutes to an hour -RRB- .
 Tech support states that this card is known NOT to work with win98se -LRB- F5D6020 ver .2 -RRB- . BEWARE trying to install the Compaq WL100 card 's driver as a work around . My 98se box just kept VXD-blue screening after I installed the compaq WL100 driver trying to get this belkin card to work . Both cards may be based on the PRISM-2 wireless chipset , and this MAY or MAY NOT work for windows 2000 -LRB- as reported also in these feedback results -RRB- , but it definitely is NOT a workaround for win98 . I can see the card alright in device manager , the lan monitor utility comes up ok , but the card will not save settings for WEP or anything else ... I.E. the card can not be configured using win98se .
 After struggling to get my Belkin Wireless card to work in my laptop running Windows 95B I finally called for Tech Support . According to them , only Version One of their wireless card will work with 95B . I had a Version Two . Version One cards can be identified by a single LED Light on the card while later versions have two lights.At any rate , I 've still been unable to get the card to work with Windows 95B as its been advertisied . Tech support was no help after I exchanged my Version Two Card for a Version One and was down right rude after I followed their instructions and still could n't get the card to work.If you 're planning on using the card with Windows 95B , be sure to get a Version One card , and be prepared for a lot of disappointment .
 I do n't understand why BELKIN do n't have different product # or Manufacturer # . This product has version1 , version2 and version 3 . Each version uses different chipsets and does not support all the OS -LRB- For example ver2 does not work on Win NT -RRB- . I got this product thinking its version 1 which has support for Win NT but I got version2 which does not . Also did not find drivers anywhere to make this work for Win NT
 I 've had a horrible time with this F5D6020 PCMCIA card . I 'm quite adept with wireless networks - have two laptops and several desktops with wireless cards in them . Some of the biggest problems I 've had have been with this Belkin card , Windows Zero Configuration for wireless networks , and WEP secured networks . I connect to wireless networks , secured and unsecured , just fine , but the drivers are mangling ARP , and so I ca n't run TCPIP over the connection.Despite the fact that the card is advertised to work with XP , it does n't include signed drivers - and the drivers it does have are what 's wrong with it .
 Despite downloading the XP drivers from Belkin support for this card , XP says `` Can not install this card '' . I really dont want to put Belkins 's support to the test -LRB- been there before and they are hopeless with very poor spoken english -RRB- , this peice of cr4p is going back ASAP .
 It 's a poor quality card ! Getting it to work with XP is one pain and then software and else !! This card does n't give you a good range -LRB- others do very good -RRB- and is not supported by many softwares -LRB- such as Boingo.com -RRB- and networks and is not recommended either ! So I would definately ask you not to buy this card please ! unless you are a computer expert and like to deal with challenges and deal with a poor range !
 Windows XP includes a utlility that allows setup of a wireless network card . This card is not recognized by XP as such , and the setup is next to impossible . Sent mine back and bought a different brand .
 I was very disappointed in this product . First of all , the integrated pointing device was extremely slow -LRB- even on the fastest speed -RRB- . Also , after I loaded the software and initially programmed the programmable buttons , I could not reprogram the buttons or print out a button guide . The instructions in the guide did not work as they said they would .
 This keyboard works about as well as any of the wireless keyboards I 've used . As usual the pointing device works about as well as that of any laptop -LRB- pretty bad -RRB- . It also sometimes misses , or doubles up on keystrokes . The internet keys across the top are a waste of time , mainly because the included software is pretty poor . It does not integrate well with Windows XP , and appears to have been written for a much earlier version . As usual , no Linux version of the software . Keep in mind though , I 've tried many wireless keyboards in the past , and they are all pretty much like this one .
 Received this keyboard today and was very dissapointed . I ca n't believe IBM actually allowed Micro Innovations to put their logo on this item . When typing , the keystrokes either were not recognized or would display seconds later . Receiver `` data '' light blinks showing that are you pressing keys , however , the keystrokes are not sent to the computer.Returning item now as I type on a good/working LOGITECH wireless RF keyboard .
 Could n't get key 's to work . Mouse slow.Returned .
 Bought this keyboard after having previous experience with an RF Wireles Keyboard + Mouse from memorex . Was interested in a combo unit . The range of this unit is barely 8ft with many `` blind '' spots where the signal drops out . Very unlike the memorex unit . It 's possible I just got a defective unit . But an online review from another person listed simliar problems . Avoid . Hope someone can find something better .
 Just got this from ups opened it up . and the main part that attaches the antenna to the stand is missing . So pretty much useless and a waste of time and money .
 Do not have good radius with this antenna , may work well if your driving by a truck stop or something but not good if you want to talk to someone more then a mile away .
 i had to order a SWR meter due to transmitting a ton of static when talking to other drivers . they said its extreamly statically and i sound like charlie browns teacher so i hope with getting a SWR meter this will fix the issue otherwise im going to get my money back . i will give this a 2 star rating only becuse for its size its pretty cheap
 Could not get a good swr with this antenna . Magnet mount is ok , seen much better . Go with a Little Wil
 I was n't very impressed with this antenna at all . Upon taking it out of the box the rubber cover that is supposed to be wrapped around the magnet mount fell on my garage floor . This thing is a cheap piece of junk . Save your money and your time and get the Little Wil . The rubber that is wrapped around the magnet is beyond cheap and the rest of the antenna is not very impressive either . Mine went back to Amazon .
 I clearly ordered an HG A1500 Cobra CB Antenna and I received an HG A1000 Cobra CB Antenna . One of the other reviews shows the same thing happened to them . Before you order from Amazon you better check if you can get it at a local store first so you know what you 're getting .
 I travel through the mountains each time I go to Florida . This antenna was not big enough to handle the hills and vallies .
 Ordered the antenna and was missnig the bottom section of it to screw into the base . I was told I would could get a 20 % discount since it 's defected , but hows that going to help me if I ca n't use it . I would suggest spending that extra ten bucks and guarantee all of your parts . Just sharing my personal experience .
 PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK COULD NOT GET RECEPTION EVEN BOUGHT GOOD ATTENA STILL COULD NOT CONNECT I THINK IT IS JUNK .
 i bought this antenna hoping to get reception on my midland 75-822 40 channel cb radio i got 0 reception and 0 transmition with it i hope the company that took my money is happy as i will never buy anything from them again fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me
 Unit arrived in a box that was sealed with a stip of clear tape on either side looking like a 6 year old did the job . The box was sealed together so badly the tape stuck to the items inside causing you to rip everything apart . The antenna itself is just a cheap poorly painted metal rod whose thin paint arrived with a chip . As soon as the flimsy package was opened the few parts there were fell out and went about the room . 1 part never to be seen again was the tip that covers the end . As stated by other reviewers the `` rubber '' base is nothing more than rubber that is quite literally as thin as a condom . The `` decorative '' plastic piece at the base of the antenna is the same plastic you 'd see on a cheap water pistol . If I could give this cheap item a zero I would . Already bought a quality antenna elsewhere . Not worth the time and money sending it back .
 This antenna will not give an acceptable SWR match with the new Cobra 75 WX ST SoundTracker CB radio . I was forced to return to my old antenna.Wasted $ 56.00 plus tax for two to go with two new CB 's .
 The base of this antenna includes a rubber boot which does not stay in place . The antenna itself is tall , and the magnet is relatively weak . This means the slightest brush with an overhead object -LRB- tree branch , beams in a parking garage , etc -RRB- causes the antenna to fall over . When the antenna falls over , the rubber boot falls out of place , leaving it hanging on by a very small area that is caught between the edge of the base and the roof of the vehicle . This makes it impractical to leave on your car most of the time -LRB- in my case a Jeep Grand Cherokee -RRB- . So keeping this thing inside your vehicle is also a nightmare . The antenna element is so long , and the coax cable is captive -LRB- not detachable -RRB- , so you ca n't easily bundle it up and put everything away for storage . The element is just waiting to poke somebody in the eye if its not kept carefully out of the way in the rear cargo area.As for its performance , even when tuned according to the instructions , the antenna 's performance is lackluster . The beam pattern is the issue . It must be like a lopsided figure 8 , with the strongest part of the beam moving around depending on exactly how the antenna bends in the airflow as the vehicle travels . Perhaps the base does not couple well with the metal roof . I have no idea . It 's not worth trying to figure out.I replaced this thing with a thru-glass antenna , brand with a T , `` CB with Weather band '' , available here on Amazon , which outperforms it in every way . I thought the factory tint on my Jeep would be a problem for the thru-glass antenna , but apparently not , since the tint is non-metallic .
 The vinyl cover of the base is flimsy at best . Falls off and will get lost over time leaving bare metal magnet touching your paint .
 compre una antena con ustedes y me vino incompleta ... porfavor compre otra y necesito de la embalen bien para recibirla completa gracias
 Base loaded antennas are not worth a damn ! center loaded like a Wilson trucker 2000/5000 or top loaded like a Firestik II will out perform this antenna 70 % .
 I bought this antenna from Amazon since I had a bad experience with a cheaper CB antenna . It 's been a couple of months since I bought my Midland CB radio and I could n't get any signal . This antenna is great . The rubber at the magnetic mount is gentle to your car 's roof and other surfaces . The BIG problem was the packaging . I bought this antenna using a courier service , and Amazon decided to package the tightly and flexibly packaged antenna in a HUGE box with more than 70 % free space filled with paper . Outrageous . I was charged 500 USD just to get this box to my place since it was bigger than all of my other shipments together .
 It really is n't that this mouse is the worst , it is just that it seems to be useless if you do not have a basic keyboard -LRB- ie
 After installing this mouse from the disk , which you have to do if you want the scroll to work , my computer constantly freezes , then shuts down and restarts .
 This mouse has been cleverly engineered so that the bottom cover ca n't be removed to allow you to clean the ball and rollers . After it starts acting erratically -LRB- which wo n't take long -RRB- due to dirt on the ball on rollers , you have to toss it . I 'm going to replace it with a Microsoft Mouse and I suggest you do too .
 I purchased this tele converter lens as an add on to my Canon PowerShot S60 . Boy was I disappointed . Let me first say that you first have to purchase an adapter to use this lens with my model -LRB- S60 -RRB- . Not a big deal since the adapter was n't too expensive . The bad news is that the lens and adapter do not feel secure . As far as performance ... the lens does what is says -LRB- brings in the shot 2X -RRB- . However the images taken with the lens are terrible . The lens feels bulky and leaves a dark spot in the lower right hand corner of all images taken with the lens on . Do not purchase this lens . Stick with the built in digital zoom instead and do n't waste your money .
 I bought this lens to take some close-up shots of stationary items under low to moderate light environments . It is utterly useless for that application . The lens blocks the flash and you get a dark photo with a near-black 40 % swatch in the lower right of the frame . It may be useful for those who plan to use it outdoors or in bright light situations , but if you 're looking to take close-ups indoors , save your money .
 This is not worth any amount of money if you take even a small amount of pride in your photos . Sadly it is the only one I find available for an otherwise acceptable camera but the pictures are terrible even using a tripod . Blurry and washed out . But what did I expect a 1200mm zoom lense for $ 80 bucks ? You get what you pay for . I read other negative reviews on this lense but thought I might get better results .
 There are so many positive reviews of this card here that I thought I would describe my experience with it by way of contrast . The installation -LRB- Win98SE -RRB- hung twice , but finally worked on the third try -LRB- nothing out of the ordinary there -RRB- . As everyone else mentions , the digital audio is fine -LRB- ie playing MP3s or wave files -RRB- . However , here are three down sides
 This product is not what is advertised on the box . Apparently , in the past , this was a retail version product . Now , the software is unavailable , the user guide is not included , and they offer no support for this product . A phone call to the company left me even more confused when they said the ones being sold now are OEM versions of the card that were packaged in a new retail version box . Do n't expect any help in installing the card , using the features , or getting any of the cool software advertised on the box , it 's not going to happen .
 I decided to get this card when i heard TechTV 's The ScreenSavers talking about sound cards . They said the SoundBlaster Live -LRB- Which is what i have -RRB- can cause slowdown in games . Patrick -LRB- the co-host -RRB- said to ditch the SBLive and go for a Turtle Beach sound card.Taking this advice , i just bought this ... . I got home , put it in , installed the drivers , restarted and launched Winamp3 . I started one of my favorite songs , and the AVS.The song had skips in the beggining and sounded horrible . The mid level was quieter then my SBLive , and it threw off the sound quality . I shut down , ripped out the card , and put everything back in the box . I 'm taking everything back ... , ... ProsUmm ... for sake of putting something here , easy installConsSounded horrible
 This card is horrible . I had an SBLive 5.1 X-Gamer . The SBLive sounds way better then this . I put in this card and played a song . It was like comparing VHS to DVD . -LRB- SBLive was the DVD -RRB- I have Windows Xp and it sounds horrible ! I decided to humor myself , so i started GTA3 . -LRB- The cutscenes had weird problems -RRB- I triggered and cutscene and geuss what ! SAME PROBLEM ! This card was a load ...
 Bought it one and half year ago from Circuit city . Used it mainly for general computer work , not gaming . When I upgraded to a newer machine and try to install it on it , has problem with driver on XP Media Center edition , can not record MIDI from my Yamaha keyboard , and they do n't provide support for it any more . What kind of business is this vendor in ? Only one and half year later , they do n't provide any technical support for their products .
 I was misled by the box 's labeling which stated that it was dolby digital compatible ... It is , if you send the digital signal to an external dolby digital processor . It does not decode dolby digital itself . I recommend going with a Creative Sound Blaster . You get the card that does the dolby digital decoding itself for just a little bit more money.If you do n't care about that aspect of signal processing , then it would be a good card for you .
 I 'm glad to see KOSS has stopped making this waste of money machine.All of the complaints about the recording side which you 'll see in all of the other reviews are accurate
 I received this as a Xmas gift 3 years ago.At first I was thrilled . It 's fairly easy to use and flexible enough to allow recording from almost any source . I mostly wanted to burn my record collection to CD , but also make compilation CDs from all sources . I connected it to my home stereo and started burning.So far , so good . Then the trouble started.First , the playback drawer became stuck.I had to manually pry it open and remove the CD.Eventually the playback deck stopped working altogether . Which may have been a blessing in disguise as it saves me from having to ever pry another CD out of it.After a year and a half or so the LCD screen went haywire , flashing like mad when the unit was turned off!Three years on the recorder still works , but I 'm buying a new preamp with CD burning software so I can run direct to my pc and reserve the Koss CDR200 for once in a while , non-essential uses.Recording with this unit can be a bit tricky . If you wait too long in record/pause mode it will stop and you have to start over again . Mis-coordinating the start of an LP and the recorder sometimes results in the first second or two of music being cut off or a blank track number at the start of the CD.Practice will iron out most problems and satisfactory result can be had.product manuals are avaiable as PDF files via http://koss-av.com/operational-manual.htm
 You might think I 'm sour because mine just crapped out after 18 months -LRB- whereas I have the same amp and EQ I bought in 80 and 81 , respectively ... -RRB- , but this just is n't worth the money . I bought the floor model , and every time I burned a CD , I wished I 'd bought a more expensive model.First of all , it does n't have a recording volume pot , so you have to run it through a tape deck or something that does , so you can balance mix CD 's to a consistent volume -LRB- in other words , different things are ORIGINALLY recorded at different volumes , particularly LP 's vs. CD 's . When you put a song from each back to back , it 's really bad , unless you can balance the incoming volume . Which you ca n't with this . -RRB- Also , even though the manual says you can do this , you ca n't make an exact copy of a CD . It ALWAYS puts a one second gap between cuts . So , if you 're copying a symphony , there will always be a | break between movements . Or , heaven forbid you score a bootleg of a concert ... Your only options are one 80 minute track , or lots of applause and cheering | and lots of applause and cheering bertween songs.Recording is cumbersome , as well , but I 've already bored you enough.Finally , I almost always got `` recovery '' errrors ... Do n't know what they are , but it was disturbing.I made some GREAT CD 's with this , and was excited to buy it , but , all in all , I was disappointed that I spent $ 150 on it , and will definitely pay more for better features , and more convenience .
 I 've used one for about 6 months , copying LP 's onto CDRW 's , which I would then carry over to my PC , edit and split the tracks , then burn a final CDR from there . For that purpose , this was a more than satisfactory deck.But then I encountered an absolutely atrocious design flaw . Eventually , everyone gets a bad or marginal burn . Problem
 Me and a great buddy of mine went the same day to buy this item and both of our systems no longer worked after about 3 months , -LRB- actually my friend 's system broke in 2mo -RRB- I will never purchase a KOSS product ever again .
 I -LRB- like many others I found out -RRB- made the mistake of buying a Koss CDR200 . I did not use the unit much initially . When I started to use it the CDRW disc locked up in the B drive . I called Koss -LRB- a faceless company - must be a pure importer -RRB- and they said unplug the unit and plug it back in . It worked - that time . The second time it happened unplug-plug did not work . I called Koss and they said `` sorry , unit discontinued , no replacement '' . Call this screw the customer . No place to repair it . No service information . No replacement unit available . I do n't know how they get away with this as I thought all electronic products sold in the US were supposed to have some kind of parts and service availability for a certain number of years by law . I will never buy another Koss product and I will disparage their name anytime it comes up . Any outfit that ca n't even suggest where their product can be repaired -LRB- and this is only to release a disc from the tray -RRB- ought to be put out of business .
 This item is not particularly user friendly when it works . However , mine went south -LRB- B drive -RRB- after only 6 months . Then I realized that there is only a 90 day warranty , which is lousy . So Koss gets a resounding `` Boo !! '' from me .
 I have had my unit for approx . 2 years now . The playing side works geat , but the recording side has started to fail . You can not record tracks off the cds now . You ca n't even record a whole cd , because it will not finalize . I should have spent an extra $ 200 on a better brand like Sony or Panasonic . I would n't reccomend this Koss cd recorder to anyone !
 This product is no longer worth the trouble . When it was first manufactured , the music industry was trying to guard against unauthorized duplication of CDs . Therefore , the CD-200 -LRB- like many other products -RRB- was programmed at manufacture to only record on `` MUSIC '' CDs . Music CDs are those for which the manufacturer has paid a royalty to the music industry -LRB- probably through RIAA , ASCAP , or BMI -RRB- , and are specially marked as such . The only place I could find such disks was at Best Buy . In most stores , the pencil-necked teens who staff the music and computer departments have no idea what you are talking about and think , erroneously , that any CD will work . It will NOT . YOU CAN NOT USE `` REGULAR '' CD-R DISKS TO RECORD IN THIS MACHINE . So , the best way to make or copy CDs is with a computer with a burning drive -- as most have these days . In most cases , a computer is less expensive . And it is certainly more flexible .
 I 'M Editing this review because this has like others failed ! The B drive does n't read the discs . It records when it feels like it and seems to say RECOVER RECOVER very often . So I called the fine Koss people and they told me they stopped making the product do to a `` maximum defect '' their words . Oh Well , so to all those Koss purchasees out there I 'm holding a Koss revolution and never buying another Koss Product again .
 To those of you who have lost your manual -LRB- myself included -RRB- you can find basic operating functions on the Koss-AV . com web site under FAQ 's - Answers/CDR Recorders . -LRB- Note
 My girlfriend gave us the CDR 200 KOSS recorder for christmasbut we are unable to use it . It did n't have the manual . I need one . Can you help ? If i have to pay i do not mind . Please advise.Please find below my mailing address . Thanking you in anticipation.Yours truly.MARIE-VONNE DE COMARMOND4670 BOUCHETTE STREETMONTREAL , QUEBECH3W 1C5
 These memorex keyboards are okay . The hot keys wo n't work unless you install the software on to your computer , but the software is memory resident . So it becomes just another program that eats up your system resources . Also for some reason , memorex decided to put lead as a conductor in the keyboards cord , so you run the risk of getting lead poisoning each and every time you touch the cord . You will see a warning to this effect on the cord itself.That alone is enough of a reason to stay away from Memorex keyboards ! Even though Memorex does make cordless keyboards , they lost me as a customer due to their reckless use of lead in their products.Not worth the money , not even if it was free . Buy another brand of keyboard . Lead can cause cancer , so enough said .
 The good thing about this was it allowed me to program a specific comand to the thumb button that I could not with other mice , the bad thing is the flare out at the bottom is very uncomfortable , it pushes in at the base of your thumb . I had other people in the office try it , nobody found it comfortable .
 purchased for an older gps that only takes the 128mb card at the last minute . it was not reconized by the gps and kept telling me bad or loose data card . but occasionaly it will stay on with out the warning . o well i get what i payed for .
 I 'm a fairly intelligent early adaptor and I have been completely disappointed with this product . I live on South Beach in Miami in a high rise , so I was not entirely surprised that this would not function wirelessly , but even after I laid down cable and hard-wired it , no luck . Or more precisely , inadequate performance . Lame , lame , lame . A total waste of money . Wait until 2010 .
 I am currently on the phone with DLink tech support who informs me that if you have more than 1000 songs in a shared folder then the DSM320 will crash . This is a known issue and they have no idea when or if they can fix it.The Media Server itself is quite horrible . I upgraded to the latest version and still am not able to add my music folder to be shared . After scanning the directory for about 20 minutes the software unceremoniously crashes with no clues as to why.The tech support people are about as good as the product itself . Their solution to my problems are `` Go to the store and return it . '' If tversity does n't make this thing work then I guess I will take their advice .
 took ten minutes for me to set this up . only because i have a solid knowledge in computer networking.excepted basically , to be able to listen to my audio and video from my computer in my bedroom where i have a 56 '' samsung dlp television and a 5.1 surround.the actual product feels cheap to be honest , the remote is so tiny that i have lost and found it about five times now . it 's not backlit . the menus are sluggish . it plays about 15 % of the videos on my computer , good luck downloading a video file it will play . if you want to spend hours decoding a video , then re-encoding it , you might as well skip the whole extender process and burn it as a vcd/dvd . it plays the mp3s fine . i am a room over from the router which is wired to my computer , there is no excuse for the `` lag '' in the video . sad so say , it went back to best buy.oh , i tried linksys 's extender before this product . dlinks is better but not by far . linksys 's extender comes with microsoft 's media center which is nice but it played none of my movies at all.good idea but the technology on any extender , just is n't there yet . might as well buy a long vga/s-video cord and some audio cords and run them along the wall/under the carpet .
 The D-Link DSM-320 is a great product in theory . However , the actual product leaves much to be desired . Basically , this is just a confirmation of what everyone else here has been saying . The remote buttons are barely responsive , it is unable to play 90 % of the files of each of the formats that it claims to play , shuffle is useless without setting up a playlist , and other `` basic '' functions are missing . This product was definately released to early . An as an early adopter , I got burned this time . I will be returning this thing tomorrow .
 1 . Streaming audio -LRB- C - -RRB- - Using either Windows Media Connect or the poor D-Link server in a sampling of about 100/2300 songs -LRB- WMA , MP3 -RRB- -LRB- ~ 250 albums -RRB- at least 10 percent stall and play eradically . My Roku M1000 navigates and plays these audio files perfectly .2 . JPEG rendering -LRB- D -RRB- is very slow and worse .3 . Video -LRB- AVI -RRB- -LRB- F -RRB- - Would not play any using D-Link server or Windows Media Connect server . Using TVersity server am able to play two or three until unit hangs and has to be rebooted.The remote -LRB- C - -RRB- feels like a toy and the proximity of the buttons is probably adequate for a childs hands.General usability of UI and navigation -LRB- C - -RRB- - D-Link designers really missed an opportunity given the fact that the user must use a TV or VGA equivalent screen.Support -LRB- F -RRB- A call to D-Link support regarding the audio file problems was a waste of time .
 Why pay over 300 $ for this product , when you can get an Xbox 360 or PS3 and do exactly what this does -LRB- stream media from DLNA compatible devices -RRB- + stream netflix , go online with a browser -LRB- PS3 -RRB- , play games -LRB- with game system discs -RRB- and much more .
 I bought this media player despite the questionable reviews . I figured if they had to do with setup I could figure out.The setup was fairly easy and I got it working in no time . I even got videos to stream from my PC even when the router was on the first floor and the media player was downstairs.The problem is the hardware . D-Link needs to fire all their programmers because they do n't know how to program worth anything . I settled for the awful UI but that 's not why I bout it , but the devide would lock up more often than it would work and twice already I 've had to return it to D-Link to get a replacement . The kicker is that they do n't pay for the shipping to them so I 've had to foot the bill . If I keep this up I 'll spend more in shipping charges than the actual device!Look , save your money and do n't bother with this . You can spend a little bit more and get a xbox 360 and use it as both a game console and a wireless media player . The UI is ten times better and the hardware is flawless .
 I bought this when it first came out and was disappointed . I was finally able to play videos , and music even from my PC , but the process was time consuming and never seamlessly enough to be used regularly . skipping through videos was a total waist . often crashing the video and was too picky about just how the video was encoded . every now and then I see it in the back of closet and think . I bet they have fixed all this , so I drag it out to find out still no updates . The DSM 320 came out when MicroSoft first tried to strong arm the media center PC on everyone , at that time you could not buy the software or build your own . In the end I bought an Apple TV and have n't looked back .
 The DSM-320 is not ready for consumer use and I 'd wait for D-Link to update the server software before I would even consider purchasing one . The current version lacks even the most basic media player functionality and really does n't do justice to what appears to be an exception device from a hardware standpoint . Current problems with the D-Link DSM-320 include :1 . Unable to play more than one song in a row . The player stops after each song on an album . Must build custom playlists for each album in your collection .2 . Repeated `` Unsupported file format '' on standard MP3 files . These same files play on every other mp3 player I own .3 . Unresponsive remote - have to hit each button 2-3 times before the entry will register .4 . No Divx support .
 First of all , I do n't own this product . My review is of Dlink , the company , and their release practices . If you read many of the reviews about this product , there are always significant problems , and ongoing firmware releases , which usually fix some problems while sometimes creating others.I had this same issue with my Dlink Wireless G router -LRB- DI-624 -RRB- last year . I initially had a very serious problem with the router rebooting often . I checked and double checked everything . I loaded the newest firmmare whenever it became available . Dlink tech support sent me on multiple wild goose chases to attempt to resolve the problem.How was the problem resolved ? Well , one of the firmware releases that came out a few months later finally fixed my problem.It seems that Dlink is more than willing to release products to the public with very buggy firmware . They have no compunction about having their customers help them to debug their products . I strongly suggest that you consider this prior to your purchase of any Dlink product . If you have the strong urge to purchase one of their products , wait until it has been out for a few months or a year , so that the bugs would have been worked out of the product by Dlink with great help by other unsuspecting customers .
 This thing is a total junker . The specs sounded promising , and when it DOES work its pretty cool , Despite what many say , many divx/xvid files will play just fine , at perfect dvd quality . However many movies and other things -LRB- especially those with weird codecs or variable bit rate audio -RRB- need to be converted using Nero Recode or some other software which can take forever -LRB- To convert one season of tv shows to a viewable format can take a 3ghz p4 half a day , and render your computer useless during that time -RRB- . The remote is a joke , unless you are pointed exactly at the box from less than 5 feet away it doesnt work , even when it does work , it annoys you more than anything . The picture viewer is a joke , its far too slow to be useful , the music features are laughable as well.I havent met too many people who own one of these that never has problems with the server staying connected . There seems to be no rhyme nor reason to what makes it work/not work . I try messing with firewalls , port forwarding , resetting the pc , resettign the router , resetting the unit itself . Then it just randomly comes back on 10 minutes later . Sometimes it works fine all day long , sometimes it works 5 minutes out of the day . Unfortunately i havent found many other products which do the same thing . I went back to using the audio/s-video outs on my computer direct to my home theater , i lose the functionality of having the remote , but for watching movies or a pre-set list of shows it works , and the beauty is if it plays on the PC fine , it plays on your TV fine .
 When using Wi-Fi for a connection , this device skips frequently when playing back audio . No matter how strong my wireless connection I had this problem . Regardless of any of the other features , this makes the device completely unusable as far as I am concerned.I 've used similar devices that did not have this problem , but had other problems like poor UPnP compatibility -LRB- Linksys WMA-11B -RRB- , so this is clearly not an insurmountable problem in general .
 I installed the system , upgraded to last firmware , installed the PC software , but when I try to play any media file I always get a `` Unable to open the file . '' error message , I cotacted Dlink , but they cant make it work . I can even see my pictures thumbnails , but when I try to see those pictures in full ress , I get the same error .
 The D-Link DSM-320 is by far the worst piece of electronic equipment I ever came across in my over 20 years of computer usage . Fortunately , returning items to Amazon is rather easy , so I sent the device back after a few attempts to get a picture on my TV . Well , I was following the instructions and even used the Ethernet connection rather then going wireless -LRB- having read some of the feedbacks about weak signal reception -RRB- . However , even with a wire , the D-Link DSM-320 did not find the media-server on the computer . Well , it did after some attempts to re-install the device . The reason for this might be that I use Linksys networking equipment but this should not be a constraint , I presume . The quality of the D-Link is very poor , though the box looks nice . The server software is even worst , since it does not even open the folders , which one selects in the setup mode . All-in-all , D-Link should make their homework before brining such a device to the market !
 I bought this player so that I could listen to the hours of music that I have stored on my computer in other parts of the house . The initial setup on my wireless network was very easy and straightforward -LRB- although the documentation is sparce ... which might be a problem who is not somewhat technically savy -RRB- . Unfortunately , after about an hour of listening pleasure , the music playback started skipping . At first this skipping was slightly annoying but bearable . However , it progressively became worse until the playback stopped completely.The unit could no longer see my network -LRB- although nothing on the network had changed -RRB- . Or , the unit could see the network , but the signal strength was extremely low . The wireless signal level fluctuated wildly from one moment to the next , even with the unit right next to the wireless router . Power-cycling the unit and rediscovering the network sometimes improved the signal strength , but it soon faded again.After spending two days fiddling with the wireless network to improve the signal strength -LRB- adding a range expander -RRB- , over an hour with D-Link 's technical support , and several hours searching the web , I came to the conclusion that the design of the wireless receiver antenna is faulty . One user forum suggested opening the unit , disconnecting the internal antenna cable and reconnecting it to the AUX connector inside the box . Unfortunately , while this technique apparently works wonders on the wireless signal strength , it also voids the warranty.After all of this , I decided to return the unit . There was no point in exchanging it for a different unit . The retail channel is full of the current hardware version -LRB- A3 -RRB- . I hope that D-Link fixes these hardware problems . When it was working , the DSM-320 provided exactly what I wanted
 This media player is great ... . when it works , which is rarely ! I have had this product for over a year now and have had nothing but problems with it . The only way I got acceptable performance -LRB- meaning it does n't lock up on me -RRB- is by ditching the wireless connection and going with a hardwired setup . I tried two different wireless routers , but the router did n't seem to be the problem . I also ditched the server software , which would hammer my machine , and went with Tversity instead . After all of that , it was finally working well , until all of a sudden it died completely . Since I 've had it for over a year , DLink tech support and customer service said too bad . Their only solution was to offer to sell me another unit - I do n't think so !
 This was recommended to me by a friend and I have to say it 's the worst thing he ever suggested . I just took this thing out into the street and destroyed it . I never could get it to play music without stopping and starting and almost every time I turned it on the `` No Server Found '' message came up and I had to reset all the settings .
 The idea is great . The implementation is terrible.To start with , the remote should n't really be called a remote since you have to be within 5 feet for it to work . It does n't play correctly . The software that you have to run on your computer is clumsy . Everything about this product is wrong.This thing is a total piece of -LSB- ... -RSB- . D-Link normally produces nice products but they completely missed with this one .
 Unfortunately , I picked this unit up with much higher hopes than I should have.Setup was relatively simple . I know what I 'm doing and I have an existing UPnP server on my network , so that made life a little easier . When you power the thing up for the first time , it steps you through network setup , locates UPnP servers , and makes it all go.However , once I got it running , I lost my optimism . Video was very choppy . It was completely unwatchable . I futzed with the settings on my router and UPnP server and video formats for a week before finally giving up .
 i bought this and quickly gave up on the included software . i then went with the tversity free software , which is miles better . however if you have a large divx xvid avi collection you wont be happy . some play . some dont . there 's no telling until you try it , even hard wired , so its not a wireless bandwidth problem . i eventually gave up and returned it . who wants to spend all the time setting it up and wondering if it will work just to watch a video ? instead i went with an old Xbox -LRB- at half the price as everyone is getting rid of them and going to the new 360 -RRB- , converted it to an Xbox media center -LRB- XBMC -RRB- and its genius . everything works no matter what ... divx , xvid , ogg ... and it can do so much else too -LRB- not to mention you can play games with an xbox if you want to -RRB- . its not the simplest route but its 100 years past whats commercially available now .
 I like the feature set of the product it mostly does everything it says it will . It plays MP3s , does good slideshows of images and plays video files located on the PC or on a network drive connected to the PC . The set up was easy and I was up and running in less than 30 minutes . It works with both it 's own media server software as well as windows media connect . In general the windows media connect is the better software for the server with the following exception notesd below.When running the D-link software :1 . The product will not play all video files . I do not mean all formats , I mean all files . I am playing video from two sources , a sony digital video camera and a Hauppage PVR-USB2 video capture device . It will play some of the files from both of these devices , but not all and there is no clear reason for which ones it chooses to play . I spoke with tech support and they indicated this is a known issue on which they are working .2 . When you are playing a group of MP3 files you can switch to a slideshow . As soon as you switch to the slideshow it will continue to play the current song over and over until you manually stop it . If you stay in the audio area it will play the list perfectly . It is only if you go to the slideshow that it does not work . Again , tech support indicates a known issue.Windows Connect :1 . It will not support content located on a network drive . It must be resident on the machine .2 . It will play all the vidoes that the D-link media server will not -LRB- I have n't found one it wo n't play -RRB- , but you can not fast forward or rewind . If you try to fast forward or rewind when you press play to stop it goes back to the beginning of the video . This was really frustrating the first time it happenend becuase I had been watching a show for 15 minutes . I fast forwarded through the commercials and when I pressed play again it took me back to the beginning of the video with no way to get back to where I was except re-watch the 15 minutes . Again , tech support indicated a known issue .3 . It has the same problem with audio and picture slideshows listed above.Remote :1 . The remote is tricky and not very responsive . Sometimes you ca n't get it to work and other times it acts like you have pressed the button several times . Kind of annoying , but not a serious problem.Overall :1 . Good Audio Quality2 . Good Video Quality when it plays3 . Good picture Quality4 . Easy to navigate screens5 . Easy to set upWhen they fix the bugs I will give it a 4 to 4.5 stars .
 Has great features if they worked . I 've been researching for just such a device to play all my multimedia files in the comfort of my family room without the restrictions of a computer monitor or small speaker sound.Unfortunatly , most of the features DLink advertises for this product do not work or work slugishly or not without major annoyances . I 'm an IT professional working for more than 18 years in the industry and must say this product was released much too early to the consumer before addressing bug issues . All the advertised file formats do not always work . I 've seen errors from `` file not found '' -LRB- even though it shows the file name on the media center , `` file type unknown '' , and the list goes on . I still have n't been able to get playlists to work and the only way I could get it to work with one of my computers is to map it from another computer and stream through two computer to get to the living room . I keep hearing that DLink is going to address the software and firmware issues , but have yet to have any of my emails returned from DLink 's tech support concerning my problems . If all the features worked , this would be one nice addition to your home multimedia experience . As of now , it 's mostly a pretty piece of electronics that will rest turned off on my stereo shelf until DLink figures out how to address all their bugs .
 I read the other reviews , some glowing , others well . . not so glowing . The price was right , -LRB- $ 149 - 50 rebate -RRB- So I thought I would take a chance . I read the other reviews so I have no one else to blame but myself.First off , I am only interested in playing videos from my computer , so I have no idea how well the image viewing or MP3 playing works.I also notice other people reviewing this product had all kinds of problems with wireless connections . My house is fully wired with CAT5 , therefore I am using this product wired , not wireless.I was able to get the device connected to my network and reading files from the media server within 10 minutes of opening the carton ... so far so good . The first thing I did was check for updates . An update was found and updated successfully.I then had the DSM-320 look for media servers . It found the tversity server right away and I was able to see the contents listed . This unfortunately is the end of the good news . It 's all went downhill from here .1 . Neither server , tversity or the Dlink were smart enough to view a folder of VOB files as a movie . They listed them as VOB_1 , VOB2 etc. . So for example , I clicked on my Casablanca folder , I would then need to click on VOB_1 to start the movie . When VOB_1 ended after about 20 minutes , it did not go to VOB_2 . I needed to use the remote and manually select the next item to play . arrrgghh !! P.O.S. thing .2 . As another review stated , the FF simply does not work properly . Oh , sure if you press FF the movie will fast forward . But there is no way to stop it . If you press play while the movie is FF ` wding , the movie starts to play from the beginning of the current VOB . more , arrrrgghh!This alone is enough of a nuisance to return the device . Which I will be doing first thing in the morning.My final advice to any prospective buyers
 Even after reading the bad reviews this product received from other reviewers I still purchased it . It is pretty easy to set up , but once connected to my PC it had very inconsistent behavior.The device would lose connection to the server after a being idle for 1-2 hours and require a reset.The video performance was awful with the included software . Tversity freeware media server made video performance better , but fast forward and rewind would n't work do to some video conversion routines being run by Tversity.Music files would play , and sounded good , but navigating through my music selection was nearly impossible because the music search feature does n't work . Really ... Does n't work at all.I upgraded firmware and played all sorts of games to try and get the device to work . Finally I gave up and shipped it back to Amazon . The thing was just more trouble than it was worth.FYI
 I have never been a big fan of companies sending a product to market and consumers being the beta testers . I think that is the case with this device . We are beta testing the item but with the full purchase price . I like the concept . I really like the Radio@AOL feature -LRB- which is why I purchased it -RRB- . The issues at hand for me :1 . wireless connection doen not maintain2 . plays only a single mp3 file -LRB- not album -RRB- unless you create a playlist manually -LRB- c'mon , be real ! -RRB- 3 . slide show does not work as described4 . screen saver does not kick in while platin the Radio@AOLThe two stars are for `` upside '' , but this is like drafting a high school star into the NBA ... it might work out but there is tremendous `` upside '' . Unfortuanely we all know how many `` busts '' there have been.The product should not have been released until it was ready and this was a faux pas by someone in marketing for D-Link . Hopefully the firmware fixed will come fast and furious to help us all out . Otherwise I will need to buy an access point and hard wire into the device and avoud the wireless component altogether .
 I 've had the product for a couple days now and I am not sure I am keeping it . Being D-Link was late to the market with this device at least from the music and photo end I expected a lot more . The devices feels like it does n't have enough processor speed in it . Menus are sluggish . The music is stripped and play at 190mps even if you have 320 's . Firmware needs some work . I 've been using the Linksys WMA11B and thought I would be upgrading . Not at all ... . The menu 's in this device are restrictive and are close to only allowing one song to be played at a time . You have to dump all your music into one folder or build play list if you want to play folders or multiple folders . I am use to selecting a whole tree of folders and allowing the device to play and shuffle if desired . Not on this device . Many of the Music files I play on the linksys show as not supported on this device . I rip them from the original CD ... Plus if you are a internet share ware user many of the songs I 've acquired do not play on this device ... . Linksys does n't have a problem ... . I was expecting good things from the G signal ... Not at all ... . Music pauses and sometimes freezes . It does not display signal . I know it is good being my Linksys show 89 % at the same point . As for video . It does not support file you create on film maker WMV ... . and many MPG file I have created come up as not supported . Those that play seem to play very slow and stall if they are large files . . Over a couple of meg . I sense the buffer if not large enough ... . One last comment the Linksys version allowed you to play music and picture screen shows at the same time . You ca n't on this device ... Calling D-Link support after doing all the checks there was nothing I could do to fix it ... For for reference I running WinXP Home . On a 3.3 P4 Hyper-Thread . 2 Gig Mem . Two Maxtor 200g ATA133 . on the latest a Linksys G Router with all the latest code updates ... . Bottom line ... I do not recommend spending the money on this device ... And I plan to return it to Amazon for my money back ...
 D-Link DSM-320 Wireless Media Player , Audio/Photo/Video , 802.11 gThis product appears to be running a linux-based OS , and will `` crash '' on any video file that is over 4 GB in size , and sometimes on smaller files . I was able to get a full refund after sending samples to their engineers who never fixed the problems . I replaced this unit with a LINKSYS WMCE54AG , which is a real Media Center Extender -LRB- and cost about $ 100 more -RRB- although it will randomly crash on occasion requiring a complete reboot by cycling power.It should be noted that none of these units is supported on WINDOWS VISTA
 The feature that originally sold me on the DSM-320 was its support for the XviD and DivX formats . These , however , are the two formats that are supported the least , and a slow , jerky , framerate should be expected . I at first thought it was a bandwidth issue , and proceeded to hard wire it to my computer using a crossover cable , the framerate improved , but not enough , in my opinion , for this device to even claim support for these file types . If support for these two formats are the selling feature for you , be warned , you should look elsewhere .
 How do you know what these firmware updates are fixing , or breaking , when Dlink does not seem to post firmware information on the website?I 've given this product a try before , but I was not waiting for `` future '' fixes for features that were prominently displayed on the box . If I could see what these firmware updates were doing , I would be more inclined to give this product another shot.I really hope that Dlink improves the server software . It was a real pain to have to manually force a rescan of the directories whenever a change was made to the file structure , or files were added to the existing directories , and the interface was terrible . I could have written better software and I 'm in pharma-research .
 The server software really stinks . I 'll say it agian , the server software really stinks . The remote is slow , small and really stinks.The only reason for the two stars is the fact the I got the unit up and running in short order ... . It then took several hours of additional work to get the video portion of the unit working.After fighting with this thing all weekend long , I gave up on the unit Sunday and took it back .
 I have had the DSM-320 for six months . It does NOT play DIVX -LRB- only some XVIDs with the audio out of sync -RRB- , but the radio functionality is great!Firmware updtates are done every fifth to seventh year , so do n't buy this mediaplyer in expectation of having a working product in the near future . It has still got more bugs than an African youth hostel . If you need AOL radio it is a great buy , but for anything else it is slooooooow , unreliable and very , very annoying ... Check out this forum before you buy it
 This is the worst piece of electronics I have ever bought . The install is not easy . It could n't play my MP3 's without breaking up . It tried to download a firmware update and locked up.Don ' t waste your money !!!
 I bought the DSM-320 some time ago and have tried everything in an effort to make it work - latest firmware , reset , relocate , etc. etc. . I 've finally pulled it out of my system after watching it collect dust for several months . I highly recommend against purchasing this POS . In fact I will give mine away to anyone who cares to pay for the shipping ...
 Installation was very difficult . Printed documents poor . On-line documents not much better . I learned the most from someone 's review . A call to the vendor was very helpful . After I finally -LRB- 6 hours -RRB- got it set up , I found that music buffered in mid-song . -LRB- Not quite what I was expecting . -RRB- My router was less than 20 feet way from the unit on the other side of two sheet rock walls . So I should n't have this kind of problem . I returned the unit to Amazon . BTW , Amazon was great - very prompt with the refund .
 Thought this would be the ideal unit for streaming music to a stereo in the living areas without having to dock a phone . Requires a TV to control the UI . The UI is clumsy and quite slow . Creating play lists is painful . Would be nice to go to your computer , tee up the music , fire and forget . Doing the same from the remote control takes several minutes of fiddling . The unit died after a few years of use .
 March 13th , 2010 update : I quit on this thing ... We tried to use it for three TV movies today . Scooby Doo played well enough because I dared not to touch a button on the remote or pause . A documentary about the Penn Dutch -LRB- Amish -RRB- froze halfway through and we finished watching on our age old spare Mint Linux 600MHz laptop . Watched Food Inc and it froze 2/3 of the way through and we finished on the Linux laptop again.There is no easy way apparently to skip forward or reverse on a video track . It is totally unreliable and could freeze at any moment thereby making a movie an exercise in fear that you will not get to finish it at some critically point in the plot.I got it working well enough with the stock software if I fed it a specific kind of file . Of course the problem is with the OEM software there is zero versatility . Limited file types , etc. . So I switched to Linux Media Tomb . Reliable software . Works well streaming to other Linux/Windows/Mac laptops when I want to tune in via VLC to test the MediaTomb server software.The DSM locked up and had almost no functionality aside from stop and pause . If I paused too often or paused too long - it crashed . Plenty of file type options . Switched to TVersity and even more deluxe options . Still the DSM-320 crashed or froze . I could not fast forward after a crash , I could only restart a movie and wait for it to get to the same point real time.I quit . I 'm going to spend about $ 250 and build a proper net-top -LRB- mini desktop -RRB- XBMC Linux player that I can hook to our current and future televisions and have the perfect machine with all the deluxe features like pause and fast forward . I 've played with the free XBMC software on my laptop and it just works ! That way I can switch back and forth to Amarok , Boxee , XBMC or Moovida as the mood hits me.Original review : I 'll admit that I 'm a little spoiled . On our computers we use a combination of free Mint Linux KDE with free Amarok , free VLC , free SMplayer , free Digikam , free Boxee and free XBMC . Did I mention free ? Those programs have really been good to us . They pretty well play anything we through at them . For us they set the standards in their respective areas.My goal was to find some sort of media center box that would simply play media stored on our D-Link NAS -LRB- DNS-323 , really good -RRB- or on shared drives on our computers throughout the house network - a combination of Linux and Mac and a lone Windows XP machine.Pretty simple I thought . Had to be more simple than trying to connect our laptop to the TV and getting the TV-out settings just right . Even so that resulted in a poor picture that was n't even quite the right size or centered.How difficult is it to create a video out jack on a computer that just works ??? Maybe with a switch to turn it off and on ? Apparently tough to do ... Enter the DMS-320 . I bought a very lightly used DMS-320 from Amazon . I suspect now it was lightly used b/c the previous owner was equally frustrated by it as we are . I read the reviews and concluded that this machine was getting poor reviews b/c the folks trying to use it did n't know what they were doing . Maybe but I know what I 'm doing and the result was less than sparkling.First give up on the Wi-Fi . Whether I was streaming video or audio - it was unreliable . Sometimes it would work for a while , sometimes it would stop and start or garble the audio . Not enough bandwidth I suspect . Note that this DSM-320 was 2 ft from my router and less than 15 ft from the desktop computer it was paired with . A network cable made everything better . Skip the wireless ... Next was the feature devoid software . I thought I could put this thing on my network and play videos stored on my D-Link NAS . Not so . You have to have a computer read the files and then send them to the DMS-320 . In some cases you have to let the computer transcode the files and feed it to the DMS-320 in a format adjusted just so . You see the DMS-320 has no computing horsepower of it 's own . The D-Link server software does n't have much horsepower either . You 've got to feed it certain kinds of files.The DSM-320 is wholly reliant on your computer to do the heavy lifting . The disappointing thing was that the D-Link software was n't even able to do the heavy lifting either . It only accepts very specific video or music formats and I suspect very specific bitrates . Otherwise D-Link prods us to buy Nero Recode to re-record all of our media to a specific format/bitrate to feed to the DSM-320 . No thanks!Enter the alternatives - free MediaTomb -LRB- Linux -RRB- and free TVersity . Media Tomb worked fine but the GUI is pretty basic . At least it is a good Linux server . TVersity unfortunately required me to boot up Windows XP . TVersity did do a very good job of serving up media for the DSM-320 . I did not play with all of the settings and consequently there was one movie that would not play smoothly b/c the bitrate was very high - about 3000 kbps . Other copies of our box DVD sets of TV shows did fine with a slower bitrate . Could n't fast forward or rewind if TVersity was transcoding it on the fly though . The DSM-320 user interface was pretty limited . Text was large enough but did not go all the way across the screen for video titles were snipped . UGH!End result ? I 'll use TVersity and Windows and the DSM-320 on a wired network for a little while longer . Then I 'll give it to a friend who likes to tinker . I 'll build us a little media center computer running Mint Linux and XBMC . That will give us a very nice interface without limiting what we can view or listen to . I looked at XBMC last night and the more up to date version is really , really nice . Boxee is really nice and Linux friendly as well.Folks pass on this DSM-320 unless your needs are really basic , and unless you have a Windows computer you can idle while you watch TV.Update
 I just received my Dlink DSM-320 . I was initially excited about the product , but after attempting to use it I quickly realised that it needed another 3 or 4 months to be ready for prime-time . Let 's start with the big issues :1 . Component out is broken.I tried this on 3 different TVs with component out -LRB- Sony Wega , JVC IArt and Pioneer SD-643-HD5 -RRB- and each time the picture was displayed with a severe blue cast -LRB- everything was shades of blue -RRB- . I tried another DSM-320 and the same problem existed , even AFTER the firmware upgrade . How something like this could slip by Quality Control I have no idea .2 . Wireless compatibility is pathetic.I have been using wireless networks since they came out . I am somewhat familiar with configuring them . My entire wireless network is DLink AirPlus XtremeG running at 108Mbs , with compatibility for 54Mbs and 11Mbs hardware . This worked because I had people connect their laptops to my network for printing and browsing the web . I , of course , had SSID Broadcast disabled so I typed in the SSID into the DSM-320 along with my other network information and it refused to find my network . After turning down my network speed and broadcasting my SSID it connected , but then refused to download the firmware update . It was stuck at zero . The machine froze and I had to pull the plug to reset the machine . Playing videos started well , but 2 minutes in the machine would freeze with no network activity and the plug would have to be pulled . In short , the wireless functionality was terrible , and I like DLink stuff .3 . Does not maintain the aspect ratio.I bought this planning to use my machine as a video jukebox . I have a dedicated TV card -LRB- Hauppauge PVR-250 -RRB- and schedule my TV recordings over the internet . The DSM-320 was going to allow my to watch these videos on a TV instead of the computer . Also , I have a large hard drive that serves as a movie jukebox . The movies are kept in their original widescreen aspect ratios -LRB- 16:9 or 2.35:1 -RRB- . I was very surprised to notice that the DSM-320 did not display the black bars required to make the picture look normal . It filled the screen with the picture and made everyone look tall and skinny.Those are the big problems , it is also plagued by the slow menus and horrible server software mentioned in other reviews . I guess the biggest compliment I can give it is that when connected to a wired network , and while using s-video , it worked great . Even the wife could navigate the menus -LRB- slowly -RRB- , play music -LRB- provided I had setup the M3U playlist for her on the server computer -RRB- , look at pictures and play videos . Unfortunately , there are other products that will do those things better and cost $ 100 less . Do I think the DSM-320 has potential ? Yes , but it needs several firmware upgrades to fix those big problems I outlined . I 'm not waiting for that though , I 'm sending mine back.7-16-04
 I am very disappointed im this product so far . I have all DLind equipment , and it recognized my network perfectly . However , it has lots of other problems and badly needs a firmware upgrade . It has frozen several times , requiring that I unplug it to restart . It occassionally stops in the middle of a song . Most disappointing is that it can not seem to read artist or album info on most of my music -LRB- mp3 or wma -RRB- , and can not play more than one song at a time . I called tech support and they told me that is the best the server can do right now -LRB- contrary to adverstisments and the manual -RRB- . The shuffle and repeat buttons never work . Wait til they fix all this before you buy , this is an awful failure so far .
 Only supports Quicktime version 4 files , not versions 5 or 6 . Who would release a product that is two years out of date ? Apparently , D-Link . `` AVI '' support limited . Suppports XVID video but not any of the three most common companion audio formats . Plays DVD formats in a half-assed fashion again with severe limitations . Often crashes when loading MP-3 collections . When it does play a movie , playback is usually out of synch and jittery , indicating some kind codec mismatch . Let me emphasize that I 'm speaking of movies that play perfectly well in a half dozen different players . These are movies which look and sound perfectly good when I connect my TV to the PC playing the film . D-Link 's Technical support dor this product is very poor . I wasted ny time and money . Do n't you waste yours .
 I 've had my DSM 320 for a little over a year now , and I have now given up on the unit . While the idea of the wireless media player is very enticing , the problems one encounters on the way make it less than enjoyable . To begin with , the initial installation of the product took two full evenings on the phone with Dlink Tech Support -LRB- who are actually quite pleasant -RRB- . It finally would play , but not playlists or protected music.Another two evenings spent solved this problem by installing windows media player . Then the DSM 320 crashed again , making hiccupping sounds . Tech support just told me to get rid of the windows media player , but then I could not use my windows playlists or the windows protected media . This one took several days to figure out , but was being caused by an interaction with a firewall.As more music was added to my computer , the menu speeds got so slow that I had to run a CAT 5 cable to the unit , making the investment in a wireless unit pointless . Then I switched my MP3 player to an iPod and the DSM 320 crashed again . After two more evenings fiddling I have yet to solve this one , nor do I intend to . Save yourself a little money and a lot of heart and headaches and skip this one .
 I just bought this device , and it 's definately got a lot going for it in the `` wow , cool ! '' factor . Unfortunately ... it really is n't ready for public release yet . D-link insists that most of the known issues will be worked out with software fixes ... but the units on shelves now are just a buggy mess.Most of the problems have already been described in other reviews , but I 'm unable to get a solid wireless signal to the device and have no desire to run a hard-wired line to my living room at the moment . I 've tried a new router , replacement antenna , and moving the equipment around as much as conceivably possible ... to no effect . Video and Audio still skip too much.Also , for what video I could actually get to play , much of it is in widescreen and the device has no options for adjusting aspect ratio , so the picture 's just stretched vertically over the whole screen . A letterboxing option on the remote would be a nice addition .
 Everybody else hit the nail on the head . DLINK is selling a product that is apparantely still in development . I have been unable to get a single MPG or VOB file to play more than 13 minutes into the file . At that point it locks up . Dlink takes 1 week to offer back lame responses . I 'm on the latest 1.02 firmware , and the server software is still at 1.0 -- definately , definately , definately AVOID this expensive nonworking product .
 Even my wife and kids hate this thing . Just work for once , please , without me having to call tech support , who always make you do the same 5 things and nothing works . I want my 15 hours of life back Dlink . This product BLOWS CHUNKS . I want the engineers who created it to have to sit on the phone for a day with various tech support people from another country and be forced to repeat the same 5 steps over and over.The beauty is that when it breaks -LRB- often -RRB- , it 's always something new and exciting . Of course you have n't changed a single thing since the last time you turned it on.I would n't even waste my baseball bat on beating this thing hanging from a rope . I HATE the DSM-320 and hope it burns in hell forever . *** Update *** Uninstall the OLD media server that comes with it BEFORE trying to install the updated -LRB- 1.10 -RRB- version . You know , because the software engineers knew that you 'd be smart enough to do that since you OBVIOUSLY have to do it with all your other software that you upgrade.So now it works , even for videos , but I still want my 15 hours of life back , to erase the frustrated look on everyone 's faces who is waiting for the movie to start , etc. . I still hate you DSM-320 . Just a little less now .
 D-ink Leave off the `` L '' for this thing is Lame . If you can get this running out of the box do n't worry D-ink will issue a software update and you will likely install it rendering this device defunct . Get ready for persistent software re installations . If the device seems to be working do n't update anything!Even with a hardwired network connection the picture is often choppy and often falls out of sync with the audio.Don ' t waste your time with this product . I have fought with this device for over a year and no longer use it.Good luck to any future buyers . I look forward to your one star reviews .
 I bought the DSM-320 to wirelessly stream my large collection of DVD files from my media PC downstairs in the living room , to my TV in my master bedroom . The ripped files are in VOB format , with each movie at around 5 GB of material in size.First , it 's well known that the DSM does n't like to be far from the wireless router . In order to get a stable connection , I literally ended up placing the router on top of the DSM , WITH THE ANTENNAS TOUCHING . This gave me a consistent `` 100 '' in signal strength , so I know any problems in streaming were not due to low strength , at least in the DSM-to-router connection.I also added a wireless repeater to boost the strength from the router to the downstairs media PC , because obviously the stream first had to get to the router unimpinged.With all of the little pieces getting ample signal , the DSM was easily able to communicate with it 's media server application -LRB- installed on the downstairs Media PC -RRB- It presented my list of movies by title , as they 're organized on the hard drives . Unfortunately , you ca n't select a movie 's name and click `` enter '' on the remote . You need to drill down to the first . VTS file , and then , press `` enter '' . Nope , just kidding . Pressing `` enter '' makes the player run just that one . VTS file , and there are around a half dozen in a feature length movie . So , to get a seamless movie , press `` play '' on the remote at the top VTS file . Then they all run in sequence to the end . Nothing from D-Link will help you figure this out ; I had to scour the forums.However , having to drill down one level is n't the slickest thing in the world , but it works . The movie plays , and in full quality with Dolby Digital 5.1 audio.The DSM-320 is so frustratingly close to being what it should be . That is , it will play a movie perfectly and jitter-free for around a minute or so . Sometimes more , sometimes less . Sometimes a movie that started jittery will play the next time as fine , and then get jittery in a different spots . Sometimes it ca n't find its server . Occasionally it will trick you by playing a movie fine for awhile . Then , when you try another movie to be sure everything is really working ... nope . Sometimes you can go back to the movie that worked well and it 'll work well again . Or not . The problem with all this is , there are several dozen variables to manage , between the wireless elements and the quirks of the servers , so that just when you think you 've figured it out ... WRONG.This leads me to conclude that the DSM-320 simply ca n't consistently stream video in a way that makes it watchable for any length of time . If that 's what you need it for , save yourself a couple of lost weekends and look elsewhere.As for servers , I tried the D-Link Media Server , the TVersity server , and my TVedia server . With some fiddling -LRB- Tversity needed some codecs -RRB- I was able to get all of them to play the videos , but nothing could overcome the jitters.My verdict
 I am using TVersity and DSM-320 wired . It works OK with my ripped CD collection -LRB- except play list as another reviewer has noted -RRB- . I have been unable to get video feeds to work and I am having hit-and-miss luck with XM Radio using the uXM-shareware . In the end I paid $ 160 to and spent several -LRB- many -RRB- evenings playing with the set-up to try to get video feed and XM radio to work . Still DVD 's can not be played -LRB- which I knew , but it shows the limited functionality -RRB- . So that 's $ 160 to get CD 's to play and pictures to show on my TV . D-Link offered a $ 50 discount 4 days after I ordered my unit , which kind-of sucks but such is life.Tomorrow I am going to buy a MP3-RCA cable converter -LRB- $ 10-15 -RRB- and plug the computer sound card directly into my stereo and I am going to get a long monitor cable -LRB- $ 20-35 -RRB- and plug my front projector into the computer . Hence I will be able to get full functionality

 This product does not support the ID tags for your WMA files in Win98 SE , so you are not able to sort by album , artist or genre . D-link 's tech support has no fix for this , and will tell you to run Windows Media Connect , which is not available for Windows 98 . Your only option if you have WMA files is to convert them to MP3 's .
 The details in the bad experiences are clear in the other reviews . I had GeekSquad come out after taking two of them back to store because I could n't get them to work and tech support for D-Link said it was a bad unit - both times . So for quick fix , I called GeekSquad to come put it in , I thought easy . After 5 hours of trouble shooting , conference calls , tweaking , etc. , etc. , they left scratching their heads . COULD NOT MAKE IT WORK ! They even set up a temporary network with a barebones pc and it still would not work . THIS THING IS GOING BACK ! WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY . Which is a shame , because it sounded like such a great idea .
 Not very happy with this product.The software on the pc side does n't work well at all.Won ' t list all my files and I ca n't get it to update changes or new folders.This bugger has way to big of a foot print.The remote needs a skip function to fast foward through movies.Hey I have a Xbox with XBMC on it . Get a clue , and copy some of it 's functionality . It continues to blow away any of the media players I have purchased .
 An avid D-Link fan I am . Their routers and Wi-Fi equipment are top notch . But the DSM-320 is not as good as I expected . In fact I think it is quite bad . My bet is that you would be dissatisfied with it and return it -LRB- as I did -RRB- . Especially if you have a large amount of music and especially if it is Classical music . After having numerous problems finding a proper location in my house -LRB- I experienced a lot of drop-outs -RRB- I finally found one but it did not at all agree with where I really wanted it placed . The reception capability is weak and is definitely going to cause you a problem unless your computer is in the same room as the MediaLounge -LRB- God forbid ! -RRB- . Now , I have meticulously given my mp3 files proper names , artists , etc. . We all know that the tags are often wrong especially on older recordings . But the darn MediaLounge uses the tags to display the music rather than the file name so it becomes a real mess . And , the real killer is - the unit can not display enough characters to allow me to see which movement of a particular piece of music is being played as such information typically is truncated due to the number of character limitation ! Enough is enough so I decided to return it despite the expense of paying for re-stocking and return freight . But before I returned it I wrote to D-Link about my experience . They did not bother to answer or offer any encouraging news about updates or anything . Save yourself the agony and wait until something better comes around and be sure to check that whatever new comes out does not have the same limitations and weaknesses I mentioned above .
 wireless doesnt work and ethernet still does n't workwasted an hour ... I have tried another $ 99 similar product from huggcences which works great except it 's wired no wireless
 On reading all the negative reviews here and on other sites , I still decided to go ahead an risk the purchase . What a mistake . The product is unusable in real life . I had envisioned using this to view shows recorded with my pc 's tivo like functionality . Here are some points :1 . Some videos worked and some did n't . All the movie files were in the same format . I think size has something to do with it . The ones around an hour did n't work , the ones around 1/2 hours did .2 . Fast forwarding was extremely slow - maybe double normal viewing speed - so 30 sec commercial took 15 secs - useless ! 3 . I do have to say , when the video did work , it looked really good . I used to burn the shows onto dvd and watch them , and the videos through the DSM looked a LOT better .4 . Many people have complained about the remote . I think the problem in the main unit itself . It does n't have enough juice/horsepower to process video and respond to remote clicks in a timely manner . SOme videos , I tried to fast forward , and the unit would stop responding - I had to power it off and on again . Before I bought the product , I thought , if its broke , I 'll wait for the next software update - not now .5 . WHen viewing pictures - the same song gets repeated over and over and over again . It 's horrible . And if you try to switch the track , you loose your position in the slideshow and have to start from the beginning again .6 . I returned the unit within 24 hours.It 's clear to me that no one at Dlink has taken the product home to use themselves . If they had , it would have been a much better product . The product is unusable in everyday life.PS - if you do buy this product , and you have MAC address filtering turned on on your router , make sure you add the MAC address of the DSM to your allow list - I forgot all about this . Also , I had no problem getting this working over WEP .
 I ordered this product last month . I never received it and the seller would not respond to my e-mails . Beware of this seller before you buy !!!!
 I really liked the idea of a media server . I thought of building my own but the positive reviews for this product in a couple places convinced me to give it a try.What a mistake.First of all , this unit is NOT possible to get to work with Linux . Do n't bother trying . I really hate when companies invent yet another proprietary protocol for something that could have been just as easily -LRB- or even more easily -RRB- using STANDARD protocols that already exist . Bad , bad , bad ... So , then I got it working with an XP box and even then it was very SLOW . I know some people complained that it was slow with large amounts of files . My media library is n't that large yet.Even beyond that I found it cumbersome to use as I ALWAYS had to have the TV on . A product like this should be useable on it 's own with the TV . It should have a small display on it and it should take less than 5 button presses -LRB- each with a pause between them -RRB- just to play music . I should be able to hit one or two buttons such as PLAY then SHUFFLE and it should just play all my music shuffled . Even though the remote is pretty good there should also be buttons on the box . Even the most basic DVD players have buttons to at least play , stop , pause and skip to next on the panel . I have kids who stash my remotes in places that take me a while to find . In that case this unit is IMPOSSIBLE to use.After a weekend of messing with it I found it extrememly frustrating and it 's going back .
 Where to begin ? Bought DSM-320 on July 2 . Installation of software was not a problem , however , it required first call to tech-no-support to get the unit to recognize the Belkin wireless server . However , I have yet to play one song or look at one picture . Second call to tech-no-support on July 3 did not resolve this issue and I was told to call back on July 5 to speak with `` product specialist '' who was only available from 8 am to 5 pm PST.Came home from work early -LRB- as I am on EST -RRB- and third call to tech-no-support and I was told that `` product specialist '' is only able to call me back and the `` senior technical specialist '' that I was speaking with was not permitted to transfer me to the product specialist and that he could only put a note in my log for the specialist to call me . Now , seeing as my computer and 320 are at home and I work away from home , as probably the majority of people do , I find it unreasonable and counterintuitive to have purchasers wait by the phone to be contacted by a product specialist , if in fact such a person exists.I was also told that the supervisors were in a management meeting and then was told that senior technical specialists are the supervisors and thus , there is no one above them to speak with . Two plus hours on the phone and still unable to play any files.I purchased this unit specifically because I use Yahoo music and this is touted by Yahoo as being compatible with the Yahoo music server . The first day the 320 recognized the Yahoo server , but it is now unable to locate at all . I will be returning the unit tomorrow and try my luck with another product .
 Unless you are some kind of computer software engineer or love to build things like train sets or models this unit is a complete piece of junk . You must be ready to troubleshoot the firmware upgrades , installing Windows Media Connect and still spend the entire weekend setting this thing up . I even found a message board online with a community of owners discussing problems , d-link tech support aggrevations and general complaints . The only positive areas are where people have found ways to work around all the problems this thing has.After all the bad reviews I read , I was still stupid enough to buy the DSM-320 because I really want to stream media from my computer to my home stereo . What a mistake . It is not a plug and play media device !!! I am a music lover and fairly comfortable working my way around the computer , but this thing is a beta model . Now why would I want to buy a product that has known issues and wait for the company to fix them and release the upgrades ? I have microsoft for that ! D-link should be ashamed of putting this product out to the public . I am returing it today.So in short , DO N'T BUY THIS PRODUCT !
 These things have nothing but bass . I like bass , but it 's ridiculous . You ca n't turn it down or control it . Forget about using these on iPods or anything where you ca n't really adjust the base pre-amp . And even when you can , the bass is so strong , it 's impossible to get decent sound . You may hear no words to the songs , and you may not be able to distinguish any instruments , but you will hear and feel the base 18 houses down the block . If you are not using this with a computer which gives you full control of the sound , DO NOT BUY .
 The bass sounds very hollow and boomy . The woofer is also too loud compared to the left and right speakers . Since there 's no way to adjust the volume of the woofer separately , I ended up not being able to turn the speakers up as much as I wanted to -- the bass would overpower the rest of the sound when I did.The volume control is deceptive . When you turn the volume up 50 % , you get about 90 % of the maximum sound output . The remaining half of the volume control is pretty much useless.The cord connecting the left and right speakers is permanently attached to both of them , which can be annoying . It 's about 6 feet long -- too short for my desk . The input cord and the cord to the woofer are also permanently attached to the right speaker .
 The bass on these speakers is annoyingly boomy on many songs -LRB- bluegrass and other acoustic music , I 'm not talking Hip-Hop here -RRB- and there is no way to adjust it b/c there is no bass or tone control . Changing the equalizer settings in Windows Media Player helps some but does not solve the problem , and I use many other kinds of audio programs , not all of which have equalizers to adjust . You ca n't use them w/out the subwoofer because it supplies power to the speakers .
 These speakers have no separate adjustment for subwoofer volume . You will have to use equalizer settings in whatever media program you are using if you want to tone down the subwoofer . Also , the speakers will not work without the subwoofer plugged in . So , this is not the product for you if you need to keep things quiet at times .
 They are nice looking speakers but they arent very loud . I didnt think that not having control over the subwoofer would be an issue but it is . I really dont like not being able to modulate the bass . Like I said , you get what you pay for . Im gon na put them in my office and be happy I didnt pay a lot for them .
 I got these very cheap with a coupon so they totalled below 3 dollars shipped . They are not really worth even that . In iTunes , I have set the bass on its absolute lowest settings and I can still barely hear non-bassy sound . The bass interference is so heavy that I can not even hear the words to songs without modifying the equalizer heavily . I called the company about it and they said that it was typical for the model .
 I just got these speakers , I was excited to try them out after all the good reviews . No matter what genre of music I listened to and how much I adjusted the equalizer in windows media player , the bass was just completely overwhelming everything else , had a distorted sound , and gave me a huge headache . The overall sound quality is poor , I will be sending these back tomorrow !
 The speakers are relatively inexpensive . Accordingly the sound quality is also sub-optimal . The volume knob needs to be turned all the way `` up '' in order to hear anything audible.If I had to do this again , I would have spent a bit more to receive a decent set of speakers .
 You get what you pay for . For best sound with iTunes I found that the ` Treble Booster ' Equalizer setting is needed . Louder than my Thinkpad speakers but I 'm afraid to compare the quality until this transaction is no longer visible on my online bank statement .
 I bought this because it was economical and because some of the other reviewers praised it . I did n't need hi-fidelity . I just wanted to be able to play audio for laptop-based presentations in a medium-sized room . This is not the speaker system you want for that.Steve
 I had a pair of JBL 's that came with my compaq computer and wanted a little more base for my music . I thought these would be perfect and were a great price . Well right off the bat I have to go back to the previous posts that warned of a ` Hollow base ' sound . It 's not just hollow , it 's vibrating and hollow . Not an attractive sound . The two side speakers did not have the rich sound as the JBL 's . But at the end of the day I had more base less richness is sound and an irratating noise called a base speaker . You can cut the output from the computer down to about 70 % and you have a decent set of speakers . Price is Equal to Value on this one . -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- Lesson learned -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- Spend the bucks to get a nice set of computer speakers . I thought I would go the cheap route and lost .
 The speakers sounded great upon opening the box . Within a week , the sub wolfer quit working . Since I know longer have the original box , I can not return the item .
 I bought this item thinking it was a thrifty and reliable way to burn DVDs off my Mac . I made a huge mistake . It takes 10 hours to get these DVDs burn a 45 minute standard definition DVD . I tried playing it back on 5 different DVD players . None of them worked.I have had lots of success with other brands of blank DVD media , such as Staples , Memorex , and Sony . A warning to all those people who want a good buy on blank DVDs
 I looked at the box when it arrived and discovered a sticker that advertised drivers for Windows Vista.I went to their site and looked for drivers for Win7 . I tried it directly on Win7 which failed to install a driver . I have wireless working on all my linux machines so I never thought to try this on any of my linux installations.The velcro tape fell off , which was OK . By then I had lost patience with the device and hope of finding a driver that worked on Win7 . For the specific purpose for which this was bought , setting up a new gaming desktop , this was a failure . I dug out an old wireless from ALFA Networks , downloaded a driver through one of my laprops , moved it to the desktop with an SD card , and I have my gaming machine working.The Netgear ? I wish I had thought to check for linux compatibility , but it has already been submitted for electronic recycling when I could have given it to a needy linux user.As an aside , since I had to submit serial number information to Netgear to search for a driver , they sent me a welcome to their list of registered users . I sent them a mail requesting removal , but no response . Netgear is a brand name I will remember , in order to avoid future issues .
 My internal card gets full strength signals , this one barely gets reception even within a room or two 's distance . Go with another brand .
 Do not buy this thinking it is a cheaper alternative to the TiVo branded adapter . I have a dual tuner Series 2 with software version 9.3 . It would not recognize this unit . Word to the wise ...
 While version 1 -LRB- WG111v1 -RRB- works with later versions of TiVo , Version 2 has not compatibility whatsoever . To make matters worse , it is impossible to tell which version you got until you open the friggin box and look -- which is totally ludicrous . Bait and Switch , people , Bait and Switch .
 This thing is a nightmare . Cuts out constantly and at random times for no apparent reason . The internet could be working just fine and then randomly , it will stop working and stop detecting any wireless networks in range ... only to magically start working again a few hours or days later . It is not the range since it is only about 15 feet away from my router , so I really do not know what the problem is .
 I rarely write reviews . And let me tell you this item is complete trash . As other users have stated it simply stops working after a couple of days . Major headache !
 I bought this to use with my TIVO . The TIVO did n't recognize it because I was sent a v2 instead of v1 . I tried to use it on my Windows XP and 2000 computers and both crashed repeatably . I am going to return it and look for a V1 .
 Version 2 of this adapter will not work with TIVO . TIVO will not recognize this version the WG111 . To find the right card make sure to look at the SERIAL NUMBERS on the box . They must start with ' 130 ' or ` WG72 ' if they do n't have those serial numbers , you are out of luck .
 I do n't know if I got a bad one , but I bought this one at best buy , and was literally a last minute thing , and was probably the worst last minute decision in my life . I am a gamer , and this thing will drop the connection and literally is useless . I 've been wondering if it 's my computer or the usb wireless . After reading alot of the bad reviews on here about this item , it 's definitely the usb wireless 's fault . because I under the frustration from this wireless adapter , I guess it 's time to upgrade . BTW I did a speedtest and my 5 year old laptop gets a better connection than this lol .
 Oh , how I wish I would have read all the reviews before buying this thing . I had a terrible time getting it to connect with my router , but eventually got it to work . I noticed the device ran quite hot -LRB- within in minutes of being plugged in -RRB- , but foolishly ignored it . I left it on for 24 hours and came back to find my hard drive * and * motherboard blown . I ca n't pin it on Netgear 's device , but it sure seems odd to me . After getting a new hard drive and a new motherboard , I am looking elsewhere to find a wireless Internet adapter . Save your $ 12.00 ! My little purchase cost me over $ 200.00 , huge data loss , and a ton of time to reinstall it all .
 WG111 V2 is NOT recognized by TIVO . V1 is.Verify with the seller BEFORE you buy.Ilearned the hard way
 So I wrote a loooooooooooooong email to my boss , explaining a protocol we were designing to implement , and hit send , and guess what , the Netgear smart wizard was looking for the wireless connection from my router across the room ... It could n't find and make that connection and lost the webpage , and I ended up all fuming over this break in wireless network . I had to write that again as a word ducoment so that I can SAVE it before trusting this stupid USB adapter.So this was just an example of what this thing is doing to me , and it has not happened just once . MANY TIMES has it lost the router , my laptop with in-built wireless adapter does not do this to me . And there 's no cure for this stupid disease .
 I agree with other users ... . If you read the TIVO recommended wireless network adapters , this adapter will not work in TIVO because AMAZON is going to ship you out V. 2 . V. 2 does not work , and V. 1 is not longer made . I suggest you just order the TIVO brand ... . that 's what I did , after trying numerous others.and YES , I have a brand new unit with the latest software , that 's NOT the issue .
 I have a three computers with wireless adapters and a wireless router , all netgear . I ca n't get but one computer working on the wireless network and it is a laptop with pmcia wirless card . The others have totally frustrated me . I purchased the recomended devices netgear offered . My main computer wo n't hookup without a wire with the router and usb devise within a foot of each other . I wish I had gone with linksys , their equipment is easier to program . I bought the netgear because of the -LRB- ... -RRB- offered and ended up not getting the -LRB- ... -RRB- after all . Save yourself some headaches and get another brand .
 I have a Netgear router and this wireless USB adapter . I used the router WGT624 for several months just as a firewall directly hooked into my computer and never had any problems . A few days ago however I moved my computer and decided to use this USB card and have had nothing but problems since . Half the time on start up my computer will not be connected so I have to reboot . Sometimes multiple reboots and then it still does n't work and I have to unhook everything , router , cable modem , etc. . I do n't know how or why this happens but it seems to make everything stuck and nothing can communicate again until I do this . This has happened several times so I am not imagining this . I try various things but ultimately I have to shut everything down and actually unplug the modem from the power source for a few seconds then start everything back up . I have cable and this is a procedure they have you do sometimes if things get locked up , usually when you have a bad connection . I did n't have to do this when it was just hooked into the router , but with this USB piece of junk I am doing it every day , sometimes several times a day . Then it shows a connection of like 55 % and the router is in the very next room . That is with the door open , not 20 feet away . Even now as I sit here writing this the little computer on the task bar showing my connection has dropped to yellow . At least it has n't changed red ... crap , just did , not freakin kidding ! This is absolute junk which I would take back except I got it in a package deal with the router and I bought it a long time ago but never used it till now . When it does work it is quick . But WHEN is the key word there . Do yourself a favor , BUY SOMETHING ELSE ! Do n't corporations test this crap before they mass market it ?!?
 The brilliant folks at Netgear sell this lovely wireless adapter w/o the driver to run it . Of course they include in the package a big bold note saying you can download the driver from their website . But wait ! The function of the wireless adapter is to connect to the Internet . Duh ! No driver , no Internet ! Brilliant way to save a nickel !
 This product gave me no trouble in Windows XP SP1 or SP2 . I also got it up and running on Windows 98 . However , whenever I try to use it on a Windows 98V1 , it will work with everyting except the internet . This is very annoying , and this is the computer we bought it for . The Netgear help desk has n't helped either .
 worked but a weird deal , not sure if my computer was the problem or this thing ... i cant say it is bad or good sorry ...
 As always , a crucial point to look for as a gamer is whether or not a wireless adapter will have heat issues down the line . I had this product for nearly fourteen months , and out of the blue it started getting heat issues , giving me 1.0 mbps for hours on end if I was on Warcraft or even surfing the internet . After reinstalling the driver , I had about 36.0 mbps to even 11mbps with a perfect signal , clearly indicating that it had heated up , or started working improperly . All my anti-virus scans and my spyware scans came up empty -LRB- as they should , since I do them regularly -RRB- , and I have concluded that this heats up.Simply stated , it heats up quite quickly as other reviewers have said , it is too fat , and that 1.0 mbps stuff annoyed me.Buy Linksys or D-Link instead .
 I ordered this when I got a new Dell desktop and needed to connect with the wireless network in my home . It was easy to set up but that is the end of the good news.This adapter just randomly looses its connection to the network . In the space of one hour , it will loose its connection at least twice , if not three times . Reconnecting is no problem - I just click on Repair and it goes through the motions and connects back right away . I reinstalled it a few times but the same thing happens.This is a very irritating feature , especially when I am using Skype ! I have had enough and I am ordering a new adapter from a different manufacturer !
 I tested on 2 PCs , a Mac and a Dish receiver and It did n't worked . I dint minded that it was used , as long as it work .
 The driver should be updated from the web site before doing anything or it will give you very hard time.It is not straight forward to adjust it for WEP Key . Took me about 4 hours troubleshooting , although I have 3 other wireless access points that were much more easier to install with trouble free experience.Regarding connection , I had no problems.Don ' t buy it if you are not an expert in troubleshooting .
 I just bought this adapter and got the latest drivers -LRB- 2.1 -RRB- . It just cant hold a connection no matter how close to the AP . It disconnects every 2-3mins which is extremely annoying trying to transfer files etc.Don ' t Buy this unless you do n't mind periodic disconnections.PS I tried XP SP2 and SP1 , do n't believe the crap they spin on the website about it being a problem with SP2 !
 Although the software interface was n't the most sophisticated , the WG111 was easy to install and worked well enough for about six months . Then it started dropping connections to the various networks I 'd been using , and now it does n't connect at all . I 've done quite a bit of troubleshooting ; apparently , it 's fairly common for the WG111 to crap out after several months . Do n't buy it .
 The good is the hardware . Neat , tidy , easy to hook up . The bad is the software , which is unreliable at best -LRB- not sure whether it 's kludgy , or just does n't work well -- tried with flavours of Windows from 95 through 2000 and XP pro.The ugly is support
 I bought this product for the conveninece of not having to open my desktop and for the mobility - being able to transfer it from desktop to laptop . Worked great for about 2 months and then it started causing my computer to reboot byself . At first this happened with my desktop - i was convinced my computer was broken - i spent $ 100 on repairs -LRB- I know I got ripped off here -RRB- . Until I started using it with 2 laptops and the same thing started happening . I took it to another techy who told me that this is a frequent problemt with these usb deviced and that I would have to do something to my `` bio '' - i said screw it - and bought a built in card . I know other people who have the same problem and it could be very costly - when you are in the middle of working on a file and it reboots . Neygear CS sucks too - they outsources and I ended up speking to some girl in India who did not understand my question and just kept reading the same script over and over again - DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY !
 I could not get this product to work . Tried using the manual and website instructions . Purchase a brand new and that one works fine .
 It worked at first but the connection kept dropping . Then every time you try to open the wizard it flashes on the screen for a second and disappears . You ca n't get the wizard to stay on screen for more than a second so ca n't change any settings . A total waste of time and money - do n't bother with it .
 Am sorry to say . you do n't need a rate , if ask me concerning the rate ! its really worse ! why ? because I order this netgear wg111 , but without CD installer , am getting insane to install and i can not use , when i ask the CD installer , you sent me the SpeedBooster not compatible on Netgear WG111 , and I sent it back to you , but my payment you did not sent me back , until now you have my payment , am sorry I can not trust you , what I experience in your handRodolfo
 Worked ok at first then started randomly disconnecting . I have XP and I found out after much troubleshooting that this was the reason my computer kept freezing !!! Complete freeze no ctr + alt + del had to manually turn off my system . Spend the money for a nicer better one . Look at all the bad reviews , DO NOT BUY !!
 This product is horrible . We own a Belkin and it works , unlike this wireless adapter . I thought I 'd try this one since it 's smaller and a bit less money , but it does n't does n't pick up any signal from our modem , and the modem is across the hall in the next room . In addition , I bought it from State Street Deals , and they wo n't let us return it because it 's been opened . How else would we find out it does n't work ? Definitely NOT a great product , or merchant . I 'd avoid both at any cost .
 bought this wireless receiver at a local radio shack for about 40 bucks because i do n't have a phone line in my room and i needed internet after i relocated my computer from the office to my room . It constantly drops internet , at least 4 or 5 times a day as bad as every 5 minutes sometimes . I can not find patterns to solve the problem . I contacted customer service . That was even worse than the product . The only advice I got was that I needed to install the software over again the exact same way as the first time . That was after the person floundered for half an hour when I was trying to explain to him that YES , I do get internet with it . But NO , it is not steady and cuts out constantly . took that long all the while he kept telling me if i ca n't get any internet service it means i must have some sort of interference which i do n't because its just through one wall 10 feet away and then he resorted to telling me to start over and sorry that 's all we can do , can we help you with anything else today . Pathetic . Please do n't buy this product . I wish i had just installed a phone line for less money and hooked up reliable corded internet .
 What 's great about it
 This product is quite unreliable . I 've had it only 8 days and it gets very hot and ca n't find the access point -LRB- in the next room -RRB- and the included software is quite unreliable with XP .
 Installation was simple , but this device has not worked consistently well from the outset . Signal is OK but once or twice a week it simply quits working , forcing us to unplug and plug it back into the USB port . We put up with that inconvenience for several months until it quit working altogether . Do yourself a favor and find another product -LRB- as we are trying to do now -RRB- .
 this is the biggest piece of junk i 've seen in my entire life . . the range of this is poor and the speed just suck . It 's no fun at all . . this is the second time i 've had a bad experience with a netgear product and from now on i 'm avoiding it like plague . . what a waste of money and time .
 I just spent hours of frustration trying to get this thing to work reliably . Never got it working correctly . Netgear wo n't just let you install the drivers and be done with it . No , they force you to install their bloated and buggy configuration software which does n't play well with Windows XP -LRB- apparently -RRB- . So , after much cursing and hair-pulling , I took it back and exchanged it for a comparable Linksys adapter . Now all is right again in my universe . If you are looking for a USB wireless adapter , do yourself a favor and go back to the search page and type in L-i-n-k-s-y-s .
 If you do n't mind blue screens of death or having your PC lockup or reboot after 45 minutes to an hour , this is the product for you . Works fine until it gets warm and then the fun begins.The longest I have been able to stay online is approximately an hour . No wonder they 're selling for $ 15 used on here ... they 're lawn wafers.I had no problems even remotely close to this until I plugged in this turd , so I know it 's the culprit.Back to Best Buy it goes .
 I 'm normally very cautious when purchasing new hardware and I always shop around for the best deals . In this case , though , I rushed in like a fool and bought this for $ 50 at Office Depot b/c I really needed Internet access at my new place.This adapter is horrible . It 's supposed to get a very strong signal from where I am , but its signal strength is always low when plugged directly into my motherboard . When plugged into a USB 2.0 extension cable , I get very good or excellent signal strength , but it will often lose the signal when under heavy load . This is incredibly frustrating when I want to watch a streaming video , access multiple websites at once , or game . It also runs VERY hot with nothing in the way of keeping it cool . Horrible .
 It works sometimes but most the time it ca n't pick up enough of a signal to work .
 After reading other reviews I decided to order this model , listed as a NetgearWG111 , to use with my new TiVo system . What I received was a Netgear WG111USA , which IS NOT COMPLIANT with TiVo systems . After over a month I am still waiting for my refund to be credited to my card . The difference is in the details - get them right folks !
 I have a VERY nice , expensive Netgear WG302 wireless access point . Using this adapter on W2K to talk to it if any sort of encryption is enabled it will drop the connection once every 5 seconds . I updated the firmware on the AP and downloaded newer drivers for the WG111 and it improved to only dropping once every two minutes . Signal strength is greater than 80 % , so it 's not that , and I have other wireless devices much further away from the AP that work fine.You would think that it would work with their own hardware ...
 Do n't get this adapter unless you are : A
 Although I am very happy with the other NetGear products I own I have to say that this adapter is a waste of money . It 's easy to set up -LRB- I 'm running Windows 2000 -RRB- and starts working at first , but after less than a half hour , it flickers out and stops working entirely.I have a NetGear router and laptops using NetGear PCI wireless cards which work well , but this product is a dog . I second one of the earlier reviewers who mentioned how hot the item gets after a short time in use . My guess is that it has a design flaw that causes it to overheat and stop working . They should really go back to the drawing board on this one .
 I installed this adapter on a desktop running windows xp service pack 2 , well in range from my 54G wireless base station . Though signal is strong -LRB- often reporting at 54Mb and usually at least 12Mb -RRB- but the actual netowrk connection is very sporadic to the degree that it 's almost impossible to browse any website without a long wait -LRB- and a lot of the times it simple drops -RRB- . I searched Netgear 's website and found an updated driver for this adapter to work with xp sp2 , but after downloading and installing that , it did n't get any better . I then tried removing sp2 from my xp install and it did n't get any better either . My computer as well as my ISP are in good condition . When I tried an old Microsoft wireless-b USB adapter on the same computer , everything worked just fine . So I have to conclude that this adapter is really a piece of junk , especially when used with windows xp . I 'm hoping Netgear would put out some better driver fix and I 'll probably give one last try before throwing the adapter in the trash .
 I was a little skeptical at first about using this device ... do to it 's incredibly small size . However I quickly fell in love with how easy it was to install on my windows xp machine and the excellent Netgear Smart Wizard that sits in my system tray , making it possible for anyone to quickly get connected to their network . Unfortunately my original skepticism quickly came back to confront me . After using the device for only a few days my connection dropped . I had to unplug the thing and reboot my computer before I was able to get back on my network . I 've only had it for about 2 weeks and I 've had to unplug it and restart my computer probably 15 times to get it to work again . I never used to have problems in the past with my other wireless usb adapters so I have a good feeling that it 's due to this devise . I do notice that it gets very hot if you leave it in your computer for a long time , I 'm no engineer but this might be somehow related to its poor performance .
 Perhaps I am luckier ... my Netgear adapter `` crapped out '' five times in the first two weeks . After reading all these negative reviews , I decided just to take it back while I still could . Netgear support was spotty -- some reps really tried . But I had one simply give up and walk away fromt the call !
 I bought this for my sister-in-law , she needed an inexpensive USB wireless adapter for her TiVo . It is not supported by TiVo , that was our fault for not checking . However , her apartment features free WiFi for it 's residents , so I hooked it up to her desktop computer running Windows XP . It worked for about 4-6 weeks . Now , it just sits with the software interface saying `` scanning '' , but will not connect to the network . She has a laptop -LRB- with built-in WiFi adapter -RRB- that connects to the same network whilst sitting right next to the desktop.I tried reinstalling , completely removing the Netgear software and reinstalling , even a system restore to before it was installed -LRB- and then a reinstall -RRB- . I tried the USB adapter on her laptop -LRB- Windows 7 -RRB- and my laptop -LRB- Mac OS X 10.6 -RRB- . Nothing worked.I then called tech support . After 4 elevations of the issue , the best they could tell me was that it was a problem with the wireless signal , not the Netgear adapter . They actually implied that I was lying when I mentioned that two laptops -LRB- her Windows 7 machine and my Mac -RRB- were sitting on the same desk and connecting with good signal strength . And they refused to honor the warranty.Based on this experience , I will avoid Netgear products in the future .
 I bought this for my daughter 's computer . It worked great when I first installed it but would not keep the computer on the internet unless I was actively using it . Every time I reboot the computer it takes me 20 minutes to reset and now it is not working at all . It is so worthless that I just ordered the linksys wireless - g usb adapter .
 I bought this to connect a mac desktop to our wireless network.Although it states on the box it is ` mac compatible ' what it neglects to mention is that the driver provided on the installation disk will not work with mac os . I attempt to download the driver from the netgear site from another computer and then I am informed that this is provided by a 3rd party for an additional 15 dollars.I will be returning this to the store today .
 I ordered this item directly from TiVo and my DVR did n't even recognize that it was there ! TiVo says that it is compatible , but it is NOT . Order the Linksys or D-Link instead .
 I really liked this model . It played our DVDs and DivX movies very well . It started up quickly , its settings were well-designed , and it seemed sturdy.So why did I return it ? Because it was noisy . We could clearly hear it running during movies . My old Liteon -LRB- non-upscaling -RRB- player was much quieter , and the new Sony and LG players we tried were virtually silent.Too bad . I liked everything else about the Pioneer , but the noise was a showstopper .
 Less than a year old , but skips and freezes on nearly every movie . Plenty of ventilation , and clean scratch-free discs , still skips . Replaced it with a Panasonic DMP-BD35K Blu-Ray player which has much better upconversion .
 I 'm from Costa Rica , when I receive this unit it 's works fine for 2 days , but after that , anytime that I play any disc , a NO DISC ERROR shows on the LED Screen . I hope I can change the Unit for a new one .
 Nice player -LRB- give it two stars for professional appearance , nice gui and remote -RRB- but when it comes down to playing videos there are serious problems . Take a standard widescreen dvd and play it on this unit and you 'll notice clipping of the image on both sides of the screen , and yes this the unit is properly set up for widescreen playback . The screen is clipped and then expanded to provide the final image on screen -LRB- still having the black bars on top and bottom -RRB- . This clipping and expansions creates noticeable image artifacts that are not apparent on the true dvd source -LRB- also not apparent on certain other dvd players therefore it is a problem with the player specifically -RRB- . Initially I could n't tell that the image was clipped -LRB- you do n't know what your missing if you do n't know what was suppose to be there in the first place -RRB- but watching videos there was consistent distortion in the aspect ratios and after reviewing images on the dv-400v and other players , the dv-400v does change and distort the video.DivX playback when compared to the DVP-5982 -LRB- Philips -RRB- has noticeable compression block artifacts that again with good decompression codecs should be much less apparent.The unit also can not perform 720p on a HDCP capable monitor -LRB- HDMI-DVI -RRB- with the newer revisions of the unit . Serial numbers beginning with GD could but I bought the ones that were available and they begin with GI and this problem is there -LRB- a known problem that other users have reported -RRB- . So there are some serious problems with the unit if you are a videophile but if you 're not you 'll find this an easy unit to use.As for me ... I 'm returning it tomorrow and ordering an Oppo DV-980H .
 I emailed Pioneer and asked if this would work with HDMI to DVI and what is the difference between this and DV-410V-K ? They said the only thing is the USB on the DV-410V-K is HD and it will work HDMI to DVI.It does not work , but I bought the DV-410V-K and it does work with HDMI to DVI .
 Dead in 30 min . Sent back for full refund . Amazon was quick to take care of me .
 I ca n't see how a company can advertise a multi-format DVD player that only plays region 1 DVDs . I do n't have much use for a DVD player advertised to play PAL as well as NTSC that will not play region 2 DVDs . Pioneer is disceptive in their advertising and this is the last product I buy from them.The picture quality is not bad but it is not worth the price for a non-recorder DVD player . It does upconvert to 1080P through the HDMI cable . I have a 40 inch LCD it it is impossible for me to detect any upgrade of picture quality from this player set to 1080P and another player that plays at 1080I . Less expensive players give just as good a picture . So unless you own a lot of region free PAL DVDs you should choose a different player .
 This player can not recognize any mpg/mpeg files on DVD+R and - R. I read the manual very carefully and found that it never mentions that it can play MPEG.I tried to burn one mpg , one avi , and one divx file on a DVD-R . The player can play avi and divx without any problems . However , the mpg file just never shows up . It 's a shame that a DivX certified player can not recognize MPEG . What a joke!Besides , the manual also mentions some restriction on DVD+R disc . This player would play + R disc only when it 's a DVD Video -LRB- backup DVD movies -RRB- .
 Disk in and out are slow than my old Poineer . USB only support real USD driver , not my mp3 or hard disk . Support mp4 ? no ! It should say , some of the mp4 format , NOT all mp4.Not worth the money .
 This DVD player is a disappointment
 I do n't really know much about these things , but I just bought two of them because Consumer Reports rated them highly . I hooked up the first one and it worked great for about 30 minutes , then it stopped working until it cooled down . I hooked up the other in another room and it works , but the HDMI connection seems a little loose . It still works , but I have to get the cable in just the right position . It does the same thing on two different brand new cables , so it 's definitly the box . Maybe I just got two lemons , but I wo n't buy Pioneer again . Good luck .
 I bought this unit for the USB port . Pretty decent DVD player so far . I had a Philips and it beats that one hands down.Unfortunately , the USB port can only supply enough power for low power USB devices . The small flash drives will work . The bigger USB disk drives powered only by USB will not . The external disk drives that also have a power connection will work . Not nearly as convenient though.I give it two stars because of this drawback . Engineering-wise , it would not have been hard to supply more power . Frustrating.This limitation is mentioned in the instruction manual -LRB- but then again who would have access to that before purchasing , let alone wonder if their drive would work -RRB- .
 I purchased this Pioneer DV-400V-K to get higher resolution from my old DVD 's on a new Sony KDL-40V2500 1080P widescreen . The Pioneer can be set to 480I or P , 720P , 1080I or P , but the highest resolution I can get it to play in is 480P . If I set it on anything higher the picture goes black after 20-30 seconds.After careful comparison for image quality -LRB- I also have my old Sony DVD player hooked up so comparison is easily done -RRB- there is a slight improvement in 480P over 480I , but it is subtle . I was disapointed that I was not able to get a higher resolution . I was assured by the salesman and reviews I read that I would get close to high res out of my regular 480I dvd 's on this player . This did not happen . I am interested in hearing from any other buyers that have had this problem and if anything can be done about it short of returning it and trying another brand.I would consider getting a HD DVD player or Blu-ray , which also claim to upconvert older DVD 's , but I am reluctant to believe them after this Pioneer upconverter experience .
 Bought this dvd player so that we can watch european dvds , the problem is that the player does not come modified to watch the dvds from UK right away . We sent it back and both it again from a vendor that sells it already modified for only a few bucks more .
 Since this was the number 2 rated DVD player in the 2008 CR Buying Guide , I thought I had nothing to lose . Wrong ! The Standard definition picture is pretty bad ; I knew that from the review . The 720p setting provides an extremely clear picture ; I also knew that from the review . However , the disc tracking is absolutely horrible on this thing . A tiny smudge or scrape on a disc gives this player fits . Even discs that have no apparent defects wo n't play . I performned an experiment
 Out of the box , the DV400 seemed like a decent player -- relative to my four year old Sony , it had better menu navigation , better remote , and more playback video/audio adjustments . Most importantly , it had the USB port , and it did a decent job of playing DIVX movie files.For the few days it worked.After about a week , it started skipping , stuttering , and stalling on every DVD attempted , even some that were literally brand new . All of them played fine in my other DVD player . Does n't anyone have quality control anymore?Anyway , nice concept but it 's on its way back for a refund .
 The software provided explicitly does not work with NT 4 even though the box claims the drive supports NT 4 . I tried to call their tech support number about 6 times to find out what alternative software I could use . Each time there was hold music for 30 minutes followed by a message saying to email them , and then they disconnected me . I do n't think they actually have anyone manning the phones . I finally returned the drive . I 'll never buy another Sony drive .
 I 've had the drive for a few months now , and it worked fine during most of this time . But a couple weeks ago , the drive stopped working with CD-R 's . It simply wo n't recognize the disc , and causes the entire computer to stall at times . It can still read regular CD 's . Now I own a broken Sony mini-stero system -LRB- a gift -RRB- , a broken Sony car CD changer -LRB- also a gift -RRB- , and this broken Sony CD-R drive . I wo n't be fooled again into buying any more Sony junk .
 Here 's a list of what I 've discovered I CA N'T do with the Sony Spressa CD-RW . I CAN NOT
 I rate the product as worhtless because I did not need the weights for the camera case that I purchased . I went diving 130ft deep and the weights were never needed for for the camera . I would like to return the weights since I have not used them and they are basically worthless to me .
 I lost the weights the second day of use . Bottom line the motion of the water as you swim unscrews the weights from the camera body . Save your money on this one .
 Canon , I 'm appalled
 Canon should have included the WW-DC1 with the waterproof case or should have produced the case with the correct weight to make it and the camera neutrally buoyant . Lacking that , purchasers of any waterproof case should ask their hardware store for lead flashing that can be cut in to pieces to fit inside the case to obtain the same objective.The case , by the way , makes focusing and aiming very difficult when snorkeling in bright light .
 I want to share a thought I wish someone had given me before I bought this . First off you do n't need any weights to use this camera while scuba diving ; second the screw for these weights to be attached to the camera is no good as it is not long and tight enough and does not lock down very well resulting in me losing the weights the first time I used them . It was a complete wsate of money .
 Well , the first one I received lasted 10 minutes . Smooth return and exchange . Second one I received lasted 2 minutes.Both times it lost signal and went blank . No option to pick another station or anything . Totally blank.There are 6 good reviews for this , so I guess I just had bad luck , but I felt the need to review anyway.While it worked , the sound was great.I expect my electronics to work for longer than 12 minutes though .
 Note that this product is the same as Model MBL-FX-XMTR300 . You have to rely on the picture in order to validate that here.I was disappointed with the sound when using this device with my Zune 8GB . I only needed to listen for about 10 minutes before deciding it was not for me -LRB- I gave it two different chances to perform -RRB- . The music I played sounded a bit `` muffled '' to me -- a little like I was listening to AM radio . I am not an audiophile , but I am an amateur musician -- and I do listen carefully . I want to listen carefully . I found the music frustrating to listen to . Maybe I am a little spoiled by the better sound results produced using my old cassette adapter . I definitely prefer the sound produced using my cassette adapter . My next car stereo will no doubt have a stereo jack . If the cassette module in my car stereo were to break tomorrow , I would rather pay $ 250 to have a new stereo installed in my car than use this device . Perhaps it 's just a fact that all FM transmitters are `` limited '' . I noticed that MonsterCable did not make any guarantees about sound quality on their packaging . I suppose the device does produce `` stereo sound '' -- but it 's not nearly as nice a sound as FM radio . If you are satisfied with the sound of AM radio -LRB- I enjoy listening to AM radio on occasion -RRB- , then you may be completely satisfied using this device . I hope that someone finds this review helpful .
 This is sold at a premium price and should be a premium product . It is NOT ; it is high priced junk that should not have gotten past their Quality Department into the market.The first unit lasted 3 weeks on a network of 4 users with a DSL rated @ 384 Kbps.The tech service people refused to believe their unit could be at fault and blamed it on the ISP . I replaced this $ 450 router with a $ 50 one and all worked fine.After a 2 hour wait for a Level 2 tech , I was issued a replacement unit . This unit , with serial # 4952 , replaced one with a 125 serial # so I assumed the bug had been resolved . This unit died after 35 minutes of use.I then called Netgear Tech Service people again and waited 2.5 hours for a Level 2 Technician . A recording came on telling me that they were too busy -LRB- after I waited for them for 2.5 hours -RRB- and told me to call at a later date and disconnected me.I fired off a short letter to Netgear 's Technical VP and CEO - which created a response . They offered to get me a new unit , stress test it , and send it to me . Then someone called and told me that it will take a week to get a suitable unit . I am still waiting - a week after the second unit died.I had a very similar experience with their FVS 318 in Feb 2003 - where it took 3 units to get one that worked . I gave Netgear a second chance then . At this point however , I will no longer use Netgear equipment . I am an installer and I just can not afford the labor associated with their faulty products.As I told Netgear people - Stop rushing product to market before it is ready . The recall expense will hurt badly ; the upset customers will go away . They did not heed my advice in Feburary and now , after I gave them an ample second chance , I do not intend to use Netgear routers again.I strongly recommend you do the same unless you like to replace and replace and replace hoping to get something that works.It is too bad for Netgear - but some people only learn the hard way . I guess they are one of them.I wrote the above on Oct 10 , 2003 . It is now Feb. 22 , 2004 . Netgear does not have a fix as of today for this problem . They issued me a less costly FVS 318 as an interim fix in late October 2003 with the intent to have the FVL 328 repaired and restored . To date , there is no fix and this has been confirmed by an e mail to me of a few weeks ago.I regret to take this harsh stance , I fully understand the technical problems in bringing a product to market and the unsuspected probems that can arise . However , the manufacturer is responsible for bringing a dependable product to market and this clearly did not happen in this case . For Netgear 's sake , I hope they have overhauled their product introduction procedures or they will not survive with new product launch . For those considering a gateway router , I continue to recommend they not buy this one .
 Very poor experience . The router worked well until the 30 day return period was over . I have been using three of them and they crash virtually every day . Do n't even consider using it anywhere where reliability is critical .
 15 users , this unit continously crashes and very poor performance . I 'm returning this unit as its not performing as advertised .
 `` High Speed '' ? Do n't think so . These units are easy to set up and install , and are feature-rich . They might work fine if you only have a few users -LRB- like under 10 -RRB- , but I experienced serious performance issues with only 25 users connected . They slow down seriously when you run a decent amount of traffic through them .
 I purchased this high speed router for a dedicated satellite internet connection . The unit provides one SSL outbound connection which is almost useless . The unit will not autosense the modem connection speed either 10 or 100 Mbps . The manufactures solution is to put an ethernet hub between the router and the ethernet modem . -LRB- what kind of a fix is that -RRB- Not what I would consider top of the line from Netgear . I would not recommend or sell one of these to any of my other customers .
 I 've owned a variety of NetGear units over the last five years , mostly stuff given to me , bought cheaply at sell-outs , and left over from dot-bomb company crashes.I keep using them because I have four of the same units I did n't pay for , and I only have three connections hooked to them . I gave up dealing w/their support years ago.Once or twice a year the unit and/or the power supply burns out , and I recycle the unit at a local company . When I run out of units or power supplies , I 'll be done with NetGear and will avoid them completely in the future.The Linksys router I have sitting next to it is four years old and still running without any downtime .
 2 batteriesSynergy Digital BP-308 Lithium-Ion Battery 900mAh - Equivalent to the Canon BP-308 - for use with Canon Optura 600 , IXY DVM5 , and MVX4i camcordersI purchased for my Canon video camera by Synergy failed to charge after one use.The rabbit that keeps on going came and went , then died in the bushes .
 This product was defective , missing the battery , and the replacement that I received was also missing a battery . The response I got from Amazon ` sCustomer Service Department was pretty much `` Tough '' . I returned both itemsat my own expense after being told I would be reimbursed for the UPS charge.Not only was I not reimbursed I did not even get a full refund on defective products . From where I stand if a product advertises a `` battery included `` and then when it is received it does not have a battery included it is defective and the fault of Amazon . Selling defective products is the fault of the seller as far as I am concerned and does nothing to encourage repeatbusiness . I know that as a first time customer my experience was a nightmareand I will not ever use your company again . I will also be sure as encourage anyone who wants to use Amazon to think long and hard about thepossible consequences . Also if I had know I would not be getting a fullrefund I would at least have kept one of the kits then I would have at least had a case for my daughter 's camera .
 The above item came up when I was ordering my HC96 Sony Camcorder suggesting this was the case for that camera , so I ordered it.When I received it I used it for my new camera on the initial trip . The second day the buckle broke and I almost lost my camera . After returning I find out this was the wrong case for my new camera . It now has been returned.I do n't understand why this was included with the camera online.I 'm disappointed , plus I could n't find a bag on you website that would work , so I ordered elsewhere.Ray
 The main reason I ordered this kit was for the battery . When I received it ... NO BATTERY included . I contacted Amazon and all they could do was give me a number for Sony customer service . Thanks Amazon !!!
 Bought the Camera , Charger and the kit as part of the deal . Every thing looks good except the missing NPF-50 Battery . Requested for a replacement.In the replacement kit also battery was missing . Returned both the items .59.99 for a Carry bag and 3 DVD sis not worth buying this item
 Main problem
 I was tempted to buy this product because of the reduced price , but was disappointed that the case barely holds the DVD recorder and little else . It is fine for carrying the recorder when out and about , but as far as carrying extra discs or charger , forget it .
 See the product features , say have a NP-FP50 in it . but I can not find it in the package when i got it today.Product FeaturesIncludes carrying case with built-in accessory pocket and 3-pack of Sony 8cm DVD-R mediaNP-FP50 InfoLithium P Series rechargeable battery pack provides long lasting powerThree DVD-R discs lets you begin recording immediatelyDesigned for DCR-DVD 203 , 403 , 105 , 205 , 305 , 405 and 505 camcorders
 The case is nice , but the plastic clasp broke on the original order as well as a replacement .
 If you bought a camera and you want somewhere to keep all your `` stuff '' - nothing outrageous but things like cords , a couple of CDs , maybe a wireless mic , this is NOT your bag . It will carry only your camera . No extra stuff . Buy this to carry your `` stuff '' and you will still be relegated to carrying the rest of your items around in a plastic grocery sack .
 Worst of the worst . Looks awfull , adds bulk and scartches your ipod by allowing dust to get IN THE CASE . Do n't waste your money .
 Rated at 1000mAh , just like the original Panasonic battery for my TZ5 . Only had 1/2 the life at first . A little over a year later , it only lasted for 4-8 picture and 3-5 minutes ' worth of video . After a year and a half , this battery is dead . Not even recommended as a backup . Spend the extra few dollars and get one with a better user rating , more mAh , or better yet , just get the Panasonic . * Update
 Purchased the battery in February 2008 . Worked fine size and power wise with my OEM charger and TZ3 camera though it seemed to last a few shots less than the original Panasonic battery -LRB- CGA-S007A -RRB- . However , starting a few weeks ago , the battery refused to charge the full time and dies extremely quickly when placed in my camera . It 's been less than 1.5 years . The battery has a 3 year warranty on it but Lenmar charges $ 7.50 shipping and handling for warranty returns over 90 days.Cheap price but not a recommended purchase .
 The battery I was sent did not work in my Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ3K digital camera .
 The Battery I received was for a completely different camera . Although the company eventually gave me my credit and sent a mailer for the wrong battery nobody contacted me with the correct battery for my camera .
 It 's ok but last only a few hours , at least with my TZ3 . I 'd buy the Panasonic one . I know for next time .
 Purchased 2 Lenmar DLP007 batteries to be used with Panasonic TZ3 digital camera.One battery was dead after 1 charge cycle . Lenmar did replaced that.Then during the past year , I continued to use Panasonic original battery and the 2 Lenmar batteries on regular rotation . Now , Panasonic battery still allows me to take 100 + photos easily . One Lenmar battery is now completely dead -LRB- can not be recharged -RRB- . The 2nd Lenmar battery holds only a fraction of the charge , maybe good for 30 photos.So you might be able to get 6 months to 1 year worth of useful life out of the batteries , and then they do not hold the charge any more . These batteries are around half the price of Panasonic original batteries , but the useful life is not half of Panasonic battery .
 I tested this item vs. the original Panasonic CGA-S007A battery , and the Lenmar performance was n't even close!After conditioning each battery , I counted how many flash pictures I could take -LRB- waiting 2 minutes between shots -RRB- before my camera indicated a low battery condition . As I will use my DMC-TZ3 camera 's flash in museums a lot , this is a fair approximation of real life -LRB- for me at least -RRB- . The Panasonic battery lasted for 87 shots , the Lenmar only 40 ! It certainly appears that the Panasonic , even at twice the price , would be a better value for the dollar . After more research , I lucked out and found the Panasonic battery for only $ 5 more than the Lenmar.If the purchase price is the only factor , perhaps this is an OK value . My camera does work fine with the Lenmar battery-just not as long . At a low enough price point , this may be a pretty decent spare battery -LRB- if you do n't plan to use it except in `` emergencies '' -RRB- . As a primary , everyday battery , I do n't recommend it . Use the Panasonic battery and get the intended performance out of your expensive camera .
 this is a product that holds true to the statement '' you get what you pay for '' it does n't come close to the performance on the factory battery . it is good only as a back up , but not as the primary battery . if you want the performance equal to a factory unit buy a factory unit . if your primary runs out and you only need a few more pictures this is fine .
 Bought 2 of these fron ADORAMA and I am not happy . I get about 50 shots w / my Panasonic TZ5 camera and the battery is DEAD . My OE battery is good for 300-400 shots .
 I did n't notice until we went on vacation what a difference there is between this battery and the real Panasonic battery ! This battery can not last for a normal vacation day of pictures ! Fortunately , I brought the Panasonic battery along on that first day out and could go back to the car and change batteries ! From then on I made sure to only use this battery at night while I was charging up the Panasonic battery for the next days shooting!Don ' t depend on this battery ! It will let you down !
 Now I know why there 's a difference in the price . This battery does n't last for more than a few hours , no flash and using normally . Could be a back up of the back up while you charge any of the good ones . My advise ; get the Panasonic one .
 I bought this battery for my new camera Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ3K . I charged it several times , but there was no voltage at all.I also notices that when it was charging , the light on the charger was flashing , this usually indicates the battery/charger connector is dirty or defective . I was sure the charger was ok since I had no problem to charge the original battery that came with the camera . So I used a dry cloth to clean the new battery connector and charged it again , the light was still flashing . But I went ahead to charge it overnight anyway , but it still did not work , I had to return the battery .
 I have four of these I purchased as backup batteries for my Panasonic Lumix TZ4 & TZ5 . I 'm an property/casualty insurance adjuster . I take hundreds of photos a day when in the field . When I first bought the batteries -LRB- approximately 1.5 yrs ago -RRB- , they worked nearly as well as the original Panasonic batteries -LRB- 200 to 300 photos at 640 res -RRB- . However now they are good for 40 photos or less after a `` full '' charge . The original batteries are still performing like `` new '' . I rotate all the batteries , including both the Lenmar and Panasonic , so they have all had approximately the same use and charge cycle . I 've recently purchased two CTA & two Kinamax replacement batteries and will see how they perform .
 Received a Lenmar branded battery as advertised . Works fine in my Lumix DMC-TZ5 , but definitely does not last as long as the OEM Panasonic battery , maybe 1/2 to 1/3 of the life of the Panasonic battery . For the price , its a good emergency backup but would n't use it as a replacement of the OEM battery .
 I read all the reviews of this battery and there seemed to be a distinct difference of opinions . Most people seemed to think it worked as well as the Panasonic battery that came with their camera and others disagreed . I hoped those who said it was equivalent were correct , but my own experience is that it just does n't last like the original . So I have to join with those who got less than equal effectiveness .
 Upon recieving this Lenmar battery , I inserted it into the Panasonic DMC-TZ3 charger and it readily charged with no problem . -LRB- Some reviews I read indicated a problem with this Lenmar battery fitting into the charger which I did not encounter . -RRB- I then put it in the camera and it has functioned as well as the original equipment . I have not used the camera enough to determine if there is any significant difference in usage time between it and the original Panasonic battery , but it is certainly a bargain price.UPDATE
 THIS BATTERY IS GOOD FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 SHOTS BEFORE IT MUST BE RECHARGED , WHILE THE ORIGINAL PANASONIC BATTERY IS GOOD FOR 100 TO 200 SHOTS AND VIDEOS BEFORE NEEDING A RECHARGE .
 I bought this mouse , and was able to configure it to my PC ... up to a point . Many of the special functions of the mouse I could not figure out . In addition , the basic mouse function sometimes worked ... other times did not . The `` instruction manual '' that came with the product was horrible . And `` customer service '' at the manufacture ? Also horrible . I called them and the phone rang off the hook . Sent them an email and they replied three days later by email indicating that I should call them , but at that time , I did not have the device with me at the office so that I could review with them step by step how to get the device to work . So I would have had to bring the device back into the office the next day and spend time during my workday trying to call them . -LRB- Naturally , their `` customer service '' hours were only M-F , 9-5 or something like that . -RRB- I felt that the company just did n't `` care '' .
 I had both the whole unit stop working and the strange wireless connection freezes . I have this gateway and the solution to the dropped connections and lock ups was to put a very small fan blowing on the router . It 's possible that it 's an overheating problem , even when the room is relatively cool . I read about the possible overheating problem somewhere , and my connection has been completely solid 24/7 for several months since I put the fan on it . Before that , it was dropping the connection daily and required pulling the power plug to reset the connection.This product was given to me by Comcast when I ordered the Home Networking option.The connection IS much better now with this modem than it was before with my own store-bought cable modem , but that is not saying much.In summary
 This cable modem and wireless functions of this device seemed to be operational , but any time I tried to have two computers hooked up simultaneously , both computers would lose their connection with the gateway . This was indeed frustrating , but technical support failed to resolve the problem after a month of exasperating phone calls and one product exchange . I was twice promised a return call within 24 hours , and twice unapologetically snubbed.I have been extremely disappointed and discouraged with this experience , and I am not inclined to ever purchase another Netgear product . I have returned this product and decided to go with Linksys after a recommendation from my systems administrator .
 I have had this router/gateway for the past year.Since then , it has basically stopped working for any kind of long transfer between two wireless devices -LRB- i.e. more than 50Mb sustained . -RRB- The router will completely crash ; while the lights still flash , 802.11 b and 10Base-T connections do not transit data.I called their customer support line and was treated extremely rudely . They basically said it was my problem and too bad.I will never buy another Netgear product again . A shame , as they used to have much better hardware and support -LRB- then again , this was back in 1999 ... -RRB-
 I 've had this product for a little over a year now , and I 'm about to toss it and move a to a Linksys.Over the life of the unit it has had occasional Internet drop outs that would require the unit to be powered off and on to recover . This happened infrequent enough to be a small nuisance that did n't rise to the level of replacement.Unfortunately recently the wireless of router has been dropping and then last week completely failed . Of course being out of warrantee , no support is offered.My guess as to the failure is that the unit simply runs too hot . Not enough engineering and too much in too little of a package . You could use it as coffee warmer.The reviews on the Linksys WCG200 look good and I 'm braving the Comcast tech support tonight .
 My 3 star rating is based on my rating of this unit 's features and Netgear support - I still do not have it working yet . -LRB- I have made 6 calls to Comcast support , but the connection from the modem is still being refused by Comcast . -RRB- I called Netgear support to see if they could shed any light , and after waiting 45 minutes , was answered by a call center in India by a technician that I could not understand . An e-mail supprt request remains unanswered after 2 days .
 This is a great product ! ... -LRB- if the computer your sending the wireless signal to is 5 feet away -RRB- I got this product back in 2005 , because i have my internet connection -LRB- high speed cable -RRB- connected to the upstars of my home , and i needed a connection to the downstairs , and was n't going to pay an extra 50 $ a month to wire it , so i got this router and a iwreless adapter for the downstairs computer hooked it up , easy , and simple , established a connection easily , but after a few minutes the connection began to die down to 2 bars ... then one ... -LRB- out of 5 bars -RRB- then two . . then one ... then it went out , i right clicked the wireless connection icon in my system tray , hit repair connection and it worked ! ... then it proceeded to degress to one bar ... then go out again . In other words if you dont mind right clicking the connection icon and repairing it -LRB- which includes waiting about a minute for it to reconnect -RRB- every five minutes then go ahead , but ive been dealing with this for almost two years now , and im finding something else DO NOT BUY BUY SOMETHING STRONGER
 I have the same problem as several other reviewers . The box repeatedly drops the wireless connection and has to be rebooted . I 'm actually on my third one , the first two having been replaced by Netgear after the same problem . Reviewers who love it tend to be those who just set it up . Setup was easy and the unit worked beautifully in the beginning but as another reviewer said , it seems to run too hot and just wears itself out . The drops initially only happened every few days , now a few times a day and any time I attempt to move a large amount of data . Alas , will have to replace the unit again .
 This product really sticks . I bought a couple days ago and then had to return it . I could n't even set up the VNP because there was no proper documentation . I call Netgear and their support was no help at all . The router could n't work wirelessly and wired simultaneously for the same machine ... without reset the router ... What I am trying to say is if you connected wirelessly to the router and then disconnected that wireless connection and then plugged into the router with your wired LAN cable ... you would not have a connection . Unless you went into the the router wirelessly and resetted it manaully . The latest firmware upgrade they have for the router is a beta v1 .2 - And if you have a a problem with beta versions of their firmware you can not call them -LRB- Netgear -RRB- ... . you have to email ... . beta@netgear.com or something like that . It does have alot of cool features but there are too many glitches . Hope this review helps .
 I 've had a variety of netgear products over the last 3-4 years . I 've generally been pleased w/features and functionality.Up until recently I 've never had to draw on netgear tech support . However , after a year of working fine one of my firewall/routers went `` kerplunk . '' All the signs point to a hardware problem . So I contacted tech support realizing that I 'd have to go through the usual rigamorole -LRB- sp ? -RRB- to get an RMA.However , despite a very detailed email description of the problems and the various things I did to try and fix them -LRB- firmware upgrades/reinstalls , hardware resets , etc -RRB- the tech who answered me told me I 'd have to contact them through telephone support.Currently -LRB- 11:10 PM Eastern Time , 29 July 2003 -RRB- wait times for tech support are in excess of 140 minutes ! That 's unacceptable.If you are lucky enough to never need tech support , or to have an item repaired/replaced then netgear is a fine option . Otherwise , buyer beware !
 I bought this to upgrade my HD to a size 750GB . It did not work , the software came with it was very old and gave me a message something like `` different partition size between the 2 drives , not supported '' I went online and download Acronis Migrate Easy 7.0 . It 's free for 15 days . It also gave me an error message saying there are bad partition in my computer 's HD and I need to fix those first . I ran the disc error check but everything was fine . Took me whole day nothing worked.I ended up went to best buy and bought a USB 3.0 case `` Rocketfish '' and use the Acronis Migrate Easy 7.0 free demo to clone the HD . Everything was done within 2 hours . So If you are buying a bigger HD , I say do n't buy this . I think the problem is there is no power cord , it does n't support the bigger HD . The Rocketfish I bought has 2 USB connector and I connect both , the computer saw the disc right away .
 The product did n't work on my windows vista . After folowing the simple directions and watching different videos on how to use it on youtube , I gave it a try , only to have a window pop up saying -LRB- that blocks of differents sizes can not be cloned ? -RRB- So I emailed the company and they said it would not clone my hard drive but gave me a couple of things to try to get it to work . Anyway to make a long story shorter , I paid a company 65 dollars to clone my hard drive and this products is neatly tucked away in the bottom of one of my junk bins . If it would have worked on my computer it would have been sweet . If it works on yours you will like it . No one bothered to explain what a block is to me , sooo you can take your chances .
 I could n't use the software at all . I emailed the company and never heard from them . So I had to just install my new hard drive and use my restore disks . I do n't any of my programs that I got from Giveaway of the Day among others . They are still setting on the old hard drive though . I do n't know if I can get those back or not without buying more software and getting the operating system too . The product claims that it 's so ease but it 's anything but that . The product created more problems . The only good thing about the product is that now I have a nice protective case to store my old hard drive .
 I have attempted to clone hard drives two different times
 The software did not follow the sequence expected and was not able to clone the 100GB hard drive on my Thinkpad to a new 500GB drive .
 When I first got this I tried to use it with the quick instructions on the package . Big mistake . I wasted hours this way . Only after I downloaded the detailed instructions from their website was I able to get it to work properly .
 I have hooked this unit up to 4 different computers , using three different operating systems , even trying two different hard drives , one brand new -LRB- on which I have since completed a manual installation of all files and am now using -RRB- and the hard drive I wanted to copy . Not a single computer even recognized the unit was hooked up to it . Do n't waste your money !!!!!! Further review , have tried it on 5 computers now with the same result . I also purchased the optional power supply unit because the manual says the USB port might not have enough power . Still does n't work , do n't waste your money ... Even further review , Now they are trying to double bill me . I purchased this through Amazon and now they just sent me a separate bill in the mail ... . This company has no integrity , DO NOT BUY FROM THEM !!!! I will be contacting Amazon to report them !!!!! I will also be returning their product !!!!!
 I ordered this item , as it was recommended to me by the website as an item purchased by people who also purchased the disk drive I ordered , a CMS Peripheral 80GB HARD DRIVE FOR DELL -LRB- DELL2600-80 .0 -RRB- . After opening the package , I found I could not use it with my type of disk drive I ordered . Those who purchased this item , when purchasing the disk drive I ordered , are out of luck .
 EZ GIG II would not load up . Will never buy this brand software again . Very disappointed that you pay for something and expect it to work it does n't . Tried contacting support , with no success . So this will be a never recommend them to anyone . PRODUCT SUCKED
 I 've been working with computers for over 20 years and this is one of the worst products I 've come across.When I first got this device , my intention was to help me replace a hard drive in a laptop . I followed their instructions , booting from the CD , and within 5 minutes , my existing hard drive was no longer bootable ; dead in the water.Several calls to their Tech Support went unanswered -LRB- left messages , no returned calls -RRB- . It was a Friday afternoon -LRB- yeah I know , never do this stuff on a Friday afternoon ... -RRB- . At 4PM -LRB- Pacific -RRB- I called and got a recording telling me that they were closed and that the hours were from 8 - 5 ! -LRB- I guess they ca n't tell time either ... -RRB- So much for getting any Support.I had to spend the better part of Saturday doing a fresh Windows Vista install on my new hard drive and reinstalling all of my applications . Fortunately I was able to copy data from the old hard drive - only the master boot record was destroyed , none of the data.Monday I get a call back and was told that it is absolutely impossible for their software to ` trash ' my hard drive . Okay , you 're right , I did it myself - just so I could spend an entire day reinstalling a computer and so I could complain about their product ... Yep , so much for Tech Support . Oh , did you know that their product does not work on dynamic drives - was that anywhere in their ads , system specifications , software cautions?After getting the machine back to a running state , I thought I 'd keep it and use it as a spare drive . However , it goes off-line `` whenever it feels like it '' and maybe you are in the middle of saving something , maybe you are not . When it is working , it appears to be a good product - but there is no guarantee that it will be working when you want it to be working.If I were you , I 'd spend your money elsewhere .
 The 160GB 5400 RPM 2.5 SATA HD from Toshiba does not fit or align with this device . And I ca n't return it ... I will remember to read the fine print in the future . On the other hand , a disk migration maybe something people do once ... and then return the device , so this non-return policy has some merit .
 The kit came in one of those treacherous plastic molded shells designed to hang on a store display . It took almost 10 minutes and several bloody fingers to access the contents . Of course the picture on the Amazon website does not show this egregious over-packaging .
 I am just getting started . Took me several minute just to open the package . This is one of those welded clear plastic packages . Just cutting one or two sides of the package is not enough . With it 's 3d standing plastic shape it is even harder than a normal welded plastic packaging . At least for web / mail orders , it would be desirable to minimize the packing , reduce waste , save blood , and save time . Now to actually try the product .
 Amazon wo n't take back the item , even if it is UNOPENED . Even if I pay for return shipment . What a second rate retailer ...
 To post this review Amazon requires at least 1 star but it does not deserve even the 1 star . Whatever you do , DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT . The `` clone '' does not start Windows OS when `` cloning '' to a larger disk ! And , as for their so-called tech support it is a joke . After eight days , sixteen disk swaps , and a bunch of make believe tech assists , three days waiting for an `` upgraded software '' disk that '' ... will fix the problem ... '' , 10 attempts to clone a 40 GB to a 120GB I yanked it out and am returning to Amazon -- have since copied all from backup external drive , after installing the OS from a CD and downloading all updates . Along the way Apricorn self-IDed National Sales Manager tells me '' ... do not bother ... '' the tech support person -LRB- only one on hand -RRB- , one week and one day after this so called Apricorn cloning project was started . While the Tech guy states that he has '' ... no more time ... '' as he has '' ... more than 20 others waiting for support ... '' Though they say they will return your call , at no time did anyone at Apricorn return a call ; come lunch or break the Tech guy cuts-off all calls and your more than one hour hold is gone to start all over whenever he decides to come to work , which on Monday was over one hour and ten minutes after their alleged start time ! The only good experience was dealing with Amazon .
 I ordered this and was excited to be getting a larger hard drive . The process went smoothly , then I put in the new drive and it said `` hard drive failure '' . What the heck ! I tried to run it again and guess what ? ... It does not even recognize it as a hard drive now.Called technical support and they gave me about 100 things to do to correct it . Took about 18 hours . You would think with Dell computers they might put a caveat on their product that it does n't work . Totally unprofessional !!
 If you have a Dell LapTop with Media Direct ; do your home work . This product may work fine on other systems and I bet it does - BUT Dell is a living H * LL as the MediaDirect software on the HD is not copyable and corrupts the copying process . They -LRB- Apricorn -RRB- will send a work around but I have not figured it out yet -LRB- You can not talk to anyone -RRB- . I have MediaDirect 2 on my HD . How do you know?Go to MyComputer - RightClick - Storeage - Disk Management . And as you look at the Hard drives you will see the partitions if you only see three - then you have MediaDirect 2 - meaning it is invisible . And then you should just forget it .
 If you read the reviews sorted by date you see a clear trend - THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS STOPPED WORKING!We used to use it to upgrade our Dell laptop hardrives , but about 6 months ago it stopped creating bootable drives . Much time on the phone has not solved the problem ... To bad - it used to be a neat thing .
 Apricorn Direct 5 GB USB 3.0 Notebook External Hard Drive Upgrade Kit EZ-UP3Don ' t bother ... . unless you 're willing to endure some frustration , then ultimately spend more money to get it to function.I received and returned this , the same day . It was obvious that it was n't compatible with my brand new hard drives.Here 's what they advertise : `` This innovative kit includes all the hardware and software needed to painlessly transfer all the data from an old hard drive to a new hard drive or SSD in three easy steps . `` Here is the truth : This will not function without an AC adapter when you 're using it on a modern -LRB- 7200 rpm -RRB- , or an SSD -LRB- OCZ Vertex 4 -RRB- drive.What will happen , is your new Apricorn enclosure will render Disk Management useless . It 's lack of power via USB will assure a conflict andWindows 8 will disable it in the Device Manager . Which means that the supplied software will search in vain for a drive that is not recognized byyour machine.I tried this with two new drives that I had purchased to upgrade my new laptop.First was a brand new WD Caviar Black 750 gig . It 's spindle speed is 7200 rpm . That was enough to render the Apricorn useless.Second was a brand new OCZ Vertex 4 , 256 gig SSD drive . This is a Solid State Drive and it too was not found by the Apricorn enclosure.Both of these drives caused this enclosure and it 's software to choke and Hang ... I threw in an old 5400 rpm HDD and it was finally found.After learning the possible cause , by searching the negative reviews of a different Apricorn model , I found the problem liesin the fact that the hardware needs AC help . The USB alone is n't sufficient to handle 7200 rpm or SSD -LRB- Vertex 4 in my case -RRB- drives.If the manufacturer should had stated that on the packaging and description -LRB- in BOLD letters -RRB- . knowing this now , I would not have bought it , but I might have considered buying it for older , slower drives . Her 's a little taste of some of the issues that I hoped were cured by this newer model . -LSB- ... -RSB- Being forced to buy an adapter to have it function as advertised , is unacceptable IMO.Buyer Beware ... . The software provided also recommends running the clone in a Windows environment . Do n't do it . Boot it up from the disk.Windows 8 is not going to get along with the recommended drive placements either . Just a warning , before you endure hours of frustration.Buyer beware , it 's not all there .
 I tried this product with three different SATA II drives , and none worked . I was able to get it to partially work by configuring one of the drives to run at a downgraded 1.5 Gb/s , but that only worked once.Don ' t buy this product if you are using a newer SATA II drive .
 I am writing this review for two reasons . The product did not work for me and I am very concerned about the high ratings I am seeing for this product here and elsewhere.I bought the kit to upgrade an 80GB laptop hard drive to a 500GB . The enclosure and cable are fine . The software however does not work . Put simply it will not copy the contents of your smaller hard drive to your larger hard drive because they are not the same size . Listen , I 'm just a simple caveman but I would say this is a pretty significant bug for software that it is supposed to copy the contents of your smaller hard drive to your larger hard drive.A closer look at the reviews here showed me I 'm not alone . I also see a good number of reviews that had similar issues , found workarounds and have in my opinion left undeservedly high ratings for the product . With all due respect you should not have to find a workaround to make a thing do the very thing it is supposed to do . I completely reject this idea of ` it works great after you ... ' so I 'm giving it five stars.Buy your enclosure and cable elsewhere and find reliable software . For what it 's worth I ended up using EaseUS Disk Copy Home Edition -LRB- free -RRB- and it worked perfectly .
 I tried it on my laptop first . It took a long time to create the image on the new HD from the old HD . After I replaced the new HD in to the laptop , it powered up but stopped on a blank screen with a blinking cursor . So I tried it on a desktop . The result was the same even though it was stuck on a different screen . I wasted a day and a half -LRB- about 20 hours -RRB- without getting anywhere . Returned it for refund . I think products like this have to rouburst , and easy to install . However when messing with the registry of the OS , it can get very tricky for different brand/type of computers .
 I but this apricorn cloning system and I clone a new hard drive I swappit and didnt work on loptop screen went blank . so it not good . I lone twice diferent hd drives and same thing happen ...
 My computer would not recognize this upgrade kit with my Western Digital 250 gig PATA notebook drive.It showed up on my doorstep on Friday night , but by the time I realized I could not make it work by following the instructions , the west coast tech support closed for the weekend . I was persistent and surfed the web to find some help , and I found some of the other reviewers had the same problem as me.Frustrated on Saturday morning , I ran to my local computer store -LRB- Kaplan -RRB- and bought ANOTHER hard drive upgrade kit , but a different brand for 40 more bucks . The second hard drive kit I bought had a power cord and a USB cord , and it worked ! -LRB- The apricorn unit only had a usb cable , but funny enough they list a power cable on their website as a recommended accessory -RRB- I would say buyer beware , unless you want to waste 40 bucks like me .
 If you had a rating of -100 it would be rated below that . The case is solid but has no on & off switch . The soft ware program is rip rip rip off . no customer service . Still have not heard back from them.I would not advise my worst enemy to buy this product . It was awast of time , money & efor . do not , do not buy this product .
 Ordered despite seeing reviews cautioning about poor documentation and situations where product does not work . Attempts to contact Apricorn via phone -LRB- 800 # on product for example -RRB- or email were waste of time.One review found via Google suggested a situation similar to my experience and possible solution/workaround . Can not find the article again . Have to wonder why Apricorn can not provide same info.The reviews noting poor support were correct .
 I bought this to upgrade the hard drive in a Lenovo T60 laptop . I followed the directions , installing the software to my hard drive , then running it . It required a reboot when I asked it to clone my hard drive and when I clicked reboot , it messed up my operating system , showed the Windows boot screen then went to a black screen . Luckily I had backed up my hard drive using the ThinkVantage Rescue & Recovery that came with the computer , so I restored the hard drive successfully . Tried again and the same thing . I finally got it to `` clone '' the hard drive by booting and running the EZ-Gig program from the CD , but when I installed the `` cloned '' disk into my computer , it had numerous problems . It booted , but the drivers were all messed up and nothing worked right . I ended up using the ThinkVantage R&R to restore the new drive to match the original , but the only problem with that was that the partition sizes were n't right , so I downloaded the free program EASUS Partition Master and resized and moved the partitions and then it worked . I would have returned this package , but I did n't because the hard drive enclosure that came with it is very nice , and since I got a rebate the price was worth it just for the enclosure . That 's the only reason I gave it two stars . I ca n't recommend the EZ-Gig software at all .
 I used this software to clone a Windows 7 Premium 64bit OS on a perfectly working drive with no errors onto a brand new Western Digital drive . The instructions do not mention Microsoft OS compatibility so I assumed it would work with the latest OS . There are two ways to clone a drive using the software - neither of which are easy - and I am an advanced computer user and former database administrator . The software failed to work at all inside the Windows environment so I tried cloning by booting the laptop to the system on CD . The software failed to load once and then ran successfully . The configuration options given are to mirror the drive , make the new drive partitions proportional or to set the partition sizes manually . None of these options are clearly explained and the choice is definitely not something a layman would understand even after reading the documentation . The cloning seemed to be successful until I booted with the new drive . Windows update and Windows defender no longer work at all on the OS and the troubleshooting steps suggested by Apricorn support as well as dozens of uninstalls and reinstalls and registry clean operations suggested by Microsoft forums have all failed to solve the problem . These two system software pieces are completely unusable and it must be a systematic error in the drive mirroring process and Microsoft 's OS . There is no way this problem is unique to my bland Windows 7 installation . This serious glitch or design problem is not being addressed by the company and the Apricorn website has pitiful support consisting of 5 inane FAQ questions and answers.I have to conclude that this software will conflict with a Windows 7 64bit log of some type and fail to copy your drive successfully .
 I bought this product to assisst in upgrading my HP laptop hard drive . I was able to clone my old drive , but when I replaced the old drive with the new , the laptop would n't boot . Upon further investigation -LRB- and help from an engineer friend -RRB- , I have learned that HP has a hidden system partition , and the cloning software was unable to access these tiles . So I 'm stuck until I can get expert help , and even then , it may not work . Bottom line is it 's not so EZ after all .
 Apricorn EZ-UP-UNIVERSAL EZ Upgrade Universal Notebook Hard Drive Upgrade Kit initially seemed to work flawlessly upgrading my Dell Inspiron 9400 's HD to a newHitachi Travelstar 2.5 Inch 500 GB 7200R PM SATA II 16 MB Cache Internal Hard Drive 0S00157 ; however , if you have Windows 7 Ultimate as your operating system , Windows 7 's default cluster size for NTSF file system should be 4 KB for a HD as big as this one . Apricorn EZ-UP-UNIVERSAL EZ Upgrade Universal Notebook Hard Drive Upgrade Kit unfortunately formats all partitions with a cluster size of only 512 BYTES ! A cluster size this small slows PC performance to a crawl . Every file is essentially split into tiny 512 BYTE segments which can become fragmented all over the large 500 GB drive . I have n't found a way for Apricorn software to force a 4 KB cluster size . And 3rd party solutions ca n't reformat without destroying all my data . I 'm a slave to this pitiful 512 BYTE cluster size . And a PC that runs slower than my Packard Bell 60 Mhz desktop PC I purchased in 1993 .
 I have an IBM Thinkpad T40 , current disk sapce is C Drive 10 , D
 Load the software and it simply gives and error when I try to duplicate my drives that the sizes do not match . I write software and this is just wrong . The software should not throw an error , but rather fix the problem for me automatically . It should adjust the cluster sizes -LRB- or whatever -RRB- so that it can copy or it should figure out another way to copy the data . It has made both my upgrade drive and this software useless . The only good thing about this product is the USB casing that comes with the software and that 's why I am not giving it a one.Just a warning that it probably wo n't work for you if you are upgrading to a different drive . In my case I was upgrading from a 500GB to 750GB drive .
 I am sick and tired of buying junk that does not work as advertised . I have a Lenovo T500 and evidentlly the software is not compatible with Lenovo Models . I want to upgrade my 320gig 7200 sata drive to a WD 750gig 7200 and the software comes back saying that `` Copying between drives with different block sizes is not supported '' . A visit to the website where an apparently bored customer service tech told me that I had to make several bios changes and remove my original drive and swap it for the new drive and run the copy backwards . That `` should '' work . I bought this product as it was `` EZ '' . THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK AS ADVERTISED .
 When I received this unit I went over the installation guide and ran the BOOT Disk as stated for Windows 7 64bit and the software crashed everytime . I installed the software as stated not to to try and see if it would work , NO LUCK . The HDD cabinet and USB cord were good quality and I just ended up using them for my old HDD after I took it out of my Laptop as an external drive for backing up my computer .
 The package as it comes , without a Y-cable or an AC adapter , is seriously underpowered . According to their technical support it is underpowered for 7200 RPM drives , but nowhere do they warn you of this before you buy . It took me a month of weekend attempts to migrate off an older HDD before I figured out the problem and used a Y-cable I had from another USB device.It also overheats with a large-capacity , fast drive . I had to open the case and leave the drive exposed.Their software is barely capable , and could n't clone to a larger drive using either the option to manually resize the partitions , or to automatically resize proportionally . In both cases I was left with an unbootable drive . I was only able to clone to a drive that was the same size.ThinkPad users should be aware that you ca n't clone to an external drive . You must put the new drive in the ThinkPad , and your old drive in the enclosure , plus turn off some ThinkPad security features before you can clone the drive.Overall a clunky process with a mediocre product and lousy software . Shop elsewhere .
 This product makes a copy of the new disk from old disk . But it is not bootable using the EZ GIG 2 software . I have Dell Media Experiance but not Dell Media direct . After trying for two weeks and researching I got hold of tech support , really . Waited on hold for 45 min . After talking with them . I was told it does not work for the dell 700/710m laptops . So now instead of using my new 120GB drive to replace my 80 GB drive . I have another 120GB external drive . But it does have all my files and programs.Sadly it was a waste of money .
 I used this kit + their EZ Gig 8.1.9 software in the past -LRB- 2006 -RRB- to clone the PATA drive in an older Toshiba Satellite laptop . Back then , it worked great and their customer support was responsive and helpful . There was only one minor hiccup
 I got this kit today and tried to clone from an old 250 GB HDD to a new 500 GB . Firt followed their 1-2-3 procedure , ran app from Windows Vista , put new HDD as destination in the enclosure and copy from the HDD in the laptop . After finishing cloning -LRB- about 120 min to clone sector-by-sector -RRB- , swapped the HDDs , it showed the boot manager error.Then I reversed the HDD copying , booted up from Apricom CD , source in the USB drive and the destination new HDD in the laptop , this time veryfying feature was turned on , but the same error message in the booting step , totally waisted me 3 hours.Good thing that I have Acronis TrueImage Home 2011 come to resue . the Acronis CD booted the laptop and cloned the HDD for about 100 minutes , Then the new drive in the laptop booted up nicely.The enclosure is very solid , two stars.The software is totally waste of my time .
 I 've read reviews that really made this sound easy , but ... If you have any difficulty at all , forget about talking to tech support . You will not talk to anyone on the phone , even after waiting two hours in the phone que . Email support only , which means it may take a week or more to have a meaningful conversation with tech support.If you have any trouble you are basically on your own.The hardware looks to be good quality as does the software , but for some reason the software refused to complete the clone . It would stop at around 90 % copied and refuse to go any further . I tried all the clone routines on the Apricorn FAQs and the common solutions on their support phone tree to no avail . I ran diagnostics on the new drive and everything looked fine , tried to clone again with no success.My advice

 I spent most of a day trying to get the EZ Upgrade package to work on my Acer Aspire 5920g laptop . After 4 calls to the support line , creating a new DVD boot disk from an ISO image the Support team sent me of the newest software version , swapping current and new Harddrives between the laptop and the EZ external drive enclosure several times , and running chkdsk and defrag on my current drive to confirm it did not have any bad sectors , it was finally determined that the external harddrive enclosure I received in the EZ Upgrade package was defective . Support has sent me an RMA number and I 'm sending back the enclosure for replacement . I 'll update this review if a new enclosure solves the problem.The product looks sophisticated and well thought-out . Maybe I just got the rare lemon .
 While this concept is good , it is not anything like 1-2-3 . My laptop could not find my hard drive once installed into the enclosure . I attached it to my desktop , it could not find the hard drive in the enclosure . You ca n't clone your hard drive if it can not be recognized . I emailed a request for help on Friday the 8th , todayMonday the 11th I received a email that asked me to look for the disk in disk management , not there . Then asked me what product I bought , and finally is it PATA or SATA . Here is my suggestion . 1 . purchase a cheap enclosure 2 . install your new hard drive . 3 . download EASEUS todo B/U for free , clone your drive , install the new one , and save yourself around $ 40.00 plus the time and trouble .
 This has to be one of the worst external modems ever made for the Mac . It is , however , still an improvement over Apple 's own internal modem , in that , once the Best modem manages to negotiate a connection , it stays connected . But getting that initial connection with the Best modem is often difficult , and dealing with the necessary workarounds can quickly tire one 's patience . After having consistent difficulties with this modem when I first bought it , I tried to contact Best Support , but I never received a reply . So , I returned it to Amazon.com for an exchange . After receiving the second Best modem , I had exactly the same problems , so I concluded that the defects I was experiencing were probably generic to the model . The basic issue seems to be that the modem often fails to initialize properly . To reset it requires that you unplug the USB cable and re-plug it , sometimes over and over , until the device finally responds . The modem has the same difficulty in both OS 9 and OS X ; the only difference I 've noted is that , in OS X , it can take up to 15 seconds after issuing the Connect command for the modem to actually start dialing . I 've had to unplug and re-plug the USB cable as many as a half dozen times sometimes to get the device to work . So why do I put up with it ? Because , as I mentioned at the beginning , once this modem makes a connection , it stays connected , which Apple 's own internal modem typically failed to do . In that sense , the Best modem is just marginally more tolerable . It 's just a shame that this Best modem appears to be the only external modem that 's now made for the Mac . Caveat emptor !
 As other reveiwers noted this modem can not stay connected . You can reestablish connection by unplugging and plugging the USB but this is a pain . Instructions that come with modem are incomplete and do not give information about lights . Also Best Data tech support does not respond . There are bound to be better choices .
 I bought a best Data USB modem listed as suitable for Mac and WIndows since I use both . The Windows software was not accepted by this OS and when I proceeded anyway the modem would not run . The instructions said to consult the web site for Mac drivers . After going thru the various layers I found the site has NO OS X drivers.I gave it one star because that is the minimum . To be fair I do n't know how it works since I could not make it work.I bought another USB modem and it installed and runs ; so I do know how to install this stuff.So what you have here is a WIndows Mac device that can not install on Windows XP or Mac OS 10 . Not needing another paperweight , I returned mine .
 I purchased this device at my local Frys on an employee recommendation and also based on details on the box . I could not get my g4 1.25 dual to see the modem in spite of everything I tried . The tech support would not respond , the website has no mac drivers , my mac wouldnt recognize it as a USB device and the included instructions and the CD have no drivers or details that would be helpful . After a frustrating few weeks I gave up and returned this . The only thing it did properly was power on when connected to a usb port . Pathetic .
 We purchased one of these to use at work as a fax modem.The drivers are poorly written , and often fail to initialize . When they do initialize the driver often crash , and it requires a full cold reboot to get the modem working again.Best data -LRB- as noted by other reviewers -RRB- refuses to provide any tech support . I suspect this is because they know their products are defective.After I hit save , I 'm dropping this modem in the trash .
 It 's been about 10 years since I bothered with a portable CD player , so I looked for one with a good combination of sound quality , battery life , playback features , and durability . I based my choice of this player in part on good experience with other Philips products , and in part on others ' ratings of the product . -LRB- Having that Amazon promotional gift certificate helped too ... -RRB- When I received the player , I was indeed pleased with the sound quality and the playback features . The included headphones had a tinny quality , but I intended to use this through my home stereo quite a bit , and it did well for that . And in any case I had another set of headphones I preferred to use , and it sounded great with those.The various playback modes -LRB- shuffle , repeat , program , scan -RRB- leave nothing wanting . The included rechargeable battery lasted at least 18 hours between charges , very impressive . I tried high-capacity AAs once and got probably 40 hours of playback out of them -LRB- using the included battery box that doubles the player 's battery capacity from 2 AA to 4 AA -RRB- . This was the first CD player I 've used with anti-skip protection , and that was a pleasant surprise . I never did manage to make a CD skip , in any playback mode . It worked fine through walking , running , cycling , mowing lawns , driving , all of it -- no skips , no pauses of any kind . And it worked with heavily scratched CDs , or CDs that would result in skips on my car stereo CD player or my home player.The downside ? This unit is not very durable . It looks good , feels like it can survive just about anything . But the lid is held in place but two small plastic nubs that , if broken , render the thing useless . Just under one month after I received it , the lid snapped clean off when I was changing CDs.This is a good unit , but if durability is of any concern at all , think carefully before you choose this player . By all means be extremely careful when you open the device .
 I rated these 1 star because they did not satisfy the reason I purchased them ... primarily to cancel out engine noise while flying . While they do give you decent sound from your music device , the open-ear design pretty much negates the noise canceling function . I have owned noise-canceling headphones before , Sony . These were closed ear design and did a much better job of canceling engine drone and other low frequencies , tho I had the same annoying problem with crackling and popping when I moved that everyone else seems to have experienced . Bottomline , do not purchase these if your goal is to reduce air travel noise .
 The only reason for my purchase of the Sennheiser PXC 300 Noise Cancelling Headphones was to cancel noise not listen to music , etc. . The person that I purchased them for is writing a technical book and relative silence is an important part of the writing process . Unfortunately , the normal surrounding noise was not canceled and , therefore , it was necessary to return the headphones . Please note , the other features of the headphones appeared to be fine . As of 15 August I have not heard anything about a refund , but am confident that will be properly handled by Amazon . I have made several purchases from Amazon and until this one have always been very satisfied with them . I look forward to a continuing relationship .
 I have tried a number of different solutions for on-train listening to my iPod , and most recently tried these headphones . At first I was happy with them , but with additional use two things became clear
 I bought this with trhe impression that it will cancel out work conversation . I am still able to hear the work conversation without any noise being cancelled out even though I have noise cancellation on . The people at work just go on talking as if there is no tomorrow . But this item is no good .
 I read a lot of reviews before making this purchase . I 'm not an audiophile or a technical expert on this item but I have good hearing , I know what I like and I 'm totally satisfied with these noise cancelling headphones . They 're easy to use , fold up neatly for travel and the noise cancellation is amazing.The active electronics are in a separate unit which also holds the batteries . This tends to mean the wires can get a little tangled but this is not a serious drawback . This is an excellent product . If I were to lose this headset , I 'd buy the same model as a replacement .
 I purchased these headphones as a replacement for my Etymotic ER4 earbuds , which were a replacement for my Sony MDR-NC10 earbuds . Unfortunately , I found them much less comfortable than either the Etymotic or the Sony earbuds and no better at noise canceling.I have used headphones two hours every day for the past twelve years during my train commute . I have been through a long succession of iPods and portable FM radios . I have had a lot of time -LRB- too much really -RRB- to develop an opinion . I am sticking with the Etymotic earbuds.BTW , the Sony earbuds were great , but if you lose one of the rubber earpieces -LRB- like I did - twice -RRB- Sony dings you for about $ 40 for a replacement .
 I 'm not sure how long the other reviewers have had their headphones , but I 've had mine for about two years now so I feel qualified to comment on a few things that may be missed by users who have only had their headsets for a few months and/or use them infrequently.First of all , the pros : Let me start by saying I 've had a few different noise cancelling headphones , and my expectations for performance were reasonable . Noise cancelling headphones do not create a Cone of Silence , but they do help and mainly make music sound better by reducing outside noise interference . - The headphones are fairly light and comfortable . - Sound quality is excellent with the unit turned on . It sounds like it 's run through an equalizer , bass is enhanced quite a bit.And now the cons : - The earpiece covers have both worn and ripped off , so now the earpieces are just hard plastic . If I were going to keep these I would try to put some new covers on . The existing ones are attached so the half that did n't rip off is still attached to the earpieces . - The cord is horribly short . It may work fine if you 're listening to something sitting in your lap or attached to your belt . But if you use it at your desk plugged into your computer , there are two problems . 1 -RRB- The cord from the plug to the unit is too short to keep the unit on your person , so you have to set it on the desk . 2 -RRB- The cord from the unit to the headphones is so short that every time you move a little bit too far it pulls the unit off the desk , sometimes pulling the plug out of the computer . - The battery hatch is very flimsy , after falling off the desk once or twice -LRB- see above -RRB- it wo n't stay latched shut any more . So every time it gets pulled off the desk the door opens and the batteries fall out . For now I 've taped it shut with scotch tape and it stays shut . - There is no auto shutoff , so if you leave it turned on you just killed your batteries . - When the batteries are dead , the sound quality is TERRIBLE . So you do n't just lose the `` ok '' noise cancelling , you completely lose the sound quality as well . It 's like listening to a little pocket AM radio.So , there you have it . The unit is sitting next to me , taped shut , and the bare plastic earpieces are on my ears right now so it 's still ticking but it will be replaced with something else soon .
 This is my third pair of noise-reducing headphones , as I owned and still have one of the original `` Noisebusters '' from like 15 years ago !! I paid extra for the PXC-300 over their less expensive models expecting superior performance in all areas . I am particularly pleased with how portable the phones are -- they provide a web page to show you how to fold them , but it seemed simple after just a time or two . And the hard shelled case is very nice but still compact enough for easy travel . The wires tend to get tangled in the case -- a better way to handle those would be an improvement . The separate battery holder , with its own belt clip , has proved not as much hassle as some fear , but another 12 '' of wire from it to the phones would have been perfect . This is an `` on-ear '' set , but I found the fit to be not tiring nor uncomfortable despite the fact that they feel tight from a relatively stiff band . I think i would prefer just a little softer padding were I designing the cups . The sound volume seems quite reasonable -LRB- hooked up to my Creative Zen Touch -RRB- and indeed it does work with cancellation turned on or off -LRB- but with off , significantly lower volume -RRB- . The noise cancellation per se is OK , but while it eliminates almost all the low-pitched jet engine whine , it seems to do almost nothing with the higher pitched whine , which I guess I do n't understand since it is so constant ; I 'd rate this element as about average . BUT -- the bass response is extremely weak -- i 'd have to say the poorest of any set i 've ever owned , which to say the least is pretty disappointing . I wish now I had opted either for their cheaper versions , or another brand to get better bass . Overall , these would be just about a 5 stars with excellent bass , but as is , the weak bass cancels out my satisfaction with the unit 's other good characterisitics .
 Bought these , tried them at home and was not impressed with the sound quality for being a Sennheiser model . Know that I am a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to sound quality , but I thought the noise-cancelling feature was more of a weak sound boost and the large noise-cancelling microphone was awkwardly placed halfway down the cord.I returned these and went back to the Bose store and purchased the QC-3 's , which sound much better -LRB- clearer highs and deeper lows -RRB- , have a more comfortable fit , have a built in noise-canceling microphone and a rechargeable battery . Yes , the Sennheisers are almost 1/3 the price of the Bose set , but if you 're serious about sound quality and appreciate well designed functionality , then trust me , just get the Bose set - you wo n't regret it .
 I have a pair of Sennheiser in-ear headphones that I am very happy with , so when I decided to buy a pair of active noise cancelling headphones , Sennheiser , along with Bose , seemed like the natural choices to consider . I wanted an on-the-ear model , since I had previously tried the Bose QC-2 over-the-ear headphones and I found that they made my ears sweat . At the same time , I was concerned about getting on-the-ear headphones because I have some problems with my ears -LRB- itching & occasional pain -RRB- and I was concerned that the stronger noise-cancellation signals of these models would cause ear pain . I ruled out the Bose QC-3 's based on some reviews which stated that they did in fact cause ear pain in some people . After reading many favorable reviews of the Sennheiser PXC 300 's , I decided to buy this model.My first impression of the PXC 300 's was that they seemed a bit flimsy . It 's not too much of a problem for me , but if I was travelling all the time , then I might worry about how well these headphones would hold up to the stresses of constant travel . They come with a small , semi-rigid case which stows easily , but I found that it 's a bit difficult to fit the headphones and cord into the case . It 's not the easiest thing to do at the end of a crowded flight.When using the headphones , the first thing that I noticed is that the volume is very muted . Normally I set the volume level on my iPod to 15-16 when using my in-ear headphones . When using the PXC 300 's however , I have to set the volume at 35-36 to get the same volume level . The good news was that the noise-cancelling technology did not cause any ear pain.I first tried the headphones during my daily train commute . I know that most noise-cancelling headphones only help to reduce low-frequency sounds , like those heard on an airplane , so I would n't normally expect them to be much help in this environment . Sennheiser , however , advertises that they have a sensor which analyzes the surrounding noise and produces a signal to cancel it . In my opinion , this is bogus advertising . The PXC 300 's did nothing to reduce the volume of higher frequency noises like people talking and train whistles.I next tried the headphones on a 9 hour overnight flight and again found them lacking . The PXC 300 's did , in fact , cancel some of the noise , but certainly not all of it . For some reason , when using the headphones , I am much more aware of the background noise . When not using the headphones , my ears somehow become accustomed to the background noise and I can eventually get some amount of sleep on an overnight flight . Although the PXC 300 's did cancel some of this background noise , I was much more cognizant of the noise that was n't cancelled and found it very difficult to sleep -LRB- the uncomfortable coach seat did n't help either -RRB- . Eventually I found it better to take the headphones off entirely.I was recently upgraded to business class on a flight and got a chance to try the Bose QC 3 's . I found their noise-cancelling technology to be much superior than that of the Sennheiser . With the Bose headphones , I experienced almost total quiet and did n't have to crank up the volume like I do with the PXC 300 's . The Bose units did hurt my ears when I first turned them on , but I gradually became accustomed to the pressure and started to ignore it . What I particularly liked about the QC 3 's was that I was able to turn off the music entirely and sleep for several hours without any background noise waking me up.In terms of sound quality , the Bose also seemed better to me , but then I 'm not an expert.If these were cheap headphones , then I would say that you get what you pay for . But at $ 200 , the PXC 300 's were not cheap . I would suggest that anyone considering buying noise-cancelling headphones get either an inexpensive pair , or that they spend the extra money and buy the Bose .
 I am new to the digital music age and purchased these headphones in preparation for a long airline flight to Guam . I wore them around the house prior to my trip to see if I would be satisfied . I was NOT ! I had a headache after about an hour , the wires are so fine that they get caught in the headphone when folding to put away and the insulation was cut . This happened twice . The noise cancelling feature was negligible . I wish I had gone ahead and purchased the Bose instead of wasting my money on these headphones . You never get more than what you pay for and in this instance you do n't get what you pay for .
 Pro : It does eliminate the fan noise from the desktop computer . That 's all it can.Con : It has its own low freq . noise when the cancel . is not activated .
 My Bose Quiet Comfort Headphones , after about a year and a half of loyal service , cracked at one of the hinges in the middle of yet another flight . They were a gift and I was n't too pleased about having to fork over $ 300 to replace them . But , after my recent experiment with these Sennheiser ` phones , I will gladly pay the cash.I am not an audiophile like some of the folks who have provided reviews here . I read many of the reviews here before purchasing the Sennheiser and these sounded like an equal replacement for the Bose . In truth , they ca n't even hold a candle to the Bose QC 's . While I do fly a lot , the litmus test for these headphones takes place on noisy New Jersey Transit trains . I am concerned about one thing
 I own the Bose QC2 . The QC2 sounds great , but they are big and carry-on space is always at a premium . I wanted to try the smaller Sennheiser 300 's . They are smaller , but they do not do a good job of cancelling out the noise . The right side was particularly bad . It seemed that the noise of the engines `` leaked '' through . I recommend avoiding these .
 I purchased these -LRB- at the airport to intensify my mistake ! -RRB- and was quite disappointed midway through my flight . I was flying internationally , so that made it even more annoying . It appears that the headphones actually create ambient noise then when you turn on the `` noisegard '' switch , it drowns out it 's own noise ... but not really anything else . Recently I purchased some solid Bose on-the-ear headphones and stood in my bathroom , with the exhaust fan running . I played some music on my iPod using the sennheiser headphones . I could easily hear the fan blowing as well as some `` wind '' sound in my ears . Then I switched on the noisegard at which time the `` wind '' noise stopped but I could still hear the exhaust fan . Next I changed over to my -LRB- non-noise canceling -RRB- Bose headphones and ... whaa la ! No exhaust fan noise . Quite frankly , this seems like a product scam and maybe there is a class action suit waiting out there ... any lawyers what to chime in on that idea?Bottom line , these headphones are useless for the claims they make . Other than neatly folding up and their light on the head feel , they offer nothing to a solid pair of REGULAR Bose headphones . AND I PAID LESS FOR MY BOSE !!! Hope this helps someone from making the same mistake I did ... Cherz !
 I enjoyed these headphones for the noise cancellation on long flights , but they are made of cheap plastic and did not hold up well over time . After one year , the the pretty silver pieces on the backs of the earcups came off . A few months later , one of the tiny plastic tabs holding the battery cover in place broke off , so I had to tape the battery case shut . And a few months after that , the rubber insulation pulled away from the jack at the joint , exposing the wires . I wrapped the frayed joint with electrical tape to keep them working a while longer , but on my last flight they finally stopped transmitting sound . The noise reduction still works , but who cares ? For the price , they should be made with better materials .
 I was expecting a much better product . The sound quality is marginal at best . There is no low end response from the headphones , and the high end is over extended . The only advantage to this is voices are very clear when watching a movie , but forget about it for music . The noise canceling properties are right up there with the Radio Shack headphones I currently own , nothing special here . And when you use them just for noise canceling , there is an annoying background noise present . One thing I miss is a volume control that I use a lot with my Radio Shack headphones . The reason I went with the Sennheiser is their reputation . I like the case , they fit well and the battery compartment is solid unlike the Radio Shack headphones which is very flimsey -LRB- I have to hold it together with a rubber band -RRB- . The frequency response problem may have something to do with the impedence of the phones -LRB- 300 ohms -RRB- . If you do n't have a device that can match their impedence you get a frequency response imbalance . My one regret is I kept them too long before trying them out so I could n't return them .
 My wife and I bought one PXC 300 and one PXC 200 for a long series of flights to Asia . Despite reading on Amazon about how comfortable they are , our ears began to hurt after only an hour and a half from the pressure of the padded speakers against our ears . It is surprisingly tight . Additionally Sennheiser seems to have forgotten to add cushioning to the very top of the inside of the headphones ... the part that rests on the very top of your head . As you can see in the images , the padding is placed on the left and right of the center / top of the head phones , which means that bare plastic sits against the top of your head . Again , not comfortable . I actually had to cut a piece of foam and super glued it to the inside of the headphones to try and provide some comfort.The noise reduction is just OK unfortunately and the bass response is terrible . I find the battery pack -LRB- and extra wires -RRB- a pain to deal with in the narrow seats of economy.Even now , with two pair of these headphones , I prefer my Sony in ear buds -LRB- non-noise reduction -RRB- . I think I paid $ 30 a couple of years ago . The bass is great and since they fit inside the ear , the noise canceling -LRB- even though there is no active noise canceling -RRB- is quite good .
 The . a half of this thing works just fine . I have an Netgear HE102 -LRB- . a only AP -RRB- and it seems comparable in performance.However the . b side is completely worthless . WEP or not , Netgear , Toshiba and other client adapters , all the same . No range , instable connection . Tried latest firmware , nada . Tried a pair of the WAB102 's with same results . Steer clear of this thing . Get the HE102 , or something better if you need . a , and get a $ ... special out of the sunday paper for your . b / . g needs .
 Oh the problems I have had ... -LRB- note that I only use the B side of the unit -RRB- ... 1 . frequent auto-reboots . Yep , it resets itself at random ... 2 . very limited range ... walk into the kitchen = &#62; no signal3 . limited compatibility ... Had to replace a few cards -LRB- MS & SMC work & can be found cheap -RRB- 4 . the wireless connection seems to slow to a halt ... you can still pull an ip and browse the internet -LRB- at circa 2400 baud speeds -RRB- ... a reset of the unit fixes this momentarily , but considering you have to either a -RRB- walk to the unit and push a button or b -RRB- slowly load it 's config page and do it -- it 's not worth the hassle.Do like me and buy something else ... something with all good reviews .
 This unit works on 802.11 a only , the 802.11 b barely functions , if at all . Unit is constantly locking up , but could not get Netgear to issue an RMA . Tech support was not helpful , definately overseas with a language barrier . I would not recommend this unit or Netgear as a company .
 I bought these after shopping around a bunch . I loved them and used them all the time . For a month that is.Today when I was taking them off the center of the plastic behind the neck part snapped in two . If you are going to make a product that gets flexed in normal use , it better stand up to it.Oh well , guess I will get some sony 's , I had my last pair of them till the foam ear covers wore away .
 Logitech has done it again . They lured me in with something shiney at a low price point and I took the bait , hook line and sinker . These are the worst quality headphones I 've owned since my sony walkman replacement fuzzies way back in the early 80s . The sound is small and easily distorted and they are an engineering disaster.These headphones use a clear plastic strap to keep tension on the ears holding the speakers on your head . This is not only seriously uncomfortable but after a week of use , my headphones are completely and cleanly broken in two!Logitech , which used to be , and still is in some unenlightened circles , the industry standard , has removed all quality from their products , and these trendy headphones are a sterling example of this . I could pursue the warranty , but at under $ 10 I 'm just going to call it a wash and lesson learned ... again .
 I bought this laptop in a bit of a hurry back in June of 2007 because I needed something for college and I was n't picky at the time . And , while it 's done relatively well for me , I really expected a bit more considering it cost $ 1000 . Its inclusion of wireless draft-N has been an invaluable inclusion , which improves download speeds of my podcasts , Youtube videos , and just regular web sites . But , it took me literally a month to get it to talk with my Linksys router . After returning the router four times at the request of the customer service agent from Linksys , I was forced to leave my router unsecured . It was n't for another year , until Vista 's first Service Pack came out did I get the router get secured , and it turned out that it was Vista , not the router , the whole time.The more recent issues I 've had with it are the battery life . As a college student , laptops are a necessity , but when they die in the library an hour before the test they 're simply a pain . When I first bought the laptop the battery would last around 90 minute in practical use with high screen brightness , wifi turned on , and using Youtube every now and then , but after two years of use the battery life has literally dwindled to a mere twenty minutes . Granted , that happens with lithium-ion batteries , but now my laptop is starting to feel like a compact desktop given that it needs to always stay plugged in.The one year manufacturer 's warranty was also unsatisfactory for a computer that is expected to last at least five years . If a car manufacturer only backed their product with one year we would n't stand for it , so why would we expect only one year for our laptops . Furthermore , Toshiba has a proprietary program to use the `` Fn '' keys called `` Flash Cards '' . Not only is the program increadibly slow , but it is the only way to adjust functions like screen brightness . It may sound petty , but it hangs around the top of your screen at all times and it will get under your nerves in no time.In all , you should be able to judge from looking at the specs that it 's not really a value buy and the review should help you understand not to buy Toshiba laptops in general , with their cheap plastic chassis , non-durable hard drives , and poor warranties . There are plenty of manufacturers out there so just steer clear of Toshiba .
 I have the DVR8-Net-Plus , which is just 8 channels . The motion sensing is fair at best . Revieiwing the recordings is weak . Often it does not even work when using the time stamp , so I have to settle for the ` event ' list . You can transfer video via the USB port , but the file is only readable by the client s/w . The client software -LRB- NetViewer 1.5 dated 2005 -RRB- that you use to connect your computer is TERRIBLE . Its the only means of transfer video to your computer into an AVI format -LRB- because the recording on the HD is a proprietary format - I thought the removable HD was actually going to be useful , silly me -RRB- . Its also used to view live feeds via the network -LRB- which often freezes for a few seconds when the unit senses motion and starts recording -RRB- . You cant just select a time/date to review , you have to open an event list and choose a time stamp . That is not so bad , except this list has always been corrupted for me . I 've returned the unit , tried a different HD , reformatted - still only a partial usable list . Video quality that you transfer off is horrid ! I 've tried all the AVI codecs they provide - its just plain bad -LRB- and I use the highest video settings on the unit -RRB- . Finally , I would like to mention that the remote becomes none responsive and only unplugging the unit fixes this . No big deal when it used to happen maybe every other month , but lately its happened daily this last week . I 've owned this unit for about a year.If they updated the client s/w to make video transfer more easy and better quality and the remote didnt get locked out , I would rate 4 out of 5 since its cheap compared to real surveillance systems .
 Guys , face it , without this expansion card , your iPac is a dud . The Expansion module is bulky and covers the sleek iPac to look like a Russian made tractor . It has no grace , but bite your lips you need this module . Perhaps someone else , a third party , will make a sleeker unit
 It is loose for the iPaq unit by itself . You can not put the unit with expansion pack in it . Also You must take the iPaq in and out to charge and sync with cradle . Unless you have the sync cable which does not come with the iPaq , it is so troublesome to use it . It does not offer any more protection , e.g. drop or rain , on the iPaq unit than the pouch the iPaq comes with . So , why -LRB- ... -RRB- -LSB- purchase -RSB- it , I did and I still do n't know .
 Be aware that the Exec . Leather Style Pack in only a leather case . It does not fit around the iPaq like the included Style Pack ; you must remove your iPaq to fit it in the cradle . It is also just as big in your pocket as the included slip case . The Exec . Leather Style Pack is sized to be used without another Pack . -LRB- Your iPaq wo n't fit with another Pack on . -RRB- On the plus side it does open like a book allowing you to use your iPaq w/o removing it.I was somewhat disappointed .
 heres is what I am currently doing to get by until serial cables come out ... On your NT computer - click import/export , select export to a file -LRB- select * . PST type -RRB- and then select what you want to transfer -LRB- check all subfolders -RRB- click next and save the file , and then transfer the file somehow -LRB- I use the internet -RRB- to your home PC and then Import that file into your Outlook 2000 at home.then sync and presto you have your information.It sucks to have to do that but until the serial cradles arrive plus beware if you do all the files in outlook -LRB- calendar/inbox -RRB- ect . the file could get huge 3 to 4 megs
 Like those who wrote before me , I too , use an NT laptop at work and while I am able to sync at home via the supplied USB cradle , all my really useful and important stuff is on the NT powered laptop ! I have been everywhere -LRB- including several other cities across the country -RRB- and done everything I could think to do to try to find the serial cradle but to no avail . This seems to be a terrific product but unfortunately , it is nothing more than a expensive doorstop until I can get a serial cradle and sync with my data .
 I too have had problems with my ipaq ! I have a toshiba 330CDS laptop , and i cant use the usb cradle , i thought usb was universal ? When i called COMPAQ , guess what ? They told me that my usb was not compatable with the piaq . I will need to wait to BUY a Serial cradle . Shelling out 500 + bucks for a unit that Compaq will support the users . I am a bit peeved at the shortage from Compaq , hello guys its time to pull our heads out !!!
 The iPaq 's been out since June and I happened to be one of the first on hand when CompUsa had it on the shelf so I eagerly snatched it up . I can use the USB at home but I also needed the serial cradles for NT at work . Yet here it is October and the serial port still is n't available ! Three months and all I 've got is a $ 500 digital grocery list . And what 's with CE ver 3 ? No close button on the applications ! I do n't even use it now , what a waste of money . Should 've been smart and returned it within 14 days . I still drool over the display of accessories for every other hand held out there ...
 I , too , have the iPAQ -LRB- since August 1 -RRB- and suffer from the misfortune of using NT at work . Compaq customer service has done a terrific job of skirting the issue whenever I call as to when the serial cradles will be available . I have orders in with several e-tailers for the serial cradle , and their delivery dates keep getting pushed out . What 's going on ? I 'm seriously thinking about selling my iPAQ on eBay , I 've heard it commands top dollar there . In the meantime , it makes for a sharp looking paperweight !
 why is there a shortage from Compaq for the Serial Cradles ? and why are the Serial Cables coming out FIRST and charging you more ?? A few people have gotten ahold of serial cables -LRB- i heard from Canada Compaq directly -RRB- what the heck ... the cables costs the same as the Serial Cradles . . Plus I thought the European Ipaq are shipping with the Serial Cradles instead of USB . .
 I finally received my iPaq 3650 today , whopee ! However I realised that it is almost totally useless as I run WinNT and USB is not supported ! So now I have to order and wait another six-eight weeks for the serial cradle . What a load of howee !
 dear sir , I want the second hand pc . for configration in celron/p-III . please send me rate and configration for second hand celron & p-III .
 I 've owned this speaker for 3 years , and was reasonably impressed with how low it could go in movies for the buck/size . For music , it 's been a different story . The response was flabby , and so unpleasant that I was loathe to allow anything over 50hz through this thing . -LRB- Allowing my Polk Monitor 70 fronts to fill in the upper bass . -RRB- If you notice , I 'm using the past-tense in my descriptions . Just a Month past the 3 year mark , the amp blew -LRB- began eating fuses -RRB- . I contacted the company , waited three weeks , and was COMPLETELY IGNORED . They seem to jump around a lot , the address was different than the one on the manual , and that one had been updated with a sticker.I ca n't tell you how disappointing it is to have a company not stand behind it 's product.I have since replaced this trash with a Polk PSW505 , and deeply wish I had made this choice from the beginning . The Polk is much , MUCH more musical , and -LRB- while I 'm no audiophile -RRB- seems to go just as low in movies , with a more accurate punch.There seemed to be some debate on the AVS forums , that BIC subs were better for theater , while the Polk 505 was better for music . Bull **** . Unless someone has direct side-by-side experience , do n't trust anything they say about the sound quality.More importantly , Polk is a respectable brand , with a strong conviction towards customer service , which BIC -LRB- Acoustech , RtR -RRB- lacks utterly.Be warned , BIC `` America '' is not worth your hard earned dollars . I wish to dissuade anyone from buying ANYTHING from this company , even if you saved money doing so . -LRB- The Polk I mentioned is actually priced lower now -RRB- . Run away . Run far far away .
 I do n't know why you would need to spend the money . When I 'm on the road I just sync up using the Infrared connection . Most laptops these days have the IR port and this seems to be a reason to finally use it.It 's a bit slower but unless you are syncing MP3 's on the road it seems to be fast enough . Fast enough even to sync e-mails with attachments .
 Would n't you think that intel -LRB- one of microsoft 's key partners -RRB- would support their PRO hardware on a 2000 professional . Intel says `` no '' and they `` have no plans on supporting it in the future . '' If you are going to buy a cam and plan on upgrading to the most current Windows release , make sure it has states explicit windows 2000 support . THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT HAVE IT !
 I got this camera but it was not supported by windows 2000
 I was so excited to see that Intel did n't go on-the-cheap with regards to cables , software , etc. . However , the installation was beyond painful . The Intel dial-up to verify the modem did n't work , the test internet call that I tried attempted to download a . com file that -LRB- obvioiusly -RRB- did n't run , and Intel tech support is non-existant . What a let-down
 This works fine with Windows ME -LRB- with a patch -RRB- and Win98 but I mostly use Win2K . Intel offers a beta driver for Win2K but it does n't work very well . I would recommend buying a different camera if you use Windows 2000 . I will have to buy another camera now that I use mostly Windows 2000 .
 I hear of Intel quite a bit nowadays . I expected their products to perform reasonably well ... This flimsy hunk of plastic refused to comply with everything I tried to have it do . It would take one snapshot , then freeze . Then , once I got the program to become unstuck , my computer would crash , rendering everything on my computer dead . Then , after a few rounds of this , I decide to remove the software . Bad idea . It took over a half-hour of battle with this monstrosity to pry its deathgrip off my system . The closest I could get to determining the cause of this debacle is that , on the back of the box , it says that it 's optimized for Pentiums . I have an AMD Athlon . ? Any help would 've worked , but the forum for video and conferencing on intel.com was deactivated in April . Probably because people got fed up w / a $ 140.00 P.O.S. and quit dealing with it . Good doorstop maybe , good camera , I do n't think so . : -LRB-
 I recently receive this product ... and I am not pleased . I am getting a lot of feedback from the unit which is picked up on other radios . The problem ? An overly sensitive microphone on the unit . My recomendation ? Go with a Motorola , Midland , or Audiovox .
 I bought this computer a while back , because at that time -LRB- Spring 2003 -RRB- , my Gateway 400C -LRB- very old -RRB- , had completely died -LRB- I got it to work in Decmember 2003 , then it died in May this year ... for good -RRB- . Although the computer 's power is good , I was VERY dissappointed in Toshiba.The proccessor is an Intel Centrino ... nice ! The memory is good at 512 MB , but I wish I could upgrade it . Some programs use a lot of the memory . It uses Windows XP Home . I love Windows XP , it 's one of Microsoft 's best OSs -LRB- unless you count Longhorn -RRB- . The hard drive is 100 GB , that 's big ... for me that is . It 's a little big but it 's really light , so you wo n't notice.But what really wanted me to write this review is the VERY poor Toshiba service . In October , the Blaster worm was attacked on my computer . Sadly , Norton definitions were outdated , and did n't track it . All of the sudden , restart in one minute . Frustrating . I called Toshiba since the computer was still under their warranty , I asked them about 10 times -LRB- for them to understand me -RRB- that I would need a restoration disc . They said it would be here in 3 weeks . Four weeks ... it 's still a no-show . I call them again , and they actually have the nerve to refuse to help me ! I took the computer to Best Buy to see if they could get me a restoration disc . They said that they have them ... they 're coming in a week . So far , add it all up , it was about 3 months before getting the computer to work -LRB- which inspired me to fix the Gateway -RRB- . Adding on , my friend 's Toshiba laptop -LRB- different model -RRB- had spyware on it , and Toshiba refused to help them ... to be honest for no good reason . Also , if you read my review for Toshiba 's DVD/VHS player , it seems Toshiba is just a poor company . I know the review is about the computer , but I 'm VERY angry at Toshiba . I am not buying Toshiba again .
 The computer that was given to me did not work from the beginning . It did not receive power . I sent it into the company and it has now been a month since I first sent it off . I am not pleased that I was not able to receive a replacement especially when I need a computer because I am in college .
 every other time I try to use this headset , it becomes possessed . It wo n't turn off , it wo n't respond to anything , and it wo n't connect to anything ... it 's a real pain and there 's no way to reset the thing . I have to wait for the battery to run out when it 's on standby which takes days .
 This product has been very disappointing due to the fact that once it pairs and I use it it works fine . If I try to reconnect later to my bluetooth device -LRB- tried several phones and computer -RRB- it will just blink fast and say connected but not produce any sound . The good point is that it can be repaired to the bluetooth device and will work the bad news is I have to wait about 5 days for the battery to run out before I can repair it to teh device since it wo n't turn off .
 I bought this headset thinking I was getting a quality product . Well I should have looked around at the opinions before I threw my money away . The headset paired once after multiple attempts . Then It would not turn off or ON or do anything . All I got was a blinking blue light . From reading the reviews it seems that the controller freezes and the only way to get it working again is to open it up , unsolder the wire from the battery , wait and then reattach it . You will be doing this daily . Otherwise you can wait till the battery runs down which can take weeks being that the only power being drawn is a tiny LED . I am going to invoke the warranty but I have to lay out money for shipping both ways . More thrown away money for this piece of garbage .
 The mouse cursor started jumping around like crazy after a couple of months and the keyboard went completely dead a couple of months later .
 This product just does n't work . I have tried using it with a wired USB keyboards and mice from several manufacturers and it did n't work . I also tried a wireless USB keyboard and mouse and it still did n't work .
 My particular drive worked fine as general-purpose storage . It would play normally encoded CDs but not MP3 files that it recorded itself . -LRB- The MP3 files all conformed to the parameter restrictions in the manual . -RRB- I confirmed that the MP3-encoded CD itself was OK by taking it to a store that had a boombox that played MP3 CDs , and it played fine on that -LRB- so it was n't operator error -RRB- . I had expected better digital design or quality from a drive that is this expensive . Also the manual had only a medium correlation with the software on-screen menus . It had poor orientation to MP3 files and software choices . Only one of three people on the phone-line tech-support knew anything about the product & I do n't think they had one physically with them . I am returning the drive for a refund .
 I ordered the Hopkins 46365 unit since it was recommended along with the hitch I purchased for my vehicle . Upon installation , the LED trailer lights worked but were very dim . The measured voltage was only 3.4 volts at the lights . I returned the unit and ordered a Curt Model 56146 . -LRB- Thank you Amazon ! -RRB- The Curt unit works flawlessly with bright lights with the identical installation . The Mercedes has an advanced lighting system and only the Curt Model 56146 worked on my car .
 Okay , ive had an HP , Kodak , and Canon camera in my past . All were low budget decent quality cameras . Canon and Kodak excelled at colors while the HP one actually came free with a printer and did a decent job , although it was nothing spectacular.This camera on the otherhand , is HORRIBLE . Dont be fooled by all the options that olympus throws in , like the `` scene '' modes . Most are novelty and some are just horrible . The indoor scene mode makes the shutter speed slow down to a ridiculous degree where you have to sit there and hold the camera motionless for a solid 10 sec after pressing the button just to get a somewhat blurry , oversaturated picture . Also , this camera is NOT compact . It is about 1.5 in thick with the screen folded . Thats actually pretty thick ifyou compare it to other compact cameras on the market now.The flash
 I have probably spent 50-60 hours trying to convert my digital movies recorded on this camera to dvd . I am not technically-savvy , so I expected to spend some time , but this is ridiculous . I finally got the imagemixer software -LRB- included on the Olympus Master disc -RRB- to burn a dvd , but the sound is just a high pitched squeak at the beginning of each clip . So irritating . I tried converting the quick time movies into mpeg-4 using cucusoft and burning a disc with nero express 6 , but the quality was so poor , I did n't even bother to burn the dvd.As a still camera , this is fine . It 's my first digital , and I have been happy with my photos . I like the larger than usual LCD . I also like the ability to close the LCD and drop the camera in my purse .
 I got this camera for free with miles that were going to expire . Compared to what is out there , it is huge ! I do like the folding viewer as it wo n't get scratched , but now a days you can buy the plastic covers for the viewers to avoid that.Needless to say , I 'm still using it on vacations and will only buy a new one when this dies or breaks .
 After weeks of changing speakers , messing with settings , and swapping devices , I 've decided that this cable was damaged in transit , or was junk to begin with . When using this cable I only receive sound from my left channel , while my PS3 , which uses a different cable , delivers to all channels . It 's too late now to return , and for $ .90 it is n't worth the hassle .
 When this thing worked , it worked out ok ... I 've definitely heard better quality out of cables but hey ... you get what you pay for.However , it stopped working after only a couple of weeks.How many stars does a cable get when it ca n't supply it 's basic function for more than two weeks?One .
 I have purchased many a Chinese made cheapo cable . You get what you pay for generally , however these snapped instantly and left the pieces inside my player .
 I tried this with my A/V system and it did not work . All I got was a popping sound .
 They did n't send me 3.5 mm Stereo Male To 2 RCA Male Cable 5 ft. I got 3.5 mm Stereo Plug to 3.5 mm Stereo Plug 12ft .
 On about the 8th disk in the spindle the disks stopped working in my Sony camcoder - they give `` recovering data '' message about 1 or 2 minutes into the recording and never work again . I tried a Sony disk and it worked fine . Then I figured I might have gotten a bad disk and openned the second spindle I bought -LRB- I bough 2 about 2 weeks apart as the disks seemed to work fine -RRB- and tried a couple of disks from there - same bad result . I put the Sony disk back in and it still works . So the camcoder is fine . These are just defective disks -LRB- and you do not know about that right away ! -RRB- . Also note that it is just the name `` TDK '' - the disk are actually made by Imation -LRB- says so in small print on the packaging -RRB- - I did not have a good experience with Imation disks on my PC in the past either - they are somewhat low quality . So here TDK makes money because their name is used and Imation makes money because even if you would not buy Imation Corp. disks - you might buy them labeled as `` TDK '' . Both companies make money -LRB- by a deceiving branding method -RRB- and you pay for one thing and get another .
 I have a couple of Sony mini DVD camcorders . I use them to video my son 's hockey games for his coach . When you put in anything other than a Sony DVD it say `` Sony DVD recommended '' . Nice marketing . Because I go through so many DVDs -LRB- I do n't use DVD-RWs because the coach wants to keep the DVDs -RRB- . I bought a few of these spindles . On the first spindle I threw away at least half the DVDs because I got a `` Disc Error '' message when the CamCorder tried to initialize the dics . You are not saving money if you can only use 50 % of them . The Sony individual discs work great , but very pricy . I have found the indvidually packed Fuji or Memorex to work every time . This product may work ok for data , but do n't bother for a CamCorder . I think the CamCorders are just more sensitive with the the real-time video recording and require a higher quality disc .
 The headphones are comfortable enough . Not quite as nice as the photo suggests . The actual headphones differ , slightly smaller/cheaper looking.The headphones cut out some low frequency hum , but in doing so add hiss.My main hope was that I could protect my ears and listen to a portable mp3/radio while doing chores such as mowing the lawn or vacuuming.They help a little , but the volume is boosted when the ANC is activated so it 's difficult to know if the improvement is due to ANC or higher volume .
 I 've had this for several months now and the line seems to be getting very crackly , which I 'd not experienced with use of other phone coils .
 Pros
 I have an 8 station KVM switch and this does not work . When I move the mouse around it does a right click even when my hand is not on the button . I bought this item because some of the reviews said it worked well with KVM 's . I plugged it into the computer via usb and then plugged in the two ps/2 ends from my KVM . I thought maybe it might just be the computer , so I tried it on another computer and it is just as bad as the first computer .
 I got this fan February 11 . It 's April 29th and it 's already squealing . I would n't mind so much except I spent more money in hopes that it would last longer . The fan is cheaply made ... you just need to feel it to see that .
 The headset itself looked and felt ok for the price - be aware it 's stereo not mono - but the sound when using for Skype was tinny and not acceptable for calls . Returned for refund and bought the logitech clearchat pro from Frys -LRB- as needed one quickly -RRB- which although feels a little flimsy , is excellent sound quality .
 I typed in USB headset in the search box and because this one was the cheapest I purchased it . When it finally arrived I found out it was not a usb headset which was never written on the product description . The sound quality is good and the mic quality was horrible .
 ... it sure was n't an engineer , or anyone who regularly uses a laptop . It gets one star for the speakers , one for the nice weight of the base that securely holds the laptop . Negative stars for the crummy keyboard and mouse that I replaced with a better Microsoft product immediately . Negative stars for lack of legacy ports -LRB- I still have to buy a USB-to-Midi converter for lack of a gameport -RRB- . Negative for the non-standard drive slot -LRB- which is too overpriced to consider -RRB- - so I still have to buy an external USB backup drive . Negative for the lack of its own power adaptor - have to buy an extra or else unplug junk when I need to travel with the laptop . So lets see ... after laying out $ 200 for this thing , I still have to buy
 Pros :1 . Matches my HP laptop computer perfectly .2 . People think it looks cool .3 . 250 GB internal HDD is huge!Cons :1 . Dorky connector plugs into the side of the laptop , and looks wrong .2 . The speakers suck . Not much better than the microscopic ones on my laptop .3 . Ca n't add a larger monitor , which sucks cause my notebook only has a 14 `` er .4 . Hard drive is made exclusively for this expansion base , and ca n't be used with anything else . It would be nice to just have an external drive , cause lugging this mammoth around is totally impractical .5 . The included wireless mouse and keyboard kinda suck . The buttons are not firm ; it 's like the whole thing wobbles and bounces as you type .6 . Since installing a Logitech wireless mouse and keyboard -LRB- left my HP ones in a hotel -RRB- , I have to re-set the mouse sensitivity every time I dock/undock the laptop from the expansion base . Many peripherals do not support being used with an expansion base .7 . When my ethernet is hooked to my laptop , it will not work when I dock the laptop to the expansion base . I have to unplug the ethernet from the laptop and connect it into the expansion base to work . This is for DSL BTW .8 . It was $ 500 ! Way too expensive ... I should have just bought an external 250GB HDD , a stand , a wireless mouse and keyboard for much less .
 OK ... so first of all does not come with its own power supply so you have to buy an extra in order to be quick and convenient . I am looking for a way to hook up my larger hp lcd monitor to it ... cant do it . Only hooks up to a TV . You have to do that using your laptop . Then I want to plug in my laptop ... you have to use a cord that does not easily come out of its hiding place ... Totally defeats the purpose of having a docking station . This is supposed to be a quick and easy way to turn your laptop into a desktop . So really my question is what purpose does this thing serve ? I paid 200 dollars for a freaking stand and lame speakers . Next time I will know better and go with Dell .
 This base station is a waste of money . It 's just too cumbersome to hook up the laptop , especially if you want to use an external monitor , for example . I 'm sure I 'll forget to unplug the monitor from the laptop -LRB- yes , laptop - it 's not connected to the base ! -RRB- and destroy the laptop or the monitor in the process.This gizmo weighs a ton - I assume it 's the speakers !? The design of this thing makes it close to unusable.Avoid - save your money .
 Bottom-Line
 I bought this for my son , who has a disability and uses a laptop with voice recognition software . Voice recognition software files are huge , and we thought the 250 gig hard drive would be a real good thing to have to back them up . Well , evidently , the XB 2000 is not compatible with the voice recognition software . As soon as he installed the base , his VRS crashed , and we have n't been able to recover it . HP phone support quite simply BITES ! All the tech could tell me to do in his English-as-a-second-language accent was to run system restore , then blame the software . So now my son has lost ALL his voice user files , just in time for his first semester at college . Angry does n't even begin to describe how I feel about this , but was glad to find out how crappy the support is before we bought another laptop from HP for the next kid .
 Ordered this because it is low profile and my computer case requires that . This item did not work in my new Lenovo desktop as it caused a blue screen hardware parity error . Reseated it and it still did not work . Tried online chat at the support site and nobody answered . Will return and buy a different brand . To be clear , there are only two external ports on this card . one standard and one mini . There is a standard internal port on the card , but it can not be used simultaneously with the external standard port . If you are looking for a card with three ports , this is not it .
 This extensions destroys your xbox 360 ! Yeah ! It gave me 2 red lights on my 360 . 2 red lights means your 360 is ef 'd up because it is a serious hardware failure indicator . Also , I passed my 1 year warranty so microsoft would n't fix it unless i gave them 99 dollars . the reason why i gave it a 2 star and not a 1 star is because it actually looks nice while the light is on and it holds your 360 up for you . I 'm going to put a video review up if I can . is it worth 20 dollars ? no ... 10 ? ... yes
 Within 10 minutes of using it , the green light burned , and to top it off the fans do n't blow worth a damn , it ended up in the trash the same day.Only good cooler the the Intec Turbo Cooler , that 's the only SAFE cooler that will suck out the heat from where it 's supposed to come out .
 I purchased this product because I was interested in a cooling fan setup for my 360 . The SOLE reason I purchased this particular Cooling stand was because of the Green LED lights on the base of the stand . I just received the unit today and the lights , which I will reiterate are the only reason i bought this particular stand , DO NOT WORK . There was no mention of the lights not working in the description despite it being a used unit . It seems to me the seller left this out . Very unhappy with the fact that they seem to be broken . Product is otherwise cheap and paying double for something that seems to work better might be a better idea . Worst case scenario you could probably set up your own LED lighting and it 'd probably look better . I would not recommend this to anyone
 This sub was great had 2 of them on a 1000 watt amp . they pounded really nice . but no more than 2 months after i got them 1 of them blew up , do n't know why so i just had 1 and i put in another 1 of my old subs . it was just older with max watts of 750 and then 2 weeks later the 2nd of the power subs blew . i have no idea why they both blew like that they were n't getting 2 many watts to them or anything so i am just getting Pioneer 's not wasting my money on cheep subs anymore .
 These need to be longer by .5 to 1 '' ... my subwoofer is almost flat on the floor . The spikes need more length and more threads .
 The P164 Circular Polarizer filter I received is totally worthless . The diameter is larger than the slots of the P series filter holder . It will not go into the holder . I am totally disappointed . I would have rated it 0 if I could have .
 I bought this tuner hoping to use it to record unencrypted digital shows from my cable . When I first connected it to my cable I could receive all the analog channels but only 1 digital channel . After checking their support page I discovered that it needed a strong signal so I installed a cable amplifier between the unit and my cable . I could then received 4 digital channels . Both of my digital TVs can receive 12 channels . I then purchased a more powerful cable amplifier and was able to receive 6 digital channels . I am not very impressed by the fact that this unit can not receive digital channels that an ordinary digital TV can .
 Its does what it says . . But if you want to use it with MCE , sagetv or Mythtv its not user friendly.It was a waste of money for me.I recently purchased HDhomerun -LRB- dual tuner -RRB- by Silicondust and love it.I can record my local QAM channels using Sagetv.Also , they support Mythtv .
 I read all these great reviews and bought the absurd thing.Whenever I record , the result has a flickering line at the top that is so irritating , I ca n't watch.Technical support says it will always be there.This thing is worthless junk . The other reviewers must just use it to watch TV . Recording is a hopeless joke . Sure , use WinDVD Creator to record . Oh , wait WinDVD only records analog , so you can forget digital.I 've have returned this `` product '' for a refund .
 Could n't get enough channels -LRB- even with purchase of an external antenna -RRB- to make it worth the price .
 CLUMSY N SLOW ! I WAS NOT IMPRESSED WITH THIS LENS .
 The sound quality is so bad ... especially when volume level is increased ... no equalizer options so ca n't adjust the bass , treble etc. , No holes to hang somewhere ... poor design so it just rolls out if I try to place in a table ... And it looks like eyes of some alien from mars ... so bright blue light , disturbing eyes at night ... pluses are quick delivery and cheap cost ... I am using it to hear audio books ... -LRB- and for music I bought an some other product -RRB- ... Best option is to put some +20 $ and go for some popular + good speakers available in the market ... If you want to hear good music with decent bass + treble + balance ... it is not worth ...
 I purchased these speakers on December 10th , and it is now December 23rd and still no speakers . I paid for the expedited shipping , but they never shipped . I tried contacting both Amazon and Caiman several times , but have received no reply from either company . I will not be able to give the speakers as a christmas gift as planned . I am very disappointed in both Caiman and Amazon , as neither company has even sent me an email to let me know what the delay is , or when they will be shipped . I do n't reccommend this company at all .
 Having been through three pairs of V-Moda Vibe earphones in the last year , each of which shorted out on one side , I absolutely accept that I may just be cursed . But these lasted an even shorter time than the Vibes did , and Creative has a much more annoying return process than V-Moda does . Because they wo n't ship to my USPS post office box , I 've decided not to bother at all.As for their sound
 Well first of all I need to write that I 'm a huge fan of Creative Labs products but this one is just the worst tech product that I bought in years . Is expensive for the sound quality wich is the same -LRB- and maybe worst ! -RRB- of my retail Sansa MP3 Player Earphone . Second and more important to me is the confort ... I tried with all sizes of earbuds and I get 2 results
 Compared to Shure 's E2cs , the rival they 're going for , it just does n't match up . For almost the same price , they offer a higher noise isolation , i 've compared them in outdoor environments .
 I have a 40gig Creative Zen Touch . I thought this would be the perfect match ; I was soooo wrong.The sound was awful , for what I paid 75.00 . I 'm really shocked at the Creative team for putting out such an inferior product.Do not waste your energy ordering this product!Buy the V-Modas bling bling black for 32.00 ; you will be happy you did .
 Not only was the bass nonexistent , buy the treble was tinny as well . Then they tell me it 's a nonreturnable product so I 'm stuck with it . Lesson learned . Bottom line - do n't even think about buying these unless you 're tone deaf .
 They look nice and have great packaging but the sound quality is poor forthe price . The Bass is muddy and there is a lot of distortion in the mids , the highs are shrill and very uneven in frequency response . They are fine for Audiobooks but not good enough to listen to music for any length of time due to the tinny and uneven requency response.For $ 80 there are much better sounding phones out there.My $ 15 Sony Playstation buds blow these things away .
 These earbuds are more costly and less comfortable than the $ 50 S ** y in-the-ear phones . And they do n't sound any better . They do sound quite good , just no better .
 Great sounding earbuds , but after only 2.5 months became staticy and distorted . Thankfully , Amazon took them back . Great Company !
 They make it sould like these are active noise canceling headphones . They are also priced like they are . However , they are just over-prices bud headphones .
 I commute by train to work each day and wanted these headphones to use every day to eliminate background noise on the train and as I walked in the city.These headphones worked great for that purpose . They were a little loud with the `` banging '' on your chest from the cords but overall I loved them.I am very disappointed in how long the product lasted . I consider myself an average user , not rough on stuff . The first pair of headphones broke after 3 months , developing a `` short '' in the wire that caused the headphones not to work . After a somewhat lengthy return process the second pair has died after 30 days . I am very upset.I went to radio shack and bought a pair of sony headphones for half the price . I have these expense ones , now broken again , collecting dust .
 These high-end headphones delivered great sound quality , but almost convinced me to return my iPod to the Apple store . I started hearing skipping , crackling and distortion in my music when I was running , but not when I played the iPod in my car . I thought it must be the Nike + iPod receiver at first . Only after a long process of elimination and considerable frustration did I figure out that the headphones were actually causing the problems.While the sound is good , these just did n't wear well enough to justify the price .
 These are very comfortable , small and light , and they block the ambient noise very well . There are a couple of major problems however . One is that the chord is microphonic . It transmits a loud scraping sound to the earpieces when it rubs on your face or clothing . The other is the response . The only other earphones I have to compare it against are the Ultimate Ears Super.fi 3 , -LRB- a.k.a. Altec Lansing UHP336 -RRB- . The Zen suffers very badly by comparison . It has an uneven frequency response with a bump in the mid treble range around 3kHz to 5kHz that makes it sound shouty . Another nit is that there is no room in the supplied carrying case for the airplane connection adapter .
 The left ear bud did not carry sound . It was damaged when shipped and the product had to be returned . I was embarrassed to have given it as a gift .
 save your money or give it to your better half.this is a point and crap unit.if there is any light in the back ground the picture gets washed out , which is most.using your flash also washes out the picture.eats battery like crazy . nice size and great operation program.that is the only good thing i can say about this camera.very poor light control.selling this unit has got to hurt the companys image in my opinion .
 I received this radio as a gift a while ago and really loved it . It is simple to use , waterproof and -LRB- for the most part -RRB- well built . The one issue that I noticed when I purchased it -LRB- which came back to bite me -RRB- was the design of the clip . While when locked in the radio is sturdy , but you only need to rotate the radio to unlock it from the clip . I noticed this from the start as a strange design compared to other radios that utilize a button lock on the clip , but I was n't overly concerned about it . That brings me to today . When I go out in my 13 ft boston whaler I keep my radio clipped to the front of my life jacket . Today I lost a towel over the side of the boat . I got back to it quickly but it started to sink so I jumped in to grab it and thew it onto the boat . As I was floating next to the boat I noticed that my radio was gone . Apparently it had rotated out of the clip -LRB- which was still on the life jacket -RRB- and sunk . So now I 'm out an $ 150 radio . I 'm not trying to say that it is a bad radio , but due to it 's flimsily lock in the clip it is maybe not the right choice for a small boat .
 I have now had two Zumo 550 's completely fail . The first made it three weeks , the second made it 4 weeks-Failure is the same on both units-simply died -LRB- not a battery issue -RRB- . As the weather prohibits riding a MC at the moment , my only experience with the 550 has been in a car . When it works , very good and easy to use.While the store replaced the first one -LRB- and they will replace the second one -RRB- , I expect much better from a product at this price point . I will be asking for a refund at this point.Suffice it to say that I have zero confidence that this unit will survive when exposed to the vibrations and weather on a motorcycle !
 I bought this unit rather than other motorcycle friendly GPS units because of the ` built in ' XM radio . It is n't really built in , though , as you have to spend another $ 160 or so to get the XM antenna.I ca n't count the number of times this unit failed to recognize an address , sent me to the wrong address , or put me into a loop where it tried to take me in an endless circle.In one instance , it took me up a hill and the map showed another road where it said I would turn . The problem was , there was no other road , and the one on the map disappeared as I approached where it was supposed to be.I have driven on multiple four lane highways that were a decade or more old , and the unit did n't know they were there.The unit also allows you to use your cell phone via blue tooth , but the sound quality and volume are terrible . I have to stop the bike and remove my helmet , then make the call normally . The only benefit I get from this function is that I know when someone calls and who it is . It 's the GPS and not the phone , because I 've gotten the same performance from more than one phone.Using the unit in a car is frustrating as well . The maximum volume is so low , you frequently ca n't hear what it 's saying . I have a friend with one of those , and it works drastically better . It recognizes roads that are barely there and definitely are n't on any maps.Save some bucks and buy a Tom Tom GPS and a separate XM radio . You 'll get better mapping and avoid some frustration .
 I 've had the Zumo 550 for just over a month now and during that time it has locked-up in the power off mode multiple times while in the cradle . The only way to get the unit to power back on is to remove and re-install the battery using a 2mm hex wrench -LRB- not included -RRB- . The unit does have some nice features but its lack of dependability make it more toy than tool . If you 're considering a purchase check out the ZumoForums online . There are multiple accounts of new Zumos with the same problem I had . Kudos to Amazon for shipping out a replacement -LRB- I had owned the unit a few days too long to qualify for a refund , which I would have preferred . -RRB- but my discussions with Garmin and others ' experience does n't make me hopeful that this will have been a good investment .
 Garmin Zumo 550 3.5-Inch Portable GPS Motorcycle NavigatorThe voice is hard to understand . Searching takes a long time and sometimes it never finds it . For a few hours it just stopped working then it started working again ?? I do n't think the screen is all that great . The speaker and microphone on the bluetooth are terrible . Everyone says they ca n't hear me . I 'm not very happy at all with this product . I have a toyota gps that works great and I have an older Magellan that runs circles around this Garman product . I hope it 's really water proof !!
 I was very happy with unit until a cool fall day and I wanted to ride . Guess what ? It wo n't turn on . For 652.00 it should last longer than three weeks . I am sure by the time I send it in and get it repaired or replaced I will not have it for fall riding .
 I made the mistake of letting this thing choose a backroads route for me only to find out that it took me 80 miles out of my way . This would n't be so bad if I had n't been riding for 10 hours already and was in the mood for some site seeing . The software for the unit needs HELP ! It will not let you easily alter a route it has chosen for you . The mapping software on the PC is much easier to manipulate . So , either plan your every move before you leave home , buy maps as you go or take your laptop with you.The MP3 player and photo viewer work well.Purchased from Beach Camera - Fantastic retailer !!!!!!!!!
 This product is advertised as `` new '' in box and is definitely not . The first time I ordered the product it came in an open box with stickers off of the unit , no shrink wrap around the box , cables undone , etc. . I was upset because of the price I paid for the item that was represented as brand new . I sent it back to Amazon and they assured me this would not happen again . The next unit that was delivered also was opened and not new as advertised.I have heard the product is great , I just would not recommend purchasing from amazon until they can get their advertising correct .
 The Zumo 550 is the bit of motorcycling kit that I have both come to love and hate at the same time . I admit that Garmin has done a terrific job of making such a feature rich piece of technology . The Zumo has never failed to disappoint me with it 's array of bells and whistles , and the usability of the device is great while riding , and while planning rides.However , I have two gripes : First , the routing is n't all that great . The Zumo can be set to route for shortest distance or shortest time , but no matter how it 's set , it will often attempt to guide me in round-about courses in lieu of direct lines . This is particularly problematic when low on gas . I 've learned that the Zumo should only be used to find where you 're going , and then navigate yourself by following street signs instead . In short , if the Zumo tells you you are heading for Interstate 1 , use your eyes to follow the signs to Interstate 1 - the Zumo will not get you there . Furthermore , the Zumo has attempted to route me on more than one dirt hiking trail . Not a good idea on a street motorcycle.Secondly , the quality control on the 550 is horrible . I know many riders that have brought their Zumos through years of constant use , but in my case , I have had three replacement units through Garmin in five years . They have a tendency to just stop powering up one day . In each case , I was billed $ 150 for a refurbished replacement , so my current , refurbished Zumo 550 has cost me roughly $ 1200 to date.With the arrival of the 600 series Zumos , the 550 should have descended notably in price , but it has not gone down much . For such a poorly constructed unit , I would have hoped to see them phased out entirely .
 Having bought this in Jan. 2010 , I hooked it up to my computer to make sure the software and maps were up to date . So what do you get for a list price of $ 600 ? One update . After that , you have to pay $ 70 to update your map to the newest version . They also have an option for lifetime updates at another ridiculous price . I 'm sorry , but this is pure greed . Not only are you paying an ultra-premium price on their GPS , but then you have to keep on paying just to keep the maps up to date . Mine came installed with the 2009 north America city navigator . I got one update to the 2009 only to discover there was now a 2011 version . Can I get that one ? Nope . They want more money . I will never recommend this product to anyone based on this disgusting abuse of company greed.And make no mistake , this is not an easy product to use . You ca n't look up a city by zip code , so you 're stuck spelling it out , and the settings go on forever . Trying to find places to eat I uploaded was painful since they were not in a place you would think they are . All in all , for something to get you from A to B , this product falls far short of a $ 600 price tag . Garmin may not think so , but that is a lot of money . And then to request more money just to get the latest map ? Pure greed.UPDATE 1-26-12
 The GPS worked fine for a couple of days and then it never turned on again . I sent a mail to DIGITECHDEALS and they told me to send them the GPS and they would send me a new one . The new shall arrive this week . Fast response from DIGITECHDEALS .
 A great gps when it works . Stopped working three weeks after receiving . Received a replacement that only worked for a week .
 Product just quit working 3 weeks after I got it . Sent it back to manufacturer -LRB- Garmin -RRB- who said they would have it fixed on a priority and over-nighted back to me . That was almost two weeks ago and have not gotten it back yet . Still waiting .
 I asked the person who I spoke why there was such a difference in prices from one retailer to another . He told me that the differences where because of the different versions of the machines and that I would not be able to update an older unit with new software.With this information I bought the unit from 17th Street Photo.When I called Garmin they told me that there is no different versions and that any updates would be available to me after buying the unit . With this information I could have bought it from another store at a lower price.I gave my review regarding my purchase , but after finding out from Garmin that there is no difference between years or -LRB- versions as I was told -RRB- I change my review.The following day a representative from 17th Street Photo called me asking me to change my review for a 20 dollar refund , I told them that I would have to think about it and to call me back later.I found this to be insulting and when they called me back I told them that I would not change my review and that in fact I was going to change my review again letting other customers know what they were doing to gain a better review , they then offered me 30 dollars to remove my review , but I refused.I believe that people should know what this company is doing to gain the trust of customer to buy their products . If they had no stars that 's what I would have given them.Garmin 010-00567-00 Zumo 550 3.5-Inch Portable GPS Motorcycle Navigator
 Let me preface this by saying that I have used this unit -- my third , one died and was replaced and the second fell and I had to have it repaired -- they sent a refurbished unit -- I have had this unit for three years and ridden with it for 45k miles . Suffice it to say I have driven it around the block . I am very tempted to give it one star.What it does do is tell you where you are . The screens are nice and as long as you are just watching the screen change with you , it is fine.But get into a situation where you must interact with this unit and forget about using it while riding.Examples : No QWERTY keyboard . Instead they have some very hard to use scroll in one screen -LRB- see Amazon image -RRB- and in another there is an ABCDEF screen . BOTH of these screens could have just as easily been QWERTY . You can not imagine how hard it is to use while riding , and it ai n't no piece of cake when stopped . It is a real pita to use.Also , the menu items are so user hostile . If you are riding and you want to find fuel these are the stepsMenu ... food/lodging ... fuel ... all types -- 4 steps to find a damn gass station . Finding a motel is even worse : Menu ... food/lodging ... arrow down ... lodging ... hotel/motel -- 5 steps to get there . They have the `` options '' in alphabetic order so you have to bypass ATM and ENTERTAINMENT to get to lodging and then you have to choose MOtelAnd once you do get there-gas food motel -- then you have to understand the shorthand , look to see where the arrow points . And the arrows do not just point up the road or behind you , no , they point in compass directions so they may point toward 4 oclock or 9 oclock . And that may or may not be on your route . To see if it is on your route you must highlight it , and then press show map and see if it is relevant to your ride.The menus are totally fixed and can not be user modified . I asked on the zumoforums about this and many people chimed in to also complain about this unit 's user hostility and the mod smugly answered that that 's `` just the way they are . `` I have no experience with any other GPS , but I have to believe that others have a better , much better , human interface . And it 's real expensive also for these `` features . '' I would NOT recommend this unit , and I have one that does n't spontaneously die.I bought this unit because Garmin tells us it is desgned by bikers for bikers . That is impossible to believe . It is just marketing hype . The more I use this device the more I find fault with it and I am not mentioning how directions can be screwed up , or if you decide to change your route on the fly the unit with continue to route you back to the part of the route you intentionally skipped until you stop it -LRB- Menu ... stop -RRB- and restart your route -LRB- Menu ... routes ... select your route ... go ... no -RRB- . Zumo , get a clue . And the most infuriating part ? I 'll bet a firmware fix would change all this , but nooooooo
 I paid around $ 800 for my Zumo and it was defective right out of the box . The features are great , but mine just would n't turn on sometimes . Unfortunately the unit waited 17 days to act up , too long to return it to Best Buy , so I turned to Garmin . Tech support could n't solve the problem so they requested that I return the unit.They would n't just send a replacement unit , they want ALL the parts , including the ones already mounted to the motorcyle . In addition , they rewarded me with the pleasure of paying for shipping to return it to them . Customer rep. said she did n't think it was right either , but it 's `` Company Policy '' . I used this unit on one trip , and it left me stranded . Thankfully I had maps . Now Garmin is taking a few more bucks out of me . Cheaters never prosper Garmin ! I 'm in a loose/loose situation . Pay the blackmail money , or be stuck with a defective unit . Not a happy camper !
 In the last 9 months , I have had 3 Zumo 550s . Each time , it took weeks for Garmin to process my RMA and send me a new unit . Each time , the unit failed within 6 months or so . This time , they have my RMA listed as `` unit backordered '' so I am without a motorcycle gps and may not get the replacement anytime soon.Garmin map support is awful . It always says the device does n't have enough room for a new map . Even though I have paid for lifetime maps . Truth is , if their IT people knew what they were doing , they could write the web -LRB- or lifetime -RRB- update application to stage and overwrite , and do it all without making the user become a computer wizard.They are smug , and unhelpful.So is the Zumo 550 a good motorcycle gps ? Yes , it is the best of the Zumos , even though it is quite `` outdated '' technology . It computes fast , gives early warning on turns , and follows your MapSource route . gpx perfectly.But so far I ca n't get one to work for more than 6 months without failing , and I can not get good service from Garmin , and its near impossible to udpate the maps unless you know all the tricks and secrets . For over $ 600 plus the cost of a lifetime map subscription , nobody should have to suffer these issues .
 For Christmas , my Mother purchased two Garmin auto GPS devices for both myself and my cousin ... in fact , she 's done this twice , for a total of FOUR Garmin GPS purchases ! The older version my cousin had just totally stopped working after about a year , then the newer versions we received last year for Christmas , also have issues.She has been like a bloodhound trying to track down Garmin customer service - sending emails , faxes , phone calls where the automated voice tells you it will be a 40-minute wait ! Undaunted , she keeps trying , where most customers would have given up and just thrown the $ 300 + out the window.I want the Amazon community to know how lacking in post-sale service this company is.I ca n't give a review of TomTom , but I can definitely say , do not purchase a Garmin , unless you enjoy wasting hundreds of dollars on a faulty device .
 I was tired of the 15 minute start up times , the touch screen that could n't stay calibrated , expensive map updates and Garmin 's useless tech support . Now I have a Magellan 5045-LM . Life just got better .
 I purchased a Zumo 550 to go along with the many motorcycles I own . I thought it would be a nice tool to help navigate on my trips . It is a GPS and should be able to provide basic navigational information , right . Wrong ! While Garmin added a lot of nice bells and whistles with Bluetooth and MP3 capability , it failed to include such basic functions as altitude and a compass that functions while the unit is navigating to a waypoint . It also fails to provide a heading indicator or any reference of direction on the route page . You can toggle to the trip information page and get a basic heading readout -LRB- N , S , W , E -RRB- but not a true compass heading . Give me a break.Garmin needs to provide the following fixes to this product .1 . Provide altimeter readout . -LRB- this is a GPS is n't it ? -RRB- It would be nice to know if you were operating at 500 feet or 15,000 feet .2 . Provide a compass that is accessible not only while off road but while navigating a route .3 . Provide a bearing indicator on the route page so that you can determine direction of travel while viewing this page . Again , it would be nice to look at the route page and be able to determine direction of travel . I know the Garmin 360 has a bearing pointer on the route page.Garmin dropped the ball on this one . The information I have outlined above is critical to a motorcyclist . I paid close to $ 1,000.00 for this product and it has in some instances less capability than a basic model . It also requires a $ 250 + antenna to receive XM radio . What gives?Garmin 's marketing campaign sums it up best , `` designed by bikers...motorcycle-friendly ... high end navigation features '' . I think not . Someone should have included a motorcyclist on their design team .
 Garmin says that only an antennae is needed to use the built in XM capabilities . That is not correct . The Garmin does not have an XM receiver in it so you have to buy a special `` antennae '' listed at $ 270 and $ 200 on Amazon . It is the only way to use the XM function and is 1/3 the price of the GPS itself . Garmin are taking advantage of customers and are providing misleading advertising implying that only an antennae is needed . To those of us accustomed to XM and what typical antennaes cost it is quite a shock when we go to use all the capabilities of the GPS .
 I bought the 810 model , which is similar . Worked generally fine , but because of its shape , easy to drop or fall over . I put it on top of my desktop , and accidentally it fell on the wooden floor , and since then , it has not turned on . Too fragile .
 Very noisy . Poor build quality . Door misaligned . Despite spending days with customer service and buying more software at their suggestion burner would never work . Tried it on three different Mac computers with no luck . Still waiting on Sony to fix it or replace it .
 I do n't know what they 're talking about , I own a year old Sony VAIO w/a P4 HT 3.06 GHZ processor and 1028 MB of RAM and this drive clocks 40x when I burn CD-R Data disks and can burn videos at the listed DVD+R speed , 8x . Most DVD+R disks are 8x or under in speed so there really is no use in having a 16x DVD burner , but I guess in the near future there will be media that can burn at 16x . By the way the other reviewers mentioned that they were using DVD-R media , that media is made to be used with Macs not PCs , you 're supposed to use DVD+R on a Windows PC . So that could have been they 're problem . I use this drive with Nero 7 Ultra Edition and it works great . Then again it 's a Sony so it has to be great!Follow - up
 I purchased this unit because it advertised 16x burn on DVD-Rs . I used 4 different brands of DVD-Rs listed on the website for this unit . None of them recorded faster than 2x . I could not get it to even record a DVD+R faster than 2x . I returned the unit after 3 days of trying different software configurations . Nothing I tried increased the burn rate faster than 2x . The only reason it deserves a `` 2 stars '' is because it plays back very well and did produce a good recorded DVD-R , it just takes `` half a lifetime '' to complete a burn .
 I never got this drive to go faster than 2x . I finally returned it , after spending a day getting no help from Sony tech support . They had no clue what the problem was , and their final answer was to tell me to go back to the store and buy some Sony DVD-Rs . I returned the drive and got a HP dvd840e instead . It works great with the same computer and DVD-Rs . Plus it has Lightscribe which is a nice bonus.Avoid this drive ...
 The card is good as a standard video card , for games , windows , etc. . The problem is the ATI software that is provided and is required to run the TV and TV scheduler -LRB- record TV shows -RRB- . The software is very buggy , and has not worked on my pc yet . The support from ATI is poor , and after 3 days has amounted to not much more than suggestions to download the newer software and reinstall , which has no helped . After each re-install a new crop of crashes comes up , and the scheduler NEVER works . Save your money , buy a non `` All-In-Wonder ''
 To add to the comments above , I have had one of these cards in my system for 2 weeks now since buying a HP Media Centre , and honestly you 're better off with a cheap Freeview USB stick if you want TV on your PC . Forget the TV , that 's a joke . The killer is that it wo n't detect some flat screen monitors on the DVI out . I have dual Formac Gallery 1740s - not a cheap flat screen - and nothing on the DVI out . I 've gone round with ATIs support , and the best they can do is ` remove all ATI software and reinstall ' , i.e. , you figure out the problem for us . This is not limited to the X600 - their own support forums reference other ATI cards as does a quick Google on this problem . I 've had my machine refuse to restart and some of my peripherals malfunction after reloading their software , so do n't intend to do it again - I 'm ordering an Nvidia card and moving on . Exactly what I did with the last ATI card I got stuck with in a machine in fact ...
 The TV driver and some other functions do not work even with the latest updates from ATI . This card gets super hot and required a dedicated fan in an adjacent slot . Still gets hot and sometimes shuts down the entire PC . The support on the web is extremely poor . It always defaults to the same page . I use Windows XP PRO , P4 3.6 GHz , 2 GB DDR2 RAM .
 I purchased two of these . One for myself and one for a friend for my Nikon 7600 and his Nikon 5600 and neither of us were impressed with its performance.The method of attachment is very risky , and can easily bend the original lens protector , leaving it in a permanently open position.As far as wide angle performance . It marginally improves the camera 's performance , but in my opinion , not enough to warrant the potential damage to a line of cameras that already do very well on their own .
 The first time I tried this , it damaged the camera 's lens cover mechanism . The little hooks that hold it to the lense poke into the area where the covers exit the mechanism , causing it to stop working . Do not buy or use this product !!!
 today was the first day with it . I have noticed no difference in appetite . directions say it may take a few days.It tastes fine .
 The product itself I ca n't complain about , considering , I have n't gotten it yet , Thanks to Amazons awful service . I ordered this on November 10th . 10 days later they tell me the order is delayed , and it will only ship after December 25th . 1 Month Delay . Cool . Does it get better ? Yes it does . I continue looking into it . They tell me , their only shipping it on APRIL 21st ! . FIVE Months delay !? No thanks , you lost your money and your customer , this is ridiculous .
 I am so sick of these things being released without CDMA/EVDO or some cell service . From Nokia of ALL COMPANIES!Get with the times and offer an internet device that does n't require me to be in 50 feet of a damn router .
 The first unit I received failed to boot . I am now on the second unit and the wireless module has failed . I bought this to replace a Dell Axim . After a month and a half it is starting to look like I should have sent this back before the 30 days were up . I really wanted this to work but it has been a disappointment .
 Do n't touch this piece of junk ! It wo n't turn on reliably . Do a Google search on `` N800 wo n't turn on '' , to see all of the grief N800 users are having with this . It 's a known problem with the N800 , and Nokia wo n't do a thing about it . People are having to remove the batteries and even put it in a fridge to try to get it to work ! I have two - one I bought for myself and one I bought for my wife as a gift . Both have this problem . Once you turn it off , you ca n't get it to turn on again . Do n't buy an N800 until Nokia fixes the problem !
 I really wanted to like this device . A friend of mine had it , and when I saw that I could have a wireless Linux box in my pocket , I was sold . He had owned his for about 9 months and said he did n't have any issues with it , so I thought it would be a safe bet.Unfortunately , I had problems from day one . The battery life was very sketchy . I got nowhere near 3hrs of actual use . Also , I wanted to be able to use this device as my alarm clock , which did n't work very well , since the battery would die overnight . At one point , it looked like it was completely dead -- even after charging it for an hour it would not boot . Many hours later that day , I tried again and that time , it did boot up . Since then , it spontaneously rebooted on me at least twice . Sadly , I had to send it back to Amazon -LRB- still have n't gotten my credit yet . . -RRB- for a refund.What I was looking for was a highly reliable method of accessing important web-based content -LRB- including my calendar , contacts -RRB- at all times without having to lug around a laptop , and I was hoping this would fit the bill , but unfortunately it did not . From what I had read , it should have been a perfect fit for my needs , but instead was completely useless because of its flaws .
 The good : * Ordered last Saturday and received it today -LRB- the following Monday -RRB- for standard ground shipping * Wireless connection is very smooth . * Most websites are displayed properlyThe bad : * The right side of the screen display is distorted and darkened . Several previous owners had complained similar problems . * Youtube playing is chokey * Does not support google docs * Does not support Chinese * Sharp edges of the stylus is not comfortable to users.I am returning it to get a replacement ... . somewhat disappointed with the quality control of Nokia .
 Why did I get it ? 1 . To have the internet on the go , wherever Wi-fi is around .2 . Mobile Skype , wherever Wi-fi is around .3 . Read e-books and text files.So how does it work ? This thing is geeky . Pretty much a half-baked product . However , after owning it for 2 months and going through two OS versions and 2 firmware updates -LRB- now it on OS2008 , second firmware -RRB- , it is finally coming close to being a somewhat user-friendly device . Before that , there were regular hang-ups and other kinds of problems .1 . Internet works fine , rather fast . Supports all kinds of sites - Flash , Ajax included2 . Skype works well . However , the audio quality can have less hiss3 . Still only one e-book reader soft - fbreader . Pretty cumbersome to make it usable , but now after hours of tinkering this one works OK too with tap scrolling , capability to use landscape and portrait modes , etc.However , there 's one thing that 's not going to make this thing a keeper for me . Display quality ! All the geeks on the net were drooling about the resolution on this thing , being higher than iPhone , iPod Touch etc. . But the resolution is not all ! I think , the problem with N800 display is back-light . It 's not spread out evenly . Some portions of the screen is lighter than others . That 's why it 's hard on your eyes . Anyhow , a text looks a bit blurry . That 's a killer for me . I think it 's actually a systemic problem for Nokia . I saw n95 phone , which had the same problem . I can make comparison with the displays on iPod Touch and Palm TX . Ipod Touch may have a lower resolution , but , boy , how nice it is to read internet pages on that one . I ca n't wait till Apple loosens its tight grip on the software and people can create e-book readers for this thing . Palm TX has actually a pretty good display - not that bright as N800 , or iPod Touch , however I read some 100 books on it and had no problem at all . And both iPod Touch and Palm TX have smaller screens than N800 . Today , when you can see gorgeous Samsung screens on cheap $ 100 phones , it 's not acceptable for Nokia to save money on their displays . For $ 200 I paid for it , I still keep it till a something better comes around , then this brother goes straight to eBay .
 I purchased the Nokia N800 in December of 2007 . It is now January 18 , 2008 , and the Nokia N800 I just bought has been frozen for over 5 days now . I removed the battery and put it back and it 's still frozen . I drain the battery completely and it still is frozen . I ca n't flash it because it wo n't shut off . Every time it gets any charge it turns itself on and stays frozen on the Nokia Flash screen.I 've purchased a lot of products online . I am a web application developer specializing in VOIP and linux operating systems . I reeeeeeaaaaaaaaallllllylyyyyy liked the Nokia n800 when it was working . I could do all kinds of cool s ** t with it . It made managing my servers very easy . Ingenx web server , sqlite and mysql , php , SOAP I could make calls using my ippbx servers , execute backups , monitor my call center and more . This thing was the best device I had ever owned ... now the piece of s ** t wo n't start . I am so pissed off . I never write reviews because I usually just never get around to it . This thing has got me so mad I had to issue a review . I am going to put this review up on as many sites as I can . This is the most irritating experience . Nokia should be ashamed of themselves for putting out a linux os pda that crashes like this . I have all kinds of linux OS on small devices that I created and use . After you get use to building a custom linux OS for small devices , it becomes very difficult to f**k it up . Nokia , you rushed into putting this out to market . I do n't want my money back . You 'll never see a dime from me again.Peace !!!
 Sent it back for a refund . Very akward , too small to read , does not work well with my blackberry .
 When I bought the Nokia 800 I was looking forward to easy access to the internet -LRB- as they advertise -RRB- and was especially interested in being able to get video streaming from some websites I use frequently with my regular desktop PC which , by the way , is set up for wireless . What I found was that the 800 was not as easy and compatible as they claimed . Internet connections were intermittent and video streaming was non-existent . At one site I connected to , I was informed that I needed Windows Media 9 or better for video streaming . When I called Nokia Support they told me that the 800 does not have Windows Media and that if I downloaded it into the device , it could not handle Media Player 9 or better . I 'm not a technology whiz and maybe others with more experience could have a better outcome but for me , this product is a dud .
 I ordered this product from Amazon . I have used them before and trust this site . Unfortunately I noticed during check out that it was through a reseller Ritz Camera . It has been VERY difficult to get my money back from Ritz . In the end Amazon stepped in to save the day . But they should n't have had to.The product is ok , had a hard time finding and getting 3rd party software to work . I purchased a Ipod Touch instead.If you buy this DO NOT GO THROUGH RITZ CAMERA
 -LSB- ... -RSB- . before purchasing this device , i read the reviews here at amazon and was impressed , my experience was very different than others , though.i got my device and turned it on , carefully following the one page of documentation which accompanied the purchase . after charging , the device powered on and i attempted to connect it to my wifi router . it would not connect to the wep secured network , so i tried the free one . the device showed connected but no web page returned . after several frustrating tries , i finally got the device to agree that it had connected to my router . the router , however , did not recognize it.the device information on the network asserted it was connected and showed traffic sent , though none received . i thought it might be a wep problem , though the device also could not display the wifi network in the building which is accessed with a username and password . unfortunately , i did not have 24/7 to spend on this device , so a couple of days later i took it out into the world to see what other networks said was going on , all four of them gave the same frustrating feedback `` network problem '' and nothing else.i then decided that , perhaps , i needed the latest copy of the operating system , so downloaded the installation tool from nokia 's website . i tried to run it on my windows xp machine , but the tool would n't install the latest operating system on the n800 because my windows time had not been synched to a time server ! why is this an issue ? well , microsoft is trying to get control of everyone 's computer who is running windows , so they developed a tool which they called `` windows genuine advantage '' which requires that you register all of your personal information with microsoft as well as give them permission to get into your computer any time they want . do n't worry they wo n't ever , never , no matter what , share this information with anyone , ever . unless their policies change , or they really need to , or it is to their advantage some how to do so , or some other reason they may regard as sufficent in the future . i opted out of that bs a long time ago , but microsoft , in an effort to make everyone install this tool on their registered copy of windows , made certain updates to their operating system dependent on it , among them the one which implemented the latest silly daylight savings time changes -LRB- and you thought your congressman was doing it for your benefit -RRB- which is required before the time servers microsoft uses in their windows tool will synchronize your time , which is trivial anyway . i suspect , though i do not know , that this is a way that microsoft is going to attempt to force its customers to open their proprietary information to microsoft -LRB- who will never , ever , misuse it , honest -RRB- . Otherwise what could the author of this tool possibly have in mind to assure that the time on the host , not the n800 was synched ? and even on this device itself , why must the time be synched to update the operating system . -LRB- Do n't worry , if you have automatic updates on , your compuuter is already bearing its soul to microsoft , unless you specifically opted to not install it before you turned on automatic updates . oh , yeah , and unless you have windows vista . -RRB- updating your operating system on linux bypasses this.What , unlike me you do n't have several computers laying around your house running different operating systems ? if you can answer that question accurately '' no '' . the n800 device may not be for you.after crossing this hurdle , i finally got the operating system updated , but the problem still occurs . there is no real debug tool , like ipconfig , or one of the network tools commonly used to troubleshoot network difficulties , and the device itself has no relevant error messages `` network problem '' is n't all that informative , though , to be fair , it may be all that the device is able to understand about what is going on . given that it asserts it is using a `` link-local '' ip address , i suspsect there is some difficulty with the dhcp client either in the software or hardware , but with the deficient tools which came with this device , who could know ? right now i 'm probably going to return it for a refund , i have a really bad taste in my mouth with nokia over this one . -LRB- A previous experience several years back with a mobile phone was equally unrewarding -RRB- . Caveat emptor .
 The Nokia is a cool looking device with interesting software and UI ; though I kept wishing that it had a keyboard . I also had trouble using a BT phone for networking -LRB- even though I know the phone I used supports networking -RRB- . My biggest complaint is that I ca n't turn on this device on unless I first plug it into a charger . If I 'm not near a charger or plug , the device is a brick . The problem continued even after I updated it to the latest firmware . That 's a huge quality flaw that 's really unacceptable for a mobile device . Enter `` N800 wo n't power on '' into a search engine to find that this is a common problem and Nokia has n't been doing much of anything to address it .
 needed a small portable internet tablet , iPhone , iPod/T have way too small screens for passable browser use for anybody above 20 and they are all closed architecture . For those reasons I went with N800 . This plus Skype , GPS , SIP , etc.Looks-wise the device is OK , kind of uglish but passable . Screen should be LED or OLED not this 10 year old rather crappy technology . Easy to carry around compared to laptops but is not iPod of course . Solid plastic feel . The device is underpowered relative to its screen size , this shows quite badly with video . audio fine.Software is a major major problem here with a few exceptions
 I am a Linux nut . I have always wanted the N800 . Well I got it and what a major let down . First the screen has a wash out on the right side . That is all 3 units I tried . 2nd , using my blackberry , it was sooooo sloooooow , it was not worth using . The wifi was fine . But tooooo small to view . I really had a hard time trying to find a place to use the device . I have a blackberry and a treo and I could not see how it would fit in . The web browsing was too small to be of any real value . I could not get the blue tooth to connect to the treo . If you notice there was a major price drop on this unit as well , in some cases the price dropped almost $ 150 since last month . That makes it more useful . However , if you have internet access thru your cell , or you have a wifi , pocket pc . I would forget the N800 . It is neat to try . It would not replace a laptop . It is too slow to use on ATT edge service . It is too small to read the web without zooming the pages . Linux is the future as far as I am concerned . I would wait for future versions . This unit is not very expensive any longer . However , it is hard to recommend it , since it really does not do anything really well . The camera is really poor . I did download all the add ons , however , it really was just a major let down . I paid $ 235 for mine , so I am returning it . I really wish I could find a reason to keep it , but I ca n't
 First of all , if you do n't have regular access to WIFI -LRB- or a Bluetooth phone , though I understand this is fiddely -RRB- , do n't bother buying this device . Out of the box , it is basically a portable web browser and nothing else.Second , the instructions which come with the device are a joke . One foldout sheet -LRB- how to install the battery ... -RRB- , and a large book of what looks like generic cautions , warnings , and required regulatory messages in multiple languages -LRB- the stuff you do n't need -RRB- . There is a PDF available online though.Third , after doing several Google searches , I came up with a few `` hints '' about software available . Perhaps there is a whole hidden internet only available through the device.A few nitpicking issues .1 -RRB- the `` external '' SD card slot is not spring loaded . I had to use a knife to get the SD card out . So much for using the device as a high-res photo viewer to view pictures just taken with a digital camera .2 -RRB- the instructions did n't even mention the internal SD card , but you have to take the battery out to get to that slot .3 -RRB- the `` pen '' keyboard is at best awkward . It does try to `` guess '' what you are typing , perhaps saving you a few pen strokes . The `` finger '' keyboad takes up most of the screen , and you have to switch between letters and numbers -LRB- and the spacebar is n't available on the number keyboard -RRB- . The handwriting recognition seems to work well with well formed letters . This is not a tool for writing the Great American Novel , or even composing a non-trivial email , unless you have all the time in the world to hunt and peck .4 -RRB- You have a choice of USB connection -LRB- the sd card -LRB- s -RRB- appears as drive -LRB- s -RRB- -RRB- or interaction with the device , not both at once . I wish there was some way to to do `` USB networking '' , but there is n't . Transferring data to the device is as slow as transferring data to any flash media .5 -RRB- Very noticable start-up lag . This is not an instant-on device.On the pluses , I downloaded some web pages to the SD card and they looked beautiful . The type is small and readable , and pictures look great !! When I turned it on , it found several WIFI channels in the area - unfortunately none available to me.If you have WIFI and are looking for a portable web browser , it 's a great choice . With the right software -LRB- and perhaps an external keyboard -RRB- , this could be a great PDA , even perhaps a laptop replacement . For now , it 's a very expensive web browser .
 I really wanted to like this . Its Flash and Opera browser allow me to log onto sites like my bank account and watch vids like on YouTube that I simply can not do on my Windows Mobile 5 phone . I love the ability to stream Rhapsody , the maipulation of web pages -LRB- full screen and zoom -RRB- plus the handling of pdfs . BUT I can only enjoy these perks ... at HOME where it connects to my wi-fi service . Outside of home it just will not conect to anything , nothing.It will not use my cell phone 's modem successfully -LRB- HTC 8525/AT & T ; network -RRB- , and it connects to open wi-fi networks but when I try to go open a web page , it gives me a network connection error -LRB- red dot that turns green remains red -RRB- . So basically , it 's a tease to me . I love the idea of traveling with this instead of popping open my -LSB- ... -RSB- Mac , especially in certain places . But due to it 's lack of ability to connect and no maemo -LRB- very un-user friendly -RRB- solutions , it 's plain useless . I plan to return it .
 First , the good news
 This item arrived DOA after initial Charge . The replacement also did not start after initial charge . I was able to get it to start after removing the battery for 5 hours . Then it worked great until I powered down , then the same problem . I could not get the update software to find the device even though windows Xp found and gave it a drive designation . I thought upgrading the OS system would fix the power problem . Nokia support could not help , I was told to send the unit in for warranty repair . When it was working for the short time it was promising . Maybe just a bad batch , I think I 'll order the N810 instead and cross my fingers .
 I Very disappointed whith this speakers I blowup all croosover , tweeters , do yourself a favor DO N'T SPENT A DIME ON THIS CRAP , LOOK FOR A GOOD PAIR YAMAHA NS-1000M AND YOULL BE HAPPY FOREVER
 The speakers carry mid and high range fairly well , however , they lack a serious bottom end . If you are looking for strong low range , look elsewhere .
 Bought for a 5.5 G iPod Video . Loose fit . Included spacers did not allow a fit at all . Sound quality was muffled and staticky , regardless of which radio station I used -LRB- I tried ALL of them -RRB- .
 Live in Denver , CO area . Signal was n't strong enough to broadcast anything in one car . The other car it came through but had so much static it was unlistenable . Returned it in a heartbeat .
 This is a neat device and works quite well . DO NOT BUY ONE FOR AN 8GIG 5th GENERATION iPod . YOU WILL HAVE TO EXTENSIVELY MODIFY IT TO FIT . Well , Mrs. Lincoln , other than the shooting , how was the play ? Also , iLuv is snotty about it not fitting . It took hours to cut the slot bigger , knock off the two tabs , then measure and epoxy the holder to the unit in the proper position . iLuv could easily make an inexpensive adapter ! It works fine now , however.UPDATE
 It did n't last as long as I thought and was n't as sturdy as I would like . I would n't recommend this transmitter because the light on the digital setting blew . The end that plugs into the cigarette lighter was not tight . I need something with a little more quality .
 Clunky , awkward , touchy and full of static . That pretty much sums it up . I had to contort it into a weird angle to keep it out of the way of the gear shift , particularly since if you tap on it in any way it disconnects and takes forever to connect again . A bump in the road will disconnect , a wayward breeze will disconnect . There is no auto scan so you are on your own finding a station and out of all of them not a one was without static . It comes with a hard extender to give you more space , but this only worsens the disconnect feature as now there is more open air for your ipod to bounce around in .
 I have a the 2nd generation iPod and it does n't fit well for those . The older iPods are much smaller so it did n't stay in the connection . Whenever I hit a bump in the road , the iPod would come loose and I would have to hold it to hear my music .
 I got this as a Christmas present and used it 6-8 times and then it just stopped working after only one month . It was working fine and then just shut off .
 I originally bought the iLuv transmitter over others because the transmitter ran off the iPod 's battery and was n't solely reliant on the car 's electrical system to be used . Since my car currently has an issue with the electrical system -LRB- the lighter/plugs do n't work -RRB- I pretty much wasted my money buying this new version since it can not be powered off the iPod itself . I do n't know why iLuv changed what I considered a unique and useful part of their product to be just like everyone else , but I am thoroughly disappointed to have wasted 34 bucks on it .
 I had this for my iPhone for about a year . It died about 4 months ago . Needless to say I do n't understand why it does n't work anymore but there 's no way I 'm buying another one .
 When I received the product I noticed on the package it said for iphone 3 and 3S and ipod touch . No where does it mention this in the description . It 's probably good for the older models of iphones that it fits -LRB- do they sell them anymore ? -RRB- , but seemed a bit overpriced for fitting 3 and 3S models which are very outdated.They should state the models that it is for .
 . Having read other reviews of the iluv , I figured , under $ 40 , it 's worth a try . It does work but the sound quality is terrible . My advice is , buy a hardwired adapter kit or wait until you have a car with the capability to directly plug in an ipod or other mp3 player .
 I bought the iLuv 4 months ago , and at this time it does n't work at all !!! when I bought it was completely happy with it , it worked perfectly.But when the time passed by , with the ipod weight it became too loose and it 's goes both ways when the car turns left or right , so I got ta drive and adjust it in every turn.Now it does n't even goes on , it does n't work at all !
 I bought this transmitter thinking it was similar to my old one that I had which unfortunately broke after MUCH use . This transmitter was terrible . It never held the transmission . Very frustrating and disappointing . Luckily I saved the packaging and returned it .
 i will preface this review by saying that I purchased this after reading the reviews nearly all related products available on Amazon and chose this because of the relatively high score . In the end , I am compelled to give this one star , which I rarely do . While it is a nice , simple , intuitive design , if you have an iPod Touch or iPhone , I would recommend you stay away ; unless you only drive on the smoothest of smooth roads , this product will drive you nuts . And yes , I did use the proper little adapter pad for the iPod Touch . Some Pros and Cons for your consideration : PROS : - Nice looking unit - Two adapters -LRB- short and long -RRB- so you can connect to almost any 12V socket and clear your dashboard - Easy to set your stations - Two presets , which you will need if you move areas much - Sound quality is just fine in most cases . Although , please read my CONS section for more discussion.CONS : - Very sensitive to road bumps if using an iPod Touch or iPhone . Do n't know about smaller units as I have n't tried them . - Basically what happens is a minor bump will cause the iPod to rock in the cradle , making it momentarily lose contact . When this happens , the iPod realizes it lost contact with the unit and pauses playback . - Rate of disconnect is frustrating . On a trip from Ames , IA to Minneapolis , MN on I-35 , we literally could only get through one , maybe two songs before it would disconnect and pause . Then you would have to keep pushing play to get it to restart -LRB- taking your eyes off the road in the process -RRB- . Sometimes , you would have to push the unit back down slightly . - Sometimes when you hit a small bump , it does n't disconnect all the way , but enough to lose one of the two speakers , or to get really muffled sounding . You would then have to push it down to reconnect it . - As a result , I found myself driving with one hand on the wheel and one on the unit trying to stifle the wiggling.CONCLUSIONS : - This product is really close to being a nice one but not there yet . - If you have one already , I have found using a rubberband to hold the iPod to the cradle seems to help as it is the forward-backward bouncing that is the main culprit . - I travel a lot and have not found many roads this will work on unmodified . As a result , I 've used it twice and retired it . - I do think that they could improve this with something like front hooks that would hold down the unit , but right now they do n't have that . - I would say purchase with caution ... and only if you can spare $ 30 - $ 40 to experiment on your roads .
 I purchased this item for my daughters birthday . Unfortunately , it does not work . Actually it does function for producing white noise . It would not connect and broadcast her ipod touch at all . It did , for some reason , broadcast my ipod nano , however , it only worked when I had my hand over it . Otherwise , major static . There may be many reasons why it worked so poorly . Some may not even be as a result of the product itself . Each car is going to be different for sure but the performance was so poor I ca n't imagine it being acceptable at any point . Yet , several people gave this a very good rating ... Hmmm ... Anyway , buyer beware ... and thank goodness for free returns !!
 Worked nicely for 8 months then failed . Warranty period for parts is one year , warranty period for labor 90 days . Bottom line it 's e-waste .
 It was working well for about 2 weeks and the . It just overheated and now it wo n't even power on . Waste of money .
 This product appears to be a great idea and a simple solution for using my ipod in the car . It was simple to set up and use . The sound quality is pretty good too . However , after use for a week or so , the unit has failed , requiring the replacement of the fuse three times so far .
 I bought this product when I first got my iphone and it has so many issues , phone doesnt fit properly in this . Im afraid that phone may fell down or the battery connector inside phone may get spoiled as the phone bends . I stopped using this after 1 week .
 I was excited about purchasing it since the sound is really good . However , it was broken after 2 days ... really disappointed !
 This thing did n't work . I did n't return it or anything because it was cheap as hell and I want to take it apart sometime . It did n't work at all , even with different cables.These switches do n't work at all , actually . I got two different ones at a store and neither one worked without fuzz all over the screen .
 Even though some customers complained , I ordered one and took a chance because it was so cheap . Mine was DOA -LRB- no right audio channel -RRB- . But here 's the story
 Item did not function and was of very poor quality . I went to Radio shack and purchased a much better one .
 I got it a Few days ago i tried it with a Wii PS3 and a 360 the Color comes through fine but a White flicker across the whole screen making the device unusable and i have n't even got to the sound yet the sound does n't work on any of the 3 channels . Im not sure what the first reviewer was on but the Isolation is horrid . Im really no surprised for $ 5 i really get what you pay for . The only thing i can say is the company does ship their products with haste i got it before i expected it , thats all i can say that was good .
 I bought this switch in order to connect my cable box -LRB- RCA connectors -RRB- and DVD -LRB- also RCA connectors -RRB- to my TV -LRB- ditto RCA -RRB- . It works well - except I had some issues with the connectors becoming loose - to the point I had to tape the connectors . This device would probably be good if you intend to connect once , and just use the on-board switch to select between your input devices . I repeatedly attached headphones to the output so I could listen to my TV without disturbing my wife -LRB- just in case you intend to use headphones - suggest trying a different switch - which I have not found yet to replace this one : -RRB-
 The AV cables had cheap plugs and only 2 of the 3 Inputs worked . Not impressed . Ca n't recommend this product .
 Tried a bunch of different RCA leads same result , faded picture and horizontal lines , watchable but pretty bad . It 's cheap , I guess thats why .
 Although these cables give you a lot of options , the spring-loaded storage discs are rather poor in quality . Getting the cables to retract fully takes several minutes and a lot of tinkering . This would be an invaluable tool overall if they just used a higher quality wind-up device .
 This goes down as one of the worst products that I have ever purchased . To call it retractable is a joke . The concept of the product is great . The casing of the cables looks great but the functionality was a big disappointment . I could pull the cables out but the cheap retraction mechanism would never allow the cables to go back into the case . Do n't waste your time with this one as you will end up returning it as I did .
 Very poor quality . Wires seems easily breakable and there are pointy edges on the earphones , which almost cut me when I tried them . Definitely would not trust this brand/manufacturer at all .
 This kit is the single worst quality product of anything that I have ever bought tech related . The first gentle pull of the cable broke or jammed the retract mechanism so now I have a thin usb cable with a big piece of plastic in the middle . The plastic that houses the mechanism even splits apart just extending the cable . The connectors are convenient , as is the case , but the retract mechanism and casing are laughably bad . I have bought foreign made knockoffs of many items that had higher quality than these . I am normally very hard to irritate , but man these irritate me . This kit is NOT recommended .
 I used to spend 65 % of my time on the road all over the USA and the world . I needed more retractable cables to carry on trips as some of mine were wearing out . I purchased this on sale many years ago and frankly I never used them . I did n't use them because the quality was so poor that I did n't want to waste my time carrying the kit 12,000 miles only to have the cables break or not work . The quality is very poor as the retractors are just poorly designed and flimsy . The wires are very thin and easily broken . The only thing of value in the set was the zip up case . I included a photograph of the set that is 10 years old and never used.Don ' t waste your time and money ; pick up something of better quality !
 The product is as described but the only thing that would fit was the side pieces . There was no place to mount the bracket to the radio . Rather than start over just taped it to radio and mounted the screws . Seems to be holding soo far .
 The anti skip in this and the cd4610 are very poor you hit a slite bump it will skip un like better systems and you can get these much cheaper around52 .00 if you look on line .
 The camera takes very good pictures , but the overall size makes it cumbersome to carry around . In the two years I 've owned it , I brought it with me less than I would 've for a smaller camera with worse optics . On hikes it is pretty much impossible to bring along because it 's too big to fit in some day packs.And after only having this camera for two years and using it sparingly , it will not work now because the camera electronics will not fully charge the battery . Purchased replacement batteries , which are specific to this camera , but these will not fully charge either . For the price of the camera quality control should be significantly higher , buy a Canon , or something that will let you use standard sized -LRB- AA , etc. -RRB- batteries at least , instead .
 Summary
 I bought this camera for my daughter for her to take pictures of the kids and send them to me . She recently moved 1,000 miles away.I wanted for her to have a reliable camera . The camera came with the wrong battery but she thought that it was the old battery and needed replacement . She wanted to take pictures right away so she searched around the city and found a charger but that battery still did not work.She finally purchased another battery on line for the camera and when it arrived it was a different battery . The camera was sold with the wrong battery.I emailed the seller and we came up with an adjusted price . He was going to make an adjustment in my Amazon account but I am not sure if it has happened yet.My daughter is very happy with the camera . I feel bad that she had to run around so much to mqke a gift work .
 Before I tell you about the problem I had with this camera , let me explain something about myself -LRB- this is important because if I was reading the review I 'm about to write without knowing about the author , I 'd think the author must be some kind of a nut case ; this camera has been reviewed so positively that I ca n't believe what I 'm about to tell you myself -RRB- . First , before getting involved in digital photography , I was a successful amateur photographer with an old Pentax manual SLR camera . I understand what terms like shutter-priority and aperture-priority mean . Also , after the old Pentax , I 've been successfully using an Olympus C-3030 digital camera for 4 years now . This is the camera I 'm trying to replace because I want a more powerful zoom . So I do have experience with digital cameras . And finally , I work in a technical field , so I 'm good with computers and other technical products . OK , enough about myself . Let 's discuss the camera.I ca n't believe how unreliably the DX7590 achieves proper focus ! The camera gives me the green bracket indicator letting me know that it thinks it has focused on the subject , but at least 50 % of the time , it 's wrong ! Sometimes it 's so far out of focus that I can see it on the display before I take the picture . Sometimes it looks in focus on the display so I 'll take the picture , only to discover that the shot is out of focus when I review the picture later.I get the same result regardless of how zoomed in/out I am ; what PASM mode I use ; what focus mode I use -LRB- there are three focus modes , none of which is manual focus -RRB- ; or what shutter speed is used.Believing that I must have received a lemon , I returned the first DX7590 to Amazon for an exchange . After all , a camera that has received such positive reviews CA N'T have a problem with a fundamental function like focus , right?Wrong ! The second DX7590 behaved exactly the same way ! So now I 'm sending the camera back to Amazon for a refund , and am starting my research over again to see what I should buy instead.Good luck to you if you buy the DX7590 . No , you do n't need new glasses . It 's the camera that 's out of focus!NOTE on 1/19/2005
 I love the pictures this thing takes . Some of them look like they were taken by professionals for national geographic . But they were just pictures of my cat.But I have a HUGE problem with the PC interface . You have to use Kodak 's software to transfer to a PC . With my olympus , I just hooked in the USB cable , went to My Computer , found the camera , then dragged and dropped the photos where I wanted them . No large programs to load , no creating albums , no setting default options , etc. . Just drag and drop using the windows explorer interface . The so called `` easy `` share software wo n't allow that.So I find myself using my old olympus , because after all , I 'm just taking pictures of my cat .
 Kodak products are defective and Kodak consumer advocates that Kodak provides for consumers is a joke they are not for the buyer but are for the corporation to appear that they try to help the average consumer . I will not being buying Kodak I am finished . They are awful with customers .
 I bought this as a replacement radiator to an old set of speakers . What I was unaware of was that this item has a downward facing lip which adds to the size . To get this to fit I will have to carve about 1mm around the opening . Even then the radiator will be resting on this lip instead of flat against the case.On a side note ; shipping cost half of the price of the item and came very slowly . Overall very disappointed with this product .
 Bought this so-called boombox and after a few months it would not play MP3 CD 's or even regular store-bought audio CD 's . When I insert a CD the display says `` no '' . Sound quality is average and the bass boost - well you might need extra sensitive hearing to tell the difference.Only thing that works on this set is the USB flash drive player and the radio.Could do with a clock.Set only shows the number of the song being played . No tags.Don ' t waste your money buying this !!!!
 I got one of these awhile back and been having trouble ever since . More then 80 % of the time it wo n't read my CD or a CD with mp3 's on it . So as a last resort I put in a usb flash drive . Well it reads the small drive like a 256 mega bytes but it ca n't read my 2 gig flash drive . I bought this machine for work so I wanted a long playing device but forget it . I hate it .
 After reading the other reviews all I need to put down is : First week it played my mp3 cd-r just fine .2 nd week noticed it took longer to load up directory .3 rd week it wo n't play any cd-r/rw disks -LRB- mp3 or cd-da -RRB- and it has problems with store bought cd 's . Someone said you get what you pay for , actually a $ 20 mp3 player hooked up to speakers would be alot better than this ... and it would show you the name of the track your playing.This is junk , dont buy it . On top of that they do n't say what the limits are on the media your trying to play -LRB- memory size , max # of tracks , etc -RRB- ,
 I was extremely disappointed in the quality of this product . The sound from the speakers was of very poor quality and I returned the product to Amazon . I am however very much pleased with the way the return was handled by Amazon . Very professional and quite satisfying .
 We ordered this item excited about its ability to play MP3 and standard CD 's . Right out of the box it skipped on the first CD we played , but we were able to get it to play fine if we carefully inserted the CD . Now , two months later every CD skips and we are frustrated since we ca n't return it . We do n't know if this is a fault of every unit , but it was our frustrating experience and suggests there may be a quality control problem .
 I have bought this player 4 month ago and it died recently . I was very careful and played my MP3 cds just few times . Dont waste your money , dont buy it .
 If you just want to copy your images from your CF cards and later to you computer it is good . Battery life is short , you ca n't copy 25gb on one charge ... Nikon does not support your copying files from your PC to it.Does not even what to hear about copying files from your Mac to it.They do not support files retouched from ANY application , ever Nikon Editor.Only wants you to : Copy images from your CF Card to it and off to your computer.Reformatting your CF Cards.Reviewing images taken off your cards.It is not ment to be used as a image storage device or to use for a portable digital portfolio . I use my Photo iPod for that ... Try giving the consumer what they want Nikon .
 I purchased this item with a hi-res camera , and it was a lifesaver on long shoots . The ability to back up my images immediately gave me real peace of mind , and the thing really worked as advertised . Although it would freeze every now and then , I never lost any images -- the only drawback was that you had to remove the battery to restart it , as it stopped responding to all button inputs.This morining , as I was preparing for a 5-day shoot , I turned it on to delete any old images and recharge it , and the screen was completely dead . Plugged into my PC via USB , it all still shows up , but I was totally depending on it for this upcoming weekend , and I have been totally let down . I have no choice but to try to navigate it in the dark , unless they want to overnight one to my hotel .
 I was anxious to buy a CoolWalker as soon as they came out . Having bought a new D-100 I could hardly wait to get out and take a zillion pictures . I did buy one and really wish I had not . It is extremely sloooow ! Better stick to a 1GB card because the batteries wo n't make it through a 2GB card . Give up on playback - it is just too slow to be worthwhile at all . Oh yes , forget payback through the TV as it is supposed to do - the pictures look terrible on a standard TV and are very slow to load . Audience will die waiting for the next picture . All in all - it has been a terrible experience . I did solve my problem - I bought an iPod and it works just as advertised . Now I ca n't even seem to be able to give away the CoolWalker . Best offer I 've had was $ 50 . Nikon should stick with what they do well - make cameras . Love my camera , but their software sucks as does the not very cool CoolWalker .
 When I put this on my car visor , it was visually distracting and made me feel claustrophobic ! Having 30 CDs hanging over my head is just not a good idea . I tried to give it to my husband , but he thought the same thing , and got a smaller one that holds 10 CDs . Much better .
 The packaging was bad . This seemed like old stock.I did not open it and sent it for a return as I was not sure if this was genuineThe Vendor was XTRA Mile Sales . They were kind to do a quick refund after they received the product.Owing to this experience ... I would not buy any products from XTRA Mile SalesI have had very good luck with most amazon vendors . . this was different.Finally I bought the CD Player from SOnyStyle ... and it was cheaper . .
 the product worked when I first received it , and when I tried a few days later I could n't get it to operate . Was going on vacation and did n't have time to see if I could return it , but was unhappy I did n't have it for my trip .
 I bought this to replace my old Panasonic SL-SX430 that after years on the road finally broke . The SL-SX430 had a battery life of up to 85 hours on two AA batteries ! It never skipped , played all of the MP3 CD discs I burned at home , and was all around a great player for the $ 50 I paid for it back in 2003 . I could not find another one of these to replace my broken one.I settled on this Sony because I could n't find many CD players that have MP3 playback anymore . I guess everyone just uses stand-alone MP3 players . Anyway the package did n't advertise the battery life , which turns out to be only 11 hours for an audio CD and 23 hours for MP3 playback . The player also skips or freezes the audio frequently if the disc has the slightest scratch or fingerprint . My old panasonic would play my severely scratched-up discs flawlessly.The sound quality is OK . No complaints here.If you have never owned a CD-MP3 player before , you may think that this one is just fine . Personally I just hate replacing an item with something of lesser quality .
 impossibly small buttons and tiny lcd.you 'll need a magnifying glass for any adjustments.barely any metal to it -- which makes it light as a feather -- and probably as durablehandle with care !
 Okay , ive had an HP , Kodak , and Canon camera in my past . All were low budget decent quality cameras . Canon and Kodak excelled at colors while the HP one actually came free with a printer and did a decent job , although it was nothing spectacular.This camera on the otherhand , is HORRIBLE . Dont be fooled by all the options that olympus throws in , like the `` scene '' modes . Most are novelty and some are just horrible . The indoor scene mode makes the shutter speed slow down to a ridiculous degree where you have to sit there and hold the camera motionless for a solid 10 sec after pressing the button just to get a somewhat blurry , oversaturated picture . Also , this camera is NOT compact . It is about 1.5 in thick with the screen folded . Thats actually pretty thick ifyou compare it to other compact cameras on the market now.The flash
 I have probably spent 50-60 hours trying to convert my digital movies recorded on this camera to dvd . I am not technically-savvy , so I expected to spend some time , but this is ridiculous . I finally got the imagemixer software -LRB- included on the Olympus Master disc -RRB- to burn a dvd , but the sound is just a high pitched squeak at the beginning of each clip . So irritating . I tried converting the quick time movies into mpeg-4 using cucusoft and burning a disc with nero express 6 , but the quality was so poor , I did n't even bother to burn the dvd.As a still camera , this is fine . It 's my first digital , and I have been happy with my photos . I like the larger than usual LCD . I also like the ability to close the LCD and drop the camera in my purse .
 I got this camera for free with miles that were going to expire . Compared to what is out there , it is huge ! I do like the folding viewer as it wo n't get scratched , but now a days you can buy the plastic covers for the viewers to avoid that.Needless to say , I 'm still using it on vacations and will only buy a new one when this dies or breaks .
 If it would have worked I am sure I would have enjoyed it . But it did n't . = -LRB-
 The good
 this 670 had a deffective battery , which was discovered the second time we used it . No support over the weekend , so 4 days of the trip required maps only , purchased at a filling station , WORTHLESS . Then a 2 hour hold and 30 minutes with the tech to get a Return Authorization . I must pay to return a new DOA $ 500 GPS , and await a repair or replacement . Secondly I purchased this unit because of the pre-loaded European Maps , HOWEVER the loaded maps are outdated but new ones will be sent to me AT NO CHARGE in 4 to 6 weeks . Third the window mount is pitiful , will not hold and the unit constantly fall off , luckily into my wife 's hands . One day it will hit something and then the screen will break and that is the end . Fourth can not change destination while using . You must exit GPS add address and then re-boot . Krazy and very bad !!! Garmin must be just too good at selling , because there is absolutely no company in today 's fast paced World that will survive with this lack of speedy resolution to a NEW & DOA product failure . Garmin charges for everything . The city guides installed are minimal and you must purchase detailed ones AT ADDITIONAL COST . The GPS chip costs about $ 1 the 670 had 2 GB of internal memory $ 5 so what are the outdated maps and minimal city guides really worth . I have used a co-pilot with mu Sony laptop for years great European maps detailed city etc. . Garmin is now my very expensive and worthless dash decoration .
 Garmin n&uuml;vi 670 4.3-Inch Widescreen Bluetooth Portable GPS NavigatorMy nuvi 670 works beautifully in the USA but a nuvi 360 would work just as well for half the money . I purchased the 670 for a three-week vacation to England last summer . The 670 failed miserably.As soon as I received the 670 , I ordered the free update CD with European maps and loaded them on my Garmin . I thought I was all set.Then I went to google maps and preloaded many locations , including hotels where we would be staying.Our first dissapointments came during our arrival in London . Leaving our hotel on foot , I set the Garmin for walking and selected a destination that was nine-tenths of a mile away . The Garmin identified its location but did not show any streets . We got a taxi . I thought , oh well , it 's not set for cities but will be ok on the highway.I also had to reset Garmin 's clock to local time . There are many European cities listed but none in the United Kingdom . There are a few in the continent , but London is not there . So my garmin was set an hour off.We hired a car and set out for Braintree . The Garmin was confused right off the bat . It was no help , constantly `` recalculating . '' We kept stopping and asking people for directions to the highway leading to Stansted where we found signs that led us to our destination.At Braintree , we purchased a map.To make a long story short , the nuvi 670 never worked . I had many destinations preloaded . The garmin would recognize the distance and direction , but was unable to show most roads . If we were on major highways like the M4 , the road would appear on the garmin , but our car would look to be floating to the left or right of it , as though we were the Starship Enterprise . And then , as we drove , the voice would start ... recalculating ... recalculating ... recalculating ... driving us nuts , to the point that I would have to turn it off . My Garmin was bewildered . We were lost.It is difficult to drive in England and I had such high hopes to make efficient use of my driving time . But no , we were often ... Lost in England ... and the Garmin was no help.While the Garmin was helpless in giving directions , it was indespensible in an unexpected way . England is loaded with speed cameras . They are on major highways and in small villages . There are warning signs posted but it is easy to speed through before you realize it . The garmin was a lifesaver -LRB- or I should say , a money saver -RRB- . Every time we approached a speed camera , the nuvi warned us . At $ 50 a speeding ticket , I 'm sure it saved me hundreds of dollars . Some of you may be asking why I think I saved money because after leaving the country , how would the authorities get anyone to pay speeding fines . Well , I did not always have the garmin turned on ... and you guessed it . I received a letter from Avis , informing me that my credit card would be charged $ 50 + for a speeding ticket . -LRB- It 's in the rental agreement -RRB- So if you want a GPS to warn you about speed cameras in England , get a Garmin . But if you want a GPS to provide directions , you 'd better look at Tom Tom or some other brand . My experience suggests that Garmin does not have the mapping platform for the United Kingdon.I 'm not surprised that the nuvi 670 has been discontinued . It did not perform as it should . Perhaps it works better on the European continent , I do n't know . But if you take a nuvi 670 to England , before you head out for your destination , I 'd suggest that you purchase a good road map .
 I have been loyal to Garmin for over 12 years but now I am beginning to think elsewhere . I docked half mark for poor layout . In previous Garmin products , you could choose how much and the type of information displayed . On this model , you can only display two and Garmin decides what those will be . On my regular trips to and from work , I do not need the map but I do like the traffic transponder . However , traffic alerts can only de displayed on the map and not the other displays and so these minor gripes go on.I docked a second half mark for the announcement of the next turn off . More often than not , the distance to the next turn is not to a turn at all but as you approach the turn , it advises you to carry on down the road you are on . This renders the displayed information of little value . More frustratingly , it does not tell you that it is not a turn until after you have moved into the lane anticipating it . The most serious implication is that at a complex junction the Garmin will instruct you not to turn for the first exit and then announce a real turn almost as you are on top of it . Not only does this mean you have to move back out of the first exit lane but you need to make quick decision for the real approach . This can lead to you being a nuisance to other road users.Finally , I docked two marks for Garmin stopping users uploading bought mapping to the computer . Most people are aware that a drawback of current GPSes is that they can take you through the middle of a town rather than the route around it . They can send you down routes that are n't roads at all . They can take you off the interstate at one exit only to bring you back on at the next . A real danger is that they can take you on roads that are inappropriate for drivers that are not prepared . To guard against this I check the route out on the computer first but with the Nuvi , Garmin expect you to do it on the screen . It is impractical to check out a route turn by turn for a long trip on such a small screen without a mouse and without doing so will lead to nonesenses and occasionally danger ... Garmin will of course sell you a second map for your computer and that would require four maps one for each region for both the GPS and the PC.One last wine . Garmin do not tell you that you have to update both map areas independently and you need a separate , expensive traffic receiver for the second map area .

 I bought a new Nuvi 670 on July 29 , 2008 . Today , August 12,2008 I happened upon a notice that said the Nuvi 670 was discontinued . I 'm rather upset with the news . Nowhere was the discontinued status mentioned . How long will Garmin support the unit ? I understand that products do have a lifetime , but it should have been stated in the Amazon blurb .
 Man , what a disappointment ! The Nuvi 660/670 is a beautiful device - a sleek design with an excellent screen , and great position accuracy . Since this is our second Garmin -LRB- we currently own a Quest -RRB- , we were mainly interested in a GPS device with an up to date US & European point of interest -LRB- POI -RRB- database . The Nuvi 670 seemed to fit the bill perfectly given its large POI database.But this is exactly where the device failed . We tried more than 25 POIs in Atlanta , GA where we 're currently based . The 670 was unable to successfully guide us to a single POI correctly . We tried various well known shops that have been around for at least 5 years , e.g. Publix , Toys-R-Us , Wal-Mart -LRB- including a Wal-Mart Superstore that has been around for 10 years -RRB- , Target , Barnes & Nobles , etc. . Either it did not know that the shop existed , or it guided us to a non-existent shop . The same applied to fuel stations.If we provided it with an address it worked like a dream and the accuracy was great . But the POI database proved to be totally useless . Fortunately Amazon 's after sale support is brilliant and they allowed us to return the Nuvi 670 . Oh yes , Garmin has no after hour support ...
 I purhcased the nuvi 670 from Amazon several weeks ago and I was hapy with the unit until I checked to see if there were map updates avaialable from Garmin . Garmin 's website stated that map updates were available for Europe and North America , but only one update was free . So I spent all this money on a International GPS unit only to end up with one map being out of date . When I received the unit it had a 2006 maps for Europe and 2008 maps fo North America . There were updated versions of both maps available , but I would have to pay for one of them - the cheap one costing close to $ 70USD . I contacted Garmin on several different occasions and they stood by their policy of only offering one free map update . What a disappointment with this supposively good company . You buy a GPS and it does n't even come with the latest maps . I am very disappointed.Ron
 I am stationioned in England and bought the 670 just for the US/Euro map combo . While here , I have traveled much though the country and mainland Europe only to do so taking back roads . The speed camera thing for me worked , but it wo n't take me on the highways !!! I keep getting told `` at round a bout , take 2nd exit ... '' or the like . NEVER staying on the highways . Does it do this for the states as well?Garmin folks told me to plug in detour to the highways . Well , it 'll only let me use one , then it wants to replace the previous.This thing does suck ! It 's great for navigating throughout the system iteself and all it 's options , but sucks navigating the roads , where it counts .
 I looked at all the Nuvi models . Unless you love gadgets and can deal with complicated add-ons there is no reason to buy anything more expensive than the Nuvi 650 . No blue tooth , no crappy MSN and no FM radio -LRB- how stupid -RRB- . The 650 's processor , GPS receiver , screen , case & battery are IDENTICALL to all of the more expensive Nuvi 6XX series.Hey I love gadgets folks but we are not helping the people who read these reviews for some common sense answers to basic questions if we do not point out which models for basic functionality.Originally I even questioned the larger 4.2 '' screen - Why ?
 Terrible Mac support ... Mac 's must use Internet Exlorer to access many links ... unavailabe after January 31 , 2006 , according to my research ...
 My second Garmin and the second to fail within a year or just after . Garmin wo n't repair without paying them . Go with Magellan
 You will not get this.I ordered one and received a `` ca n't ship to your address '' excuse.BAIT and SWITCH.BEWARE !!!
 We took the GPS to Germany and Italy and we ended up buying a map . the GPS had NO reception 90 % of the time and one of the roads it suggested taking -LRB- after we set it on fastest way -RRB- once it did work ended up taking 1 hour longer than the rout we found on the map . Over all it was a very BAD experience especially since this is one of the most expensive ones on the market . Maybe it works better in the US .
 I have had no problems with this impressive device but experienced considerable frustration with Garmin support in obtaining appropriate map updates . Ordered in late May 2008 it came with old maps . Although new updates for the US and European maps were initially promised by phone when I registered it with Garmin , only the soon to be outdated European map was eventually received . Several hours and several calls to support yielded entirely different and conflicting answers to why I was n't going to get new updates . Eventually , one helpful support person agreed to take the risk in sending the previously promised updated US map for which I am anxiously awaiting receipt . The soon to be released updated European map for my month old devise will have to be purchased . So , if you want a devise with updated maps I suggest you hold off on ordering this model regardless of what Garmin may tell you . I personally believe a newly purchased devise should come with a hassle-free guarantee of free updates on a more liberal basis than Garmin appears to offer .
 I was ready to purchase a Garmin 670 on Amazon . The 670 has both European and USA maps . After reading customers reviews regarding the maps not being current on this item , and the hassle Garmin is giving customers , I decided to call Amazon 's tech assistance . The customer rep was very knowledgeable and courteous , and confirmed that the 670 comes with outdated maps and you will have to call Garmin to get EITHER a free USA map update or a Europe update not both . Garmin will charge around 169.00 for the European map update . The usa update is around 69.00 . This confirms many of the feedback comments on Amazon 's site for this product . Sadly the customer comments about Garmin 's customer service not being up to par is also true . I guess to avoid the hassle its probabaly better to find a local retailer and check the item in the store before you buy it .
 I bought my Nuvi to take to Europe , which I did . The problems outweighed the joys by far . I was disappointed with the following . 1 . Many streets in Rome , Florence and Paris -LRB- 3 major European cities -RRB- were absent and not on the map . Also , many restaurants were not included in the section on Places to Eat . 2 . Most of the time it took `` forever '' to contact the sattelite . I would stand in a Piazza waiting for up to 10 minutes for the transponder to connect with a sattelite so I could begin a search . 3 . The batter was impractically short lived and could only be recharged in a car or in an electric socket . 4 . I never knew which direction I was going in . There is no compass function which would tell me the way to my route.I think the major problem here was that I was always on foot when I used this GPS . Even though I set it to the pedestrian setting , it tried to take me on streets that were appropriate for vehical travel . For a walker , I found this to be a total bust and a waste of money . I returned it when I got back to the U.S. and Amazon gave me a refund . Bravo to Amazon but thumbs down to Garmin . They need to do better .
 While the product works it came with outdated mapping software . They want $ 70 to update . It is only a week old I should not have to pay for an update . The battery is non-replaceable so call this thing disposable after it stops taking a charge . A lot of money for something you throw away . I paid extra for Bluetooth now find out it is not compatible with all phones . I think when the battery dies I will take the $ 70 and buy one their competitors . Hopefully they will have better customer service.Update - They told me to return the Europe software and they would send me the US disc . I sent it to them unopened by certified mail over 2 months ago and they have done nothing . So now I do n't have either . Would like to give Garmin Customer support zero stars . - Another update . After another email to Garmin with the tracking document attached they finally sent me the US update , 4 months later . If I had n't pestered them I still would n't have it . They have done nothing to improve my opinion of them .
 We paid $ 470 for this product just over two years ago . We do n't have a car so have used it perhaps 3 times a year when on vacation in the US or Europe . On a recent road trip we discovered that only the bottom right of the screen now acknowledges you touching it and the only function it has is to lock or unlock the screen . Seemed great when we got it but we would have expected it to last longer .
 I 've had my Nuvi 670 since they first came out - it was very expensive at the time , so I expected a lot from it.I was dissapointed to find that the traffic info was subscription based - and at a rip off price at that.I was also dissapointed that the maps seemed to be out of date right from the get go , and they expected me to PAY for new ones !! RX sensitivity never seemed to be as good as my older Garmin units or the Pioneer AVIC unit I installed in one of my other cars . Slight overcast skys or clouds seemed to kill the GPS satellite reception.The internal battery crapped out on me in less than a year . It lasts for about a minute before shutting off these days.I tried to nav from San Jose to an address in Petaluma today . No joy . The audio kept going into distortion and then cutting out completely . After a while , it stopped giving me any audible directions at all . No amount of powering off/on made any difference - the thing is toast . Of course , there 's no warranty on it any more ... Overall , I 'm not a happy customer . Will seriously look elsewhere -LRB- i.e. not Garmin -RRB- for my next unit . All in all , I feel like I wasted a grand on this one . Better luck next time .
 The headset broke before I could even plug it into my iPod.Very poor quality .
 This item seemed to charge successfully . I received the package just before leaving town for a few weeks , so I just tried the charger to make sure that it worked.I tried the batteries just today , a few weeks later , after having to recharge them -LRB- it appears that the charge does n't keep -RRB- and tried them in my mini-disc player . They did n't work . My player has a battery-life reader , and it said they were nearly empty before it died . I tried another pair in a remote , and they seemed to work , but I had bought the whole set specifically to use with the mini-disc player . I 've never heard of a battery that works with one item and not another -LRB- I tried using fresh regular batteries in the mini-disc and they worked fine -RRB- . I also noticed today that I received the BU-200 model , which is not the one I ordered . They do n't even advertise that one on this website . So , buyer beware ! If you intend to use the batteries for a specific purpose , you might be out of luck with this model .
 You have an advertisement to use the Olympus B-50SU 4 AA NiMH Batteries and charger with the DSC-U10 camera . The DSC-U10 camera uses AAA batteries not AA . Do you have a AAA NiMH battery and charger for the DSC-U10 camera ??? I guess I can use the B-50SU charger for other things that need AA batteries . Please correct your advertisement .
 While Amazon advertises this item as `` good for high drain devices '' , be aware
 Rayovac has a one hour charger with 4 independeent charge circuits -LRB- can cahrge unqually used batteries or uneven capacities without over/under charging some of theM -RRB- -RRB- for the same price as this -LRB- w / batteries -RRB- . GP has 2000mah batteries . These batteriees are 1700mah . Acessories that I 've had interest in that has olympus brand is 50 % more expensive than generic brands of the same quality . Olympus has great cameras . Buy the accesories from another brand , cheapeer , higher quality . Oh yeah this is a dumb charger also . That means batteries get overcharged and that substantially reduces their life . You can buy rapid -LRB- 4-5 hrs charge time -RRB- , dumb chargers for -LSB- $ $ $ -RSB-
 This radio did not cost much , and did not provide very good service . The tuner was poor , it always drifted off station . The reception was weak as well .
 I bought this radio because my last one that I bought in 6 dollars from walmart was broken from its antena and now it could play channels but there was static most of the time . I was too excited about new radio . I got my radio yesterday and it was biggest disapointment for me . This radio had more static than the broken one I had . none of SW cannel is working they are there just for show . None of these channels is clear enough that you can understand something . I will suggest either get some radio that can only work with AM/FM but have clear sound or spend more money and get something that works
 Well it had to happen eventually . Someone would put together some pieces from the current-generation dirt-cheap bin of radio components , slap a digital frequency counter on it , and presto , a world band radio with digital display for twelve bucks . Enter the JX-M14 . And it 's an idea whose time has come - needle-and-dial tuning might have been cool in the early 20th century , but in the early 21st , with hundreds of broadcasts spread over a dozen different bands , it just does n't fly . Ask anyone who 's tried to find a specific shortwave frequency on an dial-tuned radio , it 's frustrating . This is the crux of the little JWin ; you can sit down with a list of shortwave programming , tune to a frequency , and -LRB- conditions permitting -RRB- there it is.Granted , it 's still a twelve dollar radio . Using the whip antenna alone produces the same results as any other inexpensive radio you 've ever used . But here 's a little secret unique to the JX-M14 - it handles a LARGE antenna with ease . Hooking up a rooftop mounted antenna by means of a loose wire connected to the antenna 's coaxial cable , I could listen to Vatican Radio and Voice of Iran way out here in SoCal . Very impressive.The unit has it 's foibles . It always selects the FM band by default when turned on , so if you plan on using it as a travel alarm clock , you 'd better like FM . And you might be a little late - the clock is usually a few minutes slow by battery changing time . The small speaker can be remarkably loud when turned up , but it reproduces the fingernails-on-chalkboard high-pitched whistles and whines from distant stations and interference more notably than any other portable radio I 've owned . The small inset tuning wheel is unusually stiff , enough so that comfortable long-term listening is pretty much out of the question.But the big sore spot against it , the one that , for me , sent it from the five-star blessing to the two-star curse , is that after several months of average everyday use , the band selector switch has become worn and loose . Apparently how well the tuner holds a frequency is determined by the switch position , so that once it becomes eroded , the result is bizarre random drifting and very vague spot-on tuning . Enough so that tuning is impossible and the radio is unuseable.So here 's two stars for the features and the idea of a very inexpensive world band radio with a digital readout . An idea JWin -LRB- or someone else -RRB- can do better the second time around .
 RADIO HAS GOOD SOUND HOWEVER THE ON/OFF SLIDE SWITCH DOES NOT OPERATE SO IN ORDER TO TURN THE RADIO ON AND OFF YOU MUST REMOVE THE BATTERIES . THIS IS VERY TROBLESOME AND NOT VERY GOOD . POOR DESIGN THE SWITCH SHOULD HAVE BEEN A MORE DURABLE TYPE OF SWITCH .
 I had my unit for a year and the plastic hinge broke.I recommend getting and using the optional leather carrying case at all times because it helps protect the hinge somewhat . My hinge broke after a day I was carrying around my gps unit but did n't have my leather case with me.However I think the hinge started getting more loose after about 9 months of use because the flip cover started falling off my pda occaisionaly after about 9 months of use.Even when using the leather case you 'll still want to use the flip cover . The leather case is softer and if you do n't have the flip cover on inside the case there a good chace your unit 's on button will get pressed on inside your pocket and the pda battery will get drained . The flip case is more rigid and it helps prevent the on button from accidently getting turned on while you are carring the pda inside the leather case .
 The plastic mounting device that secures the leather flip cover to the M5 is very poorly engineered . I purchased my M5 in January and this mounting device has already broken . I am seriously considering replacing it with some other protective device .
 The plastic hinge mount on the cover that I bought to replace the broken plastic hinge mount on the cover that came with my Ique M5 has now broken . I will now buy another and try to reinforce the hinge before it breaks again.Garmin 010-10567-07 Leather Flip Cover for iQue M5
 It would not stay tied to the bottom of my seat , so just flapped around and looked messy . I used it for a few weeks and finally took it out . I have a 2012 Kia soul , would not recommend for seats like mine .
 Ordered this product for my son . It was broken out of the box . It had a short to the volume button so you can only hear the sound if you put your head directly to the speaker . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 This product claims to be dual voltage , but it fried as soon as I plugged it in -LRB- we live overseas -RRB- . We would have had to pay to return this defective product , and so it was n't worth the bother . I will never order any products made by this brand again !
 Connections were loose inside ... so had to take cover off and inspect since it did n't come on after plugging in.Not as pictured . Foot is plastic not metal . Tires are thin and not substantial ... toy like junk.Didn ' t inspire that keeping this was going to go well . Returned it the next day.Bought a Sears Craftsman . Quality was better and it worked without fiddling or hasseling around .
 Two chargers arrived with major dents on the bottom -LRB- see pictures I posted -RRB- . Schumacher ships them without adequate protective packaging . It may be a good charger if you can get an undamaged unit . I 'm waiting for the third one now.Update
 Seemed okay at first . Very handy with nice features . Then the current indicator failed . Then the timer eventually failed so it would n't shut off automatically . Then it did n't seem to charge very well so I checked the voltage and it was putting out much less than 12 volts . Maybe that 's operation normal but does n't make sense to me .
 My unit arrived with the top section forced down as if it had been dropped whilst upside down and the edges had been buckled slightly . Since the Unit came shipped in excellent packaging with no indication of shipping abuse , I can only deduce the that manufacture has poor quality control or simply choose to send out the unit damaged in this way . On using the equipment , I experienced similar issues to other reviewers . I found that the unit 's charge measurement rated poorly as follows ; 8.43 v at 2amps , 9.89 v at 10 amps and 12.23 v at 40 amps . The starter mechanism seems to function perfectly well but the internal fan does not work which limits my charge times to 10 min intervals to allow the unit to cool . I would hope this unit was just part of a bad batch as others seem to be experiencing good results but I 'm inclined to believe that based on my initial findings , this unit will be up for return .
 I 've used this battery backup for less then a year and it no longer works . When the power goes off , so does everything plugged into this Tripp Lite battery backup . THEN the battery backup kicks in and starts beeping . Real useful . Total waste of money and could ruin your expensive computer equipment when you think that you are being protected from power surges and outages .
 This unit failed 2 months after purchase . The surge protected side lost power and would not reset . I tried to get it replaced but got no response . So I replaced it with a more expensive brand known for it 's reliability -LRB- ATP -RRB- .
 I bought this UPS back in May 2010 . I had owned an APS UPS previously whose battery died after a few years , and had heard of Tripp-Lite 's good reputation . Unfortunately , I do n't know if I have a `` dud '' but it has lost power while the computer was turned `` on '' several times . I bought this UPS for the sole reason to avoid power outages while my new $ 2000 iMac is turned on and this thing is actually causing them . I 'm in the process of contacting Amazon regarding a replacement . I must assume that this is an anomaly , so I 'll try to post a followup regarding the replacement unit .
 My office received four units . All units failed at the first power outage . The APC units worked fine , as usual.The Tripp Lite battery back up is a complete waste of money . You are better off connecting directly to the outlet and saving your money . If that is not an option -LRB- likely the case -RRB- buy an APC . If the price is 2x or 3x that of the Tripp Lite , there is a reason why .
 I purchased 4 of the 1000VA models , one did not even start out of the box and out of the other three , two lasted less than 6 months prior to going pop and smoke . Forget warranties , if you want to spend several hours arguing on the phone , good luck . I eventual replace the first one but took almost 2 months the rest were n't worth . They worked fine , but so did a Yugo car !
 I am a new owner of a Nikon 8400 camera -LRB- a great item , by the way -RRB- . I like the MB-CP10 Battery Pack for taking vertical photos . It adds body and convenience to the camera . However , I was disappointed to find out that it is not a supplemental battery . The user must either use the camera battery OR the CP-10 . So , if you are using this item for taking vertical pictures ... understand that you will only be using the `` AA '' batteries , which burn up pretty fast .
 Battery pack , but frankly it 's a bit too pricey . And appears it would clumbersome to use . Especially in the horizontal position as the viewfinder is in lower postion . Anyway , the whole idea is to have more power available vs the battery pack which comes with the camera.Just make sure you buy NiMH 2300-2000 AA batteries.Great concept , but a bit too expensive , Nikon needs to price it more like in the $ 75 dollar price range , but consider extra battery packs cost only $ 42 , well . You can see my point of view.You can buy alot of battery packs for $ 170 bucks.If you get one of these , make sure you post a review and what type of photography you do .
 When you receive the item there is a LONG list of devices that may be damaged when used including anything with built-in rechargable batteries such as shavers , drills , flashlights etc. . Made me questions it 's use for laptops and cellphone since they have rechargers built in . It also may damage anything with speed controls or fans . It 's also not for use with portable heaters or microwaves . That pretty much eliminates anything in my home with the exception of lights and the tv . However , backup system worked properly and without interruption when power cord disconnected . However , when unplugged and in backup mode the LED indicator always displayed a 100 % charge and 0 % Watt usage regardless of how many units were plugged into the device . I charged a cell phone for 10 minutes and upon plugging the unit back in to recharge it indicated the unit was at 80 % capacity but recharged quickly to 100 % . I think the unit is functioned properly as a backup but it has faulty LED indicators for battery level and Watt usage . The LED indicator lights did not work when in backup mode . I called customer service and and the number in the users manual is not a working number . This unit is HEAVY and definitely for stationary and not portable use . Definitely check the long list of devices that may be damaged before purchasing this unit .
 I 've had this UPS for about a year now , and it has become practically useless now . . Let me explain : At first it worked pretty good . I would be able to connect a 22 '' TV , DVD and a small table top fan and run them for about 1.5 hours.Recently , the batteries die out in an instant , no matter how long I leave it charging.If I connect only the small fan -LRB- Which consumes only 40watts according to the LED -RRB- , in about 30 mins the UPS starts beeping indicating an E01 error . After a minute or so , it shuts down.If I disconnect the fan , and turn it on , the LED says its at 100 % charge ... ! Yet if I connect anything to it again , it starts beeping and shuts down in a couple of minutes!Furthermore , if I connect it to the wall outlet , it indicates it 's charging from 90 % , and it reached FUL in a few minutes ... ! What gives ??? If it 's at full capacity , why the heck is it shutting down ?? Seems to me that the batteries are faulty and are not retaining charge.I 'll also note that this is my second Powersource 400 , since the first one died out in a couple of months . During a power failure , it just shut down and would not turn back on . Even when connected to a working outlet.Steer clear from this faulty product . At $ 300 + you can find much better products out there.P.S . And to make it worse , the online tech support at the website actually CHARGES you for any question you may have ... ! $ 35 dollars a pop mind you ! Bravo Xantex ... You give new meaning to `` Thieves in suits '' .
 Fantastic unit , with a fatal flaw . Even when plugged in to 110v , the unit often -LRB- more than once per day -RRB- believes there 's no power , and goes into battery mode . Sometimes , it recovers after a few minutes . Other time , it drains its whole battery , and turns off ! As a result , the unit has drastically lowered the reliability of power availability - precisely the opposite of what it is intended to do.I bought two of these units from Amazon , and will return them . I have since bought an APC XS-1500 which has less features , but works like a charm.I spoke to Xantrex technical support , but they had no solution other than `` sorry , please return them and try to get another one from a different batch date '' . Mine say they were built May 7 2007 .
 I have a number of Xantrex products and have found them to be good quality . I can not say the same for thier product support . I have a Powersource 1800 that shorted out . It is less than 2 years old -LRB- 20 months -RRB- . It is out of warranty . I am willing to pay to have it repaired . They will NOT repair it or sell parts for it . The best they will do is sell me another unit at 30 % off list . I was informed by customer suppoer that they do not repair products that are out of warranty . So beware buying Xantrex -LRB- aka Scnieider Electric -RRB- , Durucell branded Xantrex products , and APC -LRB- a Schneider Electric company -RRB- . Once they are out of warranty , if something happens to the you can throw them in the trash heap .
 I am going to buy one of these on eBay tonight , and right now it is only ay $ 66 ! Too bad for you suckers who paid full price for one !
 I purchased this camcorder/digital camera in May 2002 and found that it takes excellent video , is easy to use , and seemed to be a good value . Unfortunately my good first impression came to an end . Despite every trick known to a computer geek and following Panasonic 's instructions to the letter , I can not get the camera to `` talk '' to my PC . Therefore the digital camera function is worthless to me now . Panasonic 's product literature states the Windows 95/98/Me / 2000 OS is required . I am using Windows XP . So I went to Panasonic 's website to download the newest iteration of the software but that did n't solve the problem . I called Panasonic 's customer service and despite numerous busy signals , finally reached a rep who was basically clueless . It might be the cable , but I do n't want to buy a new one . I 'd really like Panasonic to solve the problem !
 After I charged up the battery and attached it to the camcorder , turned it to camera and it was stuck in pause mode , could n't figure out how to work the camcorder even with the instructions , I notified the seller and she promised she would get back to me after she looked into it . Still have n't heard from her . Now I am out money and still in need of a camcorder that works without breaking the bank . Total frustration from my end . Ugh !!!
 man I feal sorry for the one who got theres for $ 66.00 i would hav given mine to him mine broke the same day i got it , and wal * mart wouldent give me a re-found becou i threw away the box and stuff...........................OVER-ALL , this cam , is dead wieght . I boght it to film skateing with me and my friends , and it F# $ % ed up the same day I was the damn laghing stalk for the day . so ... . take my advise and get the -LCB- Samsung Hi8 &#153; Camcorder - SAM SCL906 -RCB- for $ 299.00 at circut city or www.circutcity.com
 These filters are very poorly made.Out of the two that I ordered one needed to be re-soldered internally and the other disassembled and reassembled because the case improperly put together.I recommend going with the more expensive filters.Anything around ten bucks is usually pretty good.Dont try to save money by giving yourself this headache.It also did not help whatsoever with the noise on my CB from my trucks fuel pump .
 After installing this PS my systems suffered constant random shutdowns . System would not power back up until briefly removing AC from the PS . From what I 've read this appears to be an ongoing problem with the Antec NEO HE series for at least a couple years . It is evidently still not fixed.Returned and ordered the Corsair HX520 instead .
 I purchased one of these last year and although I ca n't complain about the quality of the picture , the service from Panasonic leaves a whole lot to be desired.My camcorder was accidently bumped about 8 months after I purchased it which caused the deck assembly and loading assembly to become unworkable . Even though the fault was mine , Panasonic does n't seem to want you to have their products repaired , they would rather you buy another one , as the repair technician stated to me . The parts cost more than the camcorder did new.Needless to say I will never buy another Panasonic product again and neither will my friends and family .
 I purchased this model in March 2002 and in May 2003 - it just quit working ! I thought the battery had run out - recharged it - nothing ! Bought a new battery - still nothing . All it 'll do now is make a click noise when you switch to camera or vcr . Cant even get my tape out of the damn thing now ! Call Panasonic - what a joke ! They wanted $ 149.00 for a diagnostic test and $ 102.00 service charge - I only paid about $ 300 for it new . I 'll never buy another panasonic again - the service was terrible and they are not helpful AT ALL ! Good luck if you buy one - get the extended warranty ! They should sell them for $ 50.00 and just make them disposable !
 I had this hooked up with digital cable . I tried going through the regular cable line and S-video . Going through the regular cable line resulted in an awfully grainy screen . Going through S-video did n't make it any less grainy , but it completely washed out the color of the signal . All the whites on the screen took over the other colors . Do not go with this card .
 Amazon now -LRB- 4/26/07 -RRB- has this linked with the Canon HV20 Camcorder , both as a `` buy these togather '' and listing this in the accessories section under the HV20.Everything I see , including Canon web site and email from Canon support , is that this is incorrect . The HV20 needs the BP-2L14 not a BP-214 . -LRB- The longterm solution is for Canon to be more sensible with their part numbers . -RRB- But for now I suggest anyone research this before going for Amazon 's suggestion for this for an HV20 .
 I bought this to power my pellet stove in case of power outage . Well the power went out , I connected it to this unit and it only ran about 1 1/2 hours and the battery was dead ! The power unit was plugged in and charging for over a week before I needed to use it . So much for &#34; running for 50hrs &#34; as stated in the description ...
 Bought the unit to run 4 strings of christmas lights that adorned an outdoor craft fair booth . Lights drew 400 watts -LRB- seemed OK as unit was advertised as having a 600 watt inverter -RRB- , however , unit only lasted 3 minutes before the internal alarm sounded -- even after recommended 35-hour first charge . Even using only one string of lights -LRB- 100 watts -RRB- , the battery only lasted approximately 10 minutes before the alarm sounded . Too bad - this seemed like such a good idea for quiet , long lasting outdoor power .
 I purchased this power pack for the purpose of powering my flash strobes outside when electricity is not available . It does not power my strobes . I plug one in and and turn it on . The strobe display just flashes on and off . I have a 40.00 power pack that works great for my strobes . I am not sure if I got a defective one or it will not work for the strobes , but I am not taking any chances , so I am returning it .
 I bought this a little less than 2 year ago , and used it once a year . It worked fine when I first bought it , but after that it would not hold a charge . After 6 months warranty is ineffective . This last time I plugged in a string of LED lights with less than 5 watts , and it lasted for 7 min . completely worthless product .
 The digital readout does n't work , and the machine wo n't hold a charge . The company wo n't repair or replace . I bought this for my father-in-law for Christmas , and it was a waste of money . Unfortunately , he did n't try it out until after the 90-day return period .
 I was disapointed . I had hoped it would hold a charge for a lot longer , but it did n't . I used this in a craft booth to light 4 strings of Christmas lights and a tree . It only lasted about 4 - 5 hours . When the battery began to run low , it `` Buzzed '' really loud.I wish I had picked the bigger one .
 I bought this , with the hope that it would be able to jump start my car if needed . I had been having some battery problems , so I bought this . I charged it as the directions indicated in the User 's Guide directed , then I checked it and it displayed 100 % full . I needed to jump my battery and I followed the directions in the User Guide , and it would not work . The light came on on the powerpack , BUT it would not jump start my car . I returned it , and will try another one . I might have gotten a defective unit , and I realize that , but I will not be buying another one of these from Xantrex .
 I had an old Xantrex which I had for 3 years and used a number of times . The jack from the a/c plug corroded and would n't charge anymore . I figured maybe it was because I left it plugged in all the time . I bought this one in Oct 2007 and never used it except to see if the features were working . Now when it is plugged in the alarm keeps ringing all the time.I never should have come back for seconds . I see Sears has a die hard one.I am going to look into it . At least Sears backs their products .
 Mine lasted about 6 months . It reads 100 and does n't hold a charge . I was using it every day and one day ... well . . it would n't run my laptop , even thought it said it was fully charged . Looking at the other reviews , I think I would 've done better buying something else . In fact , I 'm going to buy the Black and Decker and chunk this .
 My Xantrex XPower Powerpack 600 Heavy Duty is not good for an emergency . It is an emergency . The unit does not hold a charge . It takes days to fully charge and loses its charge by 10 % each day.Xantrex customer service has not been helpful other than to say that I should charge it through my car cigarette lighter.I ask , what should I do charge it all the time . Thats the only way their will be any power when you need it ... I bought this item to help if I have a problem ... It is the problem .
 I purchased this item to be used at tradeshows and was very disappointed with the outcome . The item was supposed to power a flourescent light for 23 hours and the alarm went off at only 3 . I wouldnt buy this item again .
 I bought this a little less than 1 year ago , and used it occassionally , for emergency power . It worked fine when it worked , but this last time I pulled it out it was totally dead , and would n't charge . I contacted the company and they would n't replace it as they say the warranty is only 6 months . Amazon website says 1 year . I would n't buy another Xantrex product based on this lousy warranty / service ...
 I have owned this for about 4 months and have had to send in 2 . On the first , the readout did n't work , then on the second , the charger died after using it once . The readout does n't work on the third , but I figured what 's the use ? I tried calling xantrex to see why there are so many problems , but getting their customer service is impossible . When it works , it 's great , but does n't have nearly the operating time that it says . Also , the radio might as well not even be there since the reception is so bad with the battery working . Amazon is great in exchanging this , however , and I give them 5 stars .
 I used my 600HD only a few times before the display stopped working . It was never subjected to water or anything out of the ordinary.The foreigner I just got off the phone with tells me there is no way to fix this.I 'm sorry , but why would Xantrex sell high tech products that can not be repaired ?
 Beware ! Per the product brochure , this unit will only support 600watts for 5 minutes . It only has a 480watt constant rating !
 I 've had this product for about a year . The readout that tells you how much charge is left never worked!When I first got the product , the readout did n't seem to work according to the directions , but it took me some use to figure out it did n't work properly . I could find out how much charge was left , but it did n't display the info as the directions stated . The item is so heavy and bulky , I decided not to bother returning it and just live with the inconvenience ... Now , after three or four camping trips worth of use , the readout does n't work at all ! There 's no way to find out how much charge the unit has remaining . I just have to find out when it dies . Not very convenient at all .
 I have a number of Xantrex products and have found them to be good quality . I can not say the same for thier product support . I have a Powersource 1800 that shorted out . It is less than 2 years old -LRB- 20 months -RRB- . It is out of warranty . I am willing to pay to have it repaired . They will NOT repair it or sell parts for it . The best they will do is sell me another unit at 30 % off list . I was informed by customer suppoer that they do not repair products that are out of warranty . So beware buying Xantrex -LRB- aka Scnieider Electric -RRB- , Durucell branded Xantrex products , and APC -LRB- a Schneider Electric company -RRB- . Once they are out of warranty , if something happens to the you can throw them in the trash heap .
 Worked great when first received and was used less than 20 hours total . Unit died within days after warranty expired . Contacted manufacturer and was told they are not repairable but offered to sell me another one for the same price .
 I purchased this to jump remote vehicles and as a power source for short term power outages . Unit worked fine the first months and then summer came and did n't need it until the next fall . Unit worked a few times and then refused to take a charge . This seems to be a problem with this type of unit so first thing I would do is look at the warranty . If it is less then a year I would be suspicious . Some have a two year warranty . I would also suggest looking at the manuals on line , some like one Sears unit requires you to turn on a switch to enable the usb port . Strange thing is that this switch also turns on the jumper cables which I find a safety issue . Especially since the 12volt ports are hot all the time . Why not the usb ? Also the Xantrex units radio was a laugh . Overall a great idea but could n't deliver .
 I purchased it primarily as a jumpstarter for my classic VW ... and secondarily as a backup power sourse in case of hurricane etc. . It may work well for the latter - but after getting it , charging it for 3 days , and trying to jump my car - it would barely turn it over and was dead after 3 tries . Back to a $ 75 Battery Charger/Jump Starter for me .
 worked great the 3 times I used it but after a week long trip it refused to recharge so now a great paperweight but very pricy for the 3 times I used itsadly it just out of warrety
 The XPower 600HD digital display will show me power consumption in watts when AC appliances are being run from the outlets , but it has never shown me the battery charge level percentage as described in the manual . So I would describe the display functionality as `` half broken '' . The run time I 'm getting from the AC outlets is pretty dismal . My 50-watt incandescent light bulb should have run for 5 to 6 hours but lasted only 2.5 hours before the XPower 600HD buzzer sounded indicating low battery voltage . I shut it down for 30-minutes then got an additional 15-minutes of power for my 50-watt light bulb before it started buzzing again.I fully charged the unit for two days before I ran my test . I then ran the same test three or four times with at least 24-hours of charging before each test.Sure the XPower 600HD pretty much does what it 's supposed to but it does n't even come close to meeting the specs set forth in the Owner 's Guide . Running a 50-watt bulb for only 2.5 hours is unacceptable . A digital display that is `` half broken '' is unacceptable.Be sure to test yours . You might be disappointed .
 I have this about 14 months ... Over the last 14 months I used this about 4 times ... Now it will not recharge ... COMPLETE KRAP !!! Do NOT buy this brand ...
 This batter backup has been charging for days however can not hold enough charge to even let a laptop run for 30 minutes . Very disappointed in this purchase .
 Do n't waste your money on this . I 've had mine for a year , taken good care of it , and yet it will only power ONE fan for 30 minutes . I tried my coffee maker
 I have nothing but trouble with the battery company that sent the power pack 600HD . I have never been able to charge it because of a defective charger . They can not send me a replacement because they do not have one . They want me to pay full postage to send back the defective charger . They offered me a choice of replacement or junk and refund . I chose junk and refund since it is impossible to send such a heavy thing back at my cost . I bought this in August and have not received a refund , am being charged with interest , and have a $ 325 item I can not use . When I called &#34; Mark &#34; he told me I was unreasonable to talk to and to call back when I calmed down . HELP . I only want to charge what I think would be a good battery to take camping or stop charging me and calling me unreasonable .
 If you do need power in an emergency , avoid Xantrex products . While it 's possibly true that the first charge requires a long time , mine has been at it for a couple of days and still does n't work . I 'll try another few days and then I will consign it to it 's proper disposal . There are many other backup power units available on the Web , so avoid the hassle and the very short Xantrex warranty ...
 I only used this product on -LRB- 2 -RRB- ocassions , when it shorted out . Tried to find the to 40 amp fuses but no luck . Got very aggrivated and tossed the entire unit in the garbage .
 Before I even attempted to charge the unit , I removed one of the plastic covers on a plugin to inspect the plugin . To my amazement , the unit -- THIS IS BEFORE CHARGING , REMEMBER -- sparked , crackled and smoked . Hoping that this had n't permanently damaged my purchase , I charged the unit for a couple of days , following the instructions to the letter . The charge light came on -- alternately blinking and continuous for various periods of time -- and I thought I was OK , despite the fact that the % - charged indicator did n't work.When the unit had been charged for the required time , I tried it out by plugging in my coffee pot to brew a pot using power from the Xantrex . Nothing . No power . No coffee . I tried all of the plugins . The ALARM , however -- which is supposed to come on when the unit is low on charge -- DID come on . I unplugged the coffee pot and turned the unit off . The alarm STAYED ON . It continued to sound whether the unit was in the off position or in the on . It 's still sounding two weeks later from its home in the dumpster -LRB- the trash company guy was spooked and would n't haul it away -- I 'll probably have to pay someone who sells batteries to dispose of it properly -RRB- . I ca n't even send the thing back to get a refund . What parcel delivery service is going to accept a box that makes piercing alarm noises ? Nice racket .
 BOUGHT THIS AND ONLY USED IT TWICE . I FIRST TRIED TO PLUG MY LAPTOP INTO IT WHILE DEER HUNTING AND IT WOULD ONLY LAST AN HOUR . SHOULD HAVE RETURNED IT THEN , BUT LIKE A FOOL , I KEPT IT . SINCE THEN IT HAS BEEN PLUGGED IN JUST WAITING TO BE USED AGAIN . AS THE RUMORS GET HOTTER FOR AN EMP ATTACK FROM IRAN , I HAVE BEEN GETTING THINGS IN ORDER JUST IN CASE THIS EVENT SHOULD HAPPEN . SO , I TOOK THE POWERPACK AND ONCE AGAIN HAD NO LUCK WITH IT EXCEPT ONE THING ; THE LIGHT WILL WORK FOR A LONG TIME PLUS THE RADIO WORKS BUT THAT 'S IT . CONTACTED SELLER TO TO IF HE -LRB- GENE -RRB- HAD ANY RECOMMENDATIONS BUT NO REPLY BACK . I CAN THINK OF OTHER THINGS I WOULD RATHER WASTE MY MONEY ON LIKE THINGS THAT WORK . WITH THAT SAID-BUYER BEWARE !
 The item indicates free shipping but when you try to check out , that option is not available and attempts to charge 55 dollars -LRB- Alaska -RRB- . So do n't use one click checkout unless you do n't mind paying shipping .
 Kinda odd that the sales price is almost half what other resellers are charging , and that a search on Nextag says its a refurb .
 From the way it looks and all the features it promises , the Xantrex Powerpack 600 appears to be a well thought-out design . However looks and features can be deceiving ! My Powerpack lasted less than nine months from the day of purchase . It became completely dead and there was no way to recharge the battery after a couple of initial uses . I had bought many items on Amazon before but I had never been disappointed until I bought this Xantrex PowerPack . Sadly , it was a big waste of money .
 Wo n't hold a charge , out of warranty and I was put on infinite hold when I called in . Will never buy a Duracell/xantrex/Schneider product again - this is an incredibly expensive boat anchor now .
 In March , 2012 I purchased A Xantrex 600 Powerpack that is discontinued and I was not told that it was so . Finding parts is nearly impossible !
 I charged this battery for 2 days when first I bought it and tested it with a few small items ... like the night light and small electronics . It worked !! I put the battery in my car for a road emergency . 3 weeks later when I need to jumpstart a friend 's car , it did not have the power . I checked the power and it was zero . I went home and charged it until it showed 100 % . 2 Days later , I checked the power and it was zero.NOW the battery would not recharge . The power was at 0 level but I could turn on the radio and emergency light so I turned them on to drain the power hoping I could recharge the battery . 5 days later the light and radio stopped and it still would not recharge.I passed the 30-day return policy so I could not return it back ! THIS IS A PIECE OF JUNK !!
 On the first of these units I ordered , the display for the clock/radio unit did n't work . I returned it and Amazon sent me another one . On the second unit I received , the power meter was broken . It would display 0 watts no matter what was plugged into the inverter . The display function button also would n't toggle the display , so the battery charge % never showed . I am currently waiting for my third unit to arrive.Why did Amazon even start selling this lousy product ? The quality control over at Xantrex is clearly dismal , if not nonexistant . One bad product I can believe was a slip-up , but two in a row suggests that their manufacturing process needs to be reexamined.Save yourself a headache and buy a power pack from a different manufacturer .
 Bought this for the occasional power cut and for the hurricane season . Worked well initially but the ac adapter failed within one month . It was replaced under the warranty but the second ac adapter has also failed . This units is just not the quality I was expecting . . huge disappointment.Gave in and bought another Ac adapter outside the warranty period so ended up throwing good money after bad , since the item lit up and appeared to be charging , but still will not work after 24 hours of charging !!! No more Xantrex for me ...
 I had the Xantrex Powersource 1800 and it worked ok for 6 months then would n't charge so I returned it . I decided I needed a battery backup so I purchased the Xantrex Powerpack 600 and just out of the box it would n't charge or light up the LED light indicating it was trying to charge . I thought it might be the power cord so I got a new power cord and it still would n't charge . I starting to feel that Xantrex does n't Test their products before they distribute them . I would rate it zero stars but one star is for Amazon and their return policy .
 I have had the vgn-s260p since 2005 and 2 days ago the motherboard went bad . I read forums and found out that this model and other models have a common problem with the motherboard and video going bad . I confirmed the problem by calling sony customer support and even though it is a common problem sony will not fix my laptop without having to pay a $ 700 repair cost.After this incident i am never buying a Sony product again .
 I actually own it for the last 18 months and the fan is vary noisy
 This cheap plastic step-up ring is poor quality . It does not stay on the lens well , and it wants to cross-thread easily because the threads are too shallow . It pops off the lens easily if bumped , and does not hold filters well . It is best to avoid this ring and find a better brand preferably made of metal.I gave this item two stars because it works , it just does n't work very well .
 I spent time installing this - had to remove the CPU cooler and reinstall it ... and it completely failed to work ! I called Antec and they mentioned a compatibility problem with 965 boards -LRB- which I was using -RRB- and this PS . Supposedly I had a `` fixed '' unit though , but it failed to work . Going back to the old PS -LRB- an Antec SmartPower -RRB- worked without a problem .
 This Power Supply cant run in a asus boards , and many intel 965 boards ... and in other because the anemic +5 v and +3.3 v 17A and 23A , and today the power needed is minimun 25A and 35 A in this rails . Dont buy , at less you have a pentium 2 or pentium 3 because in my other system with AMD 3000 + venice , 1gb ram and mx 440 the pc shutdown randomly and i only work in word , internet and itunes ... it dont provide enough power ... fake PS i dont read before the review of this PS because ANTEC is the big name in power supply and my current PS is an ANTEC SP350 and have a lot more power in the +3.3 v and +5 v. . . this antec neo HE go directly in the garbage and lost my USD 95 but i never , ever buy again ANTEC.Wlecome Thermalthake and OCZ !!
 Xantrex Technologies XPower Pocket Mobile Power Source 175-Watt Inverter # 813-0291I used this product for about 10 days and then it stopped working , it would overheat and making a high pitched beeping noise with no power output . I would invest in a higher quality inverter , I wish I never wasted my money .
 The product has a USB port but it is not compatible with my Motorola phone , the phone says unauthorized power supply and disconnects.Works with ipods but I think the Motorola expects a `` smart '' usb port it can talk to and this must not be one .
 The delivered product was different from the product listed on this page
 Xantrex Technologies XPower Pocket Mobile Power Source 175-Watt Inverter # 813-0291It totally pooped out and failed after only a few months occasional use . It worked fairly well on some things like 85 watt curling iron and cellphone charger . It would recharge the laptop but struggled to power the laptop if the laptop battery was low . This despite the very low power demand rating on the laptop.Recently on a long trip it just would n't work any more . We looked it over , tried a different cord on it , and it would n't respond . Forgetting it had a one year warranty and having no room for dysfunctional stuff , we tossed it in the trash . Rats!We are shopping for a 400 or 500 watt inverter now . This one was marginal for our laptop and we need to be able to count on the inverter for the things we need it for . I would n't recommend this tiny device .
 I was excited to be able to plug everything in without a car adapter ... but this stopped working within a month of buying it . I had a close look at it and some of the wires were n't connected all the way , as if they 'd been yanked out or -LRB- as I 'm sure is the case -RRB- never assembled correctly to begin with . At the same time as I say do n't buy it , I 'm not sure which one * is * good because I never tried a different one .
 Please be ware , that this inverter does not have the airplane plug . No bag either . The inverter 's size is small . This product does not match the user manual . The user manual might be an old version . I gave it one star since I need it with a airplane plug .
 i did n't get to use this product because i never recieved it in time for the deadline needed . the return policy is horrible and they charge a restocking fee -LRB- even though my item was unopened -RRB- so do n't buy anything unless you are absolutely sure you need the exact item .
 Xantrex is a leader in the inverter field so I was very surprised when this product failed almost immediately . I returned it to Amazon for a prompt refund and bought one from Jensen , which has worked perfectly .
 I needed a good set of headphones for some of the work that I do . I thought that by the information presented in the write up about this product that I was purchasing a good , or even great , addition to my office.NO GOOD ! If you have typical office construction , that is metal studs in walls , metal ceiling grids holding up tiles and lights , and other typical office furniture this product will not make you happy!Bad info advertisement related to this product .
 Horrible headphones . Complete static . No bass . I STRONGLY recommend that you NOT buy these . Battery life very low , complete opposite of sound cancelling , with volume all the way up , you can hear it in the other room . If you are looking for wireless headphones , these are not the answer , a complete waste of $ 80
 I read the user review somewhere else and I ignored them . What a fool I was . This product did not pick up any signal from my TV or Radio . Avoid buying this product . I had it return within 3 days of trying.Trust me . DO NOT buy this product -LRB- Sennheiser R40 -RRB- .

 This is my first pair of cordless headphones , and I 'm not particularly impressed . The strong points are convenience -LRB- it is nice to walk around the house in freedom -RRB- and comfort -LRB- they 're heavier than most corded headphones but not bad , and the earpads are comfy -RRB- . But the sound quality is not what I had hoped
 I 'm using these in an office with cubicles so maybe that has something to do with it as another review suggests but I 'm sitting barely two feet from the antenna and I 'm getting static like crazy . There does n't seem to be anything I can do to get clear reception .
 The Converter appears to be fine , except that it only came with the larger plugs used in northern Europe , not the smaller plugs used in southern Europe .
 I bought this for a trip to Argentina and Chile . The seller was great , but the product was horrible . It blew out in Buenos Aires on the first day charging a laptop . My roommate on the trip had a Brookstone adapter which worked on all the plugs we encountered . the Brookstone adapter worked on camera chargers , laptops , phone chargers , two different flat irons -LRB- hair straightener -RRB- , and ipod player with speakers . It sparked a few times , but it never blew out . I 'm getting one of those for my upcoming trip to France . I wish I had just spent the money the first time instead of wasting it on this piece .
 This converter did n't work at all . I did n't dare to expect too much for that price in the first place , but still very disappointing ...
 It has no adapters so unless you are using the Italian or French standard you 'll need another adapter . Also , do n't expect much with 50 watts ... this thing melted the first time I used it .
 I 've tried this for multiple things and it has n't worked for anything . My computer wo n't even acknowledge it regardless of what I try to connect it to .
 I bought this cable and a different brand -LRB- white -RRB- cable on Amazon and the black cable - this one - will not work on any device I try to use it with - WD TV Mini or any of my USB 2.5 '' or 3.5 '' external drives connected to my laptop or my desk top computers . Not sure why . The white cable works fine . The drives barely light up and just click so I 'm guessing there is too much resistance in this cable .
 I purchased this to replace a broken male/male USB cable that connects the fan in my lap desk to my computer.The first and second time I used this cord , it worked perfectly . The third and any subsequent times it has n't worked at all . At least it was cheap !
 This item did not work for the purpose intended . I wanted a cord to connect my laptop to my Smart TV . The TV did not recognize that there was hardware connected when this cord was attached .
 Tried connecting the cable with my printer and laptop for firmware update . neother Laptop nor printer identified the USB cable . I tried other cables like my camera USB cable with printer and laptop which it was able to identify . I am returning it .
 i could n't figure out what this cable did by its picture but purchased it because it was a good price now I have one if i need it but i did n't work for the purpose I want it to work for .
 I bought this cable to connect my laptop to my wireless printer for a first time setup and this cable did n't work . I tryed this cable on my HD 52 '' tv to connect something there & it did n't work there either . For the 2.80 I did n't even send it back . Just piched it . Was n't worth the time to send it back to Amazon .
 I think they offloading junk cables . Some of these reviews look like they are created by a business owner ; not normal customers . Mine was crap and does n't work an anything -LRB- PCs , TV ... nothing -RRB- . So , I got ripped off for about 4 or 5 bucks ... but still sleazy .
 I have received a defective cable . The USB devices that are connected using other USB cables of mine are immediately recognized . Not so with this cable . Disappointed .
 I bought the product and it has never arrived ! they take your money and no product ! Do NOT BUY
 I am unable to use this product as I intended . I hooked it up properly -LRB- for sure -RRB- and it was not able to provide signal from one device to another .
 i bought this to replace a usb cable that had been damaged . when i got the product , i connected it to my comp , and nothing . not returning because it was 3 $ . win some lose some in that price range
 One end was type A male , the other end was not . Not what I wanted or what was described . Very disappointed .
 Buyer beware . This cable did n't work to connect my laptop to printer . I only needed the cable to set up the wireless functions so I ordered an inexpensive one here . At less than $ 3 incl shipping , it 's not worth the time or trouble for me to return it .
 When I got the procut , saw I had made a mistake , had wanted a 3 USB cable , but these were so cheap , that I could not send them back , may never use them , but the cost was that good of a bargain .
 Please Do not buy this product.As this product i got it while back and i forgot to review.bt its not working .
 The item arrived in perfect time and condition , unfortunately ... I could n't use it for what I intended.I wanted to use it to charge my labtop computer in my vehicle . I did n't realize my labtop battery would n't charge via usb cable.No one 's fault but my own.Seller was not at fault .
 Dont waste your money on this Chinese piece of crap . This plastic crap does n't even work . DO NOT BUY THIS !
 Something is not right with this cable . I have tried on several occasions to use this cable with different devices and it doesnt work . I am going to take this cable to work and beep it out to see whats wrong it . Its not worth the time or effort to return a $ 1.50 cable .
 I needed to extend my usb cable and this does not recognize my iPhone or a few other electronic products . I would confirm with seller it is compatible before buying .
 We bought this computer in 2004 and had it repaired for a loose power jack in 2006 -LRB- symptoms
 I bought it in January 2004 and the power jack went bad in January 2006 . I bought a laptopp on the cheap end , knowing that it would either break or be outdated in a couple of years , and here I am , just as predicted.I have to call Kenmore , now . My two year old refrigerator just stop refrigerating . Ah , the age of great quality and service ! -LRB- Yes , Mr. Steve . I am sorry to here about your broken equipment , Mr. Steve . I 'm sorry , but it seems I can not help you . Please hold . -RRB-
 I purchased this piece of crap laptop in 2004 . Everything ran smoothly until the power jack problem which occured in mid-2005 . I was able to keep it running by forcing the power cord into the jack and wrapping it around the base of the laptop to keep it steady . That trick eventually failed and I angrily had to get it fixed in early 2006 . Months later , the power jack became loose again and I once again had to do the wrap-around trick . I just had that fixed again -LRB- December 2006 -RRB- and it crashed in January 2007 . . this time a hard drive failure . Turned out that the hard drive slipped so I had to get a new one . It should be coming in in a week . Stayed tuned for more zv5120us horror stories.PS . Repairs for this junk already cost me $ 200 + . Do n't get one . I 'm serious.PSS . Other malfunctioning parts
 I bought a Z5000 series a year ago or so . Over time I have experienced the infamous `` power jack '' problem , where the power cord into the back of the laptop loosens and the computer shuts down . Currently I can still power the laptop but can not get the battery to recharge , and if I bump the cord the unit simply shuts off with no warning . Along with that problem I have complained about an excessively noisy fan -LRB- I can hear it from the adjacent room -RRB- and HP replaced the hard drive for me shortly after I purchased the unit . The cost of repairing the power jack was quoted $ 400 from HP . I can buy a basic but pretty nice laptop for $ 800 , so I do n't see any point in throwing good money after bad . I would not buy one of these units again . I have owned several Dell laptops , and while they have not been perfect , the warranty was good for defective parts that came up . This seems to be an engineering problem that probably wo n't go away . Too bad as this is a pretty feature rich laptop , but I will give up the features and go back to a unit that historically was designed and built better than this one . I would feel better about HP if they would step to the plate and work with customers who purchased these units and have had problems , but they do n't seem to want to get involved once we have exchanged money for product . Oh well .
 POWER CORD FAILURE , WO N'T LAST . EVENTUALLY YOU WO N'T BE ABLE TO TURN ON YOUR LAPTOP , THATS IF THE MOTHER BOARD DO N'T FRY FIRST . HP COULD CARE LESS , THE 'LL FIXED IT ALRIGHT FOR BIG $ $ $
 This laptop was really nice for the first two years that I owned it - then the power stopped connecting properly . I tried to have it repaired but it just went from bad to worse -LRB- using a port replicator as a power source did n't work at all either -RRB- . So now I ca n't turn on my computer at all . HP told me they could replace the entire motherboard to fix the problem - for $ 1000 . I do n't think so !
 I bought this JVP portable , basically because I wanted a good , name brand CD player and JVC seemed to be at the top of my thinking cap . I went to several places to look at CD portable players and for some reason , ended up at Sears -LRB- what a mistake -RRB- and purchased the JVC XLPV310 CD player for about $ 44.00 , on sale . Took it out to my car , unpackaged it and hooked it up to play through my car cassette deck . The cassette adapter from JVC made several noises but played . The CD player would not play after loading a standard `` pre-recorded '' CD in the unit . Took it back in to Sears for an exchange , took 2 hours , then they gave me a new on just like the one I purchased earlier . Got it to the car and the CD would play in the unit , however , it made the worst noise as the CD played I have ever heard . Do n't buy this one . It really stinks . Sound quality was poor at best and the earphones were a joke . Forget portable CD players and get an MP3 portable device that records and plays or get a MiniDisc portable recorder that records MP3 's or standard MD 's .

 This little radio offers the well known Sony quality and gets very good FM reception . It feels solidly built and in my opinion will last for years under normal wear and tear . However if you are considering this radio for its weather broadcasts I would advise you to look elsewear . The other reviewer here that mentioned that one only has to tune in the local weather frequency once if you do n't move around is correct . However what is failed to be mentioned is that any analog type tuning knob for weather will perform the same way that a non digital tuner will when tuning FM . It will eventually drift . Without a locked frequency that most of the other radios have for weather , this Sony units broadcast will drift off center and require periodic adjustment . Quite the pain when you have to get inside the battery compartment each time it decides to drop the ball and wander . Personally I have never owned a weather radio with a locked frequency system that was `` off '' , and I presently own 8 of them . So I would not be concerned about that criticism if I were you . Overall there are much better choices for small weather radios and I would not recommend this one .
 their was 98 clips out of 100 Mounting clips in the 100pack i got . that is why i gave it a 1 on it rateing
 Right out of the box , the tuner was defective . On both AM and FM , there was an extremely annoying `` POP ! '' sound every five seconds . As a test for the problem , if you leave the AM antenna disconnected and turn up the volume , it 's very obvious . When the AM and FM antennas are properly connected , you wo n't hear it so much on loud music , but during quieter passages the five second interval click is a real nuisance.The Sony support website Knowledge Article C399832 for `` Popping or clicking noise when playing the radio '' suggests unplugging the unit for a minute and then plugging it in again , but that did n't help . The suggestion in that case is `` service may be required '' . I also called the Sony 800 number and spoke to a service rep who admitted that the unit needed repair . Well , since I only bought it last night , it 's obviously going back to the store.File this one in the Sony junk product category ...
 Unless you intend to connect this piece of junk to a cable line , it wo n't work because TV stations no longer available on the `` airwaves '' . I forgot about that and thought the antena would pull in stations . But even if airwaves still around , the tuning knob broke off first time I turned it . What do you expect for the money ?? It falls apart just looking at it .
 THE TV dOES NOT GIVE A PICTURE AND THE COST AND TROUBLE OF SENDING IT BACK IS NOT WORTH IT .
 Hi , i am writing this review in Guatemala but i live in california . I bought this thing for my nice here in guatemala and it did not work
 Within 6 months of installation , over half of the lights illuminating the buttons went out leaving me to search for the buttons at night time . Why go for the buttons when I have a remote , you ask ? This is because apparently the remote can not hold up to frequent use . The most frequently used buttons -LRB- which are like little bubbles -RRB- cracked and the covering came off . It 's almost impossible to use the buttons without the covering over the remote board because it does n't recognize when just your fingers are pushing on the bare board . Also , after going on the official Pyle website , the `` Contact Us '' link is apparently the only link that did n't , and still does n't -LRB- 4 months later -RRB- work so I emailed them through one of their other links -LRB- regarding some other question , but inquired about my issues -RRB- yet still have not received a response .
 I asked for this model in the beginning , they ran out of them , and I got another -LRB- crappy -RRB- model instead .
 I bought the Opteka 2X Telephoto lens for my Olympus C-8080 Camedia Digital Camera so I could zoom in closer to my subject or scene.Unfortunately , I have not noticed much of , if any useful difference in the closeness of the subject or scene.And the lens attachment has one terribly annoying side effect
 This shows up under digital ... but if you look closer it reads ... Tuner Technology
 Unfortunately none of the plugs that came with the kit fit in my computer even if it said in the article description that it would
 I mean , if the product is going to be used by someone travelling then provide a packaging case/bag/whatever to hold the components when it is not being used.Other than the convenience factor , they provide enough jack size to work with a wide variety of laptops and accessories .
 We almost bought the PCV-L552 for its big view finder and 27x optical zoom , but after a lot of digging on obscure web sites , we found this older camera suffers from a dew detector light that goes off too easily , shutting down camera for hours . The PV-L424 just came out in 2004 .
 I do n't know what is the quality of the ordered item . The supplier mailed to me a cheap imitation of it ! Following my complaint , he -LRB- and Amazon -RRB- decided to credit my Visa w/o returning the item
 Nice features which are included because Canon saved money by using a cheap tape transport . Within very little time expect to be continually exposed to the `` Remove the Cassette '' which can , apparently , only temporarily fixed at the Canon Repair Center . It appears that the cheap transport is not model specific . Caveat Emptor
 You stick your USB drive into the Data Guard , as if it were a USB hub at your computer . Two little teeth grab the two dimples on top of the drive and thus lock it down . Then you twist the three wheels on the side of the Data Guard to block the locking mechanism.Several things to contemplate here : - the length of the whole contraption , USB drive plus Data Guard , is exorbitantly large ; not really easily transportable anymore - the wheels of the lock are flimsy at best , and I do n't trust that they will works flawlessly all the time ; at my Data Guard , the first wheel does not move without applying severe force - it might be stuck one day with a stick in it ... - ... which would not be the end of the world ; by my estimation , a srewdriver and some patience would take care of that ... which does not speak well for the actual main function of the device
 If I could give this product zero or negative stars , I would.Not only have I struggled to make this product lock when it is supposed to , but now that it will not UNlock , I called customer support to see what I am doing wrong . Their recommendation
 this device broke my flash drive . yeah it is strong , so strong that the flash drive will get stuck and you end up breaking it . DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE , i only paid 1 cent plus shipping . it wasnt even worth that .
 I used these feet on the bottom of a PC to raise it off the floor a bit . I was expecting soft rubber but the plastic that these feet are made of is really hard . As a result the vibration from the computer was transferred to the floor and would occasionally cause an audible vibration against the floor . The adhesive on the feet was horrible . I cleaned the area on the case before I attached the feet but within 3 weeks the feet had become detached and the adhesive was completely dry . Be careful what you use these feet for .
 Do not buy this product . The earphones broke with in a month , followed by the battery case cover , which falls of easily , then the player stopped running entirely . Customers beware .
 I like the bag a lot . It is convenient having my computer and portable printer in one bag . The bag arrived with a cut in the handle and do n't think it is going to last all that long as a result . Will probably have to buy another one by end of the year .
 I gave two stars to get the attention of those wanting to buy big ticket price point goodies from Amazon.The Canon 5D is - mostly - all that it 's cracked up to be.However , you are well advised not to buy this item through Amazon - let alone any big ticket item.I received the camera and it was poorly packed . When I opened the camera , it appeared that it may have been a previous return . There were marks on the back of the camera as if someone using lotion or who has handled greasy food had handled the camera.I checked the camera and , otherwise , all seemed to be working properly and all documentation and accessories were present . So , given the hassle of returning online purchases , I decided to keep the camera.Then I was doing some high-key -LRB- background -RRB- editorial work at f22 and noticed some unusual artifact . Upon looping the sensor , it turns out that the sensor had a minor scratch . This was a latent defect that was not readily observable even upon fairly rigid inspection of the camera.I contacted Amazon and , by this time , the return window was 20 days past . I was just looking to exchange the camera for an identical model.Amazon 's response was not just `` too bad , '' but actually three conflicting responses which would have only compounded the problem if I sent the camera off to the `` never never land '' of Amazon returns . I would have been without a camera and without a refund.One customer service agent said that I could n't exchange the camera as Amazon does n't sell the Canon 5D any longer . In fact , they do . Another agent said to return the camera for a refund and make sure it was insured for shipping . Upon seeking to clarify the return terms , another agent responded and said that Amazon `` stands firm '' by it 's policy that a return can not be made after the 30 day window has expired.My mistake ? First , not returning the item immediately . Second , not spending a couple more hundred to have the peace of mind of dealing with a trusted camera shop . The moral of the story is `` Do not buy big ticket items from price point online vendors such as Amazon unless you can take the downside of getting burned . `` Welcome to the new world of retail .
 I have been putting off writing a review for this camera because I could n't really put to words how disappointed I felt with it and was waiting for things to improve . However they did n't so here it goes.I have a Bachelors Degree in Fine Art -LRB- painting and drawing -RRB- and never though I would get into photography . When I took a class in college we were using film cameras and it was too much of a hassle . Things changed however when I took a 5 mp . point and shoot Panasonic that I gave my mother for a little photo shoot around Reykjavik . I could not believe the clarity and the saturation of the colors that little soapbox could produce . They were exceptionally sharp too . It fit snuggly in my pocket and was very convenient for some of the angles required a considerable amount of climbing.I started uploading my images to flickr and discovered a great array of incredible photos of Iceland . They were made with various DSLRs . A little bulb light up in my cranium . I started reading reviews and comparing cameras . First I thought of getting the Nikon D80 but after reading about the crop factors and the '' full frame advantage '' decided to settle on the Canon 5D . Ok , now to make this easier I will just list the things that I like and do n't like about it.What I do n't like : -LRB- These items are listed in a chronological order as these things were becoming apparent to me -RRB- 1 -RRB- The view finder . It 's dim and it 's impossible to focus any poorly light objects whether I am wearing my glasses or not . There 's no circle for precise focusing which I though was a standard .2 -RRB- The autofocus is terrible in my opinion . This was the biggest shock to me,-if you point the 5D at a blank wall it will not focus , the same goes for skies and clouds that have no detail . It does n't focus at all in dimly light conditions . You need to haul around a speedlite flash at all times because the 5D does not have a built in AF assist beam . So even if you 're not using the flash but say like to take photos in twilight you need to have it on so that the camera can autofocus . -LRB- Now I need to buy a flash 250 $ + -RRB- 3 -RRB- Sharpness . I got it with the 24-105 L lens and the 12-24mm Sigma . The 24-105 was higly praised online for its sharpness . In reality it produced images that were softer than that of my Panasonic , which costs 5 times cheaper than the lens itself by the way . I asked members of the 24-105 forum if I had a bad copy and they said that with this lens you ca n't really expect better results . -LRB- I guess it 's like finding out that your Ferrari does n't go quite as fast as your Geo -RRB- . The only acceptable images I could get with it was when I set the in camera sharpening to the max -LRB- 7 -RRB- .4 -RRB- The coveted image quality . Yes everybody is crazy about it . I read so many ecstatic reviews I became a believer . The reality is that those images are very hard to produce because A -RRB- it 's hard to focus B -RRB- If you set the white balance to auto it 's always off . C -RRB- Vignetting D -RRB- Chromatic aberration in the corners , unacceptable at wide angles . E -RRB- Light fall off , = little rainbow rays from every streetlight . F -RRB- Dust , = no weather sealing , but I 'll get into that later . D -RRB- Slow burst mode . 3 frames per second means you ca n't make good HDR images hand held . Later on that .5 -RRB- NO WEATHER SEALS ! I though this was n't a big deal until my camera simply died on me . I was shooting at night and it was snowing . Not a snow storm just beautiful wet snow . It was warm so it was heavy and stuck to the camera . I was photographing a docked ship while explaining to my friend the advantages of long exposures . I was also bragging about how low the noise levels are in the 5D . It was a 30 second exposure when all the sudden my camera started firing off randomly as if in a burst mode . I reset it , but it did the same thing . The shutter just started going off randomly even when I was not touching it . ` ` This is not supposed to be like this '' I said to my friend as we headed home . In my apartment the the top LCD WENT DEAD and the camera stopped functioning . When I turned it on the shutter clicked randomly like a defective time bomb . That night I had a nightmare , 4 Nikon D200 cameras dressed in black came and buried my canon ;-RRB- . Knowing how expensive repairs are I thought my camera was done . However , however ... fortune smiled and it miraculously came to life again like some sort of a zombie.Lesson,-weather seals ARE IMPORTANT ! 6 -RRB- Slow frame rate . The Canon is unusable for any action photography . Forget sports , even photographing a cat is hard . I do n't know why the have the auto mode on it because it 's completely useless , I mean the ISO does n't go higher than 400 . If you adjust it manually it takes to much time . The only thing the 5D seems fit for is landscape and portrait photography , granted the later is done in good lighting conditions .7 -RRB- Features . A lot of people complain about them . Yeah the direct print button is a life saver . Grandma 's birthday party here I come!I have n't used other SLR ' but I can say that they could have made it more ergonomic , the buttons are hard to press and because they have double functions I always mess one setting up while adjusting the other . I like the wheel though . Thank you Canon , love you bunches!Now what do I like about the 5D ? Hmmm ... Well I guess it looks good when I walk around with it . But then it sort makes me feel like those guys that buy Hummers to make up for their shortcomings . Funny , but in actuality I get more attention from women . However when they ask me ` ` Does it take good pictures ? '' I have this very stoic look on my face like Jesus when he saw Judas.Well , the 5Ds are getting very cheap now , just 2 grand . I hope they finally release the long overdue 7D and it will improve on it 's strange predecessor.Canon to make a long story short , - You ripped me off .
 PLEASE READ MY MOST RECENT POST IN THE COMMENTS SECTION ON 11/30/07 FOR UPDATES AND RESPONSES TO THIS REVIEW . THANKS.I purchased this camera a little over a month ago . I have since sold it , and switched to using Nikon . I can no longer support Canon , and this saddens me , for I grew up using Canon since I was 8 years old . Here is why I gave this camera 2 stars : - Full frame censor
 I am a camera buff and purchased this camera because I thought it would be an upgrade from my Nikon D300 . I bought it from Samy 's Camera and it is my fault that I did not get to open the box for over 2 weeks due to a family emergency . When I took it out of the box , it was defective . I took it back and since it was over 2 weeks , I had to get it repaired under my warranty . It took 3 weeks for me to get the camera back and it has never taken clear , crisp pics . The color is off and quality is just not what I expected for the money . I use it just now and then and still have not managed to get a great shot out of it
 Purchased camera brand new to serve as a backup camera for my wedding photography business . Used for two days without a problem . On the third day , the camera was dead . I tried a new battery-still dead . Trouble shooted issue with Canon-it was determined that the camera was defective and had to be returned .
 You will likely be happy with this camera for two months . After that , it is pretty much disposable . I -LRB- along with my family and friends -RRB- have wasted far too much money on these cameras over the years , seduced by their compact size and colors . In actuality , the shots are not that great , you have to fuss with it over and over to get a good picture and they easily break -LRB- forget about it being covered under your warranty Casio is a joke -RRB- . Extremely temperamental camera . Spend some more money and get a Canon , they are hands down the best and we are officially a Canon family from here on out .
 I ca n't use it yet , because they di n't send me the charger and UBS cable yet ...
 I bought this camera and found that battery is not getting charged.I reported problem to Casio Customer care . They told that we will deliver new batter within 10 - working days . When i called up again after 10 days , they told they are not sure how much time it will take to process your request . I never saw such a worst customer care like casio
 I bought this camera because it was small and nicely fit into any pocket . The 7.2 M pixels , video with audio , etc. , seemed to be a good package . I also like the fact that the camera appears as just another drive when connected to a computer -LRB- i.e. , it appears in Windows Explorer in the same way as a USB memory stick -RRB- . After using it for a while I slowly got disappointed how often the camera misses a focus . When you shoot an easy target -LRB- a landscape or a face -RRB- then the camera just works fine . When you have more difficult situations -LRB- try close-up of flowers or multiple art objects placed at various distances on a table -RRB- the images are often out of focus.I 'm also not very happy that almost everything is special
 I have had my Casio for a year and a half now . When I first got the camera it was fine . Took decent pictures , was easy to use , was small enough . However just recently the focus has broken again . It stopped working the first time while I was in Europe , I had just come back from a weekend trip , left the camera in my desk drawer and the next weekend the focus was completely broken , it was impossible to use either the auto or manual focus to adjust it . Luckily then it was still under warranty , I sent it back and it was replaced . Unfortunately this past weekend the same exact thing happened , I had just taken a picture , turned the camera off , turned it back on and the focus had broken again . This time I am not under warranty . I will not buy another Exilim .
 I bought two of these cameras . One for a summer house . Since I opened the box a few month later , I learned that it does not work . Battery will not charge and it is not the battery . Camera is defective . Now I have to PAY to get it fixed and it never took one picture . The other one has a screen that blinks WHITE and it became unusable after only a few months . STAY AWAY from Casio Cameras . There are many other manufacturers from which to choose .
 I bought this camera and was quickly impressed by the look and ease of use . Once I started taking photos with it , it was a whole different story . The photos are very noisy and the camera will not produce solid blacks . Looking at many of the photos taken with this camera - it 's unbearable , they look awful . I am so disappointed with the quality of these photos that the camera is pretty much useless now .
 you can get better cameras that too at much lesser price . Quality of pictures is not that good as you would expect from a 7.2 megapixel . It is equivalent to 5 or 6 mega pixel of any good brand like Nikon or Cannon.in short , DO N'T BUY THIS ITEM
 I ORDERED THIS ITEM ABOUT A MONTH AGO ... I GOT THE PACKAGE IN ABOUT 2 WEEKS AND WAS SO EXCITED TO OPEN IT I WAS LIKE A 10 YEAR OLD WHO JUST GOT THEIR FIRST BIKE ! ... I OPENED THE PACKAGE TO ONLY FIND A THE CHARGER FOR THE CAMERA ... YES ... ONLY THE CHARGER ... NO CAMERA TO BE FOUND IN THE PACKAGE !!!!! ... I WAS SO PISSED I CALLED AMAZON AND ASKED THEM WHERE THE HELL IS MY CAMERA ... AND THIS IS WHAT THEY SAID `` OH IM SORRY ... WE PROBABLY FORGOT TO PUT IT INTO THE PACKAGE '' ... WHAT KIND OF @ # $ % @ # $ @ # $ % IS THAT ... SO I ASKED THE GUY TO SHIP ME A CAMERA ... AND TO MY LUCK THEIR WERE NO MORE IN STOCK ... SO I TOLD THE GUY TO FORGET IT AND FOR HIM TO SEND ME A RETURN SLIP SO THAT I CAN GET MY FULL $ 220 DOLLARS BACK BECAUSE OF YOUR HORRIBLE/TERRIBLE/RIDICULOUS SERVICE . IT IS NOW FEB AND STILL NO MONEY BACK ... I KEEP CALLING THEM AND THEY SAY THE RETURNED PACKAGE IS STILL IN TRANSIT ... IVE NEVER HEARD OF A PACKAGE TAKING OVER A MONTH TO GET TO ITS DESTINATION ... BUT I COULD BE WRONG RIGHT ? I WOULDNT BE SURPRISED IF I NEVER SEE MY 200 DOLLARS AGAIN ... IF I WANTED TO WASTE 200 DOLLARS LIKE THAT I COULD HAVE FLUSHED THEM DOWN THE TOILET ... WHAT A RIP OFF !!!!! ... IT WAS AN AMAZON VENDOR AS WELL...@#$%@#%$@#q^@#$^@#$%#$$%^@ ... NEVER AGAIN !!!!!!!!!!!!
 We were given this camera for Christmas and initially were delighted with several features . . The menu is well laid out and easy to use , the screen is larger than anything we were used to and the camera is very fast . The trouble began when we actually loaded test pictures on to my laptop ... and were shocked at how poor the quality was.So we hauled out our old slow Nikon Coolpix 990 , which is a 3.5 Mb camera , bought back in 2000 . We took several identical shots with both cameras , using different settings with and without flash . Sadly the old Nikon blew the Casio out of the water every time . The pictures were clearer , MUCH less noise , better colour etc. . A couple of the pictures were positively dismal . In fact in one picture , taken with the Nikon , of my husband standing in the kitchen you can almost read the buttons on the microwave to his left . In the identical picture taken with the Casio you can hardly tell there are buttons on the microwave . We returned the camera yesterday , and will look for another Nikon . Perhaps the D40 will be well worth the extra investment.Casio should stick to making Keyboards .
 I bought these headphones because i thought they were a 2.5 mm headphones that i could use with my cellphone . It 's a 3.5 mm headphone that comes with a 2.5 mm adaptor.When I tried it out with my cellphone , music only came out of one ear since it is n't a `` stero '' adaptor.The sound was good , but it did n't fit well in my ears.It did come with a lot of accessories , but I 'm dissapointed that it does n't really work it a cellphone . Whenever I plugged it in , my phone recognized it as a microphone/earphone headset and went to voice command each time - even though there is no microphone on this since they are earphones.So , if you 're looking to buy this as regular headphones , they 're decent . . But if you want them for your cellphone ... look elsewhere .
 Eeeee ... Kindda-ok . But naaa ... should n't recommend them.Ever wanted to look cool but be hurting and pretend like your just feeling suave?Well these earphones do exactly that . You 'll look cool but your ears will hurt like if you 'd be wearing new shinny shoes 2 sizes smaller than your feet.Could they have not put a little cushion to these very heavy earphones?I mean , so you do n't have to feel like `` metal tubes '' are sticking and hanging out of your ears.Although the sound is ok ; I do n't think the engineers had any `` comfort factor '' considered in the equation . The ear pieces are very hard and heavy -LRB- dudes it 's just hard metal all around . -RRB- That black ring you see in the picture is super hard rubber heck it could almost be ceramic for all I care , and your ears do n't appreciate the intruding material in your outer ear canal.I just would n't recommend them ... Wait ! You can put duct tape around the black ring for a little extra comfort ! AND it would look even cooler !
 The sound and fit are fine and I do like the cable length . However , after four months the left bud fell apart . The rubber gasket came loose then finally fell off and I ca n't get it to stay on . Sure , I can replace them because of the warranty but do I really want to bother with another of these ? I 'm going back to the Apple buds .
 I am not sure I like the sound out of these headphones . The base is a bit weak and they have a very high piched treble that hurts my head/ears .
 I 'm in the process of getting my second one of these gizmos repaired/replaced . The lense will not retract after being shut off . This should not be happening . It goes off to Sony next week for warranty repair . Not even 60 days old . Not good .
 This is my first digital camera . I bought it becasue of the name , and was attracted by the big 3 '' LCD screen which I hoped would be easier for older users ' eyes . I first used it in my brother 's retirement party . All 300 pictures came out with red line across them . My brother and I are bothdisappointed . I thought maybe something wrong with my photo software , ormy be set up the features wrong , because later some pictures turned outto be OK . Now a year after my warranty expires , not only the lines are showing on all my pictures , but all came with red color backgroud.My friend had problem with his Sony lense -LRB- different model -RRB- . He feltlucky because he bought 2 years ' extended warrenty , so it can be fixed with no charge . To me , I do n't believe a good name should have such a defective item.I had a BAD experience , I will never buy Sony camera.Also , I bought 2 Panasonic HD flat screen TV , -LRB- one put in my living room , the other in bedroom -RRB- , the picture is much better than Sony.I my opion , Sony is not top of the line any more .
 This camera takes terrible photos . On auto mode you have to take 3-5 photos in a row to get one good one that is not over exposed , underexposed or just a blank black photo with no image at all . DO NOT GET THIS CAMERA unless you want to be stuck with a lemon .
 I had a Sony camera and no problems for the first six months . At that point , the LCD screen on the back went white , not allowing me to review pictures , access the menu , or take pictures through it . I 've sent the camera to Sony repair centers twice , with no results . The camera has spent three of the past four months either in transit , in repair , or simply not working . The Sony repair centers keep sending it back to me in the same state that I sent it in . If you 're going to spend any kind of money on a digital camera , do yourself a favor and do n't buy a Sony .
 I do n't know how many times I have to get burned by Sony 's poor quality control before I give up on the brand . I really liked the design of the N1 and the first batch of pictures met my expectations , but the touchscreen died on me during the second day of our vacation ! It turned into a bunch of colored bars like your TV does during emergencly broadcast tests . Given there is no optical viewfinder , this meant I was out of luck . Additionally , most controls are accessed via the touchscreen -LRB- many inelegantly -RRB- so when it goes , the camera goes .
 This is an update of review I wrote on September 29 , 2007 : The first version of these earphones I received broke Within 2 weeks of standard use - both ear buds . need less to say I was not happy or impressed . However , when I wrote Maximo to complain , I have to say their Customer Service was extremely helpful and VERY hands-on in trying to address my concerns and make sure I got a replacement set of earphones as quickly and as hassle-free as possible.I have held off on revising this review because I wanted to try out the new phones for a few weeks and see if the would hold up . The product looks great and performance-wise the replacements have been very good . The low-end response is decent for in-ear style headphones and can be improved by experimenting with the other two size of ear buds included with your headphones.Overall , if you 're looking for a low-cost alternate with decent performance to some of the more costly in-ear phones in the market like the BOSE ones , these are definitely worth your consideration . Amazon wo n't let me do it for some reason but I would upgrade my rating on the earphones from 2 to 3 -LRB- maybe 4 -RRB- stars if I could . -LSB- updated 12.16.07 -RSB-
 For the price it sounds good and thats it . I bought it it looked worse than in the picture . And it didnt even last 2 months . I called Maximo and thank God they were nice , they told me to just cut them in pieces and send the photo . . I received my replacement in a week . But it broke again in 2 moths exact . I just give up the hussle to call Maximo again if its going to break again in 2 moths ...
 It is hard to quantify the value of sound quality . I used Shure E2c-n for more than a year , and Etymotic ER-4S for several years . The latter are about as good at sound reproduction as anything I have ever heard -LRB- eg Sennheiser HD650 -RRB- , and to me the E2c-n are at least in the ballpark . If I figure 200USD for close to perfect sound , 75USD for something almost as good , what should I expect for 25USD ? Something that sounds better than a mobile phone ? Better than the speakers in a laptop computer ? If so , I think the Maximo iM-390 are not even close to worth it . The reason I give them 2 stars instead of 1 is they come with decent adapters , extension cable and carrying case . For somebody who spends 200USD or more fpr a music player and the music on it , I think it is probably worth paying the extra 50USD to get something like the E2c-n . Shure E2c-n Sound Isolating Earphones -LRB- Black -RRB-
 Although I read reviews of this product prior to purchase , I purchased them because of the price and thought the ` extras ' that came with purchase would justify the loss of sound quality . I was wrong . I 've gotten ` free ' headphones with other products before that sounded better than these . Do n't even consider these for purchasing .
 I returned this item.the ad says it is a 2.5 mm head phone.it is not.it has a bulky adapter that hooks on that make them akward to use.I did plug them into my other phone and they do have a good sound .
 I originally rated these a higher but after a few months using them I find myself going back to my old Sony fontopias which are like 3 years old - sound better and are more comfortable . I really do n't care for how these fit -LRB- do n't fit . -RRB- They sound crinkly and tinny . I would n't buy them again .
 I have tried two different samples of this AC adapter which has an attractive price particularly with the settable outputs . Both samples failed to work as advertised . I tried using them with a Chamberlain intercom system that can be either battery operated or with an AC adapter with 12V input . These chargers made the intercom malfunction totally . Fortunately , when I disconnected the AC adapter , the intercom works fine on batteries and I will continue to use only batteries on the intercom . I did put a voltmeter on the output of each of these units and it came as no surprise to find that the output was not as rated but much higher . When set at 12V it was giving 22.8 V at the plug . When set at 6V the output was 11 . Both samples behaved similarly and would not work with the intercom . This is junk and I will try to get Amazon to give me a refund on both units .
 It is simply junk . Poor all the way around !! Threw it in the trash !
 This is my first ever negative review of any product.Pros
 Stick with a known GPS brand such as Garmin.Don ' t waste your time or money with WorldNav products.Check out worldnav3300gps.blogspot
 This is honestly the worst purchase I may have ever made . I bought this unit in Dec '06 and have updated it several times -LRB- firmware -RRB- to no avail . It constantly hangs up , I have to constantly reset the unit , I have trouble finding the simplest locations . I 'm basically going to give it one more try with the latest firmware update , if it does n't get better I 'll try to ebay it for $ 50 . I have the premium version , but no Canada maps - which I hear they 're giving free now - I called Teletype , but they wo n't give them to me even though I paid $ 50 more than what they 're selling them for online now - they want me to pay $ 45 more - If I was even modestly happy with this unit I might bite - BUT NO WAY can I support this group with more $ $ - I would n't even give this product 1 star , but it seems I 've little choice ... you 've been warned !
 They should have better description of product . It did n't fit my lens and I do n't know what size lens it would fit . The part that should attach to the lens was huge . I have had several slr cameras and that hood did not fit any of my lenses .
 yet to receive it.Have no clue where the wire reached.Am confused whether i was able to cancel it or did i just take it as one of those loses that do tend to happen over internet shopping .
 I bought mine almost 1 year ago , trying to improve my old -LRB- but good -RRB- Dell Axim X5 , and after using the warranty 4 times , -LRB- because the one I bought was overheating when it was Off -RRB- first they replaced the battery , then the equipment -LRB- twice -RRB- and the IPaQs continue overheating , with no technical explanation from HP . Now they offered me an `` Improvement '' to my original choice -LRB- the IPaQ 210 -RRB- but these guys are so smart that sent me only the new IPaQ -LRB- 210 -RRB- with no battery , cables , Installation CD , stylus , etc. -LRB- the 2795 and the 210 are quite differents in the accessories -RRB- this was almost 1 month ago and they are still playing games with me . Conclusion
 I bought this to replace my Ipaq hx4705 , which I used for 3 years for business purposes -LRB- medical office -RRB- . For 3 months , since I got it , I have been constantly working with the geeks at HP on the bugs in this computer -LRB- all known to HP but they wo n't admit that ; however , their support site is covered with complaints exactly like mine -RRB- . The HP support folks have had me completely update the BIOS -LRB- did n't work -RRB- and do various and other sundry `` fixes '' which have not fixed one thing but did cost me a ton of time on the phone and the time to reinstall the -LRB- few -RRB- programs that I need to work . I only use this computer to run two things
 pros
 Never been able to sync with computer , battery consistently deteriorated and now , 12 months after I bought it and despite the minimal use -LRB- as it does not connect with PC its use is very limited -RRB- , battery has now completely died and can only use it when connected to AC.HP assistance is useless - suggested to assist me purchase a new one - right , not in a million years.Not impressed by product or by HP . Had a Dell before which worked flawlessly for years . Decided to ` upgrade ' to HP . I wish Dell were still making their Pocket PCs to replace this useless and expensive device .
 It is discouraging that a company so respected can market a product so disappointing . I have struggled to use my HP IPAQ hx2495b . At any given time it can be dead even after a charging . When one goes to the multitudinous questions available to narrow the search for answers , frustration increases because the answers are not sufficient . I have ceased to consider any HP products and will replace those I have in the next weeks .
 I went to fund raiser for a Non profit organization that we like to support . Saw this at their silent auction , bought it . It was new in the box thought it would be good for helping me organize . Right from the start it would not drop the align screen page . Called HP , they suggested a clean reset , did n't work . Now I have to send it in for a $ 49.00 service fee , what a joke . Take my advice look elsewhere and do n't buy an electronic item new in the box from a silent auction .
 Brand new this did not synchronize from the start . Sent it back to HP they said it would be $ 300 to repair it as the main board was flawed . I said `` but it 's under a 1 year warrenty . Well be sure to read it , it 's does n't cover the main board . HP was horrible to deal with , never would return calls and kept it for over three months and did nothing . So once I got it back I went to bluetooth to synchronize and it worked great , but you ca n't move music , so what good is this ? I love it 's possiblities but it just has too many bugs !
 1 . Spec says that it supports SD memory card . After inserting 2 GB Card , the battery drains & I was not able to use the unit even once .2 . After calling the tech support , I was asked to download a patch eventhough my unit was brand new . Even after downloading the patch & installing it , the problem persisted .3 . I could n't use it even once right from Day 1 .
 the alarms do n't pay any attention to the settings in sounds and notifications . they repeat twice and then quit . the light does n't flash except the first time . half of the time they do n't work . i sent it back for repair and they did n't do a thing to it but send it back to me the next day . same problem , it is the way it is designed but they wo n't admit it .
 I thought this was a great unit until I inserted the SD card and it never was the same.Check the hp forum . In spite of the workarounds once you insert the card your nifty little PDA is junk.The battery life was great for months - I was pleasantly surprised . It was a wonderful unit . After deciding it would be useful tool and began loading schedules and plugged the card in , things got ugly . At this time my battery discharge rate is about 1 % per 5-7 minutes . None of the workarounds or service pack fixes does squat to alleviate the problem . I 'm really upset because hp will not touch it - I just got past the warranty a couple of months ago and now I have to pay to fix their junk.Caution - do not use any SD cards in this PDA .
 Bought this to replace my old 2200 Ipaq ; Man what a mistake ! The battery is always dead , even after the HP tech support for hours on 3 seperate occasions ; Patch downloads done nothing , lost information , reloads , Bugs to many to mention . I wished someone would have warned me of this pda model before I purchased it . All the good features it has do n't hold a candle to all the troubles it has . I 'd be very careful if your looking to buy this model . Dan
 This item is too small for the MP3 and causes it to push on the buttons . Made well but not useful .
 I purchased what I thought was a Kodak product when I purchased with my new Kodak DC3400 digital camera , a Kodak Compact Flash Card Reader for Digital Cameras , what I recieved was a Datafab Compact Flash Card Reader for Digital Cameras . This product would work with my windows 98 but every time I booted up the PC I wouuld get `` The blue screen from hell '' to quote another reviewers description of a similar product . I have since done more reasearch on the compact flash card reader products and sent back my Datafab unit and ordered another comparable unit that had at least better reviews . Buyer beware ...
 First , I have nearly 40 years experience in computer hardware and software , so I 'm not a neophyte . Yet I had an incredibly bad time installing this product . After installation under Windows SE , I constantly got the `` blue screen of death , '' a fatal error that caused crashes during boot . Success -LRB- of a sort -RRB- came when technical support from Datafab told me to power the device from the mouse port , not the keyboard port as the instructions say . There is no mention in the directions about using the mouse port . -LRB- My laptop does n't have a keyboard port . -RRB- The hookup is an unbelievable kludge
 I have this unit and it worked fine until I bought a new faster PC . I reinstalled it on the new machine and I had lots of problems with sharing the parallel port with my HP OfficeJet . I tried to update the driver from DATAFAB 's web site but that was a complete nightmare including a failed install that left the uninstall disabled.Another annoyance was on booting the PC , I would get an extraneous page printed on the printer . Also , the status light on the unit that before would turn green when the flash card was inserted , now always stays red.I have decided to buy a USB flash card reader .
 For the money , it looked too good to be true . It was.This reader seems to read some odd-sized flash card , but you ca n't determine that fact from its user manual or installation guide . The documentation is completely silent on how to use the device , or what type of flash card it 's supposed to read.What is certain is that no matter which way you try to insert a standard digital camera flash card -LRB- as in my Fuji MX-600 -RRB- , it either wo n't fit in the slot , or the card makes no apparent connection with this reader . And because the manual does n't tell you how to insert flash cards , it dawns on you slowly that nothing works . xyzzy = nothing happens.So if you have standard flash cards , do n't buy this device . If you can determine what kind of flash card it endeavors to read , and you have them , then this device might be a great deal .
 Awful quality cartridge , consistently printing lines in broken text . I 've used generic inks before , it was never like this . Expected the quality would not be as good as vendor 's cartridge , but we are talking about unreadable document . Printer is only a year old , it now looks like the inkjet printer head is clogged by this useless ink , It seems like the printer now is ready for retire ... Not buy again ever from seller . Very unappreciated and disappointed .
 I know getting after market knock-off ink is always a gamble , but this is one that did n't pay off . Not a single one of these cartridges worked . I did a full color test -LRB- after proper install , yes -RRB- and all I got was a blank sheet . It never did work . But the price was so low it was worth the gamble for me . I 'd suggest to any future buyers
 I purchased this ink to use in the Brother DCP 110C . I rarely print so this printer did not get much use in the first place . Who knows if it 's a coincidence but when I used this `` compatible '' ink , the printer never worked the same.In all fairness , the printer was never that great to begin with but I truly believe this ink was the final curtain . I do n't want to dog this product but buyer beware .
 I only shopped ads that said NEW when I needed to re-stock cartridges for all my printers . Although the low price is normally a tip off , there are a lot of NIB products offered at seriously low prices , so I clicked and paid . What I received was n't new , but refurbs . Do n't think it is ethical to post the product under the NEW only heading , then mention in the fine print of the description that they 're re-manufactured . To be fair , the first cartridge works ; however , it 's not the price , it 's the principle . Caught me once for not reading every line , but never again .
 Refill your own cartridges for pennies . These HP prices are ridiculously high . Refill ink from STRATITEC is excellent . Try it , you 'll like it . Be careful not to overfill . I try to use about half as much as I need for a complete fill . This works out well.Start learning with black . I have refilled the same 56 black cartridge dozens of times . Be neat , and keep the cartridge case and connectors clean with rubbing alcohol . Plain cellophane tape covers the fill hole nicely.Color can be trickier , but just as successful . Use a toothpick to identify the colors in the holes under the label . The label color diagram is reversed on the 57 . Stick the toothpick into the foam , and identify the ink color by the stain .
 It 's cheaper to buy two one packs than this bundle .
 One of them arrived damaged on the printer head so did not even print one page . The other one did not print as many pages as I 'd expected . Besides the color fades away too fast . Contacted the company without any reply . You 'd better go for the genuine HP product .
 Ordered on the 13th of August has n't even shipped yet .
 This camera is very dissappointing . On a field trip w/16 other photographers the only 2 cameras that failed in intermittent weather were the 5dmark11 . They were covered and protected . I do n't believe this can handle any weather . May be good in the studio but do n't use in incliment weather . Im very sorry to say as I was really excited to buy this camera .
 I was happy as a little child when the camera arrived at my door steps . I paired the camera with Canon 20-35mm 2.8 L lens and went out to `` test drive '' the camera . After taking about few hundred images , I came back home and analyzed them . At first the images looked OK , but after looking them at 50 % and over , I realized that every image has a weird banding issue . There were vertical lines with about 10 pixels spacing . I heard about some banding issues in the past with this model , but those problems were at higher ISO . My camera had the problem at any ISO , in both JPG and RAW format . I also tried different CF and SD cards , different computers to download images , different lenses , different setting , etc. . Nothing could make the problem go away . I spent 3 hours with Canon technical support and they could not help me . I also noticed that the camera was underexposing 2/3 to 1 , and that 580EX on this camera was working badly . It was almost impossible to find the right flash exposure . I compared the images from this camera and my old Canon PS G2 and G2 produced far superior images . My guess is that I got a LEMON . I returned my camera for full refund . If you are buying one of these camera used -LRB- I do n't believe that you can find a new one anymore , but I might be wrong -RRB- , make sure that the seller accepts return .
 Radius Technology DVDs ID as `` OPTODISC '' brand media . -LRB- That is , OPTODISC makes the discs for Radius -RRB- . OPTODISC media are generally found to be lousy
 I do n't know if anyone still has the original V-Phone , but during the time I did I was suckered into buying this thing because of the price . It was unusable - chinsy looking , did not fit the extended battery , rips easily , et cetera . Look elsewhere for a case .
 This particular case does not allow you to open the phone to the internal keyboard as hinted in the description . You have to take the phone out of the case to do that . The company was really nice in replying to my inquiry though . Good thing it was cheap . I bought other things from them that worked out really well .
 I have no doubt this adapter works just fine . But really , $ 50 ? Shop around a bit and you will find a regulated 5V 1A supply delivered for about $ 20 . If it does n't have the right connector , go to the Shack and pick up Type B , 4mm OD by 1.7 mm ID for an extra $ 3 .
 product did not work . wanted it to download music but it would never sync with computer it would n't charge the device either
 Upon receipt of the disks I have tested them with 10 different DVD Writer/Readers at home and at work.All the DVD-RW-capable drives will have no problem to read/write . All other drives -LRB- DVD-ROMs and stand-alone DVD Players -RRB- can not properly read those Radius DVD-RW disks prepared by any/all of my DVD-RW writers -LRB- Toshiba and TDK -RRB- . Since the price -LRB- about $ 0.40 a piece -RRB- is too low to be bothered for a refund , I 'll use them as PC system/data backups sorely.AC
 NVidia -LRB- of GeForce fame -RRB- has purchased 3dfx -LRB- maker of this card -RRB- - and NVidia has no plans to continue the Voodoo product line . Could still be a great 3D card , at the right price , and if you do n't mind no support ...
 let me start off just by saying that you should NOT GET THIS CARD . Whatever you do , there is absolutely no reason to purchase this graphics card at this point in time ... The Geforce3 Ti 200 is cheaper , yet performs much , much better . A radeon 8500 64MB would n't be a bad choice , either , as that is also much better . or even a geforce4 MX or geforce2 ultra might be better options than this one . They are all cheaper or the same price , yet they have much higher performance!Also , 3DFX , in case you did n't know , is out of business . That means if you are running on WinXP , then you will have to resort to unstable , risky 3rd Party drivers . Most of which do n't support a lot of games as well.Finally , the game devlopers of today , and tomorrow do not and will not continue to test with this card . Most new games -LRB- i.e. , Renegades , MoHAA , Freedom Force , SoF2 , etc. -RRB- do not fully support this piece of hardware . If you want a card that will work well with the newer games , then get something more stable from nVidia -LRB- ATI 's drivers are also bad , nVidia seems to be the best choice right now . -RRB- This card was the really great one back ... what ? ... 4 years ago ? But now that its creator is out of business , you ca n't find any good drivers , and games will not be supporting it fully in the future . If the game supports it , then you can usually run it with decent settings with a decent framerate . I can run CS at the max resolution -LRB- no AA -RRB- with a perfectly fine framerate.Voodoo 5 - best of its time , but now is not at all worth the -LSB- money -RSB- - stick with nVidia is what i say .
 This is a review that I believe many people in the market for a new card will find useful . The first card I purchased was the Phrophet 3D DDR-DVI and I was not exactly thrilled with the results of it on all my games . Then I bought the Voodoo 5 yesterday and here are the results . The overall picture clarity in games as Freespace 2 , Tachyon , and Homeworld was not even close the GE-Force far outpaced the Voodoo the picture the Voodoo put up was hazy to say the least even with the adjustments of anti alaizing done either with it or without it . The frame rates were about the same but if I had to choose I would say the GE-Force was better . In Homeworld with the voodoo if you zoomed all the way out on the galactic mat the picture vanished needless to say not a good thing to have happen . One more thing neither card was very good on Starlancer . Now this may not be the cards problem but my system instead , an Athlon 700mhz and Abit motherboard , but thats a whole seperate issue . Final verdict for the same price buy the GE-Force over the Voodoo 5 . Thanks .
 Do not buy this video card ! Even though numbers sound impressive , they are not all what they seem to be . That 64mb of memory , ca n't go wrong there right . Wrong , that 64mb of memory gets chewed up faster than the 4 VSA-100 chips can swallow . Therefore that 64mb of memory becomes more like 24mb ! And the Voodoo5 5500 inablility to produce per pixel shading or vertex skinning is astonishing . For it what gives you this graphics accelerater is not worth it 's price . Do n't buy this card . Buy yourself a nVidia GeForce2 GTS they cost the same price . Also the GeForce2 GTS has an on board GPU -LRB- which the Voodoo5 5500 does not -RRB- and does not need to reley on the system CPU to render light . Even though the Voodoo5 5500 is a decent card is not worth what 3dfx charges for it . Sure the box looks cool , but is n't what 's inside that counts !
 This product will soon be out of date ... 3Dfx is for sure -LRB- from a source at 3Dfx -RRB- is coming out with a better card that is not even called Voodoo!The name of the product has not been disclosed yet , but I trully asure u that this product will blow every competion away . Making all other Video cards obsolete within a few years . So please , for your own sanity ans checkbook . DO NOT PURCHASE THIS VIDEO CARD . In a few months your pacience will be rewarded with a truly monstrous achievement on 3Dfx 's behave . The Frankenstein of video cards .
 I picked up my card on the very first day of the release . I removed my old drivers from my OS -LRB- delete the old files , not just uninstall it -RRB- and put in the V5 55oo . Well ... I had a nVidia TNT2 Ultra card before and i hoped for some serious improvements . But i was wrong . The card gave me some improvement in games and the so called `` fsaa '' feature is nice , but overall i was very disappointed , because in high resolutions it is not fast enough on my PIII600 and the fsaa feature makes the picture very blurry . I brought my card back and own a nVidia Geforce GTS card now and i have to say that this was the right step to do . Please , dear customers , before you order that card , make sure that you like blurry pictures in games , make sure that your processor is fast enough -LRB- 650mhz and above -RRB- , otherwise you 'll be very very sorry !
 When I looked at this card back in feburary of 2001 i thought it was a good card . I installed it to windows ME and it worked great . BUT Try installing it to any windows NT platform and nothing but trouble . I did not expect for thier crummy software to work with NT but at least the driver so I could have a decent resolution , and that did not work . The worst thing is that 3dfx is NO longer a company . That means NO support in any way . I screwed up my computer numoruos times because of that stupid driver -LRB- that does not work -RRB- . I STRONGLY recommend NOT considering this card . ATI , pny technologies and Radeon are the best . Voodoo used to be a great card but their time of fame has gone and they need to go out silently .
 This video card is terrible . Okay , so 3dfx do n't exist any more , but let this be a lesson to you to always research before you buy . The Voodoo 5 was such a bad card that it is used as the standard against which bad products are held in the gaming community right now . The positive reviews were from people who loved 3dfx back when they were a good company that did good things . There is a reason they went out of business after releasing this card .
 i just wanted to post this review because the kids that also wrote one star reviews are NARKS !!!! , i love the Video Card
 I purchased these disks to archive digitalized , old , family movies . After I had successfully made 15 copies on Sony DVD-R disks using my computer I attempted to make my archival Pro Gold copy . In fact I tried three times
 I purchased sixteen of these batteries from Accessory Genie but only received 8 . After complaining , they sent me the 8 I had paid for but these batteries were much shorter than standard AA batteries and would not reach the contacts in my charger and in some of my equipment .
 I bought this player to take on my 5-mile a day walks . On the first day , the headset broke because the plastic is so cheap . It constantly skips and is ruining all the CD 's I use in it . The batteries bearly last two walks , for some reason , they are really drained by the player . Overall , I bought this player in December and am throwing it out in Mid February , along with two of my favorite CD 's . Not a great statement about the quality for the price . Do yourself a favor and trust me on this one !
 Bought it , used it , it stopped , exchanged it , it stopped also . I give up and am buying something else .
 I was on a road trip pulling out my new portable CD player for the first time . I slipped in a Dave Matthews Cd , listened to the first thirty seconds , and suddenly the music stopped . It was n't a problem with the earphones -LRB- even though you must know that the earphones were to most uncomfortable earphones I 've ever worn -RRB- , it was something within the player . And now I do n't even know if I can return it for a new one . It really made me mad . I would suggest buying your electronic equiptment from a store , then if you have a questions or a problem , you can easily talk to someone about an alternative
 Used this item in my car -LRB- briefly -RRB- . It stopped working after falling from my seat to the floor . I would recommend a more robust cd player , especially if you plan on travelling with it .
 I was pleased with this Koss cd player until it inexplicably stopped working . I was even pleased with the replacement I got from Target when the first one broke . After the second one inexplicably stopped working , Koss offered to replace it for a fee which was more than what I paid for it , and shipping was on me . Do n't waste your time or money on such a crappy disc player , get a decent one .
 I bought this unit about 6 months ago and was very pleased with it when I first received it . I was taken in by the pretty cool case and went for it . At this point , this is the status :1 -RRB- The switch membrane is total ... . The rewind button functions as the fast forward button and there is no way to go backwards within a song . This is a clear mechanical problem .2 -RRB- The anti-skip mechanism works poorly . Sure , it does n't stop dead when your car hits a bump , but it sure does n't pick back up where the song should be . It winds up skipping a groove or two -LRB- a couple of tenth 's of a second -RRB- and is really annoying . I have to place it on a towel as an extra shock absorber .3 -RRB- Very sensitive to dust or smudges . Very picky with CDRs - sometimes it likes them , sometimes it does n't . This is on the SAME disk across different days.Bottom line - I wish I would 've spent an extra 30-40 bucks and bought a better piece of equipment . I rate the sound an 8 out of 10 -LRB- but not through the included headphones -RRB- , but the mechanics rate a disappointing 3 out of 10 . You get what you pay for - SPEND A LITTLE MORE !
 I bought this same CD player a couple of years ago but I found out that was a big mistake . It started out working really well , and i thought all the negative reviews were wrong . Then after about a week the headphones just snapped as i went to put them on ... That 's not too big a deal cuz I had others , but about a week later all the buttons got messed up . For example the FF RW buttons switched jobs and so did others . It was really confusing and made it impossible to do anything other than just let the CD play , altho it somehow got put in a random order and the thing to stop that broke . A couple days later , the thing just quit . I tried new batteries but they didnt help . I never dropped it or anything ... If u can cough up 15 more dollars buy the cool Cd , CD-R , CD-RW , mp3 thing the have on the site .
 the buttons on this stopped working , the antiskip was very bad , hardly worked at all , it drained my batteries and was al together the worst discman i ever bought - including the one i bought 10 years ago!way to set cd players back in technology koss !
 This unit performs well while it lasts , but mine only lasted a few months when using with care . I do not jog . The unit stayed in my car the whole time . It just stopped working .
 I chose this CD player because of its great prize but . . It can not be stopped playing now ! A STOP button thinks it is `` move back '' and FF button works as `` modes '' . More , it eat batteries quickly , eg Philips LongLife in 2 hours . And do n't try jogging with it . . Nevertheless , its design is so cool .
 Admittedly , I only bought this player because it was purple , but I am still sorely dissapointed in it 's performance . I started having minor problems with it after about six months of moderate use . The sound quality has been degrading steadily , and as of today , the player is completely unusable . It skips every couple of seconds , even with a new disc on a flat , still surface . The anti-skip function actually makes it worse ! It has been less than a year since the date of purchase.Still , it is awfully cute . And for a few weeks there , I was reccomending it to everyone . If you are n't in it for the long haul , go ahead and buy this . If you want something more durable , keep shopping .
 I got this cd player for my birthday and i loved it . it looked really cool . i put my cd in and clicked on the anti skip button and it was pretty good . it skipped a little bit but not enough to be disappointed in . i did a lot of things with this cd player . i mowed with it and took it every where i went . But the first problem was that it ate up the batteries pretty quick . so if i wanted to take it somewhere i would have to take extra batteries . and also it didnt tell you how much power is left in my batteries until they totally run out . also when i mowed it would constantly skip and would really get annoying . and then after about 6 months of having it , it just stopped working . i was very mad . we had to throw it away . so if you enjoy buying a new cd player every 6 months you should get this one .
 I bought this CD player for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas and now after a months use , it no longer plays music ! The Koss website does not have any support for their CD products and so any thought of returning this product is forgotten . I read all the great reviews for this product here and decided to purchase the CD player , but I am urging you not to buy it . The bad reviews are very valid !
 This was the first portable cd player that I bought and waspleased with it for the first 3 hours . I bought this for -LRB- $ -RRB- ... . The price was the reason that I bought it . I read the reviews on Amazon.com and thought I was aware of all the downfalls . The sound output could have been louder for my tastes . The lack of a resume after stopping it did n't concern me . The shock protection worked well . In a car on my lap it did n't skip with anti-skip off . It took a good tap on the cover -LRB- anti-skip off -RRB- to make it skip . After a skip sometimes it took a little long to start playing music again . After around three hours of play I had to replace the batteries . I admit that I was using cheap batteries but even the best batteries would n't last that much longer I assume . I tested the batteries after it would n't use them and they were 3/4 full ! I tried using some rechargables that I have but they only hold a 75 % charge now so they never even played a song . So less then a week later I returned it for a full refund . After a couple of days and a little more research I just bought a Sony D-EJ611 G-Protection . I ended up spending twice as much money as I planned on but I finally have a portable cd player.To sum up my experience , you get what you pay for . If you just planned on using the supplied AC adapter it would n't be of concern . Save your money and get something that wo n't bankrupt you in batteries .
 I bought this for our son 5 1/2 . He loves the color purple and I was looking for a simple player . I got it - he loved the color and it was nice and simple . Here 's the but ! He dropped it -LRB- one week after getting it -RRB- the top broke . Lots of tears . Called Koss Customer Service to find out that not only would they not service it , but they wanted me to mail it back with all accessories along with a check for fourty dollars . They would then send a new one ! I said , `` Ca n't I just get a new player ? I do n't need the accessories . Since that was full price why do I have to bother mailing it back ? '' `` We are not a retail chain ! '' was the answer that I got . I will not be buying any new Koss product , if this is there idea of customer service .
 The ONLY good thing about this CD player is the way it looks ! The sound is so fuzzy . After a couple minutes of play , it starts making a really high-pitched sound like DE-DEEE-BE-NI-FII-DEEE ! The headphones ALWAYS FALL OFF YOR HEAD , and you have to be Arnold S. to press the buttons ! I am not kidding . But , if you like the sound of this CD player , go ahead and buy it . But , you 'll regret it ... majorly ! Thank you for reading my review .
 After reading god knows how many reviews , I decided on this one . Got it promptly when Amazon/UPS said I would , opened it , played it , purposly droped in on the box it was shipped in , and kept on playin ' without a skip !! But while just listening to it in the garage it just quit , nothing , changed the batteries , nothing , used the adaptor ... nothing . I 'm hoping when I return it for a replacement that it wo n't quit on me again !!
 I purchased this cd player and when I received it I had to send it back to Koss for repair . It would play for about a minute and a half and then just shut down.Several years ago this also happened with a pair of Koss headphones I bought.I am curious to see how long this repair process will take.Seems like Koss needs to improve their quality control.I do think I would have liked this product if it had worked .

 I bought this CD player for its great price , excellent looks , and its numerous features . I read poor reviews , and dismissed them as rare occurences . I was soooo wrong ... When it arrived , it would play for a little while , and then suddenly turn off . Then , the buttons stopped working . I had -LSB- ... -RSB- replace it , and guess what ? AFTER 2 WEEKS , THE SECOND ONE BEGAN TO HAVE PROBLEMS TOO ! The buttons are all messed up -- the stop button skips the track and the skip buttons do random things , and because of this it 's almost impossible to turn off . The return period had expired , but it was still covered by Koss Electronics ' 90 day warranty . However , I needed a copy of the invoice , AND -LSB- ... -RSB- . So now I 'm stuck with it , at least it can just play . The good thing , though , is that this CD player has EXCELLENT sound , and probably the best I have ever heard . I also like the design .
 I bought this cd player because it appeared to have the standard options , was a high seller , and had good reviews by other users . The player would begin to emit a static-like sound after about 20 minutes of playing . After about the 3rd use it began to skip and would not stop . This was my first portable cd player and I was very disappointed
 KOSS is a good bargain if their products actually worked over the long haul . BUT THEY DO N'T ! Trust me , or you will pay with a couple of 20 's and your sanity . I am not the only one , my cousin purchased the same KOSS CD player and one month later he threw it off a 5 story apartment building balcony . It 's a piece of crap .
 Wow , I see since I bought this unit there have been lots of people with the same troubles I had . I will simply add to the chorus of voices who have said :1 -RRB- Eats batteries like mad .2 -RRB- Within about a month of buying the unit the buttons stopped working properly . The reverse button advanced tracks , stop would often switch modes , etc. . ABSOLUTELY FRUSTRATING3 -RRB- The anti-skip protection did not work very well . I got nothign like 40 seconds out of the skip protection and this is just holding the unit flat while walking at a moderate pace.I was extremely dissapointed with this player . Mine finally just stoppped working one day ...
 Its a POS ! It broke the 1st week I had it then I returned it and the 2nd one the headphones broke and you can only hear out of one side . I put a new pair on it and it worked but now you ca n't hear anything ! Ive only had it about a year !
 When I first bought this CD player , it was great . The sound and headphones were excellent and it was really cool looking . It was great for a few months , then it started to just turn off in the middle of playing a CD . To get it to work again , I had to hit it really hard , cause all the buttons stopped working ! So as you can see this CD player is not worth the money . If you want a CD player that lasts a few months , this is the one for you . If you want a quality CD player , go with a Panasonic or a Sony .
 This CD player eats batteries faster than I can stuff pork rinds into my mouth with both hands . After the first five or six cds it also started skipping every time it was jostled . But hey ... it 's purple . And that 's worth a couple of stars .
 this is a TERRIBLE discman . Lasted me about a month , then the anti-skip started dying , now after owning it for only a month and a half - it does n't even play cds . and i ca n't return it ... im out $ 50
 From reading the other reviews , I see that the two unreliable points are the anti-skip and the control buttons . In my case , the anti-skip works fine , but the control buttons failed after a few months . Now , sometimes they work , and sometimes not . If I had bought it at a local store , I 'd be returning it.The unit also has a crude look to it , not as refined in appearance as the Sonys , for instance . As soon as I opened the box , I was disappointed with the appearance , just not quite up to modern standards .
 Skip protection does not work . I can not wear it and walk on the treadmill at a brisk pace . The buttons do not work reliably either . I can push a button several times before the feature engages . This was a cute color , but performance wise , it 's just another piece of junk .
 It 's cheap , true . The bad news is you 're not saving money , you 're wasting it . Do n't buy this if you need shock protection - the `` 40 second skip protection '' simply does n't work , it jumps all over the place , because after one shock the alleged `` shock protection '' needs to build back up before it can take another mild bump . Okay , fair enough , maybe you would n't expect it to be too effective on a unit costing so little , but on mine even the buttons do n't work properly . Press a button and it 's pretty much a lottery what will happen . Press play and it might play , it might not , or it might just play one track in repeat mode . Press stop and it might stop , but it probably wont , press stop three times and it might . Press track skip or scan and you 're opening a whole can of worms - virtually anything could result , except of course the one thing you want to happen . The headphones needless to say , are pathetic , and presumably all that `` shock protection '' and malfunctioning uses a lot of juice , because it goes through batteries like there 's no tomorrow . This CD player is all the proof you 'll ever need that you get what you pay for . Looks cool . Does n't work . Do n't buy .
 This was one of my first lens purchases . I initially enjoyed it however as I became more and more serious about photography I found that this lens was not producing the quality I was looking for . For one , the chromatic abberation at the long end was terrible when the image was viewed at 100 % . Secondly , when shooting wide open , the images are soft although stopping down a stop or two corrects this . I ended up trading this lens in towards the purchase of an EF 70-200 f/4L IS USM lens.This lens , however , is not a complete loss . The 3-stop IS is fantastic and the focusing is relatively fast and accurate . I would suggest people just starting out on a tight budget purchase this lens if the higher end lenses are simply out of reach especially if you do n't plan on making outlandishly huge prints from your photos . That said , if I had to relive this purchase , I would have held out for a lens with a higher resale value and higher quality .
 I am very disappointed with the performance of this lens . I expected better from Canon since I am a long-time Canon user and have many lenses by them . Images are soft to semi-sharp at all focal lengths . 300mm is never sharp . When enlarged even 25 % all images go very soft and become noisy and would be useless for printing . I get much better results with all my other Canon lenses . For the price of this lens I expected much better . My son has a cheaper canon telephoto and gets better images . Looking at the reviews others have written on Amazon , it may be that this particular lens has an inherent optics flaw . The IS works fine in both settings , but the images are still not crisp .
 Here 's why I give this such a low rating - the IS motor sounds like a cheese grater in the lens . Now , I might not make a big deal about this if the kit lens on my 60D made ANY SOUND AT ALL - but it does n't - it 's silent . NO WAY should a lens like this be THAT loud . A click here or a light buzz there is fine - this is way beyond that.So I headed off to a local camera store after the grinding sounds to try some of these lenses in this class : At a local camera store I shot this one , the 70-300 Tamron and the 70-200 f4 L all on my 60D . To be honest - the Tamron is pretty damn close to the 70-200L in sharpness - but the L is a faster focus for sure.Point being - this lens was n't even competing ... the images were NOT of the same quality as the Tam or the L - they were just blah . Guys at the camera store said the same things about the shots , saw the same issues I saw.So - for those of you who are happy with this lens - great . I found the IS morot noise to be unbelievable and unacceptable ... I do n't want people looking at me thinking my camera is dead when it 's just stabilizing an image ... I went with the Tamron 70-300mm from the local store and LOVE the results on the 60D -LRB- the lens correction profiles in the 60D recognize the 70-300mm Tamron -RRB- . Guess that 's why they make so many - to each his own.P.S . - this lens at the camera store was also way too loud in IS mode .
 Having bought Canon EF 70-300mm f/4 -5.6 IS USM Lens for Canon EOS SLR Cameras on Amazon.com -LRB- Amazon Order Number
 I returned this lens after 3 days . Autofocus searched forever in moderate low light . The IS was extremely loud . The images were not of any significant quality worth tolerating either issue . Save some money buy an L series .
 This lens sells new at Best Buy for $ 500 + , the price they show before the 51 % cut is way out of focus ... Has never sold for $ 900 + , not even on the Canon Direct web site . .
 The product is nice if you can ever get one ... Twice I have ordered lens with reasonable used prices.Both times the lens was never shipped . I am beggginging tobelieve that these used sellers are bogus to force thebuyer to pay full cost . Which I have no intention of doing.I 'm patient and will now buy on EBay . As a retiree I have allthe time I need to waut to get a lens
 Liked the lens at first but after looking closer at pictures that were taken at shorter distances they were very good , but when taking distance shots they were blurry . I switched to manual focus and the pictures were much better . I tried different settings on the camera with no luck . Returned lens and purchased the canon 70-200 L 4.0 , so far much much better , it 's the lens I wanted all along but the cost held me back . Save your money and buy what u want .
 I read every review and test I could find while deciding between this lens and the 70-200 f4 L . In the end , I opted for stabilization and reach - big mistake . Sharpness and color are poor on this lens and it can be very frustrating when you review your photos at the end of a trek and toss , literally , all of them . I sold this lens at significant loss and bought a used 70-200 f2 .8 L -LRB- non IS -RRB- . The difference was stunning . There is a reason the f4 is best in its class , do n't make my mistake . You can easily crop your super sharp photos to match the reach of the 70-300 . I 've since bought a used 400mm f5 .6 L - even at f5 .6 the L glass is so superior to other products that it is easily hand-holdable -LRB- this lens is non IS -RRB- in all but the lowest light . Additionally , the L lenses are built like tanks ! The f4 L will not dissapoint , buy it .
 At first , this cable worked great ; it was fast and sturdy . But when I tried to unplug it , it was nearly impossible . It immediately got stuck in the port . I tried all sorts of online tutorials , using a tweezer or a flathead screwdriver , and when that failed I called around asking for help ; I was at my wit 's end because I did n't know whether to keep trying lest it damage the Ethernet port itself . Eventually I suceeded , using a tweezer , but still every time I unplug it I must use the tweezer , which is inconvenient because I often bring my laptop on the go . Perhaps the plug goes too deep into the port , making it impossible to push down on the tab with your finger . I would not recommend this cable for people who regularly plug and unplug it .
 Forget this camera . After owning several digital camera 's over the years and knowing how to operate them after only a couple of days it takes constant programming for every picture you take in order to get a good photo . This is not the camera for just grabbing and taking a photo . It requires thought and total concentration to just get an acceptable photo . I 'd buy an off the shelf Kodak from Kmart before buying this one again .
 I can not review this product for you because the seller has never sent it to me . Nor has my money been returned . I am very disgusted with the whole business . It 's too bad . It looked like a good camera .
 How did the ` Electronics viewer from Washington rate this card if it 's not available ? -LRB- Especially when he recommends another card as ` better ' . -RRB- I 've checked a number of other sites and the PC vs. is definitly not available . I 'm sure everyone accessing this site would like to know the answer to that . I even e-mailed Voodoo concerning a projected release date with no response . If you choose not to release this commentary then you should delete the ` rating ' from ` Washington ' as irrelevant . Actually the whole rating system is irrelevant , in my opinion , because it reflects opinions of ` past ' purchases without correlation to ` upgrade ' purchases . Is this fair , do you think ?
 I 'm just joking about the rating it . It really is good .
 Well , I am pretty disappointed with this prodcut as it spoilt my new Krups coffee maker as well . Its supposed to take loads of upto 1600 Watts but my 1200 Watt coffee maker was apparently too much for it to handle .
 I used this in the UK running 240 volts for my 1600 watt US hairdryer . The heating element turned to toast and burnt my hair .
 I ` am afraid to use this converter after reading all reviews about it , I ` am trying to use it with Projector -LRB- sharp image -RRB-
 Go to Radio Shack for this . The converter overheated as it was plugged in and sparked upon connecting the appliance to it -LRB- well within the 1600 watts specs -RRB- . It fortunately burned out prior to damaging anything . Definitely an unsafe product from my point of view . No UL or CE approvals stamped on it .
 I have been unable to get my NEC DVD Burner to write on these disks . Upgraded drivers and looked at Radius site which say they are compatable with my drive but so far no luck . I also bought the + bundle and they work with my dirve but write at 2X . I am sorry I purchased these .
 Radius Technology DVDs ID as `` OPTODISC '' brand media . -LRB- That is , OPTODISC makes the discs for Radius -RRB- . OPTODISC media are generally found to be lousy
 This product has two rather serious design flaws ,1 . -RRB- When charging with this cord one can not listen to music , podcasts , etc. , as it cuts off the Itouch 's sound .2 . -RRB- It tends to melt/catch on fire.The company which manufactures this product , Sakar International , has a strict no refund policy ; they are based in India and only offer replacements . I politely declined their offer of a future house fire and threw the charger away.I bought this charger at a K-Mart last weekend because I was out of town and had left mine at home ; I wish I had time then to check reviews.In short , do not buy Sakar products unless you like broken , dangerous things .
 I have five kids and a bunch of ipods in my home . I purchased several of these chargers because they obviously needed a wall charger , which ipod does not include with ipod purchase . My daughter plugged it in last night before she went to bed and woke up it being melted and burnt . The ipod is okay , but the square part that actually plugs into the ipod , the plasitic melted all around the metal going to the ipod and the metal was burnt . OMG !! I 'm just so thankful that it did not catch fire in my daughters room . I did call the company with my concern of the product being defective and a possible fire hazard and they are shipping a new one right away and promised it would not be defective . Huh , how would they know ?? Do n't think they should promise that and should be more concerned with a lawsuit over someone getting hurt or dying in a fire it may cause to somewhat else . They did n't even want to see the defective product . Very unprofessional !! We will no longer use any of their chargers . Very much a lack for the safety of people that purchase their items . I will be purchasing the higher priced wall charger from apple and just deal with it . Safety is most important and purchasing a cheap item is not always worth it . I am all for saving money , but not in this case .
 Worked fine for the first two uses . Today , it is going to the landfill along with the rest of the garbage . Although the metal prongs were making contact with the outlet , the charger would only charge while holding the charger against the outlet in a certain way . After a few attempts , the charger was working again , without human intervention.Just when I was comfortable that it was working , there was a bright flash and a puff of smoke.Zero stars as a chargerFive stars as a fire hazard .
 I bought this camera for the ` wireless ' feature . Found out after it ONLY works -LRB- theoretically -RRB- with XP , 32 bit , SP2 nad if you have anything else forget it . So I tried to install it in my home computer which happens to have exactly the above parameters , nothing doing , not even with the help of my geekiest friend . Excluding the wireless feature the camera is very pedestrian , my Sony is 10x better and I imagine there are dozens of others as well .
 I 'm living away from home for some months and needed an `` all in one '' . This seemed like the ideal device . HOWEVER : -LRB- 1 -RRB- The drivers include spy software
 I recently bought this printer due to features and price . While it does a great job , it uses way too much ink . I do n't do a lot of printing and I am having to buy ink cartridges on a weekly basis . I had an Epson before this printer and will be going back to the Epson brand.I personally think that Lexmark is making their printers affordable and then sticking it to you with the ink usage and cost of cartridges . I would not recommend this printer .
 I bought this because it was cheap . I seriously got what I paid for . The printer would n't connect with either of our computers -LRB- vista or xp -RRB- . It took me two weeks and four phone calls with customer service for them to believe it was the printer , not my computers . The first week they sent me a new usb cable because mine was `` old '' . That did n't work because the problem is their shoddy product.Then they told me my usb ports were not active in either of my computers , which is garbage , because I use them for my flash drive and my mp3 player . I finally had to threaten to talk to a manager before they would send me a new one.This was a horrible experience and a horrible company to work with . I will never buy a Lexmark again .
 If you want a cheap , disposable product - you 've got it . A friend bought this for his new Windows Vista system -LRB- Problem # 1 -RRB- , and asked me to see if I could n't get it to work faster . Killing all the annoying noises and print `` enhancing '' color and sharpness tools did n't even put a dent in the abysmal performance of this device . The only way this would even appear to work faster is if you left the printer here on earth and ran your computer at the event horizon of a black hole . Lexmark continues to try and rival HP for frill filled drivers that are more annoying than useful - although they ensure you use ALL their software by making the printer non-functional if you fail to install EVERY LAST FRIGGIN BIT of it . AND , as another reviewer noted , God forbid that you 're somewhere you do n't have an internet connection or refuse to allow local SERVER services on your machine.As far as scanning goes , fergeddaboutit . I clocked this puppy at almost a FULL TWO PAGES PER HOUR on a simple black and white text page . I had to stop the color scan test as I was ready to commit suicide.This is my third experience with LEXMARK , and it 's `` three-strikes , you 're out ! '' Unless you 're otherwise trapped , find a cheap EPSON or CANON instead !!
 I do n't have any issues with the printer itself . It prints as I need it to . I have it linked to my home PC and only print research or personal Word documents , nothing more than occasional needs . However , I needed to purchase a new black ink cartridge , I went onto Lexmark 's website and ordered the cartridge based upon the printer I have . When I received it , it did not work . I then contacted one of their representatives and ordered the cartridge they instructed me to purchase , I installed it today and it does not work . I will never own a another Lexmark product . This printer will be in the trash , along with the $ 50 of ink cartridges I purchased .
 I got this all in one a while back and it was pretty easy to set up in windows . Had a minor issue with an xml settings file , but as soon as I overwrote that it worked just fine.In Linux however , it just wo n't work at all . No drivers for it and no workarounds.I would n't recommend this printer if you work primarily in Linux . Windows is ok though .
 It 's not worth it , take it from me . First , if you 're on a Mac , it 's going to be an uphill struggle with the driver . And if you think you can go on the website and get the proper driver -LRB- the cd only has drivers for Windows -RRB- , you can plan to make a day of it with all the emailing them you 'll need to do.Secondly , the ink issue is ridiculous . Imagine you want to take out your current cartridge to see what type it is . Well , once you put it back in , even though it 's still got ink , you 'll not be able to use it . You 'll get error messages galore because the printer thinks you 've cheated and refilled the cartridge , so you wo n't be able to use it . Why does it think this ? Because the Lexmark driver includes a file that stores information about the ink cartridges you use . That 's right - spyware is included in the software ! Second , if you try to use a black ink cartridge in addition to the color one , it wo n't be used . The printer will mix the three colored inks to create a crappy dark color that is not black . Forget about professional looking documents for work , it wo n't happen.Last , if you try to call Lexmark to work through these multiple problems on the phone , all you 'll be able to get are customer service people who are rude and barely speak English . They will interrupt you as you repeat yourself over and over to different people who they transfer you to.I would not recommend any product made by Lexmark as their policies are made intentionally frustrating in a transparent attempt to have the customer spend more money . Also their products are made of the flimsiest plastic parts .
 We bough our Lexmark x2500 printer primarily because it promised to be a good choice economically . We were mistaken.The printer is an ink sink . When you put in a new ink cartridge , you are always required to print an `` alignment '' page . This page is supposed to make sure he printer is printing correctly , and it is not optional . HUGE waste of ink . We are required to have a color ink cartridge in the printer , even though we never use color . Also , our printer went through a glitch phase where ever time we turned our computer off , it thought the printer needed to be `` realigned '' and made us print a new sheet . Not happy about that.In addition , the software that comes with he printer leaves much to be desired . The layout and primer boxes are cartoon-like . Ever time you do a print job , a box pops up , and if you 're anywhere near low on your ink cartridge , it obnoxiously asks you if you want to order more ink `` right away . '' It 's an advertising gimmick , and I ca n't change my settings to take the thing away.Scans well . Prints well . Hardware is great . Software is infinitely annoying . -LRB- I double posted this review , because I was uncertain which produc it was acually for
 I 've had great fun with my Geko 301 , but it 's also been somewhat frustrating . I see that other reviewers have also experienced problems such as no functionality in forests . If you 're spending a day walking in a forest , the device is essentially useless . I wish someone had told me that beforehand . I 'm in South Africa , incidentally . Worse , my second Geko 301 in a period of three years has just experienced display panel failure . The whole screen goes black and you can faintly see the information if you hold the screen to the sun at an angle ! The first time this happened to me , Garmin said there was nothing they could do . I wonder if they 're going to say the same this time .
 At first , this cable worked great ; it was fast and sturdy . But when I tried to unplug it , it was nearly impossible . It immediately got stuck in the port . I tried all sorts of online tutorials , using a tweezer or a flathead screwdriver , and when that failed I called around asking for help ; I was at my wit 's end because I did n't know whether to keep trying lest it damage the Ethernet port itself . Eventually I suceeded , using a tweezer , but still every time I unplug it I must use the tweezer , which is inconvenient because I often bring my laptop on the go . Perhaps the plug goes too deep into the port , making it impossible to push down on the tab with your finger . I would not recommend this cable for people who regularly plug and unplug it .
 I bought this item from Amazon about 1 month ago . Firstly it worked great , completedly satisfy with this product . But now it makes too much noise . I can not turn it on at night or in my office .
 Cheap plastic , poorly designed ; Bottom line
 Why?That 's all I can ask . This pad has an on/off switch located on the cord , which is tiny as extremely easy to break . I have owned TWO -LRB- TWO !!! -RRB- of these pads and BOTH have broken , IN THE SAME SPOT ! Why put a switch on it ? Why not just unplug the usb cord ? I guess its there to break so that you have to buy a new one . Buyer beware - this one small flaw is a doozie.Other than that it worked fine when it was n't broken . But if you want something that you know will last longer than a week , look at something better .
 I was using this with my macbook pro.This is a horribly designed chill pad . It does n't raise the laptop up enough to allow any significant air flow , to actually make the fans worth the battery consumption -LRB- which was n't too bad -RRB- . The two rubber feet on the top edge that raise your laptop up will melt onto the case , and leave black marks . The little dongle switch falls apart , constantly , and you have to push it back together . And WHY is everyone making chill pads out of PLASTIC ??? It 's called aluminum ! Use it!I had this for about 3 months before it stopped working . You can not set your laptop on your lap while using this , it does n't even come close to covering the bottom of my laptop , and the fans are laughably weak . Unfortunately , this seems to be the case with most cooling pads .
 I bought one and it worked for 2 months and then I had to discard it . Would like it to last atleast a year or so
 This is the second time that I have ordered this product . The first time it stopped working after about six months . The power cord at the base , as others have already mentioned , is made very flimsy and shorted out . I gave the credit that even though I am not rough on my electronics , maybe it was me , so I purchased a second . I figured that I could actually keep the old one just in case as backup and I would have the cord that I could use on either of them . Well , that theory went out the window when I received the new one . Be warned that it is not the one in the photo . It is a new , `` updated '' , version . So , among other changes , the cords are not interchangeable . In reviewing the one in the photo , it was quiet , cooled wonderfully , but again , the power cord - both the part you plug into the cooler and the on/off switch -LRB- which fell apart after about 2 weeks -RRB- were flimsy and did not hold up . This new one , they fixed the problem with the on/off switch by adding a button onto the cooler itself , but the cord remains flimsy . It does not cool nearly as well as the original . My laptop remains extremely warm when using it , unlike the original , where my laptop stayed cool to the touch . It is also very noisy - actually would wake my partner when I used it in bed . Notice I said `` used '' not `` use '' . Yup ! This one has went Kaput too
 Interestingly enough , this product was offered on the HP site when I ordered my new DV9000 laptop . As previous reviews have stated , it is indeed made of low grade plastic . I find it puzzling that HP would recommend this item , considering the fans line up in no way whatsoever with the laptop 's cooling fans . The USB cord is too long and comes with an ON/OFF slide switch -LRB- which failed quickly -RRB- . I cut the switch and wired it directly ; it worked OK for a while . Now the USB plug on the chill pad itself has to be in just the right position to power the fans . A waste of money ; do n't bother .
 I purchased this chill pad for our 17 '' laptop . The product worked well at first but after a couple of months the blades on the fans started to break off until what we are now left with is a plastic portable base . I would not recommend this product to anyone unless you are looking for a cheap temporary replacement to the one you already own .
 I have a Dell Inspiron 8500 that is now 7 years old and has logged hundreds of thousands of miles , so I take care of my stuff . This Chill Pad -LSB- ASIN : B0000AKA8Y Targus PA248U Notebook Chill Pad -RSB- was purchased for my notebook . It did cool pretty well . Laptop speed , performance and battery life improved while using the Chill Pad . After just 5 months of use I have just thrown the Chill Pad in the garbage . Just three weeks after I bought it the plastic feet began to fall off . No problem I thought and purchased new plastic nubs to repalce those that had fallen off . Whatever paint is on the unit , the plastic bumps will NOT stick to even after using the original adhesive backing , -LRB- which has stuck to my Dell for years -RRB- contact cement , and super glue . No plastic bumps on the bottom -- big discomfort on my legs . Today , I noticed that my laptop was hot . I checked the Chill Pad and the fans were not running . Initial troubleshooting pointed to the USB plug not making proper contact , so power to the unit was intermittent . Replaced the USB plug . Chill Pad ran for about 30 seconds . Further troubleshooting revealed a broken wire at the flexy joint on the mini-plug that plugs into the Chill Pad . The wire is so thin that I had a heck of a time trying to fix it -LRB- VERY CHEAP -RRB- and finally disassembled the unit and wired direct to the fans . Testing my work , only one fan was running . I surmised that even though I soldered all connections , shrink wrapped everything AND used a grommet at the edge of the Chill Pad case , the Targus wire was so thin that something probably pulled loose during reassembly . Rather than waste any more bench time on a unit which had 32 gauge wire in it I threw the whole Chill Pad in the garbage . By the way , my Inspiron , with a 16:9 LCD screen overlapped both sides of the Chill Pad by almost an inch . If you are looking for quality , and a large enough cooling solution for a 17 '' laptop , look elsewhere than Targus .
 I bought this cooler at the same time as I bought my Acer Aspire 5600 laptop -LRB- almost 2 years ago now -RRB- . It worked well for a few months and then began cutting in and out forcing me to jiggle the connector the USB cable plugged into to keep the fans running . Eventually it stopped completely . I took it apart to see if I could repair the connector but it was n't possible . I 've been using the laptop without a cooler but I 'm very careful not to block any vents . So far , so good .
 I 've bought at least 4 of these and every one has lasted for about 2 months . The only reason I continued to buy them is because I could never find another brand . I finally found some others here on amazon that I will try.I would not recommend these to anyone . They are garbage , plain and simple .
 I bought this item back to complement my new laptop that gets pretty hot when running high end applications and computer games . It worked great but after about 4 weeks the plug that connects to the cooling pad became loose and the fan would only come on if I moved the cord `` just right . '' A couple weeks later it stopped working for good . I would recommend buying another cooling pad and maybe spending a little extra for a higher quality product . This cooling pad is cheap for a reason - and it makes no sense to have to buy the same thing twice . I am now looking at replacing this chillpad , seeing as how it does n't work at all anymore .
 I used this product for a few months and then it just completely died . I kept it in good condition and everything but it just stopped working .
 This cooling fan worked for about 6 months before the USB power cable frayed and it developed cracks in the plastic . I would n't recommend it if you 're going to be messing with the cord much .
 At first this worked great , but three months after I bought it stopped working . The point where the power connector plugs into the Targus stopped transferring power . If I hold the connector at a certain angle and do n't let go then it will work . Very disappointing , but I guess you get what you pay for .
 Do not buy from this company that originate from Brooklyn . The cooling pad was delivery 2 days after I order but when it came , I immediately wrote for refund and nobody has yet to reply me -LRB- today is 2nd day -RRB- The pad I bought is used because there are scratchs mark over the cooling pad plus the two plastic cyclinder where the fan is blowing is scrap.Moreover to further confirm my suspectious I check the opening gap of the console and find that the dust being accumulate below the fan . This is redicules as new pad would not have any dust on it !!!!! Pls beware of this company !!!!
 It cools by forced air , which is the best method . The raised top and channels in the top surface allow for air dissipation , and the intake channel in the back supplies air to the fans . But ... the power cord does n't last . I just went through my 3rd one of these in about 14 months . Unfortunately , I 've researched for another option and can not find one that I believe will work effectively . Since my exhaust fan is small , a pad that sucks air might cause a vacuum inside the notebook housing resulting in overheating . I think that I 'll purchase another one of these , locally , keep the receipt , and return or exchange it when it breaks down .
 I bought my laptop and decided to buy the chill mat to keep my laptop cool . For some reason it has quit working after only a couple of months . I will not buy another one .
 After 1 week the performance seemed to degrade ; after a month it no longer worked . For that first week it cooled quite nicely though .
 I bought this item not to cool my laptop , but to provide some insulation from the heat when it 's on my lap sitting in a chair . I 'm very satisfied with it 's being able to accomplish that . HOWEVER , the cord ended up breaking after a few months . Targus replaced it at no charge which is good , but still a hassle . Now one of the two fans has started making a racket when I first turn it on . After a bit it settles down but very noisy at first .
 I bought this and have regretted it ever since . The fans are too loud and the cord does not stay in the cooler.It 's cheap for a reason .
 For this to be of vaule , a laptop or other device must have an air passage on the bottom . For laptops , every model I have seen takes air in on the bottom and exhausts it out the side . This device would help to increase the volume of air in the bottom of the device -- except this device pulls air down rather than pushing it up . Hence , this device would cause the effect of starving the laptop of air , rather than helping it . Be cautious in your use -- note the device pulls air into the fans .
 My laptop has no difference in temperature than sitting on hardwood . So it 's job of cooling my laptop left a lot to be desired , but hey , it angled it nicely for typing . About a month after I bought it though , one of the rubber pads that elevates your computer slid off , it was merely glued . I ca n't imagine what I could have done to prevent this , as it never left my desk ... so I 'm going to attribute this to poor craftsmanship.All in all I love Targus products but this felt like trash , you get what you pay for definitely is true here .
 I purchased this product about a year ago and it has already taken a dive . It worked well when new and kept the computer cool and ran guietly until one day the fans started to make a squeeling sound and out it went .
 This product worked really well , until it just stopped working . I had the unit for 45 days and then it ceased to work . I think it is probably a short in the cord , but it is cheaply made and I got what I paid for . I should have read the other reviews and noticed that others had , had similar problems .
 I had a problem with my laptop overheating , so I picked this up . For the three weeks it worked , it worked well ; no problems with heat whatsoever , laptop was completely cool even after many hours of continuous use and the internal fans rarely had to run.However , after about three weeks it just stopped . The problem seems to be the on/off switch or connections to the switch . I would look for a different product with a sturdier construction.Update
 I use a laptop since I am always on the go . I noticed that my laptop often gets hot since it is on all the time . I thought that getting this would help reduce the heat and possibly help the performance of my laptop . It works and the quailty of the product seems to be great , but it really does n't do much , if anything at all . I think the idea of the cooling pad is great , but not effective .
 I thought this would be a great item but when it arrived I found that it just was n't what I was looking for . The fan did n't alway work , there were no adjustable legs on it and it just did n't live up to my expectations . I returned it for the iCurve laptop stand and am estatic .
 When I bought this , it did n't run all that well although when the fans did actually work , my machine was definitely cooler . However , the fans continued to stop for no reason and now the chill pad does not work at all , and it is only 2 weeks after my purchase . I would not recommend this product . Although it did cool my laptop , the fact that it stopped working after only two weeks makes the purchase waste of money .
 And it just makes the cycles of heating and cooling worse . Before , the max temp was 60deg C , and that was a concern . Afterwards , the temp of the laptop went as high as 80deg C. Terrible result . But I lived with it for a few more weeks , as taking the laptop off the pad cooled things down . Yes , with heavy maintenance , it led to lower average temps . But it is much more work than should be necessary .
 i recommend do n't buy this product because i waist my money whith that , does ` nt work , and made some noise , my laptop not get the cool tempeture than they said ...
 Got this item thru Staples -- at a substantially higher price than Amazon . What a waste ! This item was DOA.It SHUT DOWN MY LAPTOP INSTANTLY . Dead . Kaput . Gone . The chill pad 's fan never worked -- AND it shut down EVERYTHING on my laptop -- no response at all . Would n't even go thru the startup sequence . Once the `` kill pad '' was unplugged from my laptop , the computer returned to life , with the help of a complete restore cycle . I could not return it fast enough.DON ' T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE . BAD CHOICE AND A COMPUTING HAZARD . MAY DAMAGE YOUR COMPUTER . I learned this the hard way : -LRB-
 Excellent product except that the Targus Chill Mat has the following warning -LRB- a warning that is starting to show up on far too many frequently used , high contact electronic devices -RRB- -- This product contains chemicals , including lead , known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm . Wash hands after handling . -- First -LRB- rationally -RRB- , except for the lead reference -LRB- which is concerning in itself -RRB- , the warning is far to vague to be useful . What `` chemicals '' are we talking about ? At what levels ? Where are the chemicals ? Inside out of reach , in the casing , or in the cord ? Is this a real concern or a California over reaction ? None of this information is available so we get to guess at our risk . That 's a game I 'm not willing to play.Second -LRB- outrage -RRB- , this is a product designed and marketed for lap use , which means constant handling ! To knowingly produce a product from a material that should require such a warning label is irresponsible - especial for a high contact item ! It is also ridiculous to expect consumers to -LRB- a -RRB- see the fine print on the packaging -LRB- it should be bold and an eye-catching -RRB- , -LRB- b -RRB- remember the warning for the life of the product -LRB- there is no warning label on the Chill Mat , only on the packaging -RRB- , and -LRB- c -RRB- be able to washing their hands after handling -LRB- if you are using it on your lap its impractical to impossible to `` wash your hands after handling '' -RRB- . I read the fine print to late , the package is open , so now I 'm looking for a replacement that is n't knowingly toxic to the user ... -LRB- And for those who like `` made in the USA '' labels , this is made in China . -RRB- If not for the disregard for human health the warning implies , I would rate this product as five stars -LRB- no other problems after a few weeks of use -RRB- and buy others -LRB- but not now -RRB- . It does what it was designed to do very well and my other half and I are vary please with its performance . Ours is made of thick , sturdy plastic , is feather light , and has quiet fans - no louder than the laptop 's - that saves our legs from the Dell 710m slow broil -LRB- bottom intake , left vent , perfect size -RRB- and even help keep the laptop -LRB- including the bottom -RRB- cool to the touch -LRB- It 's not unusual for me to sit with it in my lap for 12 hours at a time -RRB- . And so far it works well with our new Dell e1505 -LRB- back intake , left vent , inch or less overhang all sides -RRB- . The only thing I 'd like to see is one USB pass through so you do n't lose a USB slot . To bad it needs a hazard warning ...
 I purchased this product and found it to be extremely cheap and flimsy feeling . The right front screw housing broke when pulling the unit from it 's packaging . In addition , the air flow from the unit is extremely weak .
 great idea ... poor build.it lasted 2 months and then died ...
 I 've had my latop for less than a year . In that length of time I have gone through two - count 'em , two - Targus PA248U Notebook Chill Pads . The first one lasted about 3 months before it was dead-in-the-water . The second one lasted less than a month . They were not continuously on , nor were they dropped , folded , spindled or mutilated . They just stopped working . I will not be repeating this mistake .
 I started using this product in the beginning of July and less than two months later it broke . I treated it very carefully and held it properly and followed all the directions . While I was using it it did the job but not for long .
 Got it on sale ... what a waster . Really noisy . Ended up turning it off and using it like I did the cheaper version -LRB- portable cool pad -RRB- , just for the elevation off the table .
 The cooling unit works great - WHEN IT WORKS . Virtually silent when running . But the USB/power cord sucks big rocks . The switch housing is cheap and unreliable . The power connector -LRB- not the USB end -RRB- also cheap and unreliable . Worked for 2 months - NOW DEAD .
 This product worked perfectly for a few months . It was quiet , cooled enough where my laptop 's fan 's did n't kick in as much as before . It saved my legs from laptop burns , but then the fans started getting louder , the on/off switch snapped off in the off position so i could n't use the item any longer . I bought another one and the same things happened with the fans , they were quiet for a couple of months and then they started skipping and squeaking . I 'm in the market for another laptop cooler ...
 Purchased this item , power cord started bugging out within a month . Had to forcefully tape the cord into the back of the unit after it crapped out to even get it to perform marginally.Huge waste of money .
 The product is fine , shipped as promised , BUT had to pay additional $ 3.19 to Post Office in order to pick up the Item from them . When I paid the shipping as part of my order , WHY do I have to pay additional shipping charges ?
 I have been through 2 Targus chill mats in the past 6 months.The first I returned when the power cord fell apart . I thought it must have been the odd defective one that got through the factory inspection . I was about to learn that perhaps Targus does n't inspect at all . The NORM is a flimsy power cord on/off switch . Office Max took it back , no questions asked and I happily exchanged it for another.Targus has an odd power cord . It should be a simple piece joining the chill mat to one of your laptop 's USB ports . Instead , while it does do that , Targus also has a nonsensical on/off switch on the cord . It is simple enough without an on/off switch to just detach the chill mat from one end or the other , so the switch is unnecessary at best . Worse is the fact that all Targus chill mats have the same problem , with the unnecessary switch always wanting to fall apart . If you are lucky , you get one that holds together for a few months . That 's as good as it gets.Because The silly on/off switch on both Targus mats was always falling apart , I would get out pliers and fix the connecting wires - pretty much on a daily basis . A few of the little wires had never been factory stripped at the ends to allow a connection ! So before I reconstructed the gizmo , I had to make sure there was enough wire to wrap around the posts in the switch . That did improve the situation for a while . Eventually posts snap off , or a part of the switch box , when falling apart as it did almost daily , lands under a piece of furniture , goes into the black hole of missing household `` widgits '' or , worse , ends up in your pet 's mouth . Office Max people told me that my experience was pretty much the norm with the Targus chill mats . The cheaply assembled switch is the reason people return the Targus mats . The store sends them back to Targus for a refund.People buy the Targus chill mats because they are inexpensive . At first it is so neat to experience your laptop not heating up . Then the mats begin to fall apart ... not so good . My chill mat worked once I had rewired it , hence the one star - I have to give credit where credit is due ! Well ... it MOSTLY worked . Every now and again I would have to shake it to get the fans going . Finally one day , chill mat # 2 made a funny noise and died . By then , our local Office Max stocked the Belkin chill mats . What a difference ! For $ 10 more , you get a sturdy , well designed product which I will review separately . In this day of heightened awareness of our environment , it seems so wasteful to toss out a plastic chill mat after a few months of use . So do n't spend your money on the Targus . It is the cheapest one out there -LRB- in every sense of the word -RRB- and you will no doubt end up spending more than if you had sprung for a better mat to begin with .
 This laptop cooling fan was initially bought as a gift for me . It worked pretty well on my 15 '' laptop in terms of how great it cooled it . However , after only week of fair use the USB cable broke -LRB- the wires got pulled out -RRB- and would no longer power the unit , rendering it useless . I thought perhaps it was just a defective product , so , instead of paying shipping to have it repaired or a new cable sent , I just bought another . The new one lasted two weeks , when the USB cable broke in the same fashion as before . I was not rough in handling the product , usually I just used it around the house . Threebb weeks , I went through two of them . This product works great in terms of cooling , but it is not durable .
 This purchase lasted maybe a month or two and then just suddenly stopped working . The fan blades just stopped moving one day and I could n't get it to work again .
 I 've had this for roughly 2 years now and it 's worked alright . It 's nothing spectacular , but it was able to alleviate the heat problems on my Dell Inspiron 1520 . However , the build quality is garbage ; the plastic feels cheap , and the USB cord is abysmal . I do n't know if it 's truly proprietary , but if it is I know why other companies have n't had a similar design -- because it is awful.The USB cord on the cooler 's end is a fairly sharp needle-like plug which has a small hole which connects to a single pin in the cooler . The issue is this pin and the cord are both flimsy and prone to getting stuck . Well mine did not get stuck this time , it broke off.I 've seen the new Targus ones and they seem to be of a better design -- hopefully that means Targus learned their lesson.I suppose it gets the job done , but for the price ... I 'd keep away from this model .
 One of the first things I noticed about this was that the rubber grips did n't grip my laptop very well . It 's not uncommon for the laptop to slide around on it if I move it any.Another problem I 've had is some form of `` sputtering ; '' that is , it runs for a while , then randomly turns off for a while , and turns back on after another while . I 've left my laptop unattended on it to come back and find my laptop very warm.It 's not that expensive , so I 'd rate it as a decent buy and better than nothing , but I 'd get something else .
 Got two of these for two brand new laptops just recently purchased - the first about 1 1/2 months ago and the second 2 weeks ago . The first one lasted about a month before the blades started breaking . By then I had already had bought a second one - which I regret . The second one lasted a week before it started emitting horrible horrible grinding sounds and the first fan blade broke off today.My suggestions , spend the extra money on a good laptop cooling bad that 'll last at least a year because if you buy cheap crap like this every 1-4 months - that just adds up anyways .
 I bought a MacBook Pro , which runs pretty hot , and needed something to help cool the heat generated from the notebook . I opted to buy this Targus PA248U Notebook Chill Pad at a Northern California Fry 's Electronics store , since the price seems right and the spec was comparable to other models that costs $ 10 more -LRB- without the sales discount offered at the time -RRB- . Anyway , after using it for about 3 months , I noticed that the fan noises started to get really loud and annoying . To the point that it is drowning out the sound from DVDs or videos that is playing on the MacBook Pro . The amount of air that the fan circulates is also reduced considerable . Trying to clean the dust built up was a real hassle -LRB- design does not allow for easy cleaning -RRB- . Using the compressed air cleaners helps , but it does not fix the fact that the fans seem to be spinning off-balance and rubbing against something when turned on.By pure coincidence my roommate also has a Targus PA248U for her laptop , and she complains about the same issue after hearing the familiar loud and annoying sound coming from my Chill Pad . Below is the list of pros and cons that we came up with for the product : Pros : Fans initially circulates a fair amount of air to help cool down laptops.Chill pad is not heavy , so it is portable.Runs on power from USB.Cons : Design Quality - poor . Made of cheap plastic that ca n't support the weight of average size laptops/notebooks . Not much clearance underneath the chill pad to draw air.Difficult to perform routine cleaning to get rid of built up dust.Rubber pads on the corners not sufficient enough to prevent scratching the bottom of your laptops with the chill pad.Unit is light weight , but bulky -LRB- common complaint for almost all products in this category -RRB- Product lifespan for me is about 8-9 months -LRB- my roommate gave up on hers after about the same -RRB- Fan noises can get extremely loud and annoying.Unit has stopped working while plugged in and turned on , and caused notebook to overheat and shutdown unexpectedly.Can ' t easily replace the small component fans -LRB- even if you take the unit apart -RRB- Would I recommend or purchase this product again ? Most likely not , unless it is priced cheaper as a disposable equipment that you replace regularly .
 Its hardly been a month and the product ceased to work!The fans aint moving.Tried to get hold of customer care and it didnt happen either !
 I got this chill pad as a gift and was a bit hesitant to keep it since I have n't had much luck with Targus products . However , based upon it 's size and weight I opted to keep it , give it a try , and hope for the best . I wish I would have listened to my first instincts !!! My notebook has an AMD processor so it runs extrememly hot , but at first this chill pad worked great . My notebook fan came on rarely and only after being on for consecutive hours . I thought it was great along with how easy it was to carry the chill pad with my notebook in my bag . However , after only 4 months , the thing just suddenly died on me . I 'm so bummed!Based upon other reviews it appears I 'm far from being the only person to experience this . I 'm going to contact Targus for a replacement since it appears they 'll replace it for free . I suppose I 'll only use it when I have to transport my notebook . For routine use at home though , I 'm going to purchase a more reliable chill pad regardless of weight and size.I would not recommend this product to anyone despite the nice size and weight since it broke so quickly . : -LRB-
 While my laptop is certainly much happier with a cooling pad , I 'm much happier with a different cooling pad . The Targus is cheap for a reason - I 've already been through two different cables to connect it to my laptop -LRB- the wires came disconnected from the on-off switch -RRB- ; the point at which the cable connected to the pad quickly became loose and I 'd often have to jiggle the cord to get it to stay on ; and the feet first left marks on my desk , and then eventually fell off and got stuck to things . While I 'm glad I discovered the world of laptop cooling pads , I wish I 'd discovered something other than this Targus first .
 Does n't work . Spend your money getting your laptop fan cleaned or replaced - you 'll end up doing it , anyway .
 This was a major waste of money . It lasted 20 minutes out of the box . Even if it was just a fluke that I got a defective one , I need to note that it did occur . Shoddy craftsmanship . It looks and feels like a toy .
 Product worked for about 4 months . The unit was used for probably 10 hours which were not continuous . It no longer works . Unknown if it is the cord or the dual fan motors . Tried the unit on other computers with negative results . No cosmetic damage , still looks brand new . When it worked it drew the heat out of the computer .
 I received the Targus Chill Pad for Christmas . I turned it on and in less than 10 seconds I was ready to throw it away ; It is too loud . I gave it two stars becuase it does keep my notebook cool , but the constant humming noise of the fans is more than I expected . Previously I was using something homemade which worked great and no noise ; I 've gone back to using the homemade item.The Chill Pad is n't large enough for a 17 '' laptop . Do n't waste your money on this .
 It worked perfectly for the first month I had it . Then it just stopped working completely . My laptop stays on for about 8 hours a day and so the heat can be pretty intense . It could be that I just need a mat that can stand up to that kind of use and I just wore this one out . If you use your laptop a lot , I would suggest getting a higher quality mat that can stand up to a lot of use , but if you just need a mat for occasional use , then this might be a good item for you .
 So I figured I just got a lemon . It happens . But it seems I 'm not the only one . I bought this a couple weeks ago to use when I ran a high-graphics program -LRB- only time my computer runs freaking hot -RRB- . So it 's not like it was running constantly . It was working fine this afternoon and all of a sudden this evening I noticed I was starting to smell something akin to clothes left in the dryer too long and my legs were burning . I fiddled with the connections to no avail . It 's dead . The most annoying part is this is the only laptop cooling device in this town so now I have to take this piece of crap back to the store and get another one until a better model arrives in the mail . Sure it 's only $ -LSB- ... -RSB- , but for $ -LSB- ... -RSB- I 'm sure I can find something that , oh , I do n't know , works for longer than two weeks?At least the fans were quiet .
 It cooled my 15.4 laptop fairly well for the first few months and then out of nowhere starting making this grinding noise from the right fan . I do n't understand what could be causing this because I do n't ever move the cooler , it stays on my desk all the time . I would poke at it and sometimes it would quiet down but nowadays even the gentle poking is n't working . It 's LOUD and GRINDING . But again , it 's a good investment if you need something you 'll only use for 5-6 months .
 This is a very quiet and effective laptop cooler , while it lasts . I 'm on my third and last one -LRB- it 's the only one I could find in my area -RRB- . None of them have made it past the 5 month mark .
 THIS FAN WORKS OK BUT EASILY TO BROKE . I BOUGHT THE WIRE FOR SECOND TIME . I USED IT ONLY A MONTH . IF YOU HAVE OTHER CHOICES GO FOR THE OTHERS . THIS FAN IS NOT GOOD AT ALL.YOU WILL WASTE YOUR MONEY
 Expect this item to last about 5 or six months with rigorous use . I have had 3 , 1 died in a couple months , one lasted about 5 months and the third is still running after about 9 months , but I bought a backup because its going to die soon . There is something with the fan location that usually causes the pad to make noise after a few months , making it unuseable . At list price it is expensive ... I see it is now ten bucks and at that price , buy a few , and , you 'll have ONE good cooling pad .
 The Targus PA241U Podium Coolpad for laptop / notebook computers is best used only for a single location . Its multiple `` Lego '' type parts for adjusting its tilt angle can come apart quite easily and be lost if it is used as a portable device . Losing only a few of the stackable pieces can make the coolpad unusable as designed . The oginial Targus Coolpad has only one pre-set tilt angle , but is far more user friendly , especially as a portable unit , which is pretty much the purpose of a laptop / notebook computer . Targus should start making the original model once again .
 I bought this product on August 6 2007 and today Oct 16 2007 it stopped working . I have a Compaq Presario laptop and when I first purchased this item it worked great and then this morning I turned on the laptop and the Chill Pad did not turn on the fans all of sudden stopped working .
 The power cord fatigued into uselessness quickly . Slipping the pad in and out of my backpack caused me to lose the rubber footies in short order . Even when the footies were there , it did n't cool that well unless I overvolted the fans to 10 V. Look elsewhere .
 It did n't work as I thought it would . The laptop didnt get hot as fast but it was still quite hot . After about two weeks , the fan stopped working for some reason .
 This was too small for my 17 inch laptop ? Laptop wobbles when I keep it on it . Also there are no guides to keep it in place .
 This chill pad was terrible . If I could give it a lower rating , I would . I bought two of them four months ago , one for myself , one for my husband . Already , the rubber feet have fallen off , the power switch broke off on the day we received them , thankfully in the on position , and now one of them has completely burned out.I 've bought other Targus products , but this one has been a terrible disappointment.Don ' t wste your money on this product , opt for something a little sturdier instead .
 I bought this for my Dell Latitude D510 which I use several hours a day . The Targus Chill Pad looks nice , but it 's not as useful as I hoped . F1 . As another reviewer noted , the power cord often comes out of the plug & I have to check the fans several times to make sure they are still working .2 . The fans , while quiet , are not very powerful . I think one with a higher RPM will be more helpful .3 . The cooler is about an inch too small -LRB- all around -RRB- for my laptop . This does n't bother me very much , but for those of you with larger laptops , the Targus will be much too small .4 . Finally , even when the fans are working full time , the wristpad is still very warm to the touch , even after only using the laptop for 10 minutes . This is my first notebook cooler & I plan to return it & try a different brand .
 I bought a Targus chill mat a little over a year ago , and it worked perfectly up until recently . It still turns on and cools down my HP 15.4 '' laptop , but the fans make so much noise that it 's incredibly irritating . It makes it difficult to have a a conversation or watch tv/listen to the radio . The warranty is only for a year ... oh well !
 I bought this because of my Alienware laptop 's video card going over 100 degrees celsius . Now , not to ding Alienware , it 's not their fault , you can only fit so much hardware in a small space , but it overheated fairly regularly . I admit that it overheated when I was playing graphic intesive games that take up a lot of processing power . I bought this with the hope that it would work to keep my laptop cooler and keep it from overheating.Bottom line
 This review is just a warning to buyers . I bought this item at Best Buy about 2 days ago , and already this cooling pad is broken , and I 'm going to return it . It will work , but I would have to hold in the power cord very tightly to keep it powered . There 's a reason why Amazon has such a `` good '' price for this pad . I paid 30 at Best Buy , knowing that Targus usually makes quality products , but this is there one downfall .
 this item worked great for about a week . It was quit and kept my computer at a perfect temperature . Then after a weeks use it kicked the bucket , please do not waste your money on this product !
 It did a fine job while it lasted but wore out after about nine months of light use .
 This is my second purchase of a Targus notebook chill pad both stopped working after a few weeks .
 I received this as a Christmas present . I was disappointed to find out it was a Targus brand cooling pad , as I had issues with Targus before . The construction on this seemed very flimsy and fragile , but I needed a cooling pad . I decided to use it and remained optimistic about its performance.I started using it immediately , so let 's say December 26th , 2007 . As of February 25th , 2008 , it is no longer working . The USB cable connecting the pad to the computer seems to have fried somehow , so that the pad is no longer getting power . This is two months of average use
 This cooler stopped working 2 months after I got it . I think it shorted out in the cord , but whatever the problem , it still doesnt work . I would not reccomend this chill pad to anyone .
 This is a great idea and the price is right . However it is not well designed . The on/off switch is on the USB power cable and is very easily broken . I think placing the switch on the side of the device itself or at least making one that is more sturdy would improve this product immensely .
 Worked for all of a month . Fans began making noise almost immediately after purchase . Then one of the fans stopped working . Save your money and do n't buy this item . I finally threw the thing away and bought an Antec cooler ... after 7 months it still works great .
 I have gone through three of these coolers . All with the same issues . Either the wire stopped working or one of the fans . It is made very cheaply and isnt meant to last long . It does keep your laptop cool but its durability and reliability are very poor . Go with the antec laptop cooler , excellent unit that has worked great for me for over a year . The antec is built much more durably than the targus so go with that one .
 I have owned many a laptop and several notebook cooling pads . Cooling can potentially improve a computer 's performance and useful life.This pad has decent performance . But , it is made from cheap plastic and has design short-comings . The product pictures , and price , make you think it is made from high grade plastic or metal . I feel for anybody who ever paid the list price of $ 30 for this product.Reading the reviews for this product , I realized that several key elements of this product 's construction were not being mentioned.Pros - The fans do seem to push a decent amount of air , more than other pads - The rubber risers allow for better air-flow under your laptopCons - This product is made from low grade plastic . It is flimsy under the weight of any standard laptop - The rubber risers which seperate this product from your laptop will come out ; They are not glued in - The rubber feet on this pad will also come out - The fans inside can be very loud - The 2 fan heads are poorly positioned in the center of the pad - The usb cable is too longFor the price there are simply better alternatives . The Antec notebook cooler has a more durable aluminum top , ergonomic shape , and more quiet design . The USB connector also has an extra port.Antec USB-Powered Notebook CoolerAs long as you do n't mind the defects , this can be a handy unit for a spare or travel needs . This cooler is still worth owning if you can buy it on sale for $ 11 or less . Do n't pay more.Happy Shopping .
 -LRB- It seems the portable lap desk and chill pad reviews are being mixed together -- this review refers to the chill pad . -RRB- This chill pad seemed great at first
 I bought the Coolpad after reading the positive reviews here on Amazon.com , but am quite disappointed . My Fujitsu has vents both at the bottom and in the rear , so it does n't overheat , but can get quite hot when I edit digital videos -LRB- a CPU - and hard drive-intense task -RRB- . I bought the Coolpad hoping it would help cool down the laptop so the laptop 's internal fan would n't have to work too hard.To my disappointment there does not seem to be any cooling improvement whatsoever . If your laptop has vents only at the bottom and has no rubber feet , then this may help . Again , it 's a strong `` may '' or `` might , '' as in `` perhaps , '' as acknowledged on the packaging . I suspect the Coolpad does n't elevate the laptop high enough for the convection principle to work in reality.On the plus side , the Coolpad does insulate your laptop from the desk surface , thus preserving your desktop as well as prevening spilled coffee from soaking up the bottom of your laptop computer . The upper metal plate also rotates , which is nice for showing others the screen or when you use the laptop while watching TV.But , the Coolpad does n't do its main job right , hence it 's useless . If you want something that can really cool your laptop , look for a cheap product called `` Bytecc Notebook Cooler '' which has two built-in fans .
 The chill pad in the picture -LRB- silver rectangle -RRB- is NOT the model that 's shipped today . The model pictured is the older model -LRB- item # 21 -RRB- and it was great . It was made of very sturdy plastic and VERY quietly cooled my laptop like a refrigerator . My only complaint with it was that the switch on the cable got broken.The new ones have the exact same model number PA248U -LRB- only the new one is item # 22 -RRB- but is a brownish gray , curved like an hourglass , and the switch is on the pad not the cable . Targus was either dumb or deceptive on the model number . This model is a piece of junk
 I 've been through two of these chill pads in the last month . The reason is the power connector
 The product worked great for about a week . Then the blades of the fan started to fall out one by one . Then it had a machine type oder . The fans continued to get stuck . Now only on fan works . Would not recommend this product . It 's a waist if time and money .
 I bought mine in store , and after less than a month of very light handling , the cable had pulled loose from the USB connector , exposing the wires . Despite my attempts to prevent any further damage , the wires broke within a couple of days , rendering my pad completely useless .
 I bought this chill pad some time ago . It is not at all good . Just after use of a month or so . . the wiring became loose and now i have to keep it at a specific angle to keep the fans running . Fan 's run slow also . Not as good as other products in the market .
 I have had to purchase this item locally on four -LRB- count 'em -RRB- four different occasions . The pad works great for about 3 or 4 months , then just shuts down . It 's cheap enough and the only option locally , so I kept buying it . Now that the 4th has shut down , I 've had more than enough hassel and will be purchasing another pad here on Amazon . It works , but be prepared for it to not be a permanent solution to your laptop cooling needs .
 This product is very flimsy . do not buy it !!!!! will not last for mroe than a few weeks unless you baby it ...
 I bought one of these to go with the new laptop my husband gave me . It does work to keep your legs cool . While it worked it did what it said - kept my computer cool . It was not the quietest , but not super noisy.It worked for less than a month . I returned it , got another one . It worked for about 2 months . So I had to deal with Targus . No go on the return . They told me it was a problem caused by misusing it . It had a little on/off toggle installed in the USB cable . Both times it came unwired . Parts stuck out.It was not turned on or off more than once . My computer sits on the desk . I do n't even generally move it to sit it on my lap . I did that with the first chill mat . With the second I did not move it . Left it on the desk , just unplugged the USB end of the cord . It came unwired anyway.Don ' t buy this one , buy one that will work .
 If you have a notebook that runs warm , then this fan system should be fine . However , if your notebook is hot to the touch , this product does not have enough cooling power.It is relatively quiet and fits my laptop with 14 '' screen well but just ca n't keep it cool . I 'm trying to replace an external USB fan that I had which was a little loud but had great cooling power.I 'm going to return this product and try theThermaltake Mobile Fan II External USB Cooling Fan - UsUpdate on July 11
 I would not recommend this product . During the first week a blade broke off one of the fans and during the next 2 weeks , 2 more blades broke off . Plus I have n't noticed that it keeps my laptop any cooler than without the pad . All it does is drain the battery . I have not used the product inappropriately - it 's just junk .
 Targus PA248U is not worth the cardboard box it came in . Seemed to run fine for about 3 weeks ... then developed a buzz . When I disconnected it to take a look , three fan blades fell out of the casing . Now , the fans spin without the buzzing noise ... that 's been replaced with vibration and loud hum due to the imbalance in the fans . I recommend you do not purchase this piece of garbage .
 While this product did last me for more than a year without malfunction , I recently bought the Pacific Cooler which is much better . Given the choice between the two , I would not buy this laptop cooler again .
 This cooler worked great - at first . The cooler itself did a fine job . However , the USB cord that connected it to my laptop pulled apart at two different places and exposed the inner electrical wires . After a week of the wires being exposed the cooler stopped working completely.If you do n't mind spending -LSB- ... -RSB- bucks every few months , go ahead and get this - because a few months is as long as it 's going to last you .
 After I bought this it worked for a month and then died . It was never beaten up or taken anywhere , just sat on my desk . I packed it up with a copy of the receipt and sent it back to the manufacturer and never heard from them again , even after writing a second time . For pity 's sake , do n't buy one of these .
 I got this to keep my laptop from setting my lap on fire . It worked pretty well if I moved it so that one of the fans was actually under the CPU . This sort of threw the whole system into an oddly unbalanced set up unless I was at my desk . But then , after less than a month of use , the power switch on it broke off leaving disconnected wires and no power . I got out the wire strippers and put the thing back together temporarily , but this thing is just poorly made . Its not a notebook cooler if the fans wo n't spin.What I did like about this is that it is lightweight so it does n't add extra pounds to my already too heavy bag , and the fans ran pretty quiet .
 Does the trick but the power cord pooped out on me twice . I got a replacement , which was awesome , but it stopped working after a month just like the first one . I still use the pad though and its helpful .
 This fan may cosmetically cool the outer casing of your laptop , but claims that it actually cools the processor are totally bogus.I have a Gateway laptop that I use for very compute-intensive workloads that can run from hours to days . Running the processor for that long can cause thermal shutdowns , so I rigged together a $ 10 solution using blocks and a fan . It was unwieldly , but it worked . I thought the Targus would be a better solution , since it claims to be designed for just this sort of thing . The weak fans cool the outer casing , but does nothing for the processor , because the thermal shutdowns returned.If you want to cool your lap , this may work fine . If you want to cool your actual computer , look elsewhere .
 I purchased this the same day I purchased my newest laptop . I 've had a few laptops but none were my own , so I wanted to be sure I protected my investment . The reason I purchased this product was because it was all I could find in my area and I did not want to wait for shipping . It made a huge difference in cooling my Laptop 's temperature down , but it only worked for two weeks . I have no idea why it stopped , it has not been mishandled , and there is nothing wrong with the cord that I can see . It is also difficult to use in conjunction with a tilted table or laptop stand ; the laptop tends to slide off of it . Very disappointing , I wish I had saved my packaging so I could get a refund .
 The main problem is with the electrical connector . You have to wiggle it to make it works . After a while you have to wiggle it more and hope.Don ' t buy this product until they decide to use a $ 0.10 connector instead of a $ 0.05 connector .
 I purchased this product about 2-3 months ago , and it has already quit working ! It did do an okay job , but what a waste of money it has turned out to be . It is worth purchasing a better-quality laptop cooler !
 I purchased the Targus CoolPad Notebook lift and it did help cool down the notebook some but was not pleased with the quality and the amount it cooled down . I felt my notebook was not well protected from slipping while using it.I returned it and purchased another product that I am very well pleased with.My notebook is very secure on it and it does keep my notebook much cooler than the Targus did .
 These chinese made motors are really the cheapest possible ... Mine stopped working after only a month ! Basically junk , as other reviewers have noted . Targus has been good about replacements in the past , but I will try for a refund from CompUSA
 our inspirion 8200 notebook kept getting so hot when i was using it while sitting it on my lap ... `` laptop '' anyway it would get so hot at times it would leave burns on my leg in desparation to help . . my husband gave me a cupcake/muffin baking pan i simply turned it over and placed the computer on it . Wha-la our laptop stays much cooler and no longer shuts down and we did n't have to spend any money . Just a little good ole fashion ingenuity !!
 I have had this for about 5 days now and it has worked pretty good for the first few days . Now i will look under my notebook every so often and the fans are shut off . I have to fiddle with the power cord for it to turn back on . A simple rotation of the cord around the power hole seems to get the fans going but i ca n't imagine this will hold up much longer.The one thing I like about this is that the cord is long . This is sometimes a distraction but when i am near a deskop I can plug it into that computer instead of my notebook even if it is on the floor below .
 Works great for cooling your laptop . After 1 day I noticed that the wires near the on/off switch were exposed . I had to keep pushing the cable back in to get it to work . Today it completely stopped working . I just ordered a new cooler different brand . For now I just turned it over and put it under my laptop . It lets air get under there so it does keep it cool just not the way its supposed to .
 I like this product , but it was not in good condition when I received it . damn it ... !
 You 're money is better spent on another product.It 's made out of plastic so it feels cheaply made . A nice thing about the product is that the fans are incredibly quiet , damn near silent , if it is n't damaged . I had one fan made a scraping noise.The fans are designed to draw the heat from the laptop , but I 've found that these coolers are less effective than the laptop coolers that blow cool air in .
 I bought Targus because of it 's price and ratings on Amazon . I 'm disappointed with the results I 've gotten from this product . After a month or so , the fans stopped working . I received the same product from a friend and only after a few minutes of work the fans stopped working yet again . It has been my conclusion that the fans stop working at a certain temperature -LRB- ironic , is n't it ? -RRB- . I still have both Chill Pads , and when they occasionally stop working I switch one for the other . All that money wasted ...
 I bought this product the first time in August . By late September/early October , the fan stopped turning on . I 'd flip the switch and nothing would happen.Then , I returned it b/c it was still w/in the 90 days to return for Amazon . Got a new one , b/c I thought the one I had was defective . It worked until early December , but by then I was studying for my first round of law school finals , so obviously , I did n't have time to spend returning the item.I discovered in December that if I carefully switched the switch to a certain point , very delicately in just the right position somewhere between the middle and on , it would work . But , if I made the slightest movement , it would stop the fans again!Now , the 90 days has passed and I 'm stuck w / it . Sometimes it works , and sometimes it does n't . I 'm buying another brand , and hopefully that will be better .
 Even tho this is pretty cheap , it totally does n't cool down my notebook PC , so it 's just a piece of totally useless metal plate . In theory it should lift up your notebook to allow better air flow at the bottom , but in reality no , it does n't have any cooling affect at all . It 's cheap , but still a waste of money for a student like myself .
 I use a laptop at home ... on my lap . I 've gone thru two of these units now . The first unit lasted only about 2 weeks , but I 'd lost the receipt so could n't do anything about getting money back . So I bought another , and it lasted about 4 months until it started to not really work well , and now -LRB- a total of 7 months into ownership -RRB- it finally died completely . The concept is great . The product is cheaply made and does n't last as long as it should . Computer stores sell this product for like $ 40 ... insane.Today I 'm buying a different brand ... we 'll see .
 I 'm in the habit of sitting on my bed or sofa and using my laptop , and I bought this so I would be able to play Warcraft without burning my legs . It worked pretty well for about a year , and then the fans died . Figuring that it had been dropped or otherwise mishandled , I went out to buy another one . It died after a month . Fool me once , shame on you ; fool me twice , shame on me . I went back to using my senior yearbook as a heat shield rather than buying a third . It gets two stars instead of one because it actually kept my computer -LRB- and my lap -RRB- comparitively cool ... still , you 'd be better off cooling your laptop with a ziplock baggie full of ice .
 I bought this product an I do believe less than a month later it stopped working . I also have a friend that purchased it , and it stopped working a few weeks after she bought it . I really regret buying this .
 I had high hopes for this product , which is perhaps why I 'm not giving it a high rating.This Chill Pad simply does not work . The idea is great , I 'd love something that takes the heat away from my MacBook Pro , but this simply does n't do it . My hands and lap are sweating as I type this review.For $ 20 I ca n't really complain . But buyer 's beware , this wo n't magically take away all of the heat . It does provide some sort of shield between your lap and your laptop , but a book or newspaper can provide the same protection . The fans do little to no cooling .
 I loved it when I first bought it but after approx . 4 months it really started getting loud . Whenever it was on it sounded like a jet . I owned this for alittle over a year and recently threw it away because the fans were working inconsistently .
 I have this chill pad and all I can say is I wish we had taken it back . It is not good if you like to use your laptop on your couch on your lap , it might be better on a hard surface . If you use it on your lap the laptop will constantly be sliding off the unit . We have had ours for a little over a year and the fans just went out , not that they cooled that well in the first place . I would n't waste your money if you want something you can use for a while .
 BUY A ZALMAN !!! I purchased this chill mat , and it worked for a short period of time . The connector would not stay in , because it was a prong-type connector and not a USB connector . The company sent me a new cord , but it would not stay in , either . I tried every which way to support the connector , so it would stay in , but finally gave up!Bought the Zalman , and it has a variable fan , which is almost silent and have n't had a moment 's problem with it.You wo n't regret going with the Zalman .
 I received the package . When I went to plug it in to use it it did n't work . Plain and simple . The product also was put together very cheezy .
 soon within months of using this product , the wiring was not working . this seller quickly sent me a new wiring , which worked perfectly for a year , but not has stopped working again . the manufacturer was unwilling to send me a new wire since it is now out of warranty . my roommate has this same item , and her wiring does n't work either . granted , the product works fairly well while in warranty , but the wire that connects from the laptop to the cooling pad is not built to last for more than a year .
 The cooling mat was okay at first -LRB- although it has never been very portable because of the bulky shape -RRB- . Within a month , the fans started `` sputtering '' and turning off whenever they wanted until one day they stopped turning on at all . We still use it as a barrier between the computer and legs but it works the same as a book which I am sure you can find around your house for free .
 I 've had the previous version for about a year and was happy with it - until the power cord failed . A few times I forgot the thing was attached to my laptop 's USB port and jerked the cable pretty hard.So for ten bucks , I did n't hesitate to buy another . Unfortunately they 've redesigned the unit -LRB- does n't look like the picture as shown on this date -RRB- and the two fans are a lot noisier now . It looks better I guess , but the sound is going to drive me nuts until I find a replacement.Can ' t recommend this product .
 The item I received was NOT the same as the item pictured . I previously owned one of the Targus PA248U Chill Pads pictured , and it was a wonderful product - small , quiet , and effective . So I ordered another from Amazon , expecting to get the same product . However , the item I received was the `` next generation '' of this item , which is totally different than the item pictured but with the same model number . The item that was actually shipped to me was hour-glass shaped , black , and was EXTREMELY loud . -LRB- I could actually hear the fan running from over 50 feet away . -RRB- Kudos to Amazon for accepting the returned item and giving me a full refund , including return shipping . I 'd like to see them update the pictures on this item though , so that other people do n't have the same problems I did .
 complete waste of my money . the first time i bought it , worked fine for 2 months , then the stupid on off switch cable was comming apart , so i bought a new one . then the new one had the same exact issue . in addition , i have a 17 inch laptop , this cooler barely does the work , it will work fine for anything smaller than a 17 inch . i purchased a coolermaster notepal and that cooler is so much better . the only good thing with this is that it works fine if you want to work on your lap , other then that , i would not invest my money on this .
 When I first bought this product it was great . It kept my laptop cool , its light weight and its very quiet . But it fell apart quickly . The on/off switch broke off and I ended up just securing the wires by hand and lots of duct tape . Then the little plastic pieces over the fans broke off . Granted , I used this daily for two years and took it around the world a few times so I got a lot of use out of it . I suppose if you just keep it at home most of the time it would last a lot longer.BTW
 It works fine , great even , for a few weeks . Then it quits . I paid over twenty bucks for it , so I took it back and got another one -LRB- customer service did n't bat an eye -RRB- . Same problem . That little switch stops working or falls off . We did n't want to take it back to the store again , so we took off the switch and taped the wires together , unplugging the USB from the computer when it was no longer needed . It 's also an exceptionally long cord , three or four feet , which I feel is unnecessary and could have contributed to the problem . Now it 's quit again and I do n't know what to do . It works fine in the begining , keeps the computer really cool , but it 's just put together so shoddily that it 's not worth it , even if it costs five bucks , which it does n't . I think it may just be Targus . I 've also got one of their laptop battery chargers , which occasionally , though nothing has been unplugged , stops working . This rarely happens , but I have no explanation for it . I just look down and realize that blue light is off and my battery is half-dead , though I thought I was on the charger . I check everything and nothing is loose , so I try everything in order - unplug from the wall , plug back in , nothing - unplug from little box with light -LRB- both sides -RRB- nothing - unplug from computer , nothing . Then I unplug everything , nothing 's connected to each other , to the wall , to the computing , nothing . Plug it all back in , works fine . Beats me . At least it still works after a few months , unlike Targus ' other stuff .
 Off is on ... on is off which was ok till it stopped working completely -LRB- after just a few days -RRB- . I will be returning this for another one hopefully it is just a fluke : -RRB-
 Targus Chill padPros
 I have owned 2 Targus chill mats and they were the worst pieces of crap I ever bought . They last about 2 months before they stop working . Either they will just completely stop working or the fan blades will start tearing off , and then stop working . After about a week they start making a loud sound like something is caught in the fan blades . Unfortunately , they were the only brand available in my local stores , so I had to settle . I will never trust Targus for any product ever again !!! Sure , they offer a warranty , but to be honest , I 'm not going to keep my receipt and warranty information in order to get them to replace the junk they sold to me with another piece of junk that will stop working in the same amount of time and charge me over half of what I paid for the product for shipping .
 Please do yourself a favor and forget about buying this noise maker . The chiller seems to convert your computer energy , via USB , into vibration noises . The air current seems to simply be a by-product of the need to rattle . Opt for a sturdier , more effective chiller . I 'm avoiding this brand simply out of spite .
 I purchased this laptop cooler last year at a retail store , opting over models that cost $ 10 more.At first , this worked pretty well . All I needed was the edge to handle some light gaming that my laptop could n't handle without additional cooling . It worked well in that regard.This cooler has a USB powercord , but the cord terminates as a DC jack to the back of the chillmat . While some people might consider this a plus , this is the single biggest failure on this item . The DC jack INPUT on the cooler itself was poorly constructed , causing the fans to spin up and down for a while until eventually , they would n't spin up at all . A laptop cooler that ca n't spin the fans is next to worthless.However , this cooler has no channels for air and does n't sit high enough from the table to even add airflow when the fans are off . In a very real sense , this laptop cooler is actually WORSE than simply putting my laptop on top of a book for cooling benefits.I strongly recommend other people avoid this and find a better product .
 Bought one of these a few years ago and really like it . Needed a second one , but when it arrived I discovered a manufacturing error - the rear bottom pads were the same ones as on the front ; they are supposed to be thicker than the front ones , so as to slightly elevate the rear so it does n't wobble on the center screw . You can even see it in the photos on amazon.com So with the same pads front and rear , the pad is worthless as it does n't sit level , it sits on the center screw and wobbles!Tried getting the correct pads directly from Targus , they said to return it to the vendor . Amazon was nice enough to quickly send a replacement -- with the same problem.Two tries is enough for me , off to Best Buy instead ...
 I should have read reviews for this product before purchasing , but I just picked it up quick at the store , and I 'm sorry I did . The product is very cheaply made . The fans make too much noise . And now , after only typical usage , nothing heavy or out of the ordinary , not even a lot of travel , the fans are working only intermittently , and I am going to have to replace this product . Definitely not worth the cost .
 The design for this is terrible . The end of the USB cord going to the pad sticks out at least an inch , so it 's really easy to bump it if you use your laptop on your lap . A few bumps and the connection inside the pad becomes faulty . If you try to keep using the pad , you have to move the cord around to find `` sweet spots '' so that the pad gets its power . This is very annoying , and there does n't seem to be any simple way to fix it .
 After i bought this product -LRB- not on amazon -RRB- it wouldnt work after a couple days cause where you plug the port into the chill mat broke . and it was kind of noisy
 I am a long time very satisified Amazon.com customer . I recently purchased this Chill Mat manufactured by Targus . After owning it for approximately 3 weeks I noticed permanent black stains on my dining room table and coffee table where I regularly use the chill mat . The stains are a result of the little black rubber feet on the bottom of the mat.My furninture is permanently damaged from using this product , and I just felt the need to warn others that may be considering purchasing it .
 I bought this to use at home with my powerbook . I use an Antec cooling pad at my office which works very well . This cooling pad is really disappointing . The fans barely move and my powerbook 's fan still has to come on to supplement . I bought this one to save 5 bucks . I should have just paid 5 bucks more for another Antec cooling pad . Do n't waste your money on this one .
 I have purchased 2 of these products . Why ? The story goes like this . The first one I purchased was working fine but one day the wiring part which connects the USB wire to the chill pad became disconnected . Part of the interior mechanism was externalized ... I thought I was too rough with the item so I decided to purchase another of the same item . However , this second gave me constant , repeat CONSTANT , problem with the USB power connection . It 's like those bad wiring that you have to fix the wires in a specific position , otherwise there is no power to the chill pad . I had complained about this to Targus . They were pretty nice about it and gave me another USB connection cable . This one worked fine for like 2 months with maybe only once a week connection issues . However , it 's broken again . I do n't even feel like asking Targus for another cable . This unit is highly defected . Please consider other products with more stable power supply cable . -LRB- for those who are not familiar with this product , the chill pad is powered through the notebook with a USB connection . I have had lots of problems with this USB connection cable since my purchase -RRB- . So , if you value your notebook and does NOT want it to overheat sporadically when the power cable decides to go on strike , I would highly recommend other products !!
 When we first bought this product , it was great ! It worked and cooled our HP notebook . The fans were a bit noisy but it did it 's job . Now 3 months later the on/off switch that is on the usb does n't work . Therefore our product does n't work for our laptop . I had contacted the company via email with their website about their warranty . They have not gotten back to me about replacing this usb cord . Due to this issue , I will never purchase another item from this company . This is a poor idea for a design with on/off switch is on the usb cord . It should have been on the mat itself .
 It does a good job cooling down the laptop but I use it sparingly because it 's so noisy . I do n't know what its dB rating is but it 's certainly not like a typical PC fan . It 's like five times louder than a typical PC fan . If there 's a different chill pad that 's quieter , I 'd get one .
 in reality , it is n't . I have had my Chillpad for some time now . I do n't take it with me , so it stays in the same spot on my desk all of the time . I have had some of the same problems other reviewers had
 I bought this in February and the price was 13.99 . I thought it was such a great deal with all the good reviews so I bought it . Well , it does n't look like the picture ... it 's the one with the curved sides . But that did n't really bother me . It worked great at first , it was just kind of loud . Now it randomly chooses to work at all ! I do n't know if it 's the connection or what ... but now it 's merely a surface to sit the laptop on.I suggest not bargain shopping on this sort of thing . : - /
 I bought this Chill pad and had it for about 6 months before the fans stopped working . Targus was nice enough to send me a replacement free of charge . That one worked for about 3 months before it stopped working and once again Targue send me what appeared to be a better more expensive model -LRB- Not this one I 'm writing the review for -RRB- . I 'd highly recommend looking elsewhere for a laptop cooler unless you want to be stuck having the frustration of sending it back to Targus every few months .
 this notebook chill pad is a great product ... until it broke about a few months later . It 's not like I man-handled it either . It 's was quiet and it did cool the notebook off very well , but since it did stop working I have to rate this low
 This unit is made of extremely cheap , low-grade plastic . Less than two weeks out of the box , one of the fans began to grind and make noise periodically . The upside was that Targus agreed to replace the unit ; the downside was that they wanted five weeks to do it . Five weeks ! What am I supposed to do in the meantime?This is the first product of its type that I have owned , but I was pretty shocked , given its price , at how flimsy it was when I took it out of the box . Since I purchased it , the price has dropped drastically -LRB- at least temporarily -RRB- , but knowing what I know now , I would n't buy it even at the reduced price . It is just a mickey mouse device .
 Worked well when brand spanking new but not a long-term product . The Targus Notebook Chill Pad is trying to hold on for dear life but it sure is making a ruckus .
 I bought one for myself and one for my boyfriend . After having it for 3 months , it totally stopped working . Such a waste of money !
 I orderd this chill pad in May . Did n't actually open and use it until the end of August . it has abruptly stopped working as of last night ! Piece of garbage ...
 Sadly , I bought this cooling fan without researching the market . It is not powerful enough and makes a loud whirring noise . My laptop is still ultra-hot , the cooling pad is now just used to prop my laptop up so I can direct a mini-fan under it.I contacted the company about my unhappiness towards their product and they said to bring up my issue with the store that I bought it from . Which is okay , but I only realized that it was terrible after the returning period ended .
 I went out and buy the Targus PA248U Chill pad because my last cooling pad was a Targus that I had for long time befor it stoped working and it was agreat chill pad but this new Targus CHill pad didnt do any thing for my gateway MX6453 computer all I do on it is use the internet to watch movies and talk to friends and listen to music mmm but this chill pad was loud and didnt do any thing for my notebook computer if some one asked me if they should buy it I would say dont go look up othere chill pads / cooling pads over all it was loud and didnt work at all does not matter how I set my note book computer on it
 I have owned other Targus laptop Chill Mats and/or Pads that have worked very well for me . With the exception of this particular Chill Mat . I have been using this Chill Mat for four or five months now and have noticed that it was actually hotter using the mat than without using the mat . After comparing it with other devices , I noticed one single flaw . The device pushes air upwards towards the laptop . I saw a Technology Demonstration on Youtube.com , and I was using the mat in exactly same way as it was demonstrated . I have since turned the Chill Mat Upside down -LSB- opposite the mat direction as orientated in the above photo -RSB- . After turning the mat upside down , it is now pulling the heat down away from my laptop , making the laptop tremendously cooler . Either the Targus Chill Mats were improperly designed to push air upwards , or I received the Mat that missed the quality check . Either way , make sure the air is being pulled downwards and this device will work fantastically .
 -LRB- I wanted to give this product Zero Stars but the Reveiw would n't take it , so , under duress , I will `` give '' it one star even though it does n't deserve it -RRB- I got the Targus Chill Pad as part of a package deal for just over Fifty Dollars -LRB- $ 50.00 -RRB- which included a wireless mouse and a pair of `` stereo '' speakers when I purchased a new Dell laptop . I 'm sorry I paid more than fifty cents for the lot of crap!Because this reveiw is about the Chill Pad I will only say that the mouse did n't work and the speakers ... well , I 've had cheap headphones that were WAYYY better.About the Chill Pad . It 's junk . I think it ran the first day I got it . After that it sometimes ran but most times not . I checked it out as best I could with out taking it apart . -LRB- I do n't even know if you CAN take it apart ; it 's so cheaply made it might not go back together # . I discovered that either the power cord or the socket on the back of the unit are not right . If you jiggle the end of the cord in the socket you might get it to run but as soon as you let it go the fans stop . If you are real careful you might be able to prop the cord into the socket so that it will run but that sort of defeats the purpose of having a PORTABLE laptop does n't it?Overall the unit is made of cheap , thin plastic which is poorly put together #Poor workmanship -RRB- . Yes , it is light as a feather and about as useful for cooling the laptop .
 but I was so close to smashing this thing against the wall . It wo n't work unless you keep pushing the adapter into the cooler .
 I purchased one of these about 10 months ago . about 4 months of use , it stopped working . I finally called targus and asked for a replacement . They were pretty good at doing that . So i got a new one - but less than 2 months later , this one broke also . THis is not such a great investment . have to find another cooling pad.If it broke once , i would assume i just got one of the few bad ones . the second one broke ? my trust is lost for this brand .
 This product worked well for the first 5 months then started making loud noises . I 've had it for 8 months now and the chill pad is dead .
 I have been using a Targus PA241U Podium Coolpad for quite a while now and it is great . I bought this Traveler Coolpad for one of my nieces since it was a bit smaller and less expensive.One of the pieces -LRB- that elevates the laptop -RRB- broke off after only a couple months . She 's a freshman in high school and not particularly rough with her belongings.This was really disappointing . Next up
 A much needed warning on this item
 Be warned ! This Chill Mat leaves little black rings on your woodwork from the feet on the bottom .
 At $ 25.00 + , this product is grossly overpriced . In terms of cooling capability , it is strictly passive -LRB- i.e. , no fans or other cooling mechanisms -RRB- and is n't even constructed of endothermic material that would draw heat away from your laptop ; any cooling that occurs is soley dependent upon the stray breeze that may or may not flow under your machine . The device does allow you some modicum of tilt adjustablity , but only within a 1/2 '' to 1 3/4 '' range . Additionally , the lego-like system used to make the tilt adjustments is cumbersome . On the plus side , the swivel feature works well.This product would be worthwhile at $ 10.00 , but at $ 25.00 , I would avoid it .
 After owning one for 10 months , my coolpad stopped working after daily use . Definitely would not recommend !
 First , some of the description and reviews led me to believe that the fans direct hot air out of the back and/or sides of the Chill Pad . This is not the case . The fans only blow straight through top-bottom . Second , if the Chill Pad is sitting on anything -- even though the legs provide a small gap , the air flow is reduced to practically nothing.I bought this to put on top of my DirecTV DVR , to help pull hot air away from the DVR . It actually raised the internal temperature by 2 degrees , probably because the air flow it created was very minimal and it blocked some of the vented area on the top of the DVR.Good idea , but the implementation leaves it pretty worthless in my opinion .
 My husband 's laptop was overheating constantly while he was doing his work , so we bought this chill pad to help alleviate the problem . The chill pad worked nicely for about a month . The switch broke soon after , and I put it back together , but had to seal it closed with tape . A few months later it shorted out and has n't worked since . It was disappointing to say the least . If you do n't mind buying two or three of these a year , it does work well when it 's working .
 it worked ok for about a week maybe two then became unreliable . I have yet to find a chill pad that works well . I would not recommend spending your money on this one unless you consider your money extremely disposable
 This product died within 3 months . It did n't even work that good when it did work . The fans were n't very powerful , and I found myself having to turn off the notebook after awhile anyway because it still got too hot . Buy the Antec !! Its a bit pricier , but it is very powerful and has never failed on me after almost a year !
 I 've bought this product 3 different times and each time it lasted MAYBE 2 months b4 it just died . The wires alway get loose inside so it 's basically just a table for my laptop . Do n't buy this if you want goood value for your money !
 Let me state upfront that I have no problems with the product doing what it claims to do . The product worked really well for me and I was very happy with it -- for a couple weeks . The switch that turns the fans on and off is very fragile and even though I never really used the switch -LRB- I generally left it on -RRB- After awhile of moving the unit , the cords going into and out of the switch loosened and the fans quit working . For awhile I was able to push the wires in to get the fans to run , but eventually even that failed . :--LRB- The company does have a warranty , but they did n't seem to enthused about replacing my unit . I wanted my money back , not another poorly made unit . Save your money and buy a better made unit !
 I baught this to try on my friend 's Dell Inspiron 8600 notbook . It did not help at all . Using books to lift up the back end of the notebook gave the same effect at no cost . The notebook barely fits on the device and may be the reason that the device did not work . May be this will work with small notebook ... If you have a big 15 '' or up notbook , look for somthing else .
 The picture of this unit appears to be an older model . I had the silver version and it worked well for more than two years . It had a vent in the back to channel air out . The model I replaced it with is black -LRB- but still has the same PA248U model number on back -RRB- , and is much more dependent on airflow from underneath . This means that as soon as you place it on an sofa arm or pillow or something , it will immediately start to audibly strain . However , it does provide a lot of airflow when unconstrained on a table or desk.But the final straw came when one of the fan blades started making a scraping noise . I lifted my computer up to see what was happening and - I kid you not - one of the fan blades came shooting out of the unit and landed two feet to my left . This thing was pointy and sharp and could have taken an eye out - if you 're lucky enough to have it come out the top!I want my old silver one back ... This one is being returned .
 The design of the targus product is fine , but cheap electrical connections and cheap fans limit the life of this product to a few months if used regularly . It does keep the laptop sufficiently cool to alleviate overheating . The Antec mat is better for about the same price .
 I own two of these laptop coolers . Bought at the same time and used with two different laptops . Both have the same problem . After about one month of use , the socket on the cooling pad works loose , so the device no longer receives power and the fans stop working . The fans do an excellent job of cooling both laptop and lap until the hardware fails.If I could figure out how to crack the case , I might try to repair these devices . Instead , I 'm shopping for another brand with better construction .
 I picked this up a couple of months ago , and it worked decently for cooling my laptop , just not great . It , like many other cooling mats , makes the mistake of blowing air INTO the laptop , rather than drawing air away from it . This is not the way that you cool a computer effectively . Look at any desktop machine these days , while some higher end machines have fans drawing cool air into the machine , nearly ALL computers have fans that blow hot air out . So while this does a decent job of cooling , it 's far from ideal.My biggest complaint is in the quality of the materials . Opening this package initially left me very disappointed , as it is constructed of a very cheap and flimsy plastic . The fans are cheaply made too , which I could have easily seen failing if something else did n't break first.My biggest problem is with the power cable . It is extremely thin and fragile , disappointing considering it 's designed for a product that 's supposed to be mobile and durable . The end of the cable that plugs into the pad itself does not fit snugly , it jiggles around quite a bit and can easily come loose without realizing it . Many times I was using my laptop wondering why it was getting to hot , just to realize that the cord had become unplugged without my knowledge . The USB end of the cable does not have any sort of piece to prevent the cable from being bent too far at the connector , which is a certainty if you 're plugging in the cable on the left hand side of your computer -LRB- and judging by the unnecessarily long cable , it 's almost as if the designers expected you to plug in the cable there -RRB- . The constant bending of the cable at the USB side caused it to be frayed within a couple of weeks , leaving the wires exposed at the connector.I did n't have this pad for 2 months before the cable just snapped entirely , rendering the entire pad useless . I realize that I could have been a little more careful , but the fact remains that it 's an unacceptably low quality product for something that 's supposed to be used in a mobile setting . I will be looking for a more quality product next time around , hopefully from a manufacturer that understands that laptop accessories actually need to be somewhat rugged and durable .
 I am not a techie , nor am I computer illiterate . I 'm like many of you - dependent on my computer for work and personal use , just looking for something that works and does n't cost a fortune -LRB- for my notoriously hot Sony Vaio ; size 12.5 '' x 9.3 '' -RRB- . The Targus Chillpad was the first cooler I ever bought so I was satisfied because I had nothing to compare it to ... until I used someone else 's cooler and realized what I missing . And I immediately bought that one - $ 10 LESS AND 10 TIMES BETTER.Here 's the Deal : The Targus Chillpad gets the job done . Nothing more , and with SEVERAL drawbacks . FIRST , it is EXTREMELY NOISY . I would n't recommend using it in office spaces or community areas . Also , it often makes `` grinding noises '' when you first start it or any time you move . SECOND , if you have hairy legs , FORGET using the Chillpad on your lap - there is no cover on the bottom of the cooler , so it will make you very nervous about those hairs getting caught in the fans -LRB- AND MINE DID ! -RRB- . THIRD , the Chillpad is not as thin or compact as it could be , making it difficult to pack in your computer bag . FOURTH , it is extremely feeble . I remember reading about its tendency to break in other people 's reviews - and they were n't joking . Mine started making those weird grinding noises within a month of getting it . A few months later , the cord attaching the cooler to the computer became really loose , so the chillpad would n't work unless I physically pushed and held the cord inside the cooler , while trying to type with one hand . FIFTH , the Chillpad did n't manage to cool one section of my laptop -LRB- which would remain REALLY hot -RRB- , and I would n't complain about this if it were n't for the fact that the laptop cooler I recommend below does cool the entire laptop.Here 's the Better Deal : The laptop cooler that I switched to is the Vantec Lapcool 3 -LRB- about $ 18 -RRB- . It is much quieter , much thinner , covered on the bottom to keep those hairs safe , and much more durable . I use it almost constantly and have not had a single problem , excepting the noise it once made when I accidently dropped it -LRB- which I think is understandable -RRB- . I ca n't believe that a laptop cooler that is so much better than the Targus Chillpad would be so much cheaper . But that 's better for me ! Even if this thing were to break in the next few month for some reason , the purchase would have been worth it.Hope this helps !
 This item lasted about 5 months , and was a pain even during that time . It was loud when running normally , and one or both of the fans would stop spinning and make some horrendous noise at random . I would have to turn it off and on again to make it work . Now it does n't work at all . The connector used to draw power from the chord broke for no good reason , as I was not hard on this cooler . Do not spend your money on this piece of crap ; you can get better coolers for the same amount of money .
 I purchased this from Staples a few months back . It worked okay , but one of the fans constantly stopped working or made a horrible sound . It just stoppd working tonight .
 This fan was easy to setup and use . It did a great job cooling off my Thinkpad T60p . But , after only a few months of fairly normal usage -LRB- no drops/excessive wear/etc -RRB- the power cord connection went bad - I even tried taping it into place to hold it in better , but it did n't work for long.Also , the plastic fins on the fan can get bent - not sure how , but they do . And then they catch , making that fan not work -LRB- there are 2 -RRB- . I 've gone in and fixed it - mostly by removing the bent fin .
 I bought this product as a precautionary measure for my new laptop since I had one burn out on me . It worked well for a couple months with minimal use . The first problem occured when one of the fan blades broke off while in use . I was able to shake the piece out of the way -LRB- since I could n't get the unit open -RRB- and continue to use it . Soon after , the power `` thingy '' -LRB- place on the cooling pad where you plug the USB adapter in to get power -RRB- became loose . I had to hold it in just the right place for it to operate . Now it does n't operate at all and I just use it to protect my lap . I would not reccomend this product .
 I 'm boycotting Targus because I contacted them about replacing my defective usb cord , but they would n't replace it because it was `` out of warranty . '' What am I supposed to do with a notebook cooler w/o the cords to use it with.It sad that such a big company could n't spare sending a measly cord to one of it 's former customers.I have not and will not be buying anymore of their products .
 I purchased this chill pad on March 28th ... received it in April and it died in June . It died after the initial 30 days so I ca n't return it to Amazon . Do n't waste your time or money .
 I am very dissapointed with this fan , it worked great for a few months , then it broke down , I had it replaced , then it broke down again , it was then replaced a second time , and now it has broken down yet again . Customer service at targus is great , however to replace it each time is $ 5 -LRB- pay for shipping -RRB- and at this rate I have spent as much as a more durable one would have cost me.Pros : when it is working properly , it keeps your laptop very cool.Cons : - It is flimsy , I do n't recommend it for laptops over 5 lbs-The cable is what has been breaking down on me , so its obviously cheap-The rubbers fall off that hold the notebook up at an angle-it is made of very cheap plasticLike I said its good when its working , but dont expect this to last you over a year .
 I bought this item originally from Wal-Mart . This is my FOURTH one in a little over a year . Every one I have had has died within 4 months . So I just kept either exchanging it for a new one , or buy a new one and return the broken one . Then it looked like Targus redesigned the PA248U because even though the model number was the same , they changed the casing completely and added an on/off button . I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt , so I got it . It was improved . Now it does n't die outright . The fans will just stall out until you move the mat around and angle it up until the fans will restart . And to get warranty service , you have to pay to ship it back to them . But it costs over half as much to do that as it does to buy a brand new unit .
 I received a targus chill pad that was different from the one being shown by the seller . seller needs to update the image . chill mate cools the laptop but it is noisy . the fan noise can become annoying over time . I would not recommend this model .
 This products is not recommended for PC 15 inch , the service for Amazon is Good , Thank you
 I 've had this for about 6 months or so . A couple of months ago , I noticed that my laptop was n't cooling down anymore and that 's when I realized the USB wire was disconnecting and therefore preventing the chillpad from turning on . To work around the issue , I would have to fidget with the cable so that the unit would actually turn on . Well today it finally died . $ 20 is not a lot of money but it sure is a waste if the product only works for a few months .
 I almost never write negative reviews , but have to for this product . After three weeks the fan started making noise . The pad has been sitting on my desk -LRB- I do n't carry or use it otherwise -RRB- , so it has n't been knocked around . I do use my laptop -LRB- MBP -RRB- very long hours , but that 's why I purchased the product in the first place , to keep my laptop cool ! It appears that the fan blades are now hitting another part of the unit -LRB- the grating ? -RRB- , slowing them down and making an intolerable amount of noise , making the product unusable.After I unplugging the power jack several times , it also became very difficult to plug back in . The power jack is also defective . I 'm going to return the product . Very poor quality design and fabrication . Stay away from this product . Reflects poorly on Targus , too .
 Less than two months after purchasing this product it did not work properly . So , I contacted the seller after reading their guarantee : `` A-to-z GuaranteeWe want you to buy with confidence anytime you purchase products on Amazon.com . That is why we guarantee purchases from Amazon Marketplace , Auctions , zShops , and Merchant sellers . The condition of the item you buy and its timely delivery are guaranteed ... `` After providing all the information they requested they said they were very sorry but I had to contact the manufacturer . The item was less than $ 20 and by the time I would go through the hoops I would have spent another $ 20 . This really is aggravating because of their stated guarantee . My belief is that if a seller does not act positively , I will not beat my head against a wall . Rather I will write a review and hope no one else gets stuck with this problem.This is only the second negative review I have written in all my shopping with Amazon . And they both have happened in the past month . I always rate my transactions and as a whole have not been disappointed with my purchases on Amazon .
 I had this product for about three days before realizing I should have bought something else . The cord on it is way too long and there are no additional usb ports so it was taking up one of the only four I had . After about four months the fans just died ; they just do n't work anymore . I have taken the cord off and use the base just to keep it off a flat surface until I get a better one . Not to mention it seems really flimsy and if the fans would have lasted any time at all then it probably would have broken somewhere else .
 I bought this product for the second time , based on the low price , however , as the saying goes `` You get what you paid for . '' Which is absolutely true for a second time buyer . It worked fine for a while but as time goes the fan blades begin to get caught in the grill and make a very loud sound and eventually they break off.But I paid under $ 11 for it so I got what I paid for ... I invested alittle more in another brand and it is holding up thus far .
 I 've had this item for a few short months and I had to throw it away . After a month the fans operated intermittantly , and I had to fiddle with the wire awhile until I got fed up . I found after opening the unit , that the plug for the power USB cable had one of the three connectors that is solder to the board was broken off . Very disappointed that the build of this pad was very flimsy . Not worth more than a couple of bucks . Maybe 50 cents . Seriously , if you need a hardy long lasting cooling pad for your laptop , look elsewhere . Targus missed the mark with this one .
 I would not recommend anyone to buy this product . The plastic blades which make up the fans starting breaking after two weeks . Then after another 2 to 3 weeks the cord started not to work without me wiggling it around . Then it just stop working altogether . Do Not Waste Your $ $ $ !!!!
 Bought this online from eforcecity . It 's a nice powerful fan if you have a really hot laptop . Unfortunately within a day of getting it pieces of the fan began breaking off . Then 3 and a half months later the connection that powers the fan from the computer broke off .
 Just like the other negative reviews , after a few months I had to wiggle the cord a LOT to make the fans turn on . And not long after that it just stopped working.It 's really a terrible product . It 's made of plastic so that doesnt help disperse the heat.On a side note , I 've also bought a Targus laptop briefcase and the locks to keep it securely shut are starting to become unaligned after only minimal use.I 'd stay away from all Targus products all together .
 The pad cools better than nothing , but the chord that connects to your laptop is terrible . I 've gone through at least 4 of them over the last year . Consistently the part of the cable that connects from the cool pad to the on/off switch has a break in it . All I do is wrap up the cable , put it in my bag , and otherwise use the device on my lap . I 'm not sure how to limit its exposure much more . Only good thing is Targus will replace the cable for you , but it takes a few weeks to receive.Also , the rubber nubs that hold the laptop in place are often lost with no replacements readily available . I 'm looking for a better product at this time ...
 Ok , so here is the low down on this product . Its loud , I would take my laptop to school and people would thing my laptop was going to explode from the sound of this thing . I did n't mind it , but it bothered most people . I will say that the fans did increase performance slightly since the computer was running at a lower temperature . Right now I am looking into getting the chillhub to replace this item . I think any laptop owner should buy some kind of extra fan for their notebook . Down side to using the chill pad is the fact that you lose a USB port , but it 's great for travel . I kept mine taped to the laptop so that it would n't slide or anything and kept the super long cable taped to the lid of my laptop . After about 9 month it just broke , the fan tore itself up then it started grinding now its scraps to me . Oh yeah another good thing about this is that is lifts your notebook up and makes it easier to type when it 's on a table , or at least that 's how it is for me , I get a better angle on my wrists .
 The PodiumPad by Road Tools -LRB- rebranded as Targus -RRB- is the big sibling of Coolpad . Basically it just has adjustable rubber balls as opposed to fixed ones on the Coolpad . Neither one works at all when it comes down to cooling down your laptop computer . It 's also very inconvenient to type on the laptop when placed on the Podiumpad , and adjusting the height of the rubber thingies is a pain . Do not waste your money . Search for a product called Bytecc Notebook Cooler ... which is cheaper and has built-in fans which actually cool down your computer .
 I 'm running a Dell Inspiron 9100 - one of their first models to have a Pentium 4 HT processor . Because of this fact , my computer gets incredibly hot on its underside , right below where the memory and video card is installed.I bought this pad , hoping it would help - but the truth is , I ca n't tell if it helps or not . The two fans on this thing , while quiet , seem very weak . I can barely feel any extra air coming from the back of my system , and the area where the memory is installed still gets intensly hot . It DOES elevate the computer off of whatever surface I 'm working on , which is good , I suppose , but my laptop is so large -LRB- widescreen display -RRB- that it completely covers the Chill Pad and sometimes slides off of it.I want to give this thing a good review , since my computer needs its help so badly , but it just feels underpowered and flimsy . I doubt this thing will last more than a year , and it 's not really worth blocking up a USB port -LRB- which is annoying , considering I work in media and need all the ports -RRB- . Perhaps the newer model of this Chill Pad with the built-in USB hub works better and is better constructed - if so , get that one . This one works , in the sense that the fans do indeed spin , but that 's about all I can say for it.And to top all that , when I pulled mine out of its box , it already had a crack in the plastic and some of the silver paint was rubbed off the corners .
 I used this product to cool my laptop which is a server . Therefore I ran this notebook cooler for 24 hours a day . After running it for 3 months , I realized that one of the fan slowed down . A month later , the fan stopped running.Overall , I do n't recommend this product . The cooling power is not strong enough especially yours is a heavy duty laptop . I recommend the one from AntecAntec USB-Powered Notebook Cooler . I 've run mine for 2 years non-stop . So far it still works great .
 This worked great for two weeks and then just stopped working . I fiddled with the cord and it started again . Then it stopped and completely died . Do n't buy this , it is something about the connection cord that is defective and quits working . If there was a way to rate it at zero stars , I would .
 This product is cheaply made and noisy . The USB power cable developed a problem after 30 days . Do n't get ripped off . Avoid this unreliable product .
 The chill pad worked great for my HP Pavilion that had been overheating on a regular basis . Then one day the fans stopped running , and the on/off switch did n't work . My husband , a mechanical engineer , determined that the problem was that there was a break in the metal wires . I think I 'm going to try another model that does n't involve mechanical parts ...
 The first one stopped working for no apparent reason after about one year . The second one is way too noisy . This means that the third one will definitely be a different brand . Too bad , as this model is cheap , lightweight and it does the job ... as long as it works .
 Wasting money on things is alright , wasting money on the Targus Chill Pad is NOT acceptable . There are WAY better options for a notebook cooler 's such as the Cooler Masters NotePal U-x series which will run you about 5 more bucks . I 've used it on my aging HP Pavilion Dv5 notebook which is apparently notorious for turning off when overheating , these were the results : - Turned on my computer , without the cooler . Watched some videos for 15 minutes . Turns off.-Let the computer cool off . Turned it on . Plugged in the Targus Chill Pad . Watched some videos for 25 minutes . Turns off.Wow ! An extra 10 minutes of Dexter ! No . The cooler does n't evenly distribute air , plastic quality is of no help , and the usb cord broke in about a week . Not ever buying again .
 Only good thing about it is the price . But the price is n't worth a Chill Pad that 'll break by week two . I used mine for six-eight hours a day , and it broke a little after two weeks . It 'll still work , I just have to fight it . Move the USB Cord around a lot , position it differently . It 's just too much of a hassle to be worth the price . If you 're looking for a cheap Chill Pad this is it . But if you 're looking for a Chill Pad that works , this is n't what you want .
 This chill pad worked for about 2 months before I ran into problems . I found that I had to wiggle the power cord where it plugged into the chill mat -LRB- on the side -RRB- in order for the fans to come on . Within a week , I could n't get power to flow to the chill mat at all .
 I happen to own a Mac Book Pro which runs pretty hot . I saw this on Amazon and read the reviews along with all of the other cool pads for laptops and wound up deciding on this one largly because of the lack of negative reviews and Amazon said most people buy this cool pad . Let me detail for you why this is a horrible purchase , $ 20 or otherwise.First off it really wasnt clear from the description or pictures but this chill pad is plastic . It disperses little to no heat , where as propping the back of my laptop up with a book did better . I was hoping for a metal that would act like a heat sink -LRB- is that not the purpose of a cool pad ? -RRB- The laptop is far to close to the actual chill pad so there is little to no air flow and since the piece is plastic you will have to keep the fan on for any effect . -LRB- Unlike Antec or NotePal coolers -RRB- The usb wire is long and for some reason has an on off switch on it . Why you would plug in the usb cord yet keep it the fan off is beyond me ... just an annoyance , no real issue with performance.I am a programmer so I already spend a long time at the keyboard . This cool pad raises your laptop up higher then its competitors as listed on Amazon virtually breaking your wrists to type on it . However if you dream of altering your desk and chair and possibly buying a bunch of other garbage to raise your wrists for typing this may not be an issue.My last gripe is how cheaply made this product is . Being plastic with little to no design , it is an eye sore and you may just break it or the fan by using it.Overall using this is a far worse experience then just using the laptop hot as it only reduces the temperature by three degrees . I guess I was looking for something that was a little more comfortable and practical to work on . As well as effective . If you buy this , you will be underwhelmed .
 The cooler is a help , but no shortage of heat still produced . It 's smaller than the laptop as expected , but not by much -LRB- dell 1705 -RRB- .
 I should have checked here first , too . I bought this through Officemax less than a year ago and it worked well while it worked , but after less than a year , it 's now dead . For $ -LSB- ... -RSB- in plastic and motors , I expect better than a one year obsolescence . I wo n't be buying this brand again .
 Mine did help keep my Dell Inspiron 8500 from getting too hot , but the USB cable leaves a lot to be desired . About a month after getting mine , the fans stopped working . I found the problem to be in the silly on/off switch they stuck in the middle of the cable . I removed the switch and spliced the cable . However , now , approximately six months after I bought the unit , it appears that a wire has broken near the USB plug , and as far as I know , replacement USB plugs are n't available . I guess now it 's buy a 5V AC adaptor and wire into the thing . Needless to say , I 'm not impressed .
 This device is an addition to the fan inside the notebook . However , by itself -LSB- ; ` vfv -RSB- \ it did little to cool the laptop down .
 I have gotten 2 of these from Targus only to have them both break right at the switch . The switch is so flimsey , next time I 'm going to go with a different model . I would have expected better from Targus
 I bought this when it came out , it was very expensive and it broke within 2 months ! Very terrible quality , do not buy !
 I use my laptop -LRB- an older HP G60 -RRB- about 14-16 hours a day and heat build up is a serious issue . I was quite surprised to find that this pad died in just over 6 weeks . Usually Targus items take the daily beating I put them through and come back begging for more . Not this one ! It worked fine for about six weeks . Yesterday I forgot to shut off my laptop over night . I got up this morning to a dead fan and my laptop shut off because it overheated . I will go look for a different model today and avoid this one in the future .
 The good
 The air flow from the two fans is barely noticeable even half an inch from them.And flow is in the opposite direction of what I would expect.I.e . the air is sucked in from the top and pushed out along a longnarrow strip on the long thin side . This causes the laptop to getas hot as it normally would without the chill pad . And I suspect thelow pressure caused by the suction at the top may reduce cooling airflowinto the laptops , most of which have opening at the bottom to suck in air.I would expect the fans to push air up to the laptop sitting on top of it.There is no way to reverse the flow , and the fans are not removable fromthe case as the case moulding forms the fan axle.Total waste of money , other than to see how cheaply todays products are made .
 I brought it because I needed it but the complaints about the openings being to much in the center is an issue . I remedy the situation by off setting the laptop off the fan to where one of the fans blew into the side where the laptop fan opening is located . The fan started off great but it stopped working , the cord has some type of shortage . Many times I have to plug the cord in order for the fan to move . Sometimes one fan would be moving while the other was still . Upside it is cheap , downside it will stop working and you would have wasted money on it .
 This product if ordered should just go straight to trash can . Fans are in the center , which does absolutely nothing for my computer . Second , the fans are small , so no air is circulated by these things . Worst fan I have ever purchased ... Finally purchased a large single fan that works and works well . Stay Away from this Piece of $ *** . You figure it out .
 I bought this from a vender at a discount event because I needed a cooling pad . At the time , I thought it 's light weight meant that it would be great for transporting , not that it was flimsy and cheaply-made , which it was . I must have used it less than ten times . I tend to use my laptop all over the house , so carrying the cooling pad with me wherever I went was a burden , and I 'd only gotten it to shut my computer up over complaining about overheating . When my laptop was on my lap it tended to overheat less -LRB- but it still did not cool it that much -RRB- , so I used the cooling pad whenever it was sitting on my bed or table . I just tried to plug it in today when it refused to start , after not having used it for several months . The pad had been propped up against my bookcase in the interim , nothing extreme like having it in my backpack every day . Nonetheless , it is broken and I feel gypped out the $ 16 I paid for it . It came with a one-year warranty , but frankly , I 'm so dissatisfied that I do n't even want another piece of Targus `` quality merchandise '' . I will write this professionally though and give the pros and cons.Pros : - lightweight-has rubber pads-easy to useCons : - cheaply manufactured-frequently started and stopped-broke within 6 months-did not cool my laptop significantly-noisyWarning , do NOT buy Targus brand laptop accessories . The low price is more than that you actually get
 The pad ran quietly , but 2 years later it is missing 5 of the foot pads and the fans no longer run . For something with hardly anything to it , that 's sad .
 This was a great cooler out of the box , it is silent and cooled nicely . However , it 's cheaply made . The power cords are very cheap , and the cooler itself is flemsy plastic . The pictures make it look much more substantial than it actually is . Our quit working after about 3 months . Targus makes a `` new & improved '' version . We tried it as well . Much better made , but it was noisey -LRB- so noisey it gave me a headache -RRB- . So we opted for another brand and much happier .
 I 've owned this product for less than 5 months . The fan operation has been erratic the last month . Today it quit completely . I expected more from this product than it delivered . I will not buy another Targus product . Inexpensive should not mean cheap !
 This Targus did a great job keeping my notebook cool . Unfortunately , it died for no apparent reason after only 5 months of use . It never left my home . I kept it in my laptop backpack and babied it as I do all my computer equipment . It looks brand new , too bad it 's a useless piece o ' crap . Shame on Targus , I specifically bought it for the Targus name , thinking it would be dependable ! What a waste of money ...
 I bought this product for a 13 '' notebook . I could see virtually no improvement in the heat reduction performance of the 2 fans . I was disappointed with the lack of quality in this product and turned off by its design and cheap plastic appearance . It did not appear to be constructed with any lasting longevity in mind . On that note , I promptly returned it for a refund , and purchased an aluminum frame Cool Master Note Pal . It has definately cooled down my computer and has been a good choice .
 I bought not one , but two chill mats for household computers.Neither one lasted more than two months . The connection plug from the USB port to the mat broke down in both instances . While the connection plug worked , it was fine , but this is a serious issue with the product.I discourage buying this chill pad .
 It 's a small unit . I have a 15 '' Macbook Pro and I ca n't use it . I 'm just gon na give it to someone with a Macbook . I whish they made them to work with a 15 or 17 '' Macbook Pro .
 Targus PA248U Notebook Chill PadThis product is a waste of money ! No matter if I use my laptop for a little while or for a long period of time . It still I have had the pad for about 11 months and it always has a problem . The fans do n't even line up with ANY laptop 's internal fan ! The wire is cheapy and therefore you have to pinch , move it around , tug on it for the connection to be made ! Do n't waste your money ! Buy any other cooling pad with larger fans and even on an incline , which allows for best airflow .
 This fan was great for the first 3 months of so with daily use , but today it just fell apart . The power chord connecting to the fan , became dislodged from the input . In other words , the chord randomly separated and ceased to work . I suppose you get what you pay for , and I am convinced spending an extra ten dollars will be worth it in the long run .
 I received a different chill pad than the one pictured . It is a very undurable plastic , and one of the fans is already making noise after 3 weeks . It does not cool well on a flat surface such as a desk , so the only useful purpose is if you have it on your lap . You get what you pay for I suppose , but I would not suggest it if you have te extra $ 20 .
 I bought the Targus PA248U Chillpad . The fan is very noisy and after a week , the left side fan is making a loud buzzing noise . Got it for a great price -LRB- $ 13 -RRB- , but would n't buy it again . We have a Targus PA248UX for another laptop . Its much better .
 I bought this and it quit working after a month . Beware quality issues ! Also , I have a 17 inch screen laptop and can not find a chill pad other than for a 14 '' or so , although that 's not why I gave the one star rating , it still was a problem sometimes being that much smaller than my laptop . If you only work on a flat tabletop it should do fine . The month it worked , it did work pretty well and I had no overheating issues while using it . So if you 're willing to risk the low quality manufacturing of this product it might be OK .
 Let me first say that the pictured version , the light silver one , is an EXCELLENT product ! I 've been using it with a Fujitsu T4010 laptop for almost a year , but it works great even on widescreen 15.4 '' laptops ... It 's whisper quiet , vents all the air out the back , and is not dependent on airflow from underneath whatsoever . Some reviewers have commented on poor positioning of the fans ... that 's actually a non-factor due to the air channels which allow a small amount of air to constantly flow past the bottom of your laptop - and that 's really all that 's needed to keep heat from building up . I use my laptop to edit video , which used to make it scorching hot . . and even with normal use , I had to keep a phone book under it , though even that got warm on the bottom after some time . The old version , though thin and light enough to take anywhere -LRB- even coach class on a Regional Jet -RRB- , made my laptop feel cool to the touch . I 've been using As a bonus , it drew a very negligible amount of power , which at most cut down battery life by a few minutes.Now the bad news
 This is my second Targus chill mat and my last . The first one lasted 9 months and even though it was still under warranty , I did n't bother to return it . I think they count on it being too much of a hassle . While it was working , I usually had to jiggle the power cord to get the fans going . The second chill mat did n't work from day one . Not even blowing on the fans made them move . Returning to seller for refund . Any suggestions for a replacement?Note
 I actually loved this item , so you can imagine how sad I was when it stopped working.I have purchased laptop cooling pads from different companies and unfortunately none of them have worked for more than a few months.I chalk it up to cheap products made in China.If anyone has purchased a laptop cooling pad that has lasted and is still going strong , please let me know .
 Like the previous reviewer I too did not get the one that is in the main picture . I should have got one that has curves/contours on the sides but this one i got is perfectly rectangle . Plus get this the packaging that came with the one they sent doesnt even look like the one they sent . The packaging and instructions looks like the one in the main picture here . Plus the one I should have got has vents on the side . The one i got does not . So beware when u order this . U wont get the item that is in the main picture . Seems like a much inferior replacement they sent instead . Not happy !
 This product is not as show or described . It looks like a replacement for the Targus Chill Pad that goes into a lap-stand . The model shown is a great Chill Pad that has high speed fans and fits into the Targus stands . However this model is super thin is low speed fans . There is also no room to vent the heat out the sides or top or allow cool air to be blown by the fans . The fans also began to freeze up after a week of use . I ordered two and regret it . Do n't let the fake picture fool you , this is a low model of Chill Pad and is poorly designed . There are much better models out there , such as the actual one pictured .
 I bought three of these , one for my , one for my boyfriend and one for his sister ... as Targus is a good name . Two stopped working within 3 months and the 3rd stopped working in 4 . Waste of money .
 I 've had the Targus Chill Pad for about 2 months now , and I say thumbs down . Money can be spent on a more worthy cooler . The adapter part that plugs into the cooling pad often gets to have a poor connection , thus shutting off the fans . Also , plastic = bad . Heat dissipation was alright when I first bought it , but now ... it 's not performing up to task . Why ?! THE FANS BLADES BROKE OFF !!! The left fan is missing one blade and the right fan is missing two blades ! Like I said ... plastic = bad . Spend your money on an aluminum cooling pad . . preferably with ball-bearing fans.Research before you buy !!!
 I bought one of these shortly after Christmas to keep my laptop cool . Although it did a good job of keeping my laptop from overheating , I was very dissatisfied with the cord.I have had to return it twice in less than two months because of breaks in the cord , once by the on/off switch , once by the plug .
 I was very optimistic to receive this item because my computer often overheats . I am a college student , so I do a lot of work using my laptop . The cooling pad itself is a little small for my Dell Inspiron 1150 ; this causes the fans on the cooling pad to be located closer to the front than where they need to be in the back . The product was difficult to get working , but after I fiddled with the cord and the switch for a while it did come on . However , I have had the cooling pad for less than a week and it has already completely quit working . I would not recommend purchasing this product .
 At first the chill pad worked really well and kept my notebook cool . But the fans stopped working after only a month . I was not happy with the product .
 Well , the selling feature of 10x optical zoom had me hooked . Unfortunately , the picture quality was terrible -LRB- not just the zoom pix -RRB- . I had a Kodak for 4 years and it took MUCH better pix . My daughter 's Olympus had great pix of the same events that I took with the Panasonic . I returned it after using it at a weekend basketball tourney ; I purchased a Cannon A710 as a deparation purchase the night before I left for a big trip and was thrilled with the pix quality and features .
 Bought the camera because my daughter had high praise for it , I read many good on-line reviews , it has a large viewing screen , and it could take flash pictures in quicker succession than my previous camera , the Canon PowerShot A520 -LRB- whose screen broke followin a severe fall -RRB- . Sadly , my experience with the Panasonic camera has been very disappointing .1 . Because of the placement and sensitivity of the function buttons on the back of the camera , they are often pushed by my hand involuntarily when just holding the camera , or taking a picture . That means , I ca n't take the picture until I turn off the function that was turned on without my having intended to turn it on . Very annoying .2 . Many of the pictures , even ones taken in good light conditions , and without hand shake , do not have clear focus .3 . Despite trying every imaginable combination of settings , I have not been able to take a satisfactory picture indoors under artificial lights - with or without flash . Objects or people nearby get over-exposed , while objects or people a little further are dark .4 . I did not like the shutter delay on my Canon PowerShot A520 , nor that I had to wait 13 second between flash pictures . Now , after my experience with the Panasonic , I have bought a used Canon PowerShot A520 , and eagerly await its arrival so that once again I can have pictures that have accurate color , and are in good focus .
 I 've been using digital cameras since 1999 and before that I 've used film for 25 years . This purchase was our 5th digital camera , previously we 've has two Canons , a Nikon , and an Olympus . We were on vacation when our 4 year old Canon ELPH started to flake out and freeze up from time to time . After 10000 + pictures I ca n't complain.So we decided to check out some cameras at some shops . We played with Canons , Nikons , Fujis , and this Panasonic TZ3 . Since we did n't have time to research a lot on the web -LRB- we were on vacation -RRB- we relied on hands on tests and salesperson information . We found this little shop that carried Panasonics and Fujis and the shop owner was a cool talkative guy . He suggested this particular camera and we played around with it a bunch in the shop , talked it over , and figured we 'd give it a shot and we bought one . I especially liked the fact that it had Leica optics and overall it seemed quick and easy to use.Then we got out into the real world and started to take pictures of our kids , both inside and outside . We were shocked by the purled tinges to the skin tones and just the `` off '' colors , not subdued or too `` punchy '' , but `` off '' . We are Caucasian , and the pictures had botchy purple spots on our skin and gave my daughters ' blonde hair a wicked red cast . I messed with the color settings and other settings , but could n't get decent skin tones . I took around 60 pictures , being careful to make sure I was doing everything `` right '' , but I could n't get anything close to what I 'd call realistic colors.We returned to the shop and the salesman printed out a couple pictures and they were n't as bad as on the screen , but still the skin tones looked washed out . He tried to say it was because of the poor light outside due to it being cloudy , and even told me I had a lot of purple in my face -LRB- ?!?! -RRB- . He also said I 'd need to play with the White Balance to get good pictures -LRB- not true on all but the first digital camera I bought in 1999 -RRB- . I asked if it was the screen , or this particular camera and he said the camera was working fine . So I told him I could n't use this camera and he fortunately refunded our money.Since we got home , I started doing some research and have n't found too many complaints on the web about this . But we 've been going to a lot of cameras stores back here at home and every copy of this model seems to have this issue . I 'm writing this to warn any others out there that might be thinking of this camera . If you like to take color pictures , especially of people , avoid this model .
 Bought this camera in February 2008 . Being very careful about my cameras , I was totally disappointed to realize that , suddenly , last September 2009 , the display showed only blurred and purple `` images '' . When looking at menus , display was perfect . Diagnostic from Panasonic Service Center
 Bottom line
 I bought this camera -LRB- panasonic lumix -RRB- 2 years ago and its CCD is totally crashed now and shows nothing . Warranty of CCD is 6 month . So , if you want to use a camera for 6 month and ready to trash it , then I recommend you to buy this . The color is unrealistic -LRB- Canon was much better -RRB- , CCD accepts images very slowly , so the camera makes a lot of motion blurs.AdvGood for 1 yearGood for outdoor with bright sunshine10x zoom with bad lensDisDo not work after 1 year -LRB- CCD Warranty is 6 month , Panasonic can not guarantee their product no more than 6 month . -RRB- Do not use indoor or in cloudy weatherBad color quality and pixel quality -LRB- 2MB quality , they may just interpolate the pixel values -RRB- .
 I purchased this camera in 2009 , before a trip to Disney World . The camera handled beautifully and the battery life was great considering I took approximately 3000 pictures on our trip . Upon returning home and uploading the pictures to my iMac , I was surprised to see an odd grey cast to the skin in nearly every photo of my family . -LRB- Having them printed produced the same grey cast -- even directly from the SD card . -RRB- I put it down to user error , even though I have been an avid photographer since childhood , taking photography classes and developing my one prints for years -- years ago . I checked out the camera settings , read the manual again and tried custom settings , rather than the `` heart '' -LRB- auto -RRB- setting . No better . Sometimes worse . Pictures from a winter trip to NYC and Central Park were downright bizarre , so I discussed it with the photo person at the store where the prints were made and she suggested adjusting it -LRB- for the life of me I can no longer remember in which way -RRB- and the grey tones came out , my children looked great . -LRB- BTW , they both have lighter toned Caucasian skin , just for clarity -RRB- . Again and again I have blamed myself , even though the 2 digitals I had before this purchase -LRB- which I replaced due to simply wearing one out or looking for newer features and better mp size -RRB- both provided me with stunningly clear , naturally colored photos , even with a 3.1 mp camera !! I was surprised to notice one other poor review mentioned another odd photo occurance -- an almost painted look on the faces of some of the people . No settings were adjusted . It is on factory settings . But the faces have an almost penciled in look at the eyes and at smile lines . Creepily strange . Occurs about 1/3 of the time.I was very excited to purchase this Panasonic DMC-TZ3 and did my research beforehand , checking review after review . When I make my next PAS camera purchase , it will be somewhere that I can return it within 30-60 days or so and I will no longer blame myself when the auto setting produces such oddly tinted photos . Nothing is perfect , and I must say this camera certainly has not helped me preserve my memories for the last year and half , for despite the fact that I have uploaded more than 35,000 digital photos to my iPhoto in the time since I bought it , the fact that I must continually go in and adjust photos before being able to print them is ridiculous and time consuming.If you consider purchasing this camera , by all means give it a thorough run through before your return period is up . It enlarges photos beautifully , so as long as skin tones and colors are accurate , takes quite good action photos on the sports/high burst setting and the video was very good . You may enjoy this camera very much , just try it first .
 I have had this camera for a few years now and i am just your average person taking pictures of my child . This camera takes the WORST pictures indoors . If the lighting is low , even with a flash the picture will be washed out or too dark . Outside the pictures are lovely . This camera does n't take black and white -LRB- or if it does i did n't figure out how -RRB- everything else about this camera is great . Solid construction , easy to use , battery life is great ... but the pictures taken inside are AWFUL . If you are going to spend -LSB- ... -RSB- bucks on a camera get a DSLR
 When looking at all the features this camera has , you would think Panasonic had made the perfect camera . Sadly , the quality of most images produced by the TZ3 are not very good . Only pictures taken outdoors and with lots of light turn out well . My old Canon S1-IS takes much better pictures overall , even though it is only 3.2 megapixel . Enlargements of the 3.2 MP photos show more detail than photos at 5 or 7 MP on the Panasonic . This is pretty dissapointing , especially when I expected the higher pixel count to equal better picture quality at high magnification . I agree with other reviewers that say that the pictures are soft with blurred detail . Some photos have a strange painted or blocky look . Most photos are grainy and noisy even after trying all available settings . Some have suggested locking the camera at ISO 100 , but unless you have lots of light on the subject , the photos turn out way too dark . I have taken over 400 photos with this camera and can say that only about 30 photos could be considered keepers -LRB- and nearly all of these were taken outside in bright daylight -RRB- , and only about 40 others could be considered useable photos for enlargements . If you only plan on 4 x 6 prints , then most images should work for you . The flash is weak , so you need to shoot close to the subject to get good results with it.Now for the good things
 On paper this seems like a great camera ; 28mm wide angle lens , 10x zoom range , image stabilization and a huge 3 inch LCD all packed into a very affordable well built pocket size package . I really wanted to love this camera , but after using the camera I really ca n't recommend it . Read on.I once owned a Panasonic FZ5 and took many outstanding pictures with it before I upgraded to a DSLR . I bought the TZ3 as an easy to carry alternative for those days when I was n't up to lugging around my DSLR . The TZ3 only fills the bill in good outdoor light , or when using a flash about 8 - 10 feet away . The low light performance of the camera is dreadful and it even losses detail at ISO 100 . This , I have read , is because of excessive noise reduction processing . The flash is very wimpy , which compounds the inability of the TZ3 to take pictures indoors at night . The image stabilization is a nice feature , but you quickly use it up , because the TZ3 's small size makes it hard to hold steady . It might just be me , but I also find the camera misses focus a lot . The net result of all of the above is a lot of blurry pictures . This was a common complaint I noticed in the reviews here on Amazon , before I bought the TZ3 anyway , thinking these reviewers were just inexperienced . I now think the people who are rating this camera highly are the ones who are inexperienced.The colors produced by the camera are also a little under saturated for my taste , which is an easy adjustment on most cameras , but there is very little you can adjust on the TZ3 . You can limit maximum ISO , which you definitely need to do . White balance is adjustable , but the auto white balance is one thing that does work pretty well on the TZ3 . Exposure compensation is the only other manual control and it can be useful , as the TZ3 often wants to overexpose by a 1/3 to 2/3 of a stop.What can I say ? After having great luck with the Panasonic FZ5 I was expecting this to be a slam dunk . Maybe I have become jaded after a couple years of seeing what a DSLR can produce , but my wife has a discontinued Cannon A620 that runs circles around the TZ3 in image quality.The best feature of this camera is the 28mm wide angle capability of its lens . This is a significant upgrade from the 35-36mm found on most digital cameras . The 10x zoom range found only on the TZ3 is certainly useful , but not at the price of image quality . I have returned the TZ3 and will look at one of the Canon models that offer a 28mm lens with a 3X or 4x zoom range . These Canon cameras are also truly pocket size , where as with the TZ3 is too heavy and thick to be something you want to have in your pocket all day long .
 I tested this camera extensively . For casual point-and-shooters , who print small prints , this camera is small , has a great zoom lens , and gives usable pictures . For those like me , who like enlarging pictures , or cropping , this camera blurs details . The Venus noise reduction system applies a blur to all images , greatly softening detail at high magnification . At close magnification of test images , my old Canon S50 pocket digital camera provides much more crisp detail , while this Panasonic TZ3 blurs all the fine details in an image . This was true in bright daylight , flash , at all ISO 's , and was especially severe in low light . After testing this , I returned it.If you want a casual point-and-shoot camera with a great zoom lens , this is a good choice . If you are into semi-serious use of the images , you will find loss of detail unacceptable.UPDATE
 Let me go against the grain here - I ended up selling mine , although there was nothing wrong with it -LRB- no defects -RRB- . I purchased this as a second camera to complement an `` oldie but goodie '' Sony F-707 . I thought that the 10x zoom and the smaller size would help me be able to take photos in more places - when I traveled , took walks , etc.But I found that this unit is too big and heavy for a pocket - and I needed to use a hard case to carry it . At that point , it was almost no different than my -LRB- very large -RRB- F-707 , and the photos it takes do not approach the Sony.In short , it was the wrong compromise for me . I suspect this would be a good camera for a lot of people as an `` only '' camera , but it did not fit my needs as a portable . Perhaps I am spoiled by my 6 year old Sony . I will be buying something else for traveling , but it will be ultra small as opposed to the mid-size and weight of this .
 I bought this camera about a week ago and really put it through its paces . I have taken about 300 pictures in a variety of different settings . The image quality ranged from good for daytime outdoor pictures to poor for any indoor pictures . Every picture is grainy with little detail . Even the colors were off on most indoor shots . I read the owners manual twice from cover to cover for tips and setting adjustment I could make but nothing really allowed me to get the type of picture quality I expected from this camera . What a waste of time.My old Sony DSC-W5 takes much better pictures with no fuss . I upgraded to this Panasonic DMC-TZ3 for the 28mm wide angle and 10X zoom capabilities of the lens . The phenomenal Leica lens is useless in front of such a poor camera . It 's like putting performance tires on a Yugo.I am returning this camera to Amazon immediately .
 I love all features of this camera , pictures are beautiful , it is easy to take them , but ... There is no way I can use it now - it has some electrick shortcut in it that makes battery to overheat while not in use , burns it out after couple shots , lens gets stuck in open position . I sent it for repair since it is still on manufacturer 's warranty and they returned it to me not working at all after 1.5 months of wait . First - do not rely on warranty . second - if you buy - check that you cna take more than 10 pictures at a time - that has been maximum I could do . If light is low than about 3 - before so called repairs ...
 The CCD stopped working correctly after about three years , and the cost to replace it is worth more than the camera . You will see that this is a common problem with this camera , even in the reviews here on Amazon . If I had known that Panasonic builds planned obsolescence into their products , even a camera for several hundred dollars , I would not have participated . So now I have a camera that does n't work and also the guilt of having to find a safe way to get rid of this thing so that it is not clogging up a landfill somewhere . I wo n't be buying any Panasonic products again.I think I am going to go back to low tech and just build a pin hole camera until the manufacturers can build a camera that will last more than a few years with the expected abuses that a camera will experience . If such a device exists already let me know in the comments . No Panasonic though !
 Lumix cameras extremely susceptible to electrolysis from normal household conditions which will result in camera failure -- probably around the time the warranty expires . In my case , it was two weeks after -- Panasonic said to send it for repair to the service center , which contacted me to tell me the charge would be $ 160 to fix the camera . I reluctantly agreed . Three weeks later the camera was returned along with a note that said it was `` not cost effective for them to repair the camera '' , which they did not fix . They included a thank you not with the bill for $ 160 -- for shipping and diagnosis !!! Beware of Panasonic .
 Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ3K 7.2 MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom -LRB- Black -RRB- I wanted so much to like this camera . The 10X zoom is awesome and the LCD screen is huge ! The facts are though , that I need to take action shots in low light and this camera was terrible at that . I tried every setting this camera offers -LRB- and it offers many -RRB- but just could n't get quality prints out of it . You can forget using the zoom with this camera unless you have a tripod . Who can take around a tripod for action shots ? Like I said , I am very disappointed that I could n't use the camera . However , Amazon stood up to it 's excellent return policy and gave me a full refund on the camera , SD card and battery I purchased .
 While the LCD image is clear and sharp in good light , it is distored in low light and at distances . What good is an ultrazoom lens if you ca n't see what you are shooting ?
 Overall , Panasonic 's customer service is atrocious . I would not buy any product from them . Horrible .
 I am used to a responsive camera . I owe a Canon Rebel XT and 30D , but bought this camera based on its reviews . This camera 's response time is SLOW . The subject is standing still yet it still has a noticable lag in shooting . This results in mostly lousy shots . The subject blinks -LRB- even though I count 1-2-3 -RRB- . Mostly I shoot people . In summary , I have to delete 90 % of my shots . Maybe its OK for scenery as the lens is sharp . I do n't care how many pixels a sensor has . The camera has to be responsive . I would rate this one star at best . Save your money .
 I 'm very disappointed with the picture quality of Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ3K . My 3 year old model Canon PowerShot S70 is still a better camera . Now I 'm stack with the bad camera that got great reviews .
 The more I use my TZ3 , the less I like it . I can not take a picture on a nice sunny day without having vertical lines across the horizon . This renders the image useless . Pictures taken using the flash are either totally washed out or they are underexposed . Quality of images taken with low light levels are also poor . This leaves a limited range of lighting conditions where a decent image can be taken.Based on my experiences I would not recommend this camera . There are many positive reviews on Amazon so perhaps my camera is simply defective . I have contacted Panasonic and they will not help me because my camera is out of warranty.We have several older digital cameras including a Kodak and a Canon and they do not exhibit the problems that I have encountered with the TZ3 so I know that what I am experiencing is not normal for digital cameras.I 'm at the point where I will soon pitch this camera into the garbage and buy a new camera . However , I doubt that it will be a Panasonic Lumix .
 I tested this camera extensively through the several days that I owned it . I found that it took acceptable , though not exceptional , pictures . -LRB- Comments some previous reviewers have made about over aggressive noise reduction seem to be true . Images were still less than stellar even when shot at ISO 100 . -RRB- The reason I returned this camera is because the battery would not stay charged for very long . When fully charged , the battery would deplete itself with 6 to 8 hours . I tested all different settings , including power saving features , and nothing seemed to help . I may have gotten a lemon , but I figured you should know just in case.I bought a Canon SD1000 instead . Yes , a very different kind of camera , but right now there are n't many other cameras out there like this Panasonic . -LRB- It was disappointing to return it , but I could n't deal with the battery issues . -RRB- BTW , the Canon is excellent . It has some limitations , like all digicams . However , it makes a great backup to my SLR.I gave this Panasonic a one star based on how important the issue of battery life was to me . Other attributes like the lens and build quality were great .
 After having this camera for 3 weeks and taking it on a trip to Hawaii , I must say it is a poor choice for a camera . My main complaints :1 -RRB- Too much Noise Reduction over ISO 100 setting . What this means in layman 's terms is that pictures look `` blurry '' or `` soft pixelated '' .2 -RRB- The lens gets dirty easily due to the swing open little plastic doors .3 -RRB- Pictures are TOO DARK and skew BLUE .4 -RRB- The size is large , it 's heavy.At the end of the day , I would go with a Canon . They have much better color quality and are reasonably priced . You will miss the 10X zoom and wide angle though ... that is the main reason I bought this camera in the first place.It 's en-route back to Amazon as we speak .
 I had the first version of this camera , the TZ1 , which was great and we used that primarily for taking video clips of the babies . And occasionally for taking photos -LRB- have a SLR as the main camera -RRB- . The TZ1 got dropped on the floor couple weeks ago and the LCD display was trashed . So I came here and ordered the TZ3 thinking it should be a much better version . I was dead wrong . It wo n't let me zoom in/out when taking videos , whereas the TZ1 was able to ! I do n't understand why Panasonic will make such a stupid change . The TZ3 is promptly returned to Amazon , and I grabbed a new copy of the TZ1 from eBay !
 Im a photographer . I compared this head to head with My Canon S70 . The S70 quality of pictures far exceeded this camera . After working with other photographers and Panasonic I have determined It can NOT take a very high quality picture even in perfect situations . It only takes pix with 72 DPI vs 180 DPI with my Canon . The highest MB image it will take is 3.51 . My canon will take averate 2.5 to 3.5 and will do 4.5-5 .5 often . WHY is this important . Well if you blow this picture up to say 5x7 or larter you will notice SIGNIFICANT grain and distortion . It was sad . I took pix in all lights and even focused on ASA 100 and used a tripod . Im sending it back , Its not worth keeping for anyone who wants to blow up or appreciate a good picture . Panasonic even stated its a beginners camera . So my 5 year old technology in my Canon 7m camera Blows this Brand new camera out of the water .
 I opened the box and could n't found the power cable . In fact , there is n't one . The cheapest power cable available online for this camera costs $ 60 on the internet . Unless you buy it , you will have to take the battery out every time you store the camera to charge it . The included battery charger lacks a cord , so it can not be placed conveniently.Battery life is due to the huge screen and lack of an optical view finder . If money is no object , Panasonic will sell you an extra battery for about $ 45 . You can also buy a car charger or a charger with a cord from third parties for more $ $ $ . A related problem is that the image on the screen is delayed a fraction of a second . You see what was happening , not what is happening . That , combined with the excessive shutter delay , makes taking a picture at just the right moment impossible.The camera boasts an Auto Stabilizer feature . Unfortunately , if you pan the camera while taking a video , the results are very jerky unless you remember to disable the Auto Stabilizer feature . What good is an Auto Stabilizer feature you ca n't use ? Incidently , you ca n't use the Zoom feature while taking videos either , because the zoom buttons do n't work during vido capture.The last straw was when I took a bunch of pictures of my family . Fully 1/3 of the pictures turned out blurry . That is a much greater failure rate than with other cameras I have used and owned.This thing is going back to Costco tomorrow .
 Met all my expectations . Excellent stabilization even at 10x . Very good automatic ISO function . This camera is a dream and very easy to use . I had some trouble seeing the LCD screen in bright light . The absence of a viewfinder is noticable but the other features of the camera made it a good trade-off .
 In the beginning I was very excited to have a camera with 10 optical zoom . This was the reason I switched from the very reliable Cannon digital camera to the Panasonic . I have had this camera for 4 months . It takes fine pictures but other then the increased optical zoom I do n't like it better then the 3 Cannons I have owned before . I bought this camera for a trip to Egypt . The camera worked the day before my trip and the first day of my tour it stopped working . It would turn on and off , on and off and then say turn off and then back on . All it would do is repeat this over and over . Needless to say I was not able to purchase another camera or have it fixed on my tour . I had to rely on disposible cameras and other people 's photos . I will NEVER purchase another Panasonic camera again .
 I bought this card about 6 months ago and it has stopped working . I went to take a picture with my camera and an error message saying there is an error with the memory card came up on the camera . I have sandisk -LRB- 2Gb -RRB- for years and havent had any problems with it . I will never buy this card again .
 I was a big fan of this scanner until recently.Opticbook scans books fast without damaging spines.I used it very carefully.I used another scanner of mine for non-book materials , because I did n't want to waste the lamp life.The result ? The lamp died after around 200 scans!I used it intermittently , so I was out of warranty when the lamp died.I 've used scanners of several manufacturers , and this is the first time that a scanner lamp died on me.In sum , $ 300 for 200 scans is not recommendable at all.Added
 Strictly speaking , as a scanner it is working just fine . As a `` Book Scanner '' -LSB- the novel feature it is marketed for -RSB- , this thing is lacking . It does not actually scan up to the edge , as advertised . Hence , I am finding that I can have the book spine right where it is supposed to be , yet I am having my paragraphs truncated by about five or six characters . The software alignment has proven worthless , here , and I can find no place to adjust it on the physical scanner body -LSB- not that I was ever expecting to , or to have to -RSB- . Short story , I bought this about three years ago -LSB- if that -RSB- . Seemed to work fine , though -LSB- like an idiot -RSB- I failed to do any extensive testing , and I needed to put it away , essentially into safe storage most of this time . I just got it back out tonight , set it up with a new machine , and with some of my books it is not doing what it is supposed to be doing . It 's not doing what I bought it for , and what it is advertised to do . This weird , serious problem was not mentioned , when I payed out the cash -LSB- a rather substantial amount , for a scanner -RSB- , and I feel cheated . I was going to start scanning my library of books , and was kind of excited to get started . This is a letdown.It looks like I got suckered into buying an over priced scanner , under the pretext that it would fulfill a unique need -LSB- which my other three scanners cant do -RSB- .
 I purchased a Opticbook 3600 plus . Works `` ok '' with XP , but the drivers will not initialize on my Vista laptop . I even took the scanner and laptop into a computer shop and they tried to get it to run on a newly installed Vista system with ZERO success . Calls to the service center go unreturned , and email is not answered . I find it hard to believe Plustek can not get their scanner to work on Vista , or find a service center in the US that knows the meaning of SERVICE !!
 Radius Technology DVDs ID as `` OPTODISC '' brand media . -LRB- That is , OPTODISC makes the discs for Radius -RRB- . OPTODISC media are generally found to be lousy
 Burned 3 - All 3 had problems like freezes and skips . Total waste of money . As somebody else has said , get Ritek instead .
 I wasted money on four packs , every burn has failed . I used about ten before my burner went dead and stoped reading dvds all together , so I had to buy a new burner and they still do n't work . You get what you pay for .
 Drive installation is pretty straight forward , but a bit clunky because of the way the steel brackets clamp together . The company did not think through how the duplicator controller should be placed , and the connecting cables get wired . The case weighs a ton when it should n't have - e.g. the company could have used aluminum instead of steel , which would 've made it lighter and better for heat dissipation.The product was also shipped to me straight in its original box - no packaging to ensure things did n't break or chip , as they most certainly did . The rivets that the screws were going into had bent , making the case I received very unstable . I had to disassemble and re-assemble it with some patchwork fixes to make it stand straight . The case was bought a year ago and I did not have time to follow up on requesting a refund .
 This one kind of ... . It has these rubberized protectors molded over the end clip levers that are very difficult to release when the cable is installed . I finally removed it and bought one at Staples which works great .
 Bought the 25 ft which worked fine , however the 14 foot cut in and out with signal and only after I replaced it was everything working as expected . Unfortunately , probably more trouble to actually return it .
 This drive turns out to be very difficult to install in a Windows 2000 system ... possibly due to a driver issue . My technician finally solved it , but he told me never to buy anything from a 2nd-rate manufaturer -LRB- read , stick with HP , Sony or Toshiba -RRB- . The drive has a lot of trouble reading even CD-ROMs . I 'm not sure whether it 's a problem with the internal mechanism , or something with the software . I often get the `` no disc found '' error , even though the same disc will work in other PCs . My advice is save yourself trouble and money and do not buy this drive .
 This product simply ceased to work after about a month . The manufacturer 's solution was to have me ship it back , and they would rework the drive , or replace it with a refurbished drive . I can see where this is headed , and I do n't have time for the round-a-round . First dissapointment with this site .
 The cartridges are not recognized by the printer as being full of ink so the annoying `` low ink '' indicator comes up everytime you print . I would n't say that it outweighs the savings , however it is annoying . As advanced as technology is these days there should be someone who can `` reset '' the cartridge and fool the printer into thinking the product is OEM and brand new .
 Not a good product . My printer keeps saying low ink , even with the new ink catridge .
 The seller was wonderful and fast . But the cartridge is a brick . My Dell all-in-one will not recognize it . And even if I override the cartridge is empty nag screen , the ink still will not flow . Nothing . I tried cleaning the nozzles and the printer will not even do that because it refuses to recognize it . Wasted money indeed .
 I was so excited when the ink came in but once I installed it -- it did n't read . My printer kept asking me for a cartridge ...

 Really cheap !! Burnt 3 disks using Lite-On SOHW-832S . All 3 burnt OK , but later the same DVD drive had hard time reading back ALL 3 disks . Major Freezing problem on Philips DVP 642 . Not worth the money !! As somebody else said , get Ritek instead ! Or even Velocity !!
 This media says that it is 4X rated . I burned several coasters before I bumped the speed down to 2X . They burn fine at 2x but when I set them to burn at 4X my progress bar in my software never makes it past one percent before it errors out . They are not hub printable -- the print surface does not go all the way to the center hole . I would not buy this again regardless of the price ...
 I returned this product , as it did not look anything like the picture . It has a lot of white highlights in the picture , but I found the product itself , to be basically gray with no real white highlights , but just lighter shades of gray . I did receive a full refund , although it cost me over $ 20.00 to return it .
 The promo for the Again & Again cordless phone batteries sounds good , but they do n't work at all . I bought three of them to replace the batteries in all my Panasonic cordless phones . None of the batteries would hold a charge overnight , even if they were n't being used . If they were being used , they would n't last more than a few minutes .
 i bought this to replace the failing original battery in my handset . it did n't last even 25 % as long as the original battery did . this time i am going to replace it with an original panasonic battery . what a waste of money this was
 I have this book and Wagner 's book . Many of the designs are unusable for a wide variety of reasons . Plus you can get more info in an old issue of Speaker Builder magazine - check ebay or Audio Amateur Publications . More up-to-date and practical information can be found in audio forums . I have built ESLs and they are not that difficult or costly to build . Do a little research and add a good measure of common sense !
 I bought the product but I did n't receive the product . The vendor service was bad .
 Bought unit for my 32 '' Samsung hdtv . This wall mount did not fit my tv . I tried doing research to see if it would fit prior , even wen to their website , did n't see a list of compatible tvs . Seems like a decent wall mount but is probably better for smaller televisions .
 Ok this was my first buy on amazon . . I bought 2 of the Tripp Lite TMC-6 TouchMaster Compact Surge Suppressor . . My nabor came to me and Gave me the box that was shipped . She found it at her front door , 2 houses up the street ! -LRB- UPS ca n't read an address -RRB- When I took out the 2 switch boxes , 1 did n't have any screws in it -LRB- a friday special ? -RRB- I needed them bad so I put my own screws in it . . so far they are working fine . . Not very pleased with my first buy from here . . Oh and a week Later there 20 bucks now insted of 30 .
 Even tho the seller shipped me a used one instead of new - it still does the job just fine . Not too keen on the buttons -LRB- prefer toggle style switches -RRB- . No problems so far.Update - the product completely died 7 months later .
 Product appears to have been an open box , inner box was crushed outer box was not . Product was DOA and lacked normal packaging such as a poly bag etc. . What gives Amazon are you taking customer returns and then reshipping them as new , this is not OK , in fact it is illegal , it is listed as new it should show up as new . How did factory box arrived crushed yet the shipping box was not ? Very strange Amazon .
 The item I was sent arrived in an open box and appears to have been used previously . There are scratches along the sides , especially near the outlets .
 I was pleased to get the protector as I wanted a surge protector in my system . It was very easy to install . However when I turned it on I noticed that the monitoring lights for the individual switches did not work . In the booklet it suggested that you call Tripp Lite to get support . I called and told them of my problem and I was told that I would get a replacement unit within five days . After waiting a week , I called back Tripp Lite and asked what happened to my replacement unit . I was told that the unit was not shipped until a day or two before . They did not know why this happened . I got the impression that they really did n't care why . Because of this , I would not recommend Tripp Lite to anyone . I guess as an after thought , I should have called Amazon and they would have taken care of this in a timely fashion .
 this thing was an absolute cheap piece of junk . Not a single outlet worked . The lights on the front intermittently lit up , so at least that did show that the unit was getting power from my outlet . The re-set button on the back did n't work . It was cheap , thin plastic that would n't hold up even if it did work at all when I received it . I just threw it away . Was n't worth the effort to repack and send back and wait for a refund , which is probably what they are counting on . Tripp makes a product that costs about .25 cents , sells it for $ 30 and if only half the people bother to return it -LRB- which would be a high number since most do n't -RRB- they still make a ton .
 Convenient , small and easy to use . Fine if you do n't use too much power or have a LCD monitor.Too bad Tripp-Lite is too cheap to make them out of metal . The amount of power that my laser printer uses causes my top of the line Sony monitor and my cheap Dell rebrand to shimmer . The flow of electricity causes a magnetic field to interfere with the electron gun . If they still made these things out of metal it would reduce or stop the interference . I am now trying to get my old APC metal one repaired .
 My computer is too big to safely sit on top of this unit . Seems a throw back to the old PC days .
 Received the surge protector promptly and well packaged with detailed instructions . I was surprised to find that an outlet switch labelled `` monitor '' does not work . For the price , I 'm keeping it but am disappointed with the quality control testing on this item . I hope that this is the only defect.All of the other features work as advertised and I really like the design .
 The first thing that i wont to say is took way to long for the order to be processed . Next is the shipping took what seamed like i was living in the 1970 . Received the package and it was packed well . Moving on , made out of cheep plastic , but looks good . Also remember you do get what you pay for .
 Purchased the unit to turn off my computer system . Which consists of a computer , monitor , printer , camera , & audio sound amplifier.Unit worked as planned for a short time then the main shutoff push on-off master switch stopped working . Previously I had a surge protector for 25 years with no problems then I purchased this one as an replacement . This one fits nicely under my viewing monitor but the master push button does not shut down my system as it was designed to do . I bought two units one still works and one does n't .
 I do n't know how good the protection is but on the first one , the master switch got stuck in `` on '' position after 3 weeks . I exchanged for another one , and the same problem happened after 1 month . Amazon refunded my money .
 I purchased the Crosley LP-to-CD from Brookstone and after I got it home I was astonished to discover how cheap a product costing several hundred dollars could be . The turntable is awful . If you bought a turntable for $ 25 you would expect it to be better than this . The tone arm is not properly balanced and worst of all the speed is not consistent and is not adjustbale . This product is virtually worthless for converting LP 's to CD 's if you have any senstivity to sound quality . Stay away from this !
 I just received this item yesterday , and already found it does not work . The sound is poor , and when I tried to record a cd from a vinyl album , I found it did not work AT ALL ! It records the first few seconds of the song , then skips all over the place . Very expensive piece of junk which will cost you an arm and a leg to return to whomever you buy it from !!!!!!!! -LRB- If they even take it back -RRB- I bought it because I have a lot of vinyl that I want to put onto cd and into iTunes , but it 's worthless for that . A BIG WASTE OF MONEY !!!!!!!!!! Does not even deserve one star .
 It played okay . Definitely not going to stand up to the new stereo systems . The recording part of it did n't work at all . We are sending it back . A big disappointment
 We bought the Crosley Songwriter in October of last year at Linens 'n Things.The remote did n't work , but Customer Service at Crosley sent a new one , which worked fine.As a fourth-grade teacher , I have many cassettes that I want to record onto CDs -LRB- stories from the reading series , old books-on-tape -RRB- , so I used it to copy these over . All seven of the CDs I made worked wonderfully . Transferring albums was equally easy , although I only did one . In both cases , the most difficult part was being present to press the button that manually splits tracks.After a month of use , however , the CD player would only play part of a CD -- three songs -- and then it would quit , locking up the unit . Powering off and back on freed up the unit , but did n't solve the problem . We have since returned the Songwriter to Linens 'n Things for a full refund . This is a great idea in an attractive package that just does n't work .
 Sounds great when you listen to the radio , cassette , or CD player , but sounds AWFUL when you play a vinyl record . For a product that is marketed as a great way to transfer all of your old LP 's to CD , we were very disappointed in the inferior quality of the turntable . Recording was easy , perfect for someone not computer-savvy like my husband . Turned out to be a BIG disappointment on Christmas morning . Especially for $ 400 ! A kid 's toy sounds better . We had to send it back .
 It worked great at first , then the turntable started playing slow . Same thing for the cassette player . It worked great the first time . Now it is all muffled , if it plays at all . Sometimes when you try to record the machine shuts off . I whole heartedly do NOT recommend this item .
 The first item I received was defective and I was unable to use it . I returned it to the manufacturer at my expense plus a $ 19.95 return charge and they sent me a new one . I tried to record from 33-1/3 rd records to a CD . The sound quality semed distorted as if the music was being playedslightly slower than it should be . I contacted the mfg. again and they paid the freight to return the second item to their factory . I asked to receive a credit for the purchase amount -- they refused because they want to send me another unit I do n't want . I have contacted Montana Consumer Affairs in the meantime . Also , Focus Camera , that shipped the original item refused to credit me as well .
 A great idea , but do n't buy it . Listening to good quality stereo LP 's is a dreadful experience . The speakers are so poor , and worse yet , that quality carries through to the CD burner . The CD 's I produced are so bad I ca n't listen to them . When using the cassette player to make CD 's , the sound is muffled , and you can hear the hiss and the turning of the tape reproduced on the CD ! I am boxing it up , and returning it .
 I just received by Crosley songwritter and after opening it I feel it is not worth the price they ask . The tape button are hard to work , the function buttons are very hard to read and it sounds like a thrashing machine when it is in pause mode to space between songs while recording to CD.Very dispointed in this product .
 The first machine that arrived was visibly used and I purchased a new one . The main reason I purchased the machine was to record to CD from my collection of vinyl records . The first attempt to record - it failed ! I tried again and the same thing . I called the company and they told me to try again and if it failed to contact where I purchased it and return it . In the whole process , at least six cd were ruined and I ended up returning it . The replacement I got has not malfunctioned as of yet , but needless to say , I do n't know how long it will continue to work .
 The songwriter arrived inoperable . Crosley tech support told me to return to seller . The seller did not have another in stock , so I ordered from a different seller . This one also arrived inoperable . The 3rd one arrived with only a missing stylus ; Crosley tech support is sending me a new stylus , and I believe this will solve the problem ... but as of this date the product still does not work.Either I am jinxed , or quality control at Crosley stinks.The seller was excellent . the machine arrived very quickly ; and they processed the return and credit promptly and without hassle . I will definitely buy from them in the future . The seller gets 5 stars ... the product 1 star .
 Equipment is complex ; instructions uncertain ; reliability nil ... which may explain the limited 30 day guarantee ... a mistake I will not repeat with Amazon or any other internet vendor . R. S.
 Well , I got this from my husband for Christmas ... after requesting it for several years . I was so excited I actually got all teary eyed . The reason I wanted this was to record some old cassettes that were from my father , who passed away several years ago . He used to play guitar , banjo , sing , etc and I have several cassettes with no way to listen to them in my car , or at home ... So thought this would be great to create some CDs for my listening enjoyment.Well , I just turned the machine on today ... and it wo n't work . Lights come on ... but `` nobodies home '' so to speak . I ca n't get the function button to work at all ... so ca n't do anything . My husband has thrown the box away since he assumed that anything Crowsley AND new would at least work . Now after reading reviews I fear we may be in for a long road ahead , trying to get a new working unit or a refund . I also fear that even if I get a new working unit it could `` eat '' my valuable cassettes . So I am really disappointed with Crowsley on this . Hope the refund/return process goes better than most of you have stated . Too bad I or my husband did n't look at these reviews first !
 I looked forward to getting this so that I might transfer all my LPS to CDs . I did , fairly easily , but the quality of the finished product was horrible . I could listen to my LPS fairly painlessly , kept meaning to hook up another speaker , but I have now discovered that the CD drawer no longer opens , nor does the turntable turn . So , I guess I 'll throw it out . This was way too expensive to end up like this .
 I was actually able to convert some vinyl to digital , but not to the quality that I expected from this Crosley 248 . After a few weeks the CD changer refused to open . I can assure you that if you can not open the CD changer , the machine is worthless . Do n't waste your money ! I would have given this ZERO stars , but had to settle for one star instead !
 I was very enthusiastic to receive this recorder for Christmas , but , after spending at least eight hours trying to record one LP record on CD , I have given up and am going to return it for a refund .
 I was very excited about this product but after I received it I noticed it was used when I sent it back for a new one I ended up with the same product . Crosley is not customer friendly . I thought crosley was a reputable company . If I wanted a used product I would have tried eBay .
 I was very disappointed with my purchase.the record player doesnt play very clear . and the tapes were clear , then the tape player wasnt eatting them . I would not recommend spending all that $ $ for something i think is not that good .
 I have a large selection of old LPs that I wanted to be able to play and have n't been able to because my old record player from the 60 's is n't hooked up to speakers . I thought the Crosley would be perfect to play -LRB- and record to CDs -RRB- the old favorites on . This Crosley is a piece of junk not worthy of even going to the dump . Nothing on it works well . The records sound warped , the tapes sound warped , and the sound quality could be what you might have expected back in the 20 's . The tape deck does n't open or close well and sometimes has to be pried open . What a piece of junk ! It was such a great idea - too bad the quality does n't match the appearance . Guess I 'll hook up my old player from the 60 's - it may not look like much but it works a zillion times better than the Crosley piece of junk .
 The Crosley is a piece of junk . Lousy speakers . Hard to read program buttons.Its a shame I ca n't give it a lower score than 1 ...
 In theory , this gizmo sounds pretty awesome and great , right ? Wrong ! Granted , it does what it says it does , and is pretty user-friendly , but that 's where the bargain ends . The sound is very tinny and ` Mickey-Mouse ' and , on the one we ordered , one of the CD channels did n't play at all . When we tried to patch this thing into our higher quality stereo system , we still got an awful sound quality because it records based on the sound quality the component itself produces . I guess there are no quick fixes where this is concerned ; if you want to make quality CD 's from your old tapes and albums , go to an electronics store and get the components the store recommends . It may be considerably more complicated , but the quality will be well worth it . The Crosley CD Songwriter is nothing more than an expensive piece of garbage in an attractive cabinet .
 This turntable and most if not all the Crosley 's turntables are overpriced for what it gives you . First off , the sound quality is not very good and the tone arm does not have a weight control to prevent the stylus from severely damaging your ablums if accidently kicked or knocked . Also without weight control on the tone arm , more pressure is applied on the sound groves and your albums wo n't last very long . You can definitely get a better deal for a turntable equipted with tone arm weight control so the stylus will ease up your fine albums and still give you excellent sound quality .
 This is a great idea for all of us with vinyl and tape to convert to CD . It worked great for about 6 cds then became very inconsistant . Only half of the display was visible . Shortly it stopped playing any cd . Ca n't recommend it .
 I bought this item because I have serious amounts of vinyl and old cassettes I wanted to digitize.Sad to say , I started with the cassettes . For that purpose , this device excels . I digitized about 100 old -LRB- mostly spoken-word -RRB- cassettes.By that time , I was no longer able to return it ; and when the first LPs came out sounding tinny and slightly fast , I found myself seriously wishing I could do so.I must say , this device was a snap to use . The reviews that refer to the controls as confusing may reflect a lack of willingness to RTFM -LRB- which I 'll admit could be a bit better-written -RRB- . It 's well-constructed and sounds at least average.If you have * lots * of tape -LRB- comedy , books-on-tape , radio programs -RRB- , and you 're not particularly tech-prone -LRB- read
 This is n't worth even one star . I 've never purchased anything as worthless as this . Fortunately , I bought it at Target , because of the ease of returning purchases there -- I pretty much knew I 'd be returning it since I 'd already read these negative reviews -LRB- could it be the positive ones were written by Crosley employees ? -RRB- . I 'd also had a lot of trouble with TEAC 's version of the same thing -- though that 's an infinitely superior component to this.Ease of operation , yes . Does it work , NO !!! Each time I put a blank CDR in the tray -LRB- whether SONY , MAXELL or TDK -RRB- it did the same thing
 I purchased one of these from One-Way Furniture . It seemed like the perfect way to preserve some of my near-50 year old reel to reel tapes and LPs . I was very wrong . All the problems you read here in other reviews were the ones I had also . And do n't let the needle in the tone arm on this thing come in contact with an LP you want to keep . The downward pressure is so great that it will actually deepen the groove in the vinyl ... then try playing it on your high dollar Technics turntable . I sent it back but they kept $ 77.58 of my money as a restocking fee ... Nice people , huh?This is being added almost one year later -LRB- 10-30-2007 -RRB- . This morning I went to Bed Bath & Beyond to buy a small crockpot . Just inside the door there was a large display with this same CD recorder . Only it was not the same . This one was a solid wood cabinet and all else looked like the Crosley except the buttons/control configuration . The price was -LRB- sit down all you folks that paid close to $ 399.00 for theirs -RRB- , $ 199.99 . I looked it over really good and it appeared to be very close to the Crosley unit . Since I sent that unit back almost a year ago , I was fasinated with this one ... the price floored me . I bought it ... and get this ... I had a 20 % off coupon and the unit cost me $ 159.99 plus tax . I have been `` playing '' with it all afternoon and believe me , it is far superior to the Crosley Songwriter . It performs flawlessly . It 's has the name of Innovative Technology ... buy it ... you 'll like it ...
 I was very disappointed with the whole experience . Firstly , the machine never worked and also the accompanying directions and brochure was most inadequate and very poorly written.Furthermore , it took great effort and persistence to finally return the songwriter for another machine.I hope my next experience is not as trying !
 While the cabinet is beautiful , the `` brass finish '' on the face plate looks to be made of cheap pot-metal . The dials and buttons feel cheap and tacky.But that was n't the real problem . Once I got it set up , I was amazed at how out-of-balance the turntable was . The whole turntable assembly is cheaply made from plastic that I was afraid to put an album on -LRB- no pad - just bare-naked-cheap-plastic -RRB- . While the tone arm queuing lever was a nice feature , it felt like it would break off in my fingers at any moment . I can not understand how these guys get away with charging so much for something made so poorly . It reminded me of those old portable turntables made for children -LRB- except , not as durable -RRB- . Upon checking out the radio receiver I found that it gave acceptable reception and sensitivity , but the speakers are obviously rejects from AM Transistor radios of decades gone by . The tinny sound almost hurt my ears , and my hearing is n't all that great to begin with!I decided to give the CD Recording function a try . -- As long as you are willing to record a complete side of an album to a CD and do n't really care about sound quality , you 'll be fine . The record function was very easy to master . Unfortunately , what you end up with is a disk with two audio files on it -LRB- one for each side -RRB- which can not be edited , cleaned up , or broken into single tracks in the native format . I had to rip the two files to MP3 files to my computer to accomplish those tasks . Since software is not included with the Crosley , I downloaded Audacity , a free -LRB- open source -RRB- sound editing package that I found fairly easy to use without documentation . Once the two files are converted to MP3 , you can do any editing that you have the time to accomplish.Back to the wobbly turntable for a moment though ... Besides looking silly , it was bad enough that it induced Wow on the CD . -LRB- This produces a sound of `` speed-up/slow-down '' for each revolution of the cheaply made plastic platter . -RRB- This is , as far as I know , impossible to correct outside a professional sound studio . It was n't noticeable at first , but once you notice it , you 'll not be able to ignore it.I had this item in my house for eight days before I returned it to Target where it was purchased . I assume that , considering the expense of this item , you must be paying a lot of money for the `` hand-made , solid wood '' cabinet because the electronics could n't be worth more than twenty bucks . I liked that the box had speaker outputs and auxiliary inputs , but I did n't keep the item long enough to try these out.If you want a pretty , antique looking box to display , this is the one for you . If you want to use it for it 's advertised capabilities , you will be sorely disappointed .
 The Cr248Songwriter CD Recorder is without a doubt the biggest lemon of it 's time overpriced . Inferior Radio speakers weak and cheap . Top everything off with no customer service from manufacturer . Made my Christmas very unhappy . Cd door will not open ; . Recorded 8 cassettes to Cd then it quit working . For a company that has been around as long as Crosley they ought to be ashamed of there craftmanship .
 This player was a Christmas gift that was opened Christmas morning . The player had a bunch of screws or something rolling around inside the sealed player when we took it out of the box . There was a larger component rolling around inside the player also . Must have been where the screws came from . We still tried out the player hoping that we would not have an electrical blow-out when we plugged it in because of the components rolling around inside the player . It seemed to work ok . We returned it for a full refund.This item was very cheaply made and for the money they are asking for it it is not worth it . Do not go by the pictures because the one I received did not look like the same wood color . And thats because it is not real wood.I am not sure where this was made but it is typical of the junk that is being made in China these days . When I was a kid this kind of junk was being made in Japan.My advice ... stay away .
 Disappointing piece for frustration.Bought one of these last July , 2009 from Target online . First of all , if you 're dubbing an LP or Cassette to CD , once you start the dub you can no longer adjust or change the volume till the dub is complete . If you 're dubbing a cassette to CD , the dubbing will not stop when the cassette has completed so you get a 15 minutes or so of white noise until the CD is full . Any other dubbing device I 've ever seen will automatically stop recording / dubbing when the source device stops . Why this one does n't is a mystery to anyone who 's used another dubbing device . Also , the `` track splitting '' device which you 're supposed to use to separate tracks when dubbing from an LP or Cassette to CD is joke ! It stops the recording for too long and chops off the begining of the next track whenever you use it ! Finally , I used it for a week last Aug and have n't touched it again till today - Oct 24 and now the Cassette deck does not work ! It will not fast-forward or rewind a cassette and eats them when you play them ! This after maybe 10 hours of use and 2 and half months of sitting idle . A couple of months later , the turntable started to speed up and slow down when playing / dubbing records - junk ! As another review pointed out , you and also hear rushing noises in the background on dubbed CDs . Often times , it will just stop in the middle of a dub too and leave you with a half a track . I think the people that gave this one a positive review have not owned it very long and have not really played back what they 've dubbed . Never again !
 this crosley songwriter looked very nice but did n't perform well at all.i had to keep pushing the buttons to get it to run and when I tried to record an album onto a cd at first it did n't want to start it kept telling me there was no cd then when it did say it was recording it only recorded 2 songs from the album i returned it and will be looking for another recorder other then crosley
 For a product costing as much as it does , it is a really bad investment . I could n't get anything out of the radio , the phonograph does n't work at all and the cd drawer jammed so I had to pry it open with a nail file ! I also have to use a flashlight to see the markings on the faceplate to select the proper button to push . And the instructions for the turntable are so sketchy I ca n't figure out how to start it . If I can find my purchase record , I will return it for my money back . From what I have read in these reviews , the quality is all over the lot , which seems to be the case with many items made in China . It 's a shame because the promise of having a unit that can do so many procedures seemed wonderful !
 I bought this piece of junk a year ago . I ended up giving it to a friend , who ended up throwing it in the garbage .1 . The cassette player always played the tape faster than what it should have . Always sounded like I was like I was listening to the chipmunks .2 . The cd recorder always left off the first few seconds of the song if I pushed split track .3 . It did n't matter what remote I was using . It would end up turning on . If I had a cd left in the tray it would start playing . The volume starts out at 15 every time you turn on the unit . I was startled a few times .4 . When I would try to put the arm of the turntable on a record . The whole turntable would move around like it was n't being held in place.I have another Crosley that I paid $ 99.00 for and does n't have anything fancy on it . But it is way better than this junk .
 I bought the Crosley recorder last year at Christmas and used it -LRB- 3 -RRB- times and the cassette player quit working ... sent it back for a new one and then the power button would not work ... just got a new one again for the third time and now this power button does n't work you have to use the remote control only to use it ... junk , junk , junk !!!!!!!! Never again will I purchase one of these and they should pull them all off the market since they are getting such bad reviews and everyone has problems with them ...
 I ordered this for my Dad for Fathers Day and it was delivered fast ! He has one of the other Crosley players but it does not record to CD which he really wanted . Recently the cd player door will not stay closed on his original Crosley -LRB- he has only had it a couple years and it was not cheap either ! -RRB- ... anyway so I figured I would order him this one to replace it with . It was delivered 2 days before Fathers Day and I was real happy about that . He was very excited and tried to set it up and the display does not work . He tried for a couple of hours working with it and the screen would come on but would not show any of the functions . Well he is very disappointed and so am I. I have scheduled a UPS pick up and decided on a refund instead of an exchange because I want to make sure my refund goes through ok first before I reorder . I have never returned anything to Amazon before so I hope it will be a smooth process . After reading some of these reviews I am really nervous about reordering ... . but I know he really wants one , so I guess I will .
 Caveat Emptor - Buyer Beware ! That 's my warning to anyone considering buying the Crosley `` Songwriter ' . Be sure you know why you are buying this and what it can do or you are likely to be very disappointed.When I saw the title `` Songwriter '' I thought it would meet my desire for a product which would turn my pop music cassettes and Vinyl into CDs with separate tracks for each song . My car cassette player can `` fast forward '' to the next track and I assumed the `` Songwriter '' used that same technology to know when to split tracks . The `` Split Track Button '' does not work that way.The directions say , `` While Recording your record or cassette , listen for the end of each song . There will usually be a brief silence between songs . Once you are at the end of the song , press the Split Track button . The recording will then go to the next track number by increments of one . Once the recording is finished , you can ... go to the beginning of each song . `` Literally , in order to `` write songs '' to a CD you have to sit by the box the entire time it is recording , hitting the new track button at the right time and only the right time . It is much easier to buy replacement CDs for your albums.My advice to Crosley is to eith
 I bought this because I wanted something with which to listen to my vinyl and which could be put in a home office . And while I was at it , record that vinyl to CD . However , it has all the fidelity of a AM transistor radio from the 70 's , and while the resulting CDs sound good on a different system than when the vinyl is played , the CD recording process requires you to sit by the machine in order to manually enter the track breaks and to stop the recording process manually . So I find myself recording sides of an LP or cassette onto a CD/RW disc , ripping those onto my PC and using some MP3/WMA editing software that allows me to split the tracks manually and drop the silent space at the end where the record ended , but I was in the bathroom . So now I 'm scratching my head thinking I should just put all the money this costs into a USB turntable and some software that automatically does track splits and noise removal . I definitely do not recommend .
 The Crosley Radio CR248 Songwriter CD recorder is great when it works . However , after 2 weeks , I had to return it for repairs . The tape cassette did not work and I could n't record anything onto the CD . It is now at the shop . I had to call twice to get them to give me a return authorization and there was no indication in the packaging telling me to contact Best in Home , the place that shipped it to me . Best in Home contacted me and told me they would have replaced the whole unit free of charge , but that was after I had already sent it to Crosley .
 THIS MACHINE SEEMS TO WORK O.K. , BUT THE SUPPORT FROM THE MFG . STINKS . THEY CHARGE 9.95 FOR 12 PLASTIC 45 INSERTS THAT YOU CAN PURCHASE 60 FOR $ 7.00 ON E-BAY . THEY OFFER A BRUSH AND REPLACEMENT NEEDLES FOR OTHER MACHINES , BUT NOT FOR THIS MODEL . THE SUPPORT IS VERY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU ARE PAYING SUCH A PRICE . SOMEONE NEEDS TO NOTIFY THEM OF THIS FACT.LEN SCHIFF
 Received as a Christmas gift . It came from JC Penny so I had no problem returning it . The albums worked okay but the 45rpm records did not . I never tried the cassette . The turntable seemed to be warpped which was very noticable on the 45rpm records . Also on most of the 45 's the stylus would come up before the record ended and return to its rest position , resulting in not getting the complete song . I called Crosley on Dec. 31 , 2008 . I was told someone would call me back in 48-72 business hours . -LRB- No holidays or weekends . -RRB- It is now January 24 , 2009 and I never did hear from them . Luckily the item has been returned and I have my money back . I would not recommend this product to anyone .
 i 'm not for many words so i 'll be brief , i record cds from albums using a 2nd generation pioneer . i bought this thinking i would n't have to break down and reassmble my stereo everytime i wanted to record from album -LRB- long story , moving on -RRB- this item is fine for the novice recorder -LRB- but not for the price -RRB- . it makes an `` o.k. '' recording -LRB- but not for the price -RRB- . for the money you can get a better turntable and outboard recorder and do a better job . i mean get real , the track inscriber actually stops the recording and restarts !?! in which w/o care , you end up cutting off one song at the end and one at the begining ! i do n't think the 1st generation recorders were THAT archeic ! you ca n't adjust tone arm pressure ! you ca n't use better stylus -LRB- only their replacement which is mediochore at best -RRB- and here 's the real kicker ... $ 30 for s & h !!! if it was n't so much to , i 'd send it back , but i 'll cut my loses , use it till the needle wears -LRB- oh i ca n't wait for that -RRB- and then give it to the resale rack cause i could n't bring myself to actually try to sell this ! buyer beware .
 I heard about this product on a local radio show , and purchased for my husband for Christmas . When we set it up , the radio worked , but when he attempted to record a cassette to a CD , nothing happened , and even the radio failed to work after that . Do n't know if the turntable worked , as we returned it . A great idea , but in our case , not a good product .
 I do n't recommend this product to anyone . It is easy to use , however , the sound is horrible . It is noisy and has a loud humming sound to the finished CD . Also , the background is horrible . The first one I bought I returned because I could n't even hear the songs on the CD . the second one is a tiny bit better , but it still very disappointing . I am not planning on using it much . I have n't even tried the cassette player yet . It has one thing for it . The cabinet is pretty ! DON `` T BUY IT !!!
 I DO N'T LIKE THE CONTROLS . THEY SHOULD BE LIT UP . I HAD TO USE A FLASH LIGHT TO SEE THE DIFFERENT CONTROL BUTTON . I STARTED TO MAKE CD 'S FROM CASETTES . AFTER AN HOUR THE MACHINE STOPPED RECORDING . I AM IN THE PROCESS OF RETURNING THIS UNIT . I WISH IT LASTED LONGER . RUSS
 this camera has every feature i could ever want . the battery is charged in the camera which is how they all should be . everything needed comes with it . the macro mode is a joke , closeup would be more accurate . even with a 13x add on lense it was not good enough for even flowers and was a pain to keep changing . the m65 is much better for photo quality and has a great macro . the pictures bothered me though with the 70 , most were just a little out of focus in auto , fuzzy , or they had a haze , washed out look . the color was not good . the shutter delay way too long with the slow focusing . i sent it back to toshiba and bought my nikon .
 After 100 attempts I made excellent photos of some old snapshots of my girlfriend that seemed to show greater detail than the originals . This highlights the PDR-M70 's abilities and shortcomings . It makes great photos , but it 's extreemly complicated to use . My 20 year old film camera takes excellent shots on full automatic so I 've never learned anything beyond `` point and shoot . '' The PDR-M70 has an automatic setting , but it works poorly and even on automatic you should choose the proper mode for conditions . As you experiment with this camera you get so deeply involved in the settings it 's like learning a new programming language . But you have to do it to get good photos , expecially with anything involving the flash . And even worse , when the camera goes off after three minutes of inactivity -LRB- I think you can change the setting so it stays on longer -RRB- it wipes out some of the settings , but not others . Grab it up and shoot a quick picture ? Only if conditions are perfect for the settings in the camera at the time . Worse yet , the PDR-M70 wo n't re-charge from a universal adapter . I arrived in Russia with only my camera and the Radio Shack adapter that runs my computer , and had to have a Toshiba part shipped from the states so I could re-charge the camera . If I had been stopping in England or elsewhere I would have needed a special adapter for each region . I heeded another customer 's review and ordered a high-capacity SmartMedia card and a Viking Flash Memory reader , so now I have a huge tangle of cords ... but when I arrived back in the states the camera refused to re-charge using the original cord . I 'm not sure what happened ... perhaps I need to study the manual some more and perhaps adjust the settings ...
 Nice camera at first . If you take 3 pictures of same object 1 picture will be extremely sharp and the other 2 will be noticably fuzzy when you zoom in . I do n't know if this is an autofocus problem or hand jitter problem . Taking videos with this camera is fun and more convienent then carrying around a second video camera . The video quality is poor , but it beats having nothing . Everything else worked well with the camera . I did n't have a problem with the battery . I was able to take 100 + pictures with my battery . After about 6 months with the camera we were on vacation in California . The battery went out and the lens would n't retract . After charging at home the zoom lens would n't move . No doubt it broke in the handling .
 Where to start?I guess the best way to put it is , neither of the two products included in this package will work to their full potential when used together . Yeah , you wo n't find that in the product description will you?If you plug the wireless keyboard / mouse into the KVM emulator -LRB- i.e. the keyboard / mouse ports -RRB- , you will not be able to use the keyboard hot keys . By hot keys , I mean the keys on top of the keyboard for multimedia support , browser control , etc. . You will however be able to use the KVM switch hot keys to move between computers . So I contacted tech support and they told me that I would have to plug the wireless keyboard / mouse into one of the USB ports on the back of the KVM switch to utilize these hot keys.Yeah , this works!But wait , now I ca n't switch between computers using the KVM hot keys on the keyboard . Now I have to physically hold down the button on the KVM switch corresponding to the computer I want to switch to -LRB- and hold it down for ~ 6 seconds -RRB- . So , basically you have to choose your poison for what functionality you are willing to lose when using this combo . I just ca n't believe the company actually sells this product as a package knowing that these issues exist.And to top it off , now the audio portion of the KVM is no longer working -LRB- after ~ 3 months -RRB- . By this , I mean the ability to share one set of speakers via the KVM . In all honesty , I have not researched this issue yet , but know it was originally working and now it is not.Hope this helps !
 Beware ! This item is NOT the GCS1742 ! Read down into the specs ; it is actually the GCS1734 , which is also available from Amazon . -LRB- The 1742 enables switching of two computers each using keyboard , mouse , and TWO monitors simultaneously ; hence the name `` Dual View . '' If that is what you want , do n't buy this one !
 T-Handle used to regulate pressure was missing . This was the second regulator I received in this condition . External packaging was good but bubble pack regulator came in was open . There is a bubble in the packaging for the T-Handle but none was in the box . Returned for a replacement .
 I was impressed with the online reviews and the specifications of this handy external drive . However , it failed -LRB- as in very dead -RRB- during my first use , backing up my MacBook . Two different customer service reps were very rude as we were trying to diagnose the fault . And it was a toll call . Smartdisk does not provide toll-free customer support . Eventually they gave me an RMA -LRB- return merchandise authorization -RRB- . It took them about 2 weeks to send me a replacement - a refurbished unit ; one that had definitely been used a lot -LRB- I asked for a new one since my original one died after about 20 minutes of use ; but they refused -RRB- . I know I wo n't be buying from SmartDisk again .
 I purchased one of these hard-drives to back-up my PC data , but it soon failed to be recognized in either of my PC -LRB- or Mac -RRB- . I sent it back twice , and both replacements failed -LRB- I think they sent me back the same faulty drive twice -RRB- . I ended up paying twice the purchase price just to recover the lost data , from a data recovery service -LRB- SmartDisk would n't pay for this -RRB- . An external hard drive ought to be reliable , mine was n't .
 This thing broke down on me , believe it or not , three times and I 'm on my fourth one . I 'm glad they replaced it , but the last time they gave me a USB hardrive instead of a firewire . It never lasted me for over a year . And guess what ? This fourth one just messed up . And they do n't have a toll free number so you have to pay . You also have to pay to ship it out there and they want you to ship it fedex which if I added up all three times I returned this product for another used one , I could have gotten a brand new hardrive.I would not recommend this product for those who have important documents that need to be saved and transported somewhere else and have it fail.Lucky me , I backed up my stuff on a good old reliable CD : -RRB- Oh and by the way , I always disconnect everything by `` safely removing '' it and I have XP in case anyone wanted to know .
 I must say that my initial impression was very favorable for this drive . Small , quite , and easily powered by my laptop using only power from the USB port.My initial satisfaction was quickly erased when I opened Windows Explorer and clicked on the drive . My anti-virus on access software immediately identified a virus on the drive - iexlores.exe also known as W32/Tombai . worm . It also detected W32/Pate . a worm on the drive.I contacted Smartdisk 's technical support line and they confirmed that `` a small number '' of drives shipped with a worm on the drive . I suspect that `` a small number '' is an understatement because as soon as I identified that drive I had , he asked what the lot number was , even before I told him that it had a virus on the drive . The support person immediately confirmed that drives had shipped with a virus without having to research.As best as I could tell , every executable on the drive was infected . I believe that attempting to install the Bounceback software included on the drive will infect your machine.Needless to say , I am returning the drive .
 Bought the FlashTrax Media Player . After a power outage the hard drive was fine , but the main computer would not recognize the drive . We were only three months over the one year warranty , and even though we would pay for the repair they said they would n't touch it after it was out of warranty . POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE . Poor attention was given to detailed emails , had to keep repeating the same thing over and over.Their final response ... `` But it is the way that we have everything set up . We can not change things because you want us to . It would not be fair to every other customer who fellows the rules and saves their paper work . Good luck . '' Hello ? I had the paperwork .
 I got a 25 pack of these and only 3 barely worked , the rest just wo n't read in both my deck and DVD drive and of course ca n't burned the second time . Bad Bad Bad !!!!
 As soon as i got this laser I thoght this was going to be the best laser ever , it worked really good for the first 2 days but after that the laser lost the `` power '' so at the end I got a really bad product , I will recomend you to stay away from this if you want a laser pointer that last more than 48 hours . Really bad quality !!!
 I agree with the others who posted after they encountered a problem with the product . This product is fabulous when it works , but if if goes dead on you , you are own your own . It worked great for a few months before it died . I tried to negotiate customer support with a very poor telephone connection to India , speaking with a person who understood little English . The U.S. tech support office could offer no help when I tried calling them later.Since these routers are all the same , buy from a company with good tech support .
 The title speaks for itself . Watch out for their lifetime limited warranty , it 's good for about a year and a half . I guess that must be the lifetime of some kind of horsefly or something.Avoid SMC at any expense .
 In building out a DC powered rack , we were looking specifically for a 12VDC powered rack-mountable switch . The unit arrived as a 9V , with attached documentation `` included power supply as required '' in the specification . So we threw it out , and have ordered a different unit . For a home user , it would make no difference ... but if a unit is advertised with power supply specs , then I expect to receive same .
 It works well as a standard gigabit ethernet switch , but if you are looking for jumbo frame support you really should look elsewhere . It works well as some other reviewers on other sites have said up to around 6k packets , after which packet loss starts to increase . Additionally you can find analysis of this switch online showing blocking after about 4.5 k packets , with a performance cliff around 7k packets . This is exactly what I saw , and would cause my fairly expensive Intel e1000 NIC to reset its own port back to 100 mbps . According to what I 've found online there are actually two models , so it could be this problem is only with the original model -LRB- which I purchased in 2007 -RRB- . Anyway , I replaced this switch with a managed gigabit dlink switch and now have no problems . Anyway , it works well if all you want is regular gigabit , but stay away if you need reliable jumbo packets .
 I have owned this camera for nearly 3 years . Yet , in that time , the camera has been used for less than 6 hours . And I know that for sure because I bought three 2 hours tapes and have yet to use all three of them.I am happy with the image it can capture . The 1 DVD I made using footage from this camera -LRB- of course imported through firewire at high quality setting of the capture software and burned at max . resolution -RRB- looks pretty good . Battery life is about 1 1/2 hours max.However , this camera just died on me recently . It keeps telling me that the lens cap is on and wo n't record anything or show anything on the screen even though the lens cap is removed . The playback of previous recorded tapes are okay though . Anyway , I thought I got unlucky and started shopping for a new camcorder and I come to find out that JVC issued a recall on a slew of models because they had a bad CCD board . Do n't believe me ? Just google `` JVC lens cap '' or `` JVC CCD '' . They have admitted this problem on over 20 + models . However , the internet is full of owners of JVC models not on this list with the same problem . The GR-D750 is not on the list , so when I called JVC for help , they told me my camera was not part of the recall and it would cost anywhere from $ 100 - $ 200 to fix my camera.Maybe the exact root cause is not the same , but the end result is so I was extremely dissatisfied with their response . So bottom line , I will be shopping for another brand and hope for better luck .
 Product is malfunctioning . Did n't have the battery charger ; which was not disclosed in the device display . During video is played back , the pictures show grid lines that distort quality of the actual images .
 JVC had a class action lawsuit about their camcorders and even though this one is not on the list , it should be . I bought it new and it has had a problem dropping sound and pixilation on the left side of the screen since I opened the box . It has been into JVC repair FOUR , yes FOUR times since I bought it at the beginning of the summer 2007 and every time it had been returned , the problem persists . JVC has yet to acknowledge that it is a LEMON and insists on repairing it . Their repairs do not work ! I dont think they are even doing anything but repacking it and sending it back to me . Its out for repair at JVC as I type this and hopefully they will replace it this time . PLEASE , for your sanity 's sake , buy another camcorder besides JVC .
 Not sure if my camcorder is a lemon , but the audio is distorted . Also the photot feature that somes with this camcorder , which allows you to take photos whenever , it is taking photos randomly both while in pause , not recording mode , as well as durning movie recording mode . I will be returning my camcorder immediately and getting something different .
 I got this for a gift about 1 year ago . Now I wanted to upgrade it with more memory and I find out that the firmware is NOT upgradeable . This means I am stuck buying a whole new MP3 player in order to get more than 6GB of memory . I will not be buying another Sandisk player . I hope that their competitors do a better job of of being able to update the firmware in their devices so you do n't have to buy new players to get new features . I am not happy with this player.Other things I did n't like with this player
 i wish i had never bought an mp3 player/ipod-what they do n't tell you is , that after the battery goes completely dead after approx .2 years , is that you have to send the whole mp3 player back to companny so they can put new battery in it . i went to radio shack to get battery for my sandisk mp3 played , just to find out , you have to send back to company for new battery , IF I HAD KNOW THIS BEFORE I BOUGHT IT , I NEVER WOULD HAVE PURCHASED IT . read reviews before buying anything , jim
 Good looking Camera . Good Pictures . But very low shutter speed . Low Memory . Heavy drain on the batteryI tried to take my 2 year old daughter 's pictures in action . But becuase of the SLOW SHUTTER speed , I did not get the pose I wanted . Many pictures are dark , 2 out of 5 pictures come out completely dark . Very low memory - just 4 MB . Fits just 6 pictures in the defult resolution . Uses up too much battery power - Need to recharge after approx . 10 pictures . Does not come with rechargable battery or recharger .
 I had this camera for about a year when the dial broke . Of course , repairing this is far more costly than a new camera , so here I am . I found the camera did take good quality pictures , but if it is n't going to work after a year , then what 's the point ?
 I 've had it for a year and half ... it has it 's good , and bad sides , but 2 days ago , the dial just fell off ... upon inspection I 've discovered that it was made to brake ... which was supported by numerous reports of the same problem ... do n't buy this camera , or any other from toshiba ...
 I bought this camera in 2001 and it 's dead now . When I just got it , it sarted giving me problems with batteries -LRB- kept showing `` low batteries '' -RRB- , so I bought AC Adapter to avoid this problem -LRB- I used it indoor only -RRB- , and that same problem came back again 2.5 years later , `` low batteries '' with AC Adapter . It made noise , kept blinking until went completely dead . I did take same good photos with this camera , but since it 's dead now , I have AC Adapter that 's perfectly fine and does n't go with any other camera . I payed $ 60 , if anyone wants it , I 'll sell it for $ 25 . Email me
 I purchased my original PDR-M60 in January of 2001 , and before February it was in the mail to be repaired . I ended up receiving a refurbished unit , without the reimbursement of my S&H . So everything was fine until Febraury of 2002 , when my power button popped off . So again of to the mail with my S&H and time as if Toshiba were the only ones that run a business . Out of commission for over a month I recieved another refurbished unit . Now that I am out of my original warranty period of one year they refuse to repair/replace my camera that has another button that has popped off , without an additional $ ... for another refurbished unit . Why ? So the button can pop off again ? I think not . I think I 'll learn to take my losses .
 This is the second review as I have had the camera for sometime now . I have taken some killer photos with this camera and printed them on my HP 812C color inkjet.I strongly recommend you buy a 32 or 64 mb smart media card and NiMh batteries . The battery life is great with those batteries.Radio Shack sells an AC adapter at a very reasonable price for the PDR-M60 . Go forth and shoot !
 I recently purchased a Toshiba PDR - M60 digital camera . The first thing I noticed right out of the box was the bottom left area of the viewfinder had an obstruction as if a finger partially covered it . This never went away . The camera only comes with a partial owner 's manual and to obtain the full length version you have to download it from the CD and it is 103 pages long . Another problem is the batteries discharged in a couple of days although the camera was in the off mode . If you buy a PDR-M60 be sure to immediately buy some rechargeable batteries and a charger and an AC adapter as battery life is very short when you connect the camera to your computer . I have to believe my camera was an anomoly as Toshiba is recognized for quality , nevertheless , I returned it and ordered a Canon s-10 .
 I am a loyal Toshiba buyer , the TV 's are super , the best , but they goofed big time with this M60 camera . I could never get it to focus correctly and most pictures were blurred and not useable . Naturally , I returned the camera for a refund , it was auto focus defective . I used up 2 sets of batteries , on approx . 20 unuseable pictures in various resolutions and options -LRB- always using the LCD -RRB- trying to learn how to take good pictures -LRB- in focus -RRB- with this sucker . Yes I know you have to pause half way down to allow the camera to focus . You also need a gold mine for all the batteries it can use up very , very quickly . The batteries refused to work the camera even at 1.4 vdc under normal current demands by the M60 , that really sucks . It did run longer with the 1500 mah NI-MH rechargeable batteries -LRB- worked even at 1.2 vdc but it takes 13 hours to charge a set of batteries -RRB- but overall this digital camera is n't worth the MSRP price ... . and sorry to say , in my opinion , at any price . Great name ... . poor design ... . do n't buy .
 This camera is a decent general use camera , but buyers should be VERY aware of some inherent flaws with the camera and Toshiba 's lack of support for their own engineering flaws . The camera has 2 reoccuring problems . First , the tabs in the battery compartment are weak . Extreme care must be taken opening and closing the compartment to prevent wear and breakage . Second , the mode dials on these cameras fall off in normal use . The plastic pins which hold it in place break off no matter how gently used . Toshiba has stopped supporting the camera with replacement parts . If the dial falls off outside the warranty window , your only option will be to trade the camera in for a refurbished camera . The price of the trade is not justifiable considering the problems , and you will be better off buying a new camera from someone besides Toshiba . I currently have a worthless PDR-M60 , and will not buy from Toshiba again .
 I was impressed with the features in the store , but when I got it home the Toshiba was less impressive . It ran out of battery power very quickly . The viewfinder was obstructed by the camera body . The 4mb smartmedia card is far too small . And I kept looking for the manual -- but all it comes with is a useless reference guide that barely tells how to refill the batteries -LRB- a skill you will need to develop quickly ! -RRB- Hold out for a better value .
 Radius Technology DVDs ID as `` OPTODISC '' brand media . -LRB- That is , OPTODISC makes the discs for Radius -RRB- . OPTODISC media are generally found to be lousy
 Would not order large electronics outside the US again !!!!! Sipping cost $ 349 . Both speakers arrived malfunctional i.e. would not power up ! Amazon offered to replace , however , would have meant paying $ 349 to ship back to US & same amount to send new speakers out again so simply not practical for such large items ! As a result , we spent money locally to replace the transformers of both speakers , with NO assistance from Amazon/the dealer at all !!! Speakers now working & are great but what a hassle !!!!
 I will never again buy any Audiovox products . They make poor quality disposable products . Is is a shame that GE put repair of RCA -LRB- Excellent products -RRB- under the care of Audiovox , because Audiovox looks for reasons not to repair the products . After speaking to nine prople within their `` pass him on '' system , I got the impression that it was not the attitude of the people I talked to , it was the attitude of Audiovox . They sell over priced products and when the break , which they always do , they do not stand behind the repairs . So expect this product to last the life of the warrenty , then it will turn to junk and you will be stuck with it . So let the buyer beware of any Audiovox product .
 Bad Bad Bad . . stay away . I got a 25 pack and only 3 worked the rest either could n't be used the second burn or burn fail right out of the box .
 The batteries work as expected . Batteries.com is an online business to avoid . They sent me different batteries than I ordered , charged exorbitant shipping fees , and then made it very difficult to get the batteries replaced when they messed up the order in the first place . Two thumbs down !
 Bought the 25 ft which worked fine , however the 14 foot cut in and out with signal and only after I replaced it was everything working as expected . Unfortunately , probably more trouble to actually return it .
 This product was useless . Once the backplate was attached to the wall and the cables put into place , the plastic cover would not stay in place . The plastic cover was poorly designed and would not fasten securely to the backplate and would pop-off after a few minutes.After talking to their technical support department , it was explained that this product was not intended to `` manage '' more than one or two cables . Seemed like a lot of to do for something that did not work satisfactorily at all . They suggested that I return the product and get the CMK product instead .
 I sort of thought I could ADD to the 32G of my Zen Vision W but it works the other way around and I could 've done the same with a USB cable or flashdrive and PC . I 'd actually return it but there is nothing wrong with it , its just my not wholly understand its use .
 It does what it is supposed to do . But it 's completely overpriced for what it is . It should be about $ 10 . Still if you want to use SD cards with your Creative Zen W , this is necessary . 4 Stars for functionality but -2 stars for price .
 I bought this as a gift for a friend . We spent two weeks trying to figure out why we could n't see anything in the lens . We gave up today and returned it.The directions are good for putting it together , but there is NOTHING in the directions on how to use or troubleshoot . The Bushnell website and calls to their helpline were also of NO USE.I would NOT recommend this telescope to a novice or anyone for that matter . It was more frustration than anything !
 The product arrived quickly . I ordered this and the box wave Stylus/ink pen . My original review was 4 stars ; however , in the last weeks of ownership , I 've lost at least 1 black ring from each item ! The small black lines you see are actually black really thin and cheap O rings . They make for a comfortable and stylish pen and mini ; however , when they fall off and you lose them , it becomes an uncomfortable and ugly Stylus and min ! I lost the first one of each before I even noticed the rings move easily ! After being aware that I must use caution , I lost another . I 'd like them to send me quiet a few spares for each item . But as it is , I ca n't give this product a good review . I would not order another box wave product knowing about the temporary rings !! It 's upsetting !
 I like the small size for the ability to carry it all the time . It 's just too small to be useful as a stylus . If you want the ability to carry it , then go for it .
 THE SCREEN MATERIAL WAS WHAT I EXPECTED FOR A SOUND SCREEN , BUT THE WAY THE SCREEN SNAPS INTO THE FRAME IS POORLY DESIGNED . EXPECTED MORE CONSIDERING THIS SCREEN IS ACTUALLY FROM DRAPER . ALSO THE FELT ON THE ALUMINUM IS THIN AND CAN SCUFF EASILY . YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR .
 I bought this to power a portable laser printer , as soon as the printer started warming up it would fault . Tried on multiple batteries and using heavy duty cables . It just could n't handle the job . My old 750W power inverter could at least power the printer on , this would just fail . It is also very big in size . Item returned to amazon immediately and I hardly ever return anything but not much I could do with just a brick .
 I recieved the product in a timely manner but when it came to testing it , it did not work . I immediately sent t back to amazon and i am expecting my refund .
 I bought this battery to have a second one besides the one that came with my HP Jornada 568 , and unfortunately it did n't work at all . After I plugged it , and charged it -LRB- it miraculously charged in 10 seconds ? -RRB- , it quickly discharged after 2 seconds of use . I then took it with my PDA to an authorized HP tech service in my location and they told me that the battery was useless .
 I gave this to my son-in-law for a birthday gift.I subsequently found out that the strap was broken right out of the box , and he was too busy to arrange for an immediate replacement.Now the time for Amazon 's easy return policy has passed , and he 's stuck with a defective product .
 Just before starting my review , I 'd like to clarify that I did not buy the bag from Amazon . I bought mine from Best Buy -LRB- Just to show that I have it -RRB- . I bought my Canon t3i , and this bag came bundled with it . I wish I never spent the 50 dollars on the bag + 16gb SDC + Disc . Reason being is that it defiantly is not a bag for people that want to be tidy/want a lot of space . I 'm the type of person that wants to open my bag , quickly grab my lens , and close it . With this bag , you have to pretty much stack your lens on top of each other in order for it to fit all of it.Pros : Small bag for certain people.Weather Proof.Cons : Price . I think it 's worth maybe 30 bucks max . There 's a lot of other bags that can do 10x better than this bag.Organization . It 's pretty hard keeping everything tidy since there is n't any dedicated spots to put your stuff in.Tall , but not wide.Style . Looks very unappealing , and I feel embarrassed walking around with it.Shoulder strap . Has no padding on the shoulder pad , only has rubber gripping .
 I bough this back 4 years ago . It worked great for a while until recently when the plastic connectors popped out and my bag fell 2 feet to the ground . It ended up busting my $ 800 lens and now I 'm out $ 300 to fix it . If those parts did n't break it would be great . I have n't abused this bag at all . I was simply walking and the part popped and the bag fell . I have a more complete review that I did a few years ago on youtube . Look up the shuttersight photography review on this bag . I mention the popping part there as well .
 The sound is great , the features fantastic , and you 'll never be able to appreciate them , because the controls are impossible , and the manual worthless.Quick ! Change the volume level of the center speaker . Just try . You 'll have to push a button on the remote , after you push a button on the remote that is n't documented , then you 'll be able to get to the control . The buttons for changing between 5.1 and 6.1 on the front panel , as well as the remote , are easy to find , for all you folks that swap out speaker systems daily . If you want to change balance , make a pot of coffee and a sandwich .
 sounded good for the money . but then it broke 6 months later . if you buy it make sure you get a replacement warranty . I am going to buy a better one next time . you get what you pay for .
 Overall this screen looks ok and it 's very easy to assemble compared to similar products . The frame is flimsy . But be aware that it has connection points in the middle of each side and it will bow inward at those connection points . This is not a major issue , especially considering the price , but buyers should know that the frame sides are made of 2 pieces per side not one solid piece . More importantly , if you are buying an acoustically transparent screen it 's probably because you want to mount speakers behind the screen . Be aware that this screen is also visually transparent . Even though my speaker frame and grills are very similar in color to the wall behind this screen -LRB- off white -RRB- , they are completely visible through the screen . Seeing the speakers through the screen significantly affects the viewing experience and I will definitely be replacing this screen with a better alternative . If you do n't plan to put speakers behind this screen , it is a reasonable , cheap option .
 I have been in the process of selecting a screen for my theater and have tried Elite , Da-Lite , and this company . I have to say that the construction of this product is the worst . The framing rods go together badly and there are many other problems that are wrong with the unit . The actual screen quality was mediocre compared to the Elite and Da-lite . Even though they all had similar screen gain , this unit really had a significant loss in color reproduction . I wo n't get too extensive due to the time I need to write this properly , but this should n't be rated at 5 stars as it was previously .
 Extremely Poorly Made . Frame is not sturdy , and all components are very cheap . I switched to an Elite Screen Silver Frame which is approximately the same price , and the quality of the product is night and day !
 I ca n't believe that Amazon/Tiffen is selling these at $ 28 when you can get the same item as a generic for $ 4 or less on eBay with free shipping . Normally , I love Amazon -LRB- Prime member -RRB- and I also look for brand name items over generic when it comes to my camera equipment but this item is about as low-tech as you can get . After all , how hard is it produce an aluminum ring that screws into then end of a lens and allows you to attach a larger filter ? Use the extra $ 24 towards a nicer filter or dinner .
 People , do n't fall for this flawed product . I have the ipod shuffle , nano , and the 30gb ipod photo . The only reason I have three different Apple mp3 players were that they were given as gifts . I hate the nano the most of all of them . This thing will scratch no matter how carefully you look after it . Leave it in your pocket and after a week of regular use , the display will NOT BE READABLE . I learned this the hard way.Already knowing how easy it is to scratch the Nano , I was conscious of making sure that I did n't keep it in a pocked that had my keys or my loose change . This in itself is a major hassel , since I was always rearranging the contents of my pocket so I would have an empty pocket just to store the Nano . Nevertheless it has scratched and the plastic gets so warped that it becomes difficult to read the screen.Additionally the Nano can not be recharged on the road unless you have a laptop with a USB port . Or you can buy the adaptor for a wall outlet that costs way more than it should . And you will find the need to recharge the Nano quiet often because in the real world where you like to skip songs or change the volume , it will not last 14 hours that apple is claiming . I get maybe 6-8 hours.The biggest disadvantage to any of the Apple mp3 players is that it locks you in to buying songs via iTunes . I would much rather participate in a subscription service that gives me access to millions of songs such as those offered by Napster or Yahoo , but Apple has made their players compatible only with iTunes.And since most of my mp3s which I encoded from my cds are at a bitrate of 256mbps I am able to fill it up with only about 550 songs . About half that of what Apple claims . Sure you can get 1000 songs , as long as you are willing to sacrifice sound quality.There are a lot of diehard Apple fans going out to their way to defend this product . It 's up to you to decide if they have your best interests in mind or are blinded by their loyalty to a brand name and by its `` coolness '' factor.So in conclusion , my humble opinion is that the hype around this product is solely based on it 's smallness and chic factor . However in the practical world , this product will end up being more of a nuisance because of how much you have to baby it in order to keep it functioning .
 So I was the first kid on the floor with the IPOD NANO , I orderedone from MAC the Monday of release.It arrives , we all OOOOH and AHHHHHI take it home and charge it for the nightWake up at 5:30 , fully charged battery , put it onand get on with my day , by 10 AM the battery had DIEDCRAP!I call up MAC and they want to REPAIR this oneI say HELL NO !

So I am getting ready to mail this back , when I charge thebattert ONE more time , all night charge , fresh in the AMThis time , it stayed on from 7:30 , when I started to use it until1 :26 PM , an hour ago , my NANO died from poor battery power.Watch out when you get these , I am going to return this and hopeI get a better one , if I get another POOR BATTERY , I am goingto get a freaking refund , this is BOGUSMAC should know better than to release a product that is crap : /
 Do NOT buy the iPod Nano ! I wasted half my Christmas day fooling around with this worthless device , and as of 10:50 p.m. I still do not have it working . First , the software would not properly format the device . Second , when I thought I got the device properly formatted , it would not accept any downloads from a CD . As I sit here now , my computer wo n't recognize the device , and the iPod screen is frozen -LRB- yes , I 've tried to reset it according to the instructions -RRB- . So I 've obviously got a defective unit or component . To add insult to injury , for the brief moment when I thought the device was formatted correctly , I was unable to successfully purchase anything from iTunes -LRB- a very poor , unintuitive website -RRB- because the session kept timing out . -LRB- Gee , Mr. Jobs , did you think about adding servers for Christmas ? -RRB- I have no doubt that other people have had good experiences , but I 'm here to tell you the iPod is finicky and that iTunes is inferior even to first-generation P2P sites . I expected much , much better from Apple . The iPod is only for those who -LRB- i -RRB- have a need to have the cool , hip device , -LRB- ii -RRB- are technologically savvy and -LRB- iii -RRB- have the unlimited patience it will take to get your device formatted and working properly , and then to get your music into a format that your iPod will find acceptable . My advice -- look at the other MP3 players on the market .
 i got my ipod for Christmas and i can tell you ... everything about the nano lives up to the hype except for its battery life . I understand that results differ from ipod to ipod -LRB- by reading others reactions -RRB- but i 'd say that the battery has truely dissapointed me . I think mine on a full first charge -LRB- about half a day -RRB- lasted only about 2 hours
 I waited through the iPod evolution and finally bought the 4G iPod -LRB- clickwheel -RRB- in 2004 . The hard disk technology broke 3 times within a year -LRB- under warranty -RRB- and then finally a 4th time the week after the one-year warranty expired . I swore I would never again buy another hard disk-based iPod . The very next week , the iPod Nano was release . I was mesmerized . It sounded perfect ! Granted the 4GB version has a $ 150 profit markup , is easily scratched , delicate and low memory capacity -LRB- only 4GB -RRB- , but at least it was flash-drive based . I actually bought this the next week , and returned it before opening it once I found out that it did n't have VIDEO-OUT capabilities for photos and no FireWire capabilities , as the regular iPod 's did . Those were deal-breakers for the tiny $ 250 device . I will wait a bit longer for the 2nd generation Nano which hopefully will have VIDEO-OUT and FireWire capabilities -LRB- and hopefully more memory -RRB- even if they have to be a bit larger . The iPod and iPod Mini 's are small enough for me already ; I like the Nano for its flash-drive technology -LRB- for prospective reliability reasons -RRB- .
 I have joined a class action lawsuit against Apple because of how easily the Nano scratches.For those of you who think this lawsuit is stupid , worthless and for those who think the iPod nano is made exactly the same as previous iPods , you 're wrong . I suggest to those who believe this to read the filing that these two law firms filed . It suggests that Apple knowingly made these iPods with thinner materials , making them easier to scratch , to lower manufacturing cost . This is why this lawsuit is not stupid or `` bull '' . A company who makes a bad product knowingly should be held accountable!I have five iPods ; iPod mini , a 20GB iPod , an iPod shuffle , an iPod U2 Edition , & iPod nano . All of them have gone into my hoodie pocket that contains nothing else -LRB- no keys , no pens , paper , etc. -RRB- . All of them are scratch free except the iPod nano . I bought the iPod nano September 15 , 2005 at Best Buy and took it home where I laid the box on my desk . It stayed there until Monday morning where I took it out of the box -LRB- for the first time -RRB- and loaded all the music I wanted onto it . I was leaving for vacation that day by the way . I put the Nano in my hoodie pocket , with nothing else in there , and left for the bus . A few moments into my trip and I took the Nano out of my soft cotton made hoodie pocket and it was scratched badly enough already that it is hard to see what is on the screen.I feel I , and everyone else who has a scratched iPod nano , am entitled to a new iPod nano from Apple , however , all I really want Apple to do is admit that they have a bad product out there and I want them to fix it for future iPod nanos -LRB- which I have no doubt they 've already done -RRB- . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 First off , let me just say that the nano was my fourth iPod ; I have a second-generation 40GB iPod , as well as two minis -LRB- 1st gen 4GB and 2nd gen 6GB -RRB- , and was happy with all three until the batteries died . A side note -- do n't ever store your iPod in a third-party speaker set that also charges . Mine lasted not quite a year and now the battery dies after 20 minutes of play time.Here is the problem with the nano . It looks cool , is lightweight , and for all intents and purposes , promises to be a great piece of technology . But it is just way too easy to break . My other iPods had taken some abuse over the years , but never showed any signs of considerable wear -LRB- except for a scratched screen on the 40GB -RRB- . I managed to break the Nano two days after purchase on its first use , without any significant trauma to the casing . -LRB- I dropped it while sitting on the couch , and it fell two feet . -RRB- The screen cracked and the display is ruined , at a cost of over $ 100 to replace . Even after giving a polite explanation , producing a receipt , and enduring condescension from the manager -LRB- `` Sometimes things break '' -RRB- , Apple would n't take it back.I really ca n't recommend this product . There are better iPods out there , namely the Minis , which are more tightly crafted and likely to withstand the pressures of everyday use . Do n't waste your money on the nano . It is flimsy and poorly constructed , and you 're better off looking elsewhere until they improve their product .
 I bought this item for its great looks , form factor and the Apple interface , but I 've come to regret this choice as I primarily listen to audio books with this device . My primary issues with using this device for audio books are : -1 - Does n't support DRM-protected Windows Media Audio -LRB- WMA -RRB- files !! That precludes me from downloading Overdrive books from my local library . Most devices at this price point support this feature and I wish Apple would too.-2 - I loose my bookmark whenever the unit is recharged -LRB- really inconvenient for books !! -RRB- . -3 - I only get ~ 5 hrs of runtime between charges.Also , the ` click-shift ' mechanism for selecting files is hard to work with , and there have been a few technical glitches whereby all content on the iPod spuriously vanished .
 Please read this review depending on your IQ rating1-100This is the MP3 Player especially designed for you ! It is NOT compatible with ANY music service except iTunes and so you have only 1 choice ! Perfect if you do n't know what you are doing ! Even if you do BUY music from iTunes , NOTHING besides iTunes can play it ! It leaves no space for modifications ! Perfect for people like you ! : -RRB- 101-200I 'm glad that there are still people will intelligence . As I already know , you are NOT planning on buying this iPod for yourself but for someone else . This does make a very good gift for the previous type of people mentioned . Do be careful , if you are going to give this as a gift , make sure you buy an iTunes gift certificate to go along with it.Review for ALL people : Sound -LRB- 6/10 -RRB- - Crisp treble and bass . No custom equalizer and no sound shift when you are sick and have hearing imbalances . No 3D surround sound or anything of that nature . Low noise produced.Battery Life -LRB- 1/10 -RRB- - Battery lasts 4 Hours of use without navigating through songs . The battery life stated by Apple is complete bogus ! Lasts 2 Hours time with photo viewing and flipping through music.Looks -LRB- 8/10 -RRB- - Looks very nice and symbolizes simplicity . However , there is a little too much simplicity.Ease of use -LRB- 4/10 -RRB- - Not exactly easy to use and lacks many needed controlsOverall - 4.75 / 10Use if you are not so smart
 10/27/05 SAFETY NOTICEWal Mart has pulled ALL Nano 's from inventory ! They are offering a full refund to anyone who has purchased a Nano from their stores . It seems there have been issues of a battery leak that can cause severe burns . I called Best Buy and Circuit City and both stores say they are looking into a possible product recall but are still selling the units.Well , I was excited to get my ipod nano yesterday -LRB- 10/17/05 -RRB- and I raced home , got it out of the box , followed the directions step by step . Other than the DO NOT DISCONNECT message appearing ALL THE TIME when it is hooked to the computer , things went fairly smooth . I dropped 89 song on the Nano and let the battery fully charge.The BAD NEWS ! First thing you will learn is your 4G Nano is really only a 3.6 G nano after format . So you chunk 400MB out the window . Next thing you learn is this device will NOT hold 1000 songs even in the recommended bit-rate of 64kpbs . Let me explain further the bit-rate . 64bit-rate is the equivillent to the old records in sound quality . When you move to 128kbps , your getting cassette or 8-track quality sound . Only at 192kbps will you begin to hear some-what digital audio on this high tech digital device !! Unfortunatly for me , all my music is in 320kbps . In other words , the better the sound quality of your file , the LESS songs you get . You will be lucky to get 350 songs @ 320kbps quality -LRB- which is true cd digital audio -RRB- . Back to the BAD news !!! It boast a 14 hour battery life . Well , I have listened to 89 songs and the battery is nearly dead . I will guess I have had less than 5 hours of listening time . 1 hour last night and 4 hours today uptil lunch . Now maybe there is a way to get 14 hours , but I do n't know how you would do it . I guess if you turn it on and leave it , dont search for songs , dont use random and turn everything off that is not required for the device to funtion . I do n't know.My over-all opinion is , this would make an awesome player for $ 100 . But for $ 250 it 's a joke and most certainly the rip off of the century.Something else you may consider , I have heard form several different sales people from different stores -LRB- best buy , circuit city , fry 's , conn 's and compusa -RRB- that ipod batteries are notorious to throw craps after a 1 1/2 - 2 years . BUY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY !!!! It seems to be common knowledge that ebay sales of used devices have a battery issue . THE BATTERY CAN NOT BE REPLACED , YOU HAVE TO TRASH THE DEVICE !!!!! I am returning mine to compusa this afternoon . It has left me disappointed and with a bitter taste in my mouth with Apple . I would expect far more than an ad campaign of mis-leading information and it leads me to question the capability of the new ipod video.Good luck and I hope this was helpful .
 I ordered this item on Nov. 25 , 2005 . It was in stock at that time . I wish I would have known I would have gone elswhere as I am going to do now .
 I bought the nano instead of the larger capacity Ipods because it can hold enough audio in the form of podcasts and audio books without having to worry about the delicacy of a hard drive mechanism . In less than a month I 've worked through four audiobooks on my one hour commute ... some of them 15 hour reads . At a reasonably good sample rate , I can theoretically store nearly 600 hours of audio.I ordered the Belken FM Modulator with the Nano . It works well for in-car listening with the bonus of picking up adjacent vehicle satellite radio listening on occassion ... you 'd be surprised who listens to Howard Stern !
 Do n't waste you hard earned cash on this if you plan on using it with MS Windows . Windows recognizes the iPod but Apple iTunes does not . After 32 hours of trying to get it to work , I 'm giving up . My expience tells me that Apple still does n't play well with PC 's .
 Got two sets . One broke after a month or two . Other set did the same . There are MUCH better products out there .
 Do n't waste your money . The headset is cheap . The volume is so low even when it is set at its maximum setting .
 The sound was not good on my end though the people I was talking to said it was fine . I spend many hours on the phone for my business , so I opted for the no frills Panasonic KX-TCA60 .
 I 've had my Sansa c140 for just over a year . Several times it has locked up , and I 've managed to get it working again . Now it wo n't connect to my computer , all text is missing from the menus , and tech support is n't responding . -LRB- Being out of warranty , they probably wo n't . -RRB- From what I 've seen , this is a common problem , with no fix posted . Personally , I will avoid Sansa products in the future . I will certainly NOT buy another one of these !
 This is awful like within 2 weeks it started to develop problems now its just frozen on me its bad
 I 've had my C140 for a few months now with no problems - no distortion issues no trouble moving files to it . HOWEVER , with doing absolutely nothing to it , my C140 is now frozen . I can power it off but it 's as if the hold button is on . I ca n't forward to the next track , reverse to the last track - play and pause do nothing ... It 's stuck at 1:06 of the last song I played . It 's toast ...
 I bougth this player almost one year ago . From the first minute I was dissapointed by the sound quality . Compares with old cassette player -LRB- not even with the worst cd player -RRB- . Battery average life was under 10 hours.Doesn ' t connect directly to USB -LRB- had to carry always with me the cable huge connector -RRB- . Documentation is poor . It took me over 2 months of web research to find out how to create playlists -LRB- you sinply transfer the . m3u files to the root of the audible folder -RRB- . Finally after 10 months the player is broken . After a media transfer with my pc it was never stopped updating the storage so the only sollution was to take out the battery . After restart the player was FROZEN with the last song played before the media transfer and the battery level on red -LRB- no control working , not even the power button -RRB- . I wrote to the sandisk support twice -LRB- they never responded to the phone either -RRB- . Buying again from SanDisk ? NEVER !!!
 Some initial trouble loading on songs , but after a little bit figured it out . Was not as straitforward as the other MP3 player I own , the ZEN NANO from Creative . Songs were alright , although I agree with other reviewers that the menu navigation is cumbersome more than helpful.Major gripes started about 5 days in : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Audible books were able to be loaded on , but quit playing after about halfway into the first book . Others could be seen and selected on the player , but even with volume set at high and all the way up , can barely hear the voice . Multiple attempts to work around -LRB- using different media players or loading on directly -RRB- were unsuccessful . Which brings me to problem # 2 : -LRB- 2 -RRB- Sandisk telephone and email support people were totally unhelpful . After several suggestions that I either already tried/considered or were off base to begin with , they blamed others -- `` it must be an Audible problem or the file is messed up '' . Neither are true , as both continue to work fine on computer and the other MP3 player . -LRB- 3 -RRB- Now it is stuck on one of the Audible programs , but will not play , not shut off -LRB- unless I take the battery out -RRB- , will not respond to anything . So now it is worthless.I will never buy a Sandisk MP3 player again .
 When this unit works it is a great idea.Mine froze up on me and I was forced to return it .
 I returned this mp3 player because it kept shutting off and I would have to remove the battery and replace it to turn it back on i think it is not a good purchase . DO N'T GET THIS TYPE OF MP3 PLAYER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 I bought this thing thinking it had good features for the $ 99 price tag . I used it for a few days and it is a piece of junk.The construction is very weak , the dial is lose , the sound quality is not that great -LRB- not horrible though -RRB- and my biggest problem is it does n't sort the songs by the track number in the ID3 tags.I emailed support about this and they were very rude and rather than answering my questions about the sorting , they suggested I return it if I 'm not happy with it.The only reason I did n't rate this one star is 'cause the player has FM radio , which I kind of liked.Anyway , I returned the C140 and got an Ipod Nano ... It 's $ 50 more , but WAAAAAAAY better.Just my two cents . ; -RRB-
 It 's amazing to me that there could be an MP3 player that allows one to corrupt it by simply uploading slightly more data that it shows . That 's what happened . Pathetic . Playng volume is weak , the display is easily cracked , and now my son 's player is a useless paperweight . I 'll probably try to get it replaced , meanwhile I just bought anoter one . Search for `` no space for Db please delete 4.0 Mbs to free up space '' and just see how many hits you get . I really do have a hard time recommending ANY Sansa MP3 player when the very basic operation can render one useless ; and it 's not just this model , just search , and you 'll see .
 i got this b/c i was desperate for an ipod alternative , and it seemed to be a decent buy . my main complaint is that every few days it refuses to play songs that i 've downloaded onto it from yahoo music player -LRB- it will still play songs i 've transferred from CDs -RRB- . when it does this it asks me to `` plz sync the device '' . i still have n't figured out what that means . sometimes if i plug the device into my computer and alter the playlist a little , it 's happy for another few days . sometimes this does n't work . very frustrating . also , it operates on AAA batteries and sucks them down like water .
 The player only lasts one or two hours with 1 aaa battery . Sometimes it turns on when its in my pocket and wont stop playing , and it goes dead . i hate it . dont buy it
 I have the c140 and c150 , and both are very frustating . The c150 took 10 hours to fill the 2GB of memory . Now the C140 is acting up . I can not add or delete anything from this unit . With Sandisk support and trying to format it still no luck . A huge waste of time ! And also money . I never had a problem with any of my minidisc players in over 8 years !
 The player was alright for a while but after like a month the display stopped showing any text and then it stopped linking up to my computer properly and when you call customer service at sandisk they are of little to no help . Overall I would not advise this item
 We purchased this product as a Christmas gift . The MP3 player arrived , but did not include the very necessary CD which contains the `` Sansa Media Converter '' software so that we could put pictures onto it , nor the even more important `` User 's Manual . '' It had obviously been repackaged into a different box from its original packaging . Very frustrating .
 I have another SanDisk 512mb mp3 player . After the headphones went out and the face plate got smashed on this mp3 player , I was eager for an upgrade.I 've had this one for about a month , this was a Christmas gift to myself . The headphones has already gone out on this -LRB- this is a pattern in there mp3 players -RRB- . You ca n't turn it up very loud . It 's easy to navigate and transfer music but there are other mp3 players that have the same features and do more better than SanDisk . Yes , you can put pictures on the mp3 player , I would avoid doing so seeming that the screen is extremely small .
 I LIKE THE SIZE BUT THE DOWNLOAD TIME IS SOOOO SLOW . I BOUGHT ANOTHER SAN DISK MP3 PLAYER AND IT IS 10 TIMES AS FAST AND WAS MUCH CHEAPER .
 I read many reviews on this product and I saw a few that said the product froze on many customers . I thought to myself , `` Oh well , sucks to be those peope ... `` Unfortunately SUCKS TO BE ME . I purchased this mp3 player and the very next day it froze at the front title screen . I tried everything from restarting , new batteries , etc. but nothing would work . It continued to freeze at the title screen.Word of advice to SanDisk , RECALL THIS PRODUCT OR YOUR GOING TO LOSE MANY CUSTOMERS !
 For a device with practically no moving parts , there is no excuse for it to freeze after a week of ownership , and barely an hour of use . If it would work , it could be just about my ideal mp3 setup . We 'll see what happens if I am able to get it replaced ...
 I purchased a `` White Box '' version of the player and the driver/software CD that came with it had W32.Perlovga.A virus on it , which infected my machine . The virus is very difficult to remove . It can be identified by Norton AV , but can not be cleaned . If you do get infected , virus removal is a manual and very painful process.BEWARE !!!
 I bought this for my 14yr old son . After 3 months it froze and would no longer work . SanDisk should be ashamed for producing products that are disposable after only a few months !
 the player froze up after about a week worked with tech support downloaded patch , still had to order replacement . Replacement did the same thing within a week . Went out and bought an RCA mp3 player for the same price . Really suprised an sandisk product usually are good .
 I was in US for work for some time.I brought this item as a gift to my brother while coming back to my home country . this product hanged within a week from its first use and i was not able to use it again . I contacted customer care for its complaint but nothing was worked out . I am very much disappointed with this purchase and think that it was a total waste for the money I spend on this product .
 I bought this player mainly for its FM recording abilities . I have an Ipod that i use for most everything in my library . So for under $ 100 i thought this would be great for what i needed . I was wrong . When the backlight turns off the sound on the FM is drown out by an annoying hum . This also travels over to recording . You can leave the backlight on all the time , but that will just eat power like no tommorow . Sadly disappointing becasue it seems this is the same on all this model not just the one I had . Dont by it for FM anything ! Get a Creative Labs Zen Nano Plus like I did - cheaper & it works !
 I bought this player for 2 reasons . One , my son had a similar , smaller version that he was very happy with . Second , I wanted a small flash player device that would work with Rhapsody and their Rhapsody to go service . Initially the player performed well . I was syncing about 90 songs which consisted of subscription and MP3s from my own CD collection . After I added a second playlist which was mostly subscription music , the player froze up . At first , I thought I had tried to sync too much music , but I was well under the 1 gig limit at 650 meg . So , I started doing all the usual things to reset the device -LRB- pop the battery , hit different control key combinations , etc. -RRB- . But everytime I turned it on , it froze on the Sandisk screen which is the initial screen . After 1.5 weeks of working with Sandisk support , they decided to have me ship it back and they would send a new unit.The new unit arrived and things worked well for one day then the unit started to stop playing after each song and freeze . Popping the battery would unfreeze this time and I was able to follow technical support instructions by reformatting the device using Windows Media player and resyncing with Rhapsody . After the resync , the device froze again and now I can not reset.I suspect that the problem has something to do with the Rhapsody service and the `` Play for Sure '' code , but that is only speculation.If I ca n't get my money back , I will try to get another unit and only sync it with MP3s . If that fails , I will crush it underneath the tires of my car and call it a day .
 What can I say . I purchased not once but twice and not because I liked it . I first bought it about a month ago and was really happy with it and all of its features . However , after just one month it locked up on me and would n't do anything . I returned the item and thought maybe I just got a defective product and gladly replaced it with the same product . This however was a huge mistake since this one locked up on me after just one day . I returned the item and bought a completely different mp3 player . I hope this helps anyone who is potenially going to buy this product .
 I bought this mp3 player as an upgrade from an old 60mb player I had been using . The size , the AAA battery , the FM tuner / recorder were all great features for the price . When I first tried it out , I noticed a bad distortion on everything in the mid to low range at normal volume . I thought it might be the ear buds so I plugged in my high-dollar headphones and it was still there . Next I tried out the FM tuner , which had the same distortion problem . And if that was n't enough , as soon as the display light went out , a horribly annoying hum started up . I hit one of the buttons , which turned the light back on , and the hum stopped . Then the light went back off and the hum started up again . After some internet searching I found that this is a common problem with this player . The first time I plugged it into the USB port it worked for a while then froze up and would n't respond to any key presses . I had to remove the battery and put it back in . This is apparently another common problem . So I went to the Sandisk website to try to download a firmware update , hoping that might solve these problems , and there was n't one available for this model . So in a last ditch effort -LRB- after wasting lots of time and brain cells -RRB- I emailed tech support detailing the problems I was having . I was immediately sent an autoreply message saying that my question had been assigned to a support specialist and would be answered promptly . Two days later when I still had n't received any response -LRB- it has now been four days as of this writing -RRB- I took the thing back and bought an iPod nano , which is in a whole different league from this player , and worth every penny . My only regret is that I did n't go ahead and spend the money on the iPod to begin with , which would have saved me a lot of grief . On the positive side , at least now I have a much greater appreciation for the quality of the iPod .
 When I first bought this device it was for the FM recording capabilities . When trying to record stuff off of the radio , the instructions were pretty simple . Once finished my recording I listened to it back and the sound was VERY distorted and it skipped alot as if it was a CD player with no anti skip feature . If SanDisk is going to advertise this feature they should atleast make sure that it functions half-way decent . I was very dissapointed in this player
 Used the player for about three months . Worked good . Then one day when I turned it on , it froze up completely -- pressing the controls had no effect on the display or operation of the player . I tried a new battery . No effect . The only way to turn it off now is to take out the battery . I will never buy a SanDisk product again .
 I realized when I ordered this HD Jump that I lived in an outlying suburban area of Mpls , MN . I knew it was a gamble on reception . I can actually pick up the public radio broadcast I was after . The problem is that the HD Jump ADVERSELY affected my normal FM reception so badly that I pulled it all back out . I would not recommend this product . Try something with HD built into the radio itself .
 After wiring it up to the car , the unit will not turn on . Yes I checked the power after the fuse . The support says to take it back to the installer . I like the idea of this product but after putting in the effort to install it and having a dead product and no one to call , I may go with a new in-dash HD radio .
 Mine was dead out of the box . Hey America , you get what you pay for - there is no free lunch . On its ' way back , needless to say .
 It might just be the area I live in -LRB- Austin , TX -RRB- , but I only got 1 HD station . It was too bulky and looked terrible in my vehicle . I guess I got what I paid for .
 Got this thing all hooked up and nothing.Not a buzz , pop or even a flatline.Power to device-check . Press power button-check . Houston we have a problem .
 It 's 10/11/11 and the image displayed for sale is a rotary switch model . The item that will be shipped is a push button model . The rotary switch model is more reliable as I have one still working after 10 years . The push button model is too light of weight and to be used properly the box must be secured down by double sided tape . Also , push buttons have a habit of developing bad contacts after much use . Besides the rotary switch does not need tape to secure it from moving while turning the switch . Still , maybe you would like it more secure too .
 Did not work.hooked it up , worked on one computer , switched to the other computer and got a screwed up screen . Turned screen off and on , rebooted computer and screen ended up with gibberish lines.I do n't understand as this should be a simple wiring setup.SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME - BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE THIS SETUP DOES NOT WORK !!!!!!
 This switch is as plain and simple as it can be - just a cheap metal casing with a crude switch and the wires going to the ports . As small as it already is , it could have been made into something even less than half the size . 90 % of the space in the case is air .
 Instead of the dial pictured with this listing , the product shipped comes with two push buttons -LRB- A and B -RRB- . That 's nothing that would have kept me from buying it ... but it 's still disconcerting to get something besides what you ordered.What would keep me from ordering this is that although the signal changed from source A to source B -LRB- and back -RRB- when the appropriate button was pushed ... it would change the video signal to a * very * yellow color once you let go of the button . As long as you are mashing the button down all the way with your thumb it is fine . But the second you take your thumb off of the button the image looks like it 's being viewed beneath a layer of dark yellow liquid . For this reason I can not recommend this product .
 I had the same problem mentioned by J. Swanson . I ran the primary SVGA cable out of my computer to the input jack on the back of the switch box and then a SVGA cable to my monitor and another to my Samsung TV . My computer is running XP . It also seems to recognize the switch box as a monitor , deletes the actual monitor from the system , and replaces it with a `` default '' monitor . The only solution was to delete the `` default '' monitor from the hardware profile , shut the computer down , plug a SVGA cable directly from the computer to my monitor , also a Samsung , and then start the computer up again , and then add the proper monitor to the hardware profile . I am returning both the switch box and the 50 ft SVGA cable I bought to connect the computer to the TV . From what I understand , this process may be much easier in Windows 7 , and I will be upgrading to that OS soon , so this may be easier to achieve then . For now , with my present computer and OS , though , this solution just did not work for me .
 Thought it would work better than it does . No matter what I 've done , I ca n't get rid of the wavy lines that distort either of the monitors . I 'd return it if it was n't too late .
 I bought these so I can switch between my second computer monitor and Xbox 360 . I did n't notice the difference in quality of the picture when I switched to my xbox 360 , but when I turned the switched to my computer , I noticed a huge decrease in image quality . There was an overlapping effect on fonts and images were extremely blurry . I even switched the VGA cables out thinking that was my problem , but it did n't help . It could just be my VGA Switch box though -LRB- not sure since it was pretty cheap -RRB- . All in all , it works ... but does not give a clear image .
 This ink was advertised as Brother Model LC41BK Black Injet Cartridge , leading me to believe it was Name brand , but when it arrived , it was compatible , not original . I feel this was very missleading and false advertisement . If I wanted compatible ink , I would have looked for compatible ink and paid the appropriate price . I only give it two stars because the ink is compatible . I wo n't buy from databazaar again !
 The produst lasted me all of a month before the power cord broke . I tried contacting their websales department but i never recieved a response . tech support told me there was nothing they could do so my $ 80 burner remains useless . definatley buy at your own risk .
 I own a cybershot sony camera , and I was planning on just buying a housey for that camera , but then I was told that a housey can hurt the camera if its not used right so I started looking for a cheap underwater camera . I came across this camera , and seeing as it was cheap and digital I bought it . . After I got I noticed that there was no screen -LSB- to see the pictures after they are taken -RSB- . Also the pictures didnt come out very good . Most were very blurry . The first time I put the camera in the water -LSB- after testing the case -RSB- the camera failed and the pictures deleted themselfs . I wouldnt even call this a camera . This is a toy . Not worth the money . Your better off buying a $ 200 camera that will last you more than one try .
 I bought this camera to use kayaking . Unfortunatly it is too low of resolution and too poor of lens quality to be good for anything other then a toy .
 I bought this camera for a snorkeling trip in the Philippines . What a disappointment to find that none of the pictures we took with this camera -- above or under the water -- were even distinguishable . Fuzzy , blurry , and strangely ... red . Do yourself a favor , do n't buy this camera .
 Received the Canon Pxima mini260 on time from Amazon as usual ! Open the box to check it out before wrapping it as a gift . I found the quality of the printer to be really cheap and there were all these warnings about how to put the ink cartridge in the printer and if not just right it could cause problems and even breakage . The ink cartridge is a multi purpose cartridge and it is so small that there is no way it could last for long without have to replace . I returned it to Amazon which refunded my mony and I purchased an Epson Photomate . The Epson works great and the quality of the prints are supper .
 I 've always loved Canon digital cameras , so I was sure that I would also love a Canon printer . Sadly , I 've never been so unhappy with anything as I am with this mini260 printer . After less than six months , of light to medium use , the printer seems to be worn out . I am faced with either replacing the print head -LRB- which Canon happily tells me may not solve the problem -RRB- , or replacing the printer completely . Further , I have found that the ink cartridges are nearly impossible to find locally -LRB- so I order them from amazon -RRB- , the paper is very expensive locally , and the printer is picky about using only Canon paper . Other papers give very poor print results . The user interface is very ` clicky ' , and I 'm not impressed with the feel of the printer - it 's very lightweight and fragile-feeling . Before I purchased this canon printer , I used an HP photoprinter -LRB- one of the first -RRB- for YEARS and was very happy . Guess what I am about to do now ?
 Keep your orginal plug , this is worthless . it only has two controls and half the time it reboots and never does what i programed it for .
 I have the Whistler Pro78SE detector which is a great unit . The Whistler Intellecord is supposed to be compatible with my unit . The cord does what it 's supposed to , but it randomly shuts the unit off and turns it back on . I do n't have any problems when I use the power cord that came with my detector , only with the intellecord . If the Intellecord did n't do this it would be a useful thing to have .
 When I press the button it reboots both my detectors . I have two of these cords on 2 different detectors and it does the same thing on both of them . I even set both functions to auto mute and it still simply cycles the detector off then on when I press the button .
 This product comes with a straight power cord vs. a coiled cord that I was expecting . Did not even open the item packaging , and have already returned the item for credit , and subsequently ordered a regular coiled cord from Whistler directly as I could not find one offered on Amazon .
 1 1/2 - 2 weeks after receiving the intellicord unit it failed . The unit 's indicators lights were functioning but it did not power-up my whistler xtr 695se radar . Luckly , I was able to fall back on the original power cord for the radar to function properly . I am really surprised the failed unit did n't even make it passed the 30 day mark . I am in the process of returning the intellicord back to the seller -LRB- antonline_com -RRB- . So far no issues from them at this point .
 The grand Intellicord !! Turns out not to be that Intelligent after all !! So what 's in the box , so to speak :1 - You get a lighter plug that has two L.E.D 's -LRB- one to indicate power , and one to indicate the radar is turned on -RRB- it also has a single button to control two separate controls on the Radar Detectors -LRB- S1 and S2 -RRB- , I have yet to master how to engage the second stack -LRB- S2 -RRB- .2 - Each time you press the button , you can step thru pre-lined up options like Auto-quite , dark mode etc. that you have to choose when you configure the radar detector . However I only get auto quite .3 - It does n't really come with any meaningful instructions , so you have to go by what comes with the radar detector which it is n't much ! 4 - I expected this to be similar to the Escort Intellicord , where it has an extra speaker and real controls and a concealed radar led . -LRB- NOP -RRB- 5 - So , you get the option to power the radar from Remote , and maybe control the quite feature . That 's all that I got off of it.Is it worth $ 15 ~ $ 20 you decide ?
 SENT IT BACK BECAUSE WHISTLER PHONY RADAR DETECTOR IS JUNK RETURNED RADAR DETECTOR ALSO , A DO N'T BUY WHISTLER PHONY RADAR DETECTOR
 The one positive thing I can say about this headset is that people seem to be able to hear me and I can hear them.The negatives far outweigh that positive , however . The part that goes around your ear , which can be flipped to allow wearing the headset on your right or left ear , is completely stationary . There 's no way to adjust it in or out except by bending the rubber parts . The part where the earpiece attaches to the microphone/speaker assembly is hard plastic and very uncomfortable when it rubs against your cheek . The cord should be at least 8-12 '' longer . If I have the phone sitting on my desk and I turn my head or move away , the headset pulls the phone off the desk . The mute button ca n't be set in place and left alone . If you want to mute , you have to be holding the button down . This is a major inconvenience for conference calls when you want to take notes and have both hands free -LRB- which is one of the main reasons I use a headset -RRB- . I 'm seriously considering returning this .
 Dont waste your money on this product . Very poor voice quality .
 I had high hopes for this case but when I put it on my belt and walked around the house , I accidently bumped lightly against a bookcase and it cracked . I was surprised since I barely brushed the bookcase . I called Contour Design and they had me send it back to them but they determined it was not a warranty issue and will not replace or fix it . While the case did protect my iPod , I would not recommend it since it is too easily scratched or cracked . Get a case that has some flexibility to it and from a company that will stand by their product .
 You ca n't use it with iTrip . . You have to remove your iPod out of the case everytime you want to use iTrip . : -LRB- Hence it is as good as not having the case at all ...
 The case is fine however you have to remove your IPod in order to use ITALK or ITUNES . Why even bother .
 Until the logic board went and self-destructed , it was doing well . I am very upset with Canon and its short-lived circuitry .
 I bought this printer about 2 years ago . Up until tonight it has printed great . I would say that I did n't even come close to printing 500 pages with this printer in that time . Probably much less . I replaced the ink once , relatively recently.Tonight , I print one page . It turns off and that 's all she wrote . Nothing . Wo n't turn on anymore . tried everything I know to get it back to life .2 stars , sorry Canon you 'll have to do better than 2 years . My old HP lasted 10 . My Samsung lasted 5 . I 'll try Kodak next . What a bummer .
 I just purchased this printer based on all the glowing reviews I have read and I have to say I do n't know what everyone likes about this model . I was interested in this particular printer since it had the ability to scan slides and film so possibly I could eliminate my separate film/slide scanner . Well I never got the opportunity to try anything with this printer because the automatic sheet feeder would not work and I had to return the printer . I chose not to get a replacement printer for the following reasons :1 -RRB- Printer was much more difficult to set up than previous Canon and HP printers I have owned .2 -RRB- Printer has so many moving parts that appeared to be cheaply made and most likely break after minimal usage .3 -RRB- Access to the print head and ink cartridges is very awkward because the top only lifts about half way .4 -RRB- Printer made so many clanking and grinding noises that it sounded like it would n't last a long time . These sounds may have been due to the printer being defective but ; I would n't want to take that chance .5 -RRB- The fact that the printer was defective I think is indicative to the complexity and poor quality of this model.I plan on getting a single purpose photo printer and continue to use separate film/slide and document scanners .
 Seriously
 The printer works good -- quick . Scanner is good . The colors are not vibrant though . Everything is dull . We have tried a variety of papers and nothing seems to make any of the colors pop . We are considering looking into a laser printer instead .
 I received the printer with a broken ink cartridge in the box , that should have been the first clue . Printer would not get past the set up returning an error about the `` scan lock '' . Makes me wonder if they actually tested the printer before sending it back out again . If it had n't been for the easy return policy I would have been very upset . Ended up buying a brand new Canon MP610 and had it up and running in a few minutes , very happy with it .
 We bought this printer based on extensive research and on the recommendations of a leading consumer magazine.We had trouble on two separate occasions with the ink cartridges `` losing their minds '' and deciding that they were empty when they were not . This problem `` spread '' from one cartridge to another , an issue verified by Canon . Although Canon replaced the offending cartridges in a timely manner both times , the printer will not print AT ALL without all cartridges working , so we were out for a couple of days or forced to buy new cartridges.The print head also had to be replaced , requiring the unit to go to a local repair shop . One month after the one-year warranty was finished , the printer gave us another error message and would not print at all . The error message was not specifically covered on Canon 's web site , but after going through extensive testing with the CSR at Canon , the printer was declared dead , and we were told that all Canon would do was to give us 15 % off a new one since it was out of warranty.We are most disappointed -- the printer was really nice but it just did not work well enough and we do n't believe that Canon stood behind their product as they should have . We will not buy another Canon despite their high ratings .
 The Crosley Stack Mate 45 Cartridge dropped the records properly . However , the base of the cartridge that the records spin around is too large which created a drag , ie , the records do not spin freely . This caused them to sound distorted . Some would not even spin.I was very disappointed in this product .
 This adapter is lousy . do n't buy it . Certain records , do not drop properly using this adapter , because the adapter is too wide . Records drop halfway down and stick , causing the tone arm to bump against it and land on the turntable , or the record will drop to the turntable , but not turn , because of the width of the adapter , and cause the flip side of the record to be scratched by the turntable . This is not a good product and Crosley should make corrections . I received my first one for a birthday gift and it did n't work properly , so I bought another one thinking the first one was defective . It is defective from the Manufacturer . Crosley , long in the radio business for years , should know better and should make a better adapter . Dont buy this one
 Setup is pretty easy , but slow . It took more than a day to initialize my 4x500GB drives in RAID 5 . Nice looking unit , nice admin web interface.Now the bad stuff - I just lost all of my data stored on the unit ! After 2 months going back and forth with Intel support , I was told that there 's nothing they can do . I lost a few days talking to them , and on top of that , I lost a good client because I lost some of their crucial data.For some reason , my data just disappeared after a reboot . No prior warning of any kind , all of my hard drives are working fine , I can see the system on my network but all of my files are gone.I was told by INTEL SUPPORT that the software raid got corrupted somehow and there 's nothing they can do to fix it . To their credit , they tried to help me fix it but it did not work . The reason I bought this system was to ensure that my data is safe with Raid 5 , never thought that the raid can get corrupted.Also , when we are talking about cons , the system was always very , very slow , that is something to think about.Do not buy . I tried to return it to Intel and get my money back , but they do not accept returns , you can just get a replacement unit . I am not sure I trust the unit any more to store any data there.If you do buy it for some reason , make sure to check Intel site for working hard drive list - there are bunch of mainstream hard drives that are not supported , so make sure you know what you are buying here . If you buy a drive that is not supported and something goes wrong , they will just tell you to use supported drives .
 I purchased the LaCie implementation of this Intel small-office storage array early last year . The design specs for this Network Attached Storage array are impressive -- a four-drive storage array that can be configured as RAID 0 , 1 , or 5 . Unfortunately , the system proved to be buggy from the outset . Despite many email exchanges with tech support , none of our users were ever able to see the array as expected -- we all had to map the drive using its IP address . Several times , the array simply disappeared from our network and had to be restarted . Then last week , the array disappeared from the network and stayed invisible . We could access the administrative controls via a web browser , but we could not access any of the files . I spent hours on the phone with tech support , but they were mystified . To make matters worse , this unit does not support automatic backup to another device , which makes backups time consuming and clumsy . As a result , if the unit fails , as ours did , your backup is likely to be out of date . In a nutshell , it does little good to have multiple drive redundancy if the unit itself fails.I have had much better luck with the Netgear ReadyNAS small NAS RAID boxes -LRB- Netgear acquired this line from Infrant -RRB- . The Netgear ReadyNAS Duo that I bought to replace the failed Intel SS4000 was much easier to install , is dramatically faster than the Intel SS4000 , and has a much better set of features . Based on my experience so far , the Netgear ReadyNAS has been as pleasant a surprise as the Intel SS4000 was an unpleasant one.Based on the reviews I 've read on tech sites , the new Intel model , the SS4200 , is a very good networked storage device . It 's supposed to be screaming fast , and the software -LRB- which Intel got from storage giant EMC -RRB- is supposed to be great . In a nutshell , it looks like Intel 's second try at small-office networked storage is a huge leap forward , but based on my experience , their first try -LRB- the SS4000 -RRB- was n't ready for prime time .
 I had to buy two of these , the first one failed with all of my data on it , I bought the the other to recover the information . It worked yes but that unit failed after two months . I had luckily learned my lesson and backed up everything onto a few dozen Blu Ray Disks.This unit has serious issues when trying to back up a file that is over 2GB even after an update to the latest firmware , the device just freezes . I would not recommend this device for any one . Buy something else , something more reliable and robust .
 It would be nice if it were really explicit whether there are any drives included in this package ... I infer from the price -LRB- and the lack of any mention of disks ... ? -RRB- that those are extra . But since I ca n't really tell I will move on and hope for something more helpful and less misleading .
 This is such a dumb webcam . The construction is okay , at first , but before too long the camera part just flops around on the stand and becomes impossible to point . Utter fail when trying to install under Vista , which probably rules out Windows 7 . I was able to configure it under Ubuntu Linux , then learned that the camera element is mounted UPSIDE-DOWN in the unit.Update February 2010
 bot Target Store And picture was not clear . no zoom , it seemed dark I couldent even see my self in it . I took it back to target and just said for get it . who am I trying to be pretty for Nobody.I dont really need it now . but if it dosent good picture why waste the good hard earned cash on money to servive in this over priced economy . wait till I have money and I have credit cards payd off before I go buy a nother one . I rate cam a 2 . because on a sunny day couldent see my self on this cam other couldent see me . good luck
 Bought the 25 ft which worked fine , however the 14 foot cut in and out with signal and only after I replaced it was everything working as expected . Unfortunately , probably more trouble to actually return it .
 In renovating our house we installed 2 pair of the Bose virtually invisble speakers . There were no problems until after the painting , when the speakers went into the walls ; apparently , they just hang there , inside the rough-in plate and sheetrock . There is no screw connection to hold them in place , with the result that the grilles of 2 of them are flat against the wall , and the grilles of 2 of them stick out on the top , probably because of insulation between the wall studs -LRB- which is standard , at least here in the Northeast -RRB- . I am going to try to take them back out of the wall and remove some insulation , but it is annoying , to say the least -- neither the rough in plates -LRB- which are just flat stamped metal pieces , vastly overpriced -RRB- nor the speakers are exactly budget models .
 I bought this tablet and at first it worked fine . However after a couple of months it started failing . I would plug it in and nothing would happen - as if it 's not connecting . Juggling the cord where it attached to the tablet would cause the light to flash on and off and if you held it ` just right ' it would work ... for a few minutes.Now it simply does not work at all.Other than that it worked fairly well when it worked . I did not like the included software - it was difficult to use and looked ` kludgy ' to me.I suppose you get what you pay for ...
 First of all , I want to state that I have used a Bamboo fun for 5 years and loved it . I was trying to find an inexpensive alternative with a mouse since the Bamboo is getting old . I found this and I regret not getting another Bamboo Fun.The packaging was terrible , I cut myself on it just trying to figure out how to get it out . Installed the driver first as was instructed and then restarted , plugged it in , and the calibration refused to work properly and neither did the pen pressure . Went to their website , installed the latest driver , restarted , same thing . Went through this process a number of times , went through some troubleshooting , and I never could get the Manhattan icon to show up . No settings , no nothing.In addition it 's worth knowing the mouse is very shoddy . There is no scroll wheel , it is actually a button and I do not like that one bit . The surface of the tablet is extremely slick and the mouse bottom is unprotected plastic -LRB- unlike the soft cloth bottom of the Bamboo 's mouse -RRB- so moving the mouse across it creates a grating noise and feels very unnatural.I am very disappointed in this product ... I sincerely hope the seller gives me my money back because this is ridiculous . I will go buy me another Bamboo Fun .
 It 's a nice heavy power wire and that 's it . It 's being used to power my hometheater sub . Cant tell if there 's a difference . But one thing that is Anoying is that the pluging that gos to the sub is is to big for the cord . Along with a different sub as well . So it dosnt stay in very good . Overall I would n't recommend it . Especially the price .
 At around five dollars it was OK . There are a few pictures that can be edited in a photo editing software to make usable . Nothing dynamic or interesting about most of the photos . No where near 10K photos on this disc .
 I used for about 20 minutes and then it did not want to work anymore . Tried it on four different pcs.Too bad.Cheap is cheap !
 Will not work on my Windows 7 64-bit machine and unfortunately the Sabrent site does n't offer any help in regard to this either . This product may have been great a few years ago , and perhaps those for whom it works are simply using older technologies , but in my opinion if it does n't work with today 's technologies it needs to either be updated or discontinued .
 This item is just fine if you 're using SD cards , or micro-SD in an SD holder . But you can forget about mini-SD .
 This card did not work as a Writer . Worked OK as a Reader . Read SD and SDHC cards on both Mac and PC platforms using Cards that are known to read and write on other readers . Permissions on the cards appeared to be `` READ ONLY '' on both platforms . Tried moving the the `` lock '' tab on the SD and SDHC card with same no-write results . No software or downloads available to correct this problem . If you go to Sabrent.com , the card is listed as a `` reader '' only . Sabrant.com -- model
 I plugged it in to my machine . Windows made `` Chirp '' sound it makes when I plug in a flash drive , and the little green icon in the lower right showed up , that I click to removed the drive , and the J drive appeared in my Folders pane in Windows . But when I clicked on the J drive , I got an error message saying `` Please insert a disk into Drive J '' . Does n't work . POS .
 I purchased this item along with a 2GB SD card to use with my desktop computer . The desktop recognizes the reader but says there is no media . I took the SD card out and put it into my laptop 's built in reader and it immediately found the card and showed 2GB of free space . So the card is fine , but the reader is DOA .
 This was definitely not worth what I paid for it . It failed to work upon receiving . It feels flimsy , like it 's about to fall apart . It sounds like something is loose inside and rattles around . Spend your money elsewhere .
 had to return as it didnt work for SD card , first bad exp with amazon .
 I will be returning my Jwin JD-VD138 DVD player . The video is jerky , and the spoken tracks get a bit off from the video at times . This does not make the disks unwatchable , but it is very distracting . For one of the disks I tried , `` Head in the Clouds '' -LRB- ASIN B0006J27WO -RRB- , the menu cursor did not render although the menu worked if you counted the number of times you pushed the arrows.These issues were clearly the fault of the DVD player and not the disks or the rest of my set up . I have tried other players with the same disks , TV -LRB- a Zenith Z23LZ5R 23 '' LCD Widescreen , ASIN B0007MGCLM -RRB- , stereo receiver , and speakers . I always use the component -LRB- YCbCr -RRB- video and the digitial audio outputs . The Sony DVPNS75H DVD player -LRB- ASIN B000EDK8V4 -RRB- I immediately replaced this Jwin with has none of the problems I just mentioned . Of course the Sony is about $ 100 -LRB- 4x -RRB- more expensive , so I guess you get what you pay for.To be fair , my JWIN did `` work . '' It played every disk I tried . I had no problems with it not opening as others have . In the short time I had it , it never skipped . I would give it one star , but given how cheap it is , I give it two . It probably deserves 1.5 stars . Of course , I had it only a day before I replaced it , so I do not know if it would have broken in a month . Maybe it really deserves zero stars .
 Most people I know use a keyboard like Microsoft Ergonomic keyboard , or some other large keyboard . The pad that holds the keyboard will not fit this kind of keyboards , the large keyboard will have to rest on the wrist cushion.Also the mouse try will not accommodate standard a mouse pad easily .
 This is the most worthless piece of fecal matter I have ever bought . Nothing functions well . It 's like reading a bad book . No interactive elements . Totally Sucks .
 PROS
 This case came with 400 L series 2.8 lens.When you purchase a lens for over $ 7000 . One would expect Canon to at least provide a half decent case to protect your investment.REASONS NOT TO PURCHASE .1 / The handles are held on by plastic , very low quality fasteners . They will fall off in time . Hopefully not while you are boarding a boat . Both my handles have broken of from light carful use . .2 / All the padding inside the case will drop off . It is just a matter of time .3 / It is far too expensive for the piece of crap it is .4 / Pelican cases are less expensive , tougher and waterproof .5 / The low grade metal hinge WILL rust.You have spent far too much investing in a great lens . Get a good case and save yourself hundreds of dollars by not purchasing this overpriced piece of crap.Hope I was some help .
 I cant believe they are selling this thing . The pictures are blurred and do not have believeable color , much less actual color . Washed-out in high light , blacked-out in medium-low light . Worthless . Save your money .
 It 's like a plastic toy . There is no diagram with the manual to label the parts . Example
 How can you go wrong ? A camera that fits on a keychain , takes digital photos and works as a webcam AND a video camera . Sounds too good to be true . Well , in a way , this IS too good to be true but in another way , this little camera delivers what it says it does . So let 's run down the functions .1 . This is a small , box-o-matches sized camera that has a loop for a standard keychain . The camera is operated by a button on the front that switches function from snapshots , to PC-linked to taking a short . avi file for a video . There is no flash , of course . It 's all run on a single AAA battery . And no LCD screen , either . It 's plastic . Think
 It 's a cute little thing , but who wants to pay $ 25 for a cute little keychain bobble ? Put in a AAA battery , start it up , take one photo , and the battery is dead . But it does n't tell you the battery is dead , so you keep taking pictures , but they do n't get saved . When you go to download the photos , you find you 've only got the first one . At the cost of one AAA battery per photo , this has got to be one of the most expensive digital cameras on the market.Works ok as a webcam , but because its not really designed for that , you have to hold it in your hand to use it , so it 's more or less useless for that application too.Save your money !
 I got this for free and I feel cheated . Seriously , the only reason I 'd ever consider buying this is if I needed a single AAA battery and this purchase was the last source on earth .
 This Iomega HDD 250gb drive is a nice little drive that has both FireWire and USB connectors , and is sold at a good price . It works fine , and I 'm sure these minimal design goals were chosen so as to look good in magazine checkbox chart reviews , and upon cursory examination of the box by shoppers in stores.But here 's something the box and reviews do n't say
 We use this drive at work and i 've just ordered it 's replacement . The device constantly disapeers and you have to unplug the power and/or firewire cable to get windows to recognize it again -LRB- this has occurs on various computers -RRB- . It is also loud . The fan has now cratered and it sounds horrible . I have fixed it several times by blowing it out and applying oil , but eventually it goes back to sounding horrible . The only thing good about this drive in my view is the backup software that comes with it . What I have done , and what I suggest , would be ordering an external enclosure and a regular internal drive to go in it . That way if the fan breaks or the HD goes back you only have to replace one item . It also comes out being quite a bit cheaper .
 These headphones are pretty bad . The sound quality is bad . I 'm not real picky when it comes to sound quality and even I noticed how awful these were . Plus they have volume control on the cord , and my brother told me that it would eventually start to make static sounds , so I never used it hoping that it would n't get static-y but it did anyway and it did n't take long . If they were only $ 5 then i would say they were ok but for almost $ 20 no way . Try the wrap around your head Sony 's they are great and not too expensive .
 what the hell does your statement have to do with a review for headphones , and Im guessing you ment rapper not raper , although i wouldnt be suprised .
 I was under the impression that this was able to be used free standing . But it obviously needs components and that was not what I wanted
 I was a little disappointed . If you see a photo of these online or in a catalog they look kind of rugged and adjustable . Up close you 'll notice there all plastic and there is n't any adjustment for different head sizes . Who knows ? If you like to overdo it with bass and have a big fat head these might be a perfect fit for you .
 Bought the temperature probe , it worked fine for a few weeks then diedBasically a poorly made piece of junk
 It does not work . the temperature was off by 10 degrees . very dumb device . too much manual intervention . nothing automatic . too limited storage . no live data . after receiving the device and discovering all this , I went back and re-read the description - very misleading . Useless .
 I purchased this card for my Canon SD790 IS camera . A memory card error immediately appeared on the screen.I think i will stick to Sans Disk SDHC cards .
 I got a new camera and I have thought she was notworking because this brand new memory card wasntworking ... add few $ $ $ and buy san disc likeI did later
 The format of this SD card must be unique . My computer will not recognize it . My daughter 's newer HP desktop will read it . So I have to download on hers and put on a stick , then move to mine . Yuck . Dane-Elec website seems out of order today .
 Amazon lists this as a memory card for the Garmin Nuvi 500 . It is physically too big . Buyer beware -- do n't count on Amazon to know what accessories work with the products they sell .
 I ca n't honestly comment on the sound quality of these headphones , because I was so discouraged by the fit , that I have n't even tried listening to anything yet . The ` comfortable , no adjustment needed ' headband was such a sloppy fit that the ear cups hung nearly an inch lower than they should have at my ear . With shipping charges and restocking fee to the seller , I ca n't see that it will be worth my while to return them , but I was sure disappointed . Maybe they 'll fit over a hat , but do n't assume they 'll give you a comfortable fit just because you have an adult head .
 I had high hopes for this product but the buttons are noticeably cheap quality and the left click button stopped working after 8 weeks , just stays flat and does not pop back up . I contacted the company filled out the RMA form and have not heard from them for 3 weeks . No one answers the RMA extension or gets back to you . Then they want you to prove you returned it . You can quickly tell the company is Chinese owned as when someone finally answered they said R&D department and could not speak english and just wanted to switch the call without helping . They said to hold and when I got switched to the supposed RMA department I got a message that there was no one there to answer the phone , to leave a message . The company does not know the meaning of customer service and obviously the warranty is not something they take seriously . If the product fails dont count on the mentality that seems to pervade the company to stand behind the product . You are basically taking a gamble . If I had another problem I would not even try to return the product which is what I believe they are counting on . The amount of work , the amount of calls and time wasted makes this a very expensive product . Do yourself and favor and find a reputable company and dont bother with Adesso . Call the RMA department if you have any doubts you wont get anyone on the line . The product quality is substandard and the customer service non existent .
 I got this type of mouse when I started getting repetitive motion problems in my arm . One of my co-workers had one of these touchpads and raved about it . I 've had it on my home machine for about four months and I have formed some definite opinions .1 -RRB- It is not good for actions which require simultaneously holding down a button while dragging . The flat design makes this type of action ergonomically difficult . Simple , everyday actions like selecting lines of text to copy , choosing from drop-down boxes , resizing online maps , panning from side to side on photographs , etc. , become cumbersome . I have to do these things by placing both my right and left hands on the unit . A finger from my left hand holds down a button while a finger from my right hand drags . If you need to use graphics software like Photoshop , I would suggest you not even consider this type of mouse . You just can not get the level of fine control you need .2 -RRB- Because the mouse is flat and less than a half inch in height , you will need some kind of wrist rest which is pretty tall . My coworker uses a special bean bag to support her wrist .3 -RRB- Regarding the tapping motion on the touchpad -- it is really not so much how hard you tap that matters , but to let up quickly . It does require some learning and adjustment . If you share your computer with anyone else who is not as motivated as you are to learn the tapping motion , you will probably really annoy them .4 -RRB- Other types of mice have a more diverse list of options for programming mouse buttons than this one . For example , this mouse does not let you assign a button to be the `` Back '' button in a browser . As you shop for mice , pay special attention to the programmability of buttons and choose the one that offers what 's important to YOU .5 -RRB- As you are on the internet , your hand will likely hover over the touchpad because you will be poised to click on the next thing . Since it 's flat , you can not really rest your hand on it as you would a conventional mouse . So your hand has to remain dangling in the air , even if your wrist is supported . If your hand droops and you brush against the mouse ever so slightly , you will risk accidently clicking on something you did n't intend.If you are still intent on trying out this kind of mouse , I strongly suggest you borrow a friend 's for a couple of weeks , or buy one from a store that has an excellent return policy . Good luck .
 The product works as advertised , but , at least for me , it is even worse for wrist and hand issues than a conventional mouse . With a mouse , it is possible to rest your hand lightly on the mouse . With this touch pad , it is necessary to keep your hand suspended , since touching the pad -LRB- obviously -RRB- acts as a click . By adjusting the mouse settings in Windows , the degree of needed wrist action to use a mouse can be reduced to little more than with this touch pad . In addition , like touch pads that I have used on laptops , it can be a little inconsistent -- it seems like sometimes you have to whack it to get a response while other times just getting near it causes something to happen . As noted in other reviews , the buttons feel cheap .
 We purchased this device hoping that we could program left/right mouse buttons on the bottum and Page Up/Page Down on the other two buttons to the left and right of the touchpad . Our goal was to be able to navigate PowerPoint via the additional two buttons . The device is advertised as a 4-button touchpad . However , after installing and talking to Adesso support , I discovered that the drivers only allow you to program 3 buttons . If you only need 3 buttons , this is a great device . However , because it is advertised as a 4 button device , I am giving it only two stars .
 I have had to use the touchpad type mouse for years due to a pinched nerve , causing my hand to go numb.The old one , from years ago was far , far better than this one ! I guess they were bought out and the qualityis not so great . I can not make the software work with Vista . They made a simple thing more compliacted.I wish that my old one had not worn out and it would work with Vista . Please , someone come up with a REALLYgood touchpad mouse for a P.C.
 I wanted this larger , four-button version of Adesso 's touchpad . Unfortunately , it is not compatible with Apple computers .
 For the price tag this device has VERY poor construction quality . The plastic body so poor that the device came to me slightly warped . So now when I run my finger over the pad it constantly wobbles . My review would be at least 2 stars better if this device cost between 10-15 dollars . But at $ 54 this was a really bad purchase . As for the performance , it works just fine . The touch pad sensitivity is a little sloppy and given the small surface area this is causing me problems . It 's a shame that Apple get on board with a device like this .
 Does not work well that 's when it works at all . Maybe a faulty one , for the price I may order another one or perhaps not .
 These binoculars were a big disappointment . You ca n't see far or clear at all . I am sorry I made the purchase .
 not that great , cant view the objects clearly.Very less options for Zoom . Feels like waste of money.Can get better one for same/little more price .
 In my experience , Bausch and Lomb 's products , unfortunately , are very poorly made . . My 7-year-old cousin and I were unable to see the birds on our nature trip with these binoculars . We ended up having to pick up a pair of plastic binoculars at a nearby toystore -LRB- which worked much better ! -RRB-
 WOW , what a piece of junk these binoculars are !!! I 've had to return 2 different sets . The first set were about a week old and my husband went to pick them up and put them in his backpack to go on a trip , and the eye cup came right off in his hand . Amazon was great about replacing it . Now I 'm returning the replacement , because , within a week , the entire eye cup/focusing mechanism -LRB- so both eye pieces and the stem , etc. -RRB- came out of the housing . Both pairs had been treated properly , and never dropped . This is just shoddy workmanship . Bushnell used to be really good , but obviously quality control is no longer a factor or consideration . Perhaps because they are MADE IN CHINA ?????? At the same time , you get what you pay for I suppose . I 'll try an expensive set and we 'll see if they are in fact any better ; I suspect the lack of quality control is a larger issue than the price paid .
 These headphones suck . I regret buying them -LRB- bought them second-hand , and ca n't return them ... damn ! -RRB- . They are VERY uncomfortable . The padding around the speaker is insufficient , so the metal speaker itself presses hard against your ear . After 10 minutes they give you a headache . Plus , the reception sucks BIG TIME . Every time you move your head one way or the other you get shocked with static in your ear . Also , the range IS NOT what they claim . It may be 50-feet or so -LRB- NOT 300 ft. / 100m like they claim -RRB- . Do n't waste your money on these .
 These headphones were comfortable to me only for a few minutes at a time . After a few minutes , they felt too tight and pressing against the ears . It did n't seem the phones could maintain the reception . Maybe it was the enviroment in my office with all the office equipment but I was n't very happy . then , the band cracked after only about a month 's use . Perhaps my unhappiness caused me to apply too much pressure in adjusting them for the tightness . Regardless , I suggest trying other headphones before purchasing these .
 After reading mixed reviews , I purchased this product . It was to be used outside but was n't tried out until several months later . BIG MISTAKE ! I 'm sure the HAW300RF is as bad . If you turn your head , you lose the signal even well within range even in the same room ! Garbage !
 This product does n't work . Plain and simple , it does n't work.I have a plasma-screen HDTV with 2 component video inputs . I bought this switcher so I could hook up my DVD player and video game systems to the TV . After getting everything set up properly , I had problems . The picture on my TV basically did n't have any red in it . Everything that was supposed to be red was a sickly brown color.I happened to be in Best Buy a couple days later , and after going through about 4 people , I found someone who could explain it . He said the switcher probably did n't have enough bandwidth to adequately pass the HD signal , so it was dropping one of the colors . I ended up buying the Pelican Pro System Selector at the store , and I brought that home and it works perfectly . I highly recommend avoiding the JVC and going for the Pelican instead . It 's about $ 20 more expensive , and it requires an electrical outlet , but it 's a much better product . It has spots for -LRB- I think -RRB- 8 component inputs , digital audio inputs , and a remote , which can be programmed into your Harmony remote if you have one.I really just do n't understand how JVC can sell a product that just plain does n't work . The only reason it gets 1 star is because Amazon wo n't let me give it zero .
 I have a 53 '' Panasonic HD set which I bought 3 years ago and lost one of the component inputs ... So rather than repair it I decided a switcher would be much more useful , especially at these price points . I found the standard definition channels to slightly degrade with the switcher in place . Edges were no longer sharp and somewhat fuzzy . In 1080i mode I was actually seeing a signal compatability issue . I have a Motorola DVR provided by Comcast supporting 1080i to my PT-53TW53G set . I would get purple and yellow lines whenever we went into 1080i mode . I am betting since my Panasonic set was made in 2003 that there now might exist some compatability issues with the most recent 1080i products and the JX-S111 did not account for this ... This is just my un-expert opinion but I can tell you my experience was n't the greatest ... I packing this up to send back now .
 I bought two of these Christmas 2006 . While one actually worked for a while , the other ate and corrupted Data the second I put it in the camera and used it , getting progressively worse with every shoot , whether I used my little Powershot or my Minolta Dimage 7hi . The second one worked fine for a few months , but during its first exposure to high-volume and fast-paced shooting this past spring , it started to eat my photos , too . Now it eats nearly everything I put onto it , even when treating it as a pocket drive to transfer files between computers .
 I have used this card with an 8 MP DSLR for the past five months.It has been reliable , but memory writes to the card are too slow for anything other than studio or landscape photography.Actually bought four of these cards with the camera . Am going on a trip to France this fall , and will be replacing all four with faster cards before I go.Read the `` Technical Specs '' for this card . Write speed is NOT EVEN LISTED - that is a hint . -LRB- Tr&egrave;s lent , trop lent , aucun allez = Very slow , too slow , no go -RRB-
 The card failed after 23 pictures . Amazon credited me with a full purchase price credit to my credit card account .
 Instead look into CF1GB-40-278 -LRB- Lexar 40x -RRB- compact flash card . This one is Type 1 and slow as molasses . For about the same price the lexar card -LRB- which is Type 2 -RRB- is almost 10 times faster . If you are into digital photography with atleast 3mp cameras you need to skip this card and get a faster one .
 I Purchased two of these . VERY VERY disapointed when my BR-600 indicated the memory card is not compatable . I thought I was getting a steal when I ordered these , but now , I was the one robbed . I wo n't even ship them back or ask for my money back , because shipping alone will make this a `` NOT WORTH IT '' situation . So I 'm out -LSB- ... -RSB- . And back to looking for a compatable Memory for my BR-600
 Yesterday was the annual Thanksgiving sale day . I got this 1G CF card from Staples by $ 40 after easy rebate . With this price , I think it is a great deal . However , it worked for my digital rebel only half an hour before it was DEAD . All my photos in the card were lost . I am a graduate student majoring in computer engineering , I know how to recover data if a hard drive fails . But this time , I find I simply ca n't help . Fortunately , Staples have a good return policy and I just returned it without hassle . Hopefully , this is only my case . My suggestion
 There was a defect in the memory card that I purchased . I only found this out when I tried to use it in my digital camera on my vacation overseas , and it did not work .
 Of course as all things computer related , as soon as this was purchased the price dropped drastically . Unit works great but buy the 2 gig . More bang for the $ $
 My main problem with this Compact Flash is that the `` real-time '' performance is very slow . I bought it a year ago for my 5-Megapixel camera , and it makes me wait a long time before I can take my next photo . This gets frustrating when you miss good photo opportunities.Then , I read this article which reviews Compact Flash cards , and I realized that this particular SanDisk product line is inferior.The review at DP Review says this Sandisk writes at 6x -LRB- where ` x ' = 150 KB/sec -RRB- . I since then , have purchased a 512MB Transcend compact flash which claims to Write at 25x . My camera works much faster now . I have borrowed my friend 's IBM Microdrive and that is really fast too .
 I have used CompactFlash cards before , having great success with usage and loading to computer . BUT , I recently purchased the 1GB SanDisk card from Amazon , and am disappointed to report that it was defective . I lost over 150 photographs . It would not load my photos onto my computer , and in the camera 's LCD there were digital streaks/bands across the images.I exchanged this item for a new one , which had EXACTLY the same troubles . I am not sure if this was a bad batch , or if 1GB disks are not sophisticated enough yet . Again , I have used other type I/II cards without any problems whatsoever .
 I planned on using this in my PDA for music . Its slowness led to skipping and the more files I added the slower it got until it was unusable . I guess that 's why they do n't tell you the transfer rate .
 The fan built into this card was 10x louder than the two larger fans built into my media center pc . I could not bear to keep the pc on in my living room with this card installed . Unfortunately its past compusa 's unresonably short return period , and visiontek will not give me a refund either . These cards that are made for HD/media center must start publishing their noise levels or they are just trying to fool consumers into buying them . Had to go with a passively cooled card for that reason .
 It is not working right out from the box . Yes I got my refund back , but wasted 2 whole weeks just to order , wait , installed , and found out it is not working , then RMA argh ... Yes , Tiger Direct refund the amount minus shipping -LRB- to and back -RRB- . Next time I will buy from a local store it would had saved me time and some shipping money .
 The title of this review says it all . I bought this system from Best Buy . From the looks of it , it looks like a great system , with enough inputs to keep me satified with the equipment that I have to give me great surround sound . Those equipment are : - 42 '' 1080p HDTV - XBOX 360 - Playstation 3 - Nintendo WiiAnd now , thanks to this system , I got a 5-DVD changer Player . Ok , here it goes downhill.The speaker wires are CRAP . It 's not plug and play . Connecting the wires on the back of the receiver is crazy and so difficult . It 's like a screw and you stick the wire in , and then you screw it in again , but the wire is so flimsy that I have to do it again over and over again , very frustrating . And , oh my god , trying to hook all those equipment that I mentioned before into this reciever is such a headache.I followed the manual and hooked up the DVD player via HDMI cable , but since this receiver does n't give me sound when I use HDMI , I have to use a Optical cable , which I did . Not luck , no VIDEO , WHAT THE HELL !!!!!!!! . I do not want to use the Composite cable , which is crap . The composite cables work , NO VIDEO , it gives me the surround sound , but obviously it only gives me 2 channels and not 5.1 . I did n't buy a HDMI cable for nothing . Believe me , the set up is all correct . The only one that worked with this receiver is the PS3 , which is my BluRay player . That worked fine . I have n't tried the Wii yet , if you were in my position , you will be tired to get into that.My next grip is my HDTV . I have a Built in Tuner , so I watch HD channels . It 's a cable wire straight to the wall to the TV , but now how do I get surround sound with my HDTV is a puzzle that I have yet to figure out.After two days , I 'm so frustrated with this system that it 's not even funny . And packing this system is going to take me a day because the package is crazy and the box is HUUUUUUUGGGGEEEEEEEE . I 'm still why this system came with a DVD player when HD is the future , it 's nice , but ... why ?? Anywayz , not happy , I may after I get everything hooked up , but from the looks of things , it will take me awhile , plus the customer support has n't been helpful , bunch of people who do n't have technical reads back what I read in the manual , and I 'm standing there with the phone of my arse listening to these people who ca n't figure out why I ca n't even hook the DVD player that came with the system via HDMI . It could be because my TV is 1080p and the DVD only gives out 1080i , but if that is the case , than why is the PS3 working in full 1080p . Not to mention the DVD menu is like somebody drew it with crayons.If anybody can help me in the problems that I 'm having on how to hook up the equipment that I mentioned in my earlier review and maybe make me appreciate this $ 500 system , than please do .
 I just got the system , i connected it -LRB- i didnt like the connections of the speakers to the reciever , but what the hell . . -RRB- , and gues what i could only get like 100 watts of output i got the maximum volume and it would be right perfect for watching a movie , when it shouldnt it should be extremely hard at the maximum volume . I own a bose companion III for my computer and it would sound much more higher than this crap . i should have gone afther the bose .
 I 'm going to be brief . For the cost , they 're okay headphones at first . The `` headband '' is a little irritating at first , but you can grow to ignore it . The volume control is a nice feature for quickly turning down the music when a coworker complains . However , the problem lies in it 's durability . After approximately 3 months , the volume control casing split in two , exposing the small board and wires inside . Promptly giving it a quick fix -LRB- super glue -RRB- , it worked fine again . Another month or so after that , the wires on the inside of the cable started to split , causing nasty scratches in the music that continued to get worse , and worse , and worse . Now , this was in an office environment , not getting bumped around while jogging , flung around by kids , or getting eaten by the dog . Normal wear and tear.I would buy these again if my other option was sticking my arm in a woodchipper , but that 's about it .
 These headphones are uncomfortable . They 're not nearly as `` adjustable '' as one would expect . They do n't fit well behind the neck , and the volume control makes maximum volume available a fraction of what you 'd get out of your CD player/walkman . As - have I mentioned this yet - they do n't fit very well , the combination of poor fit and reduced sound output make these headphones a really poor choice . I 'm returning mine .
 Comfort is okay , but the audio is terrible . Even if I have my pc audio options maxed out , along with the volume control on the headphones , the sound is still very low . .
 Zero stars . This thing fell apart after a few uses , not very sturdy at all . This product is probaly outdated as new cameras come to the market .
 The quality of the pictures was great , maybe better than the ones I took with my 430EX . But the dream ended after only one Day . The unit did not fire anymore when attached to my Canon Powershot S5 .
 My grandmother always said `` Many times cheap is to expensive '' this is one of the samples . After 5 days using it , failed and never work again . . next time i will buy a better brand .
 I think the product would have been great if it was n't outdated already . It will only read SD cards up to 2GB which you can hardly find any more since they are all 4GB , 8GB , 16GB , etc. . You can find smaller SD cards on the internet for now but the way things are progressing , it would only be a matter of time before you would n't be able to get those either . Plus , that did n't help me because our office already had 3GB cards and up . Also , with the amount of money that they want for this DIGITAL machine , it needs to be updated to fit the capacity for which everything is going . So ... . with that being said , they need to figure out how that machine can read higher SD cards . Being an at home transcriptionist , I would have loved to have been able to stick in my SD card and go !!!
 As a previous poster already stated this unit only supports up to 2GB SD cards . Unless Philips releases a firmware update for SDHC cards or you have a large supply of 2GB or less SD cards stay away from this unit . Other than this major shortcoming , it 's a pretty good device .
 I have n't found the usability so difficult , and rather found it easy to use.Initially , I really loved this unit.Then , about 3 months later , it started having trouble , and has n't worked right since . Despite a month at the `` factory authorized '' service center -LRB- over half-hour away !! and only open inconvenient hours -RRB- , it still does n't work right . It wo n't even record at all now . I am bringing my device for the 4th time tomorrow . So right now I have a _ really _ expensive box that worth less than my VCR ... I 've read a lot of other positive reviews , but I wish I 'd never bought this thing now.Changing from 4 star to 1 star ...
 Panasonic is off my list , I will never buy another Pansonic product . After spending almost $ 1,000 on this purchase it stopped working in only two years . The estimated cost of repairs at the Panasonic service center was over $ 700 . Live and learn .
 After a lot of reading , and especially because of the premium price for this recorder , I slowly committed to purchasing it . Now I can confirm another reviewer 's comment about the poorly written manual and can add that Panasonic support is equally poor . It took the company 5 days to acknowledge my email requesting help with connecting the unit to a satellite receiver and answering basic questions about set-up . After 5 days of waiting all I have is an acknowledgment of my email but no answers to my simple questions . I 've had this expensive recorder for 2 weeks now and ca n't even watch a DVD video on it . If you plan to connect this equipment to a satellite receiver , you might want to reconsider .
 The unit is well made . The hard drive idea is great !! It only works with DVD-R disks and DVD RAM disks which kind of stinks , but hey , I can live with that . So how did Panasonic screw this one up to make it essentially worthless to me ? Well , read on ... The primary reason I bought this , and missed this nuance in the reviews/descriptions was that I wanted to time shift rented DVDs . I thought I would be able to back up a limited number of DVDs to the hard drive , watch them , and then delete them later to record another movie etc. . I did n't want to buy a DVD burner and have tons of DVD media hanging around , and the integrated hard drive seemed like just the ticket.Panasonic , in all their brilliance , blocked it . You can not copy a DVD , copy protected or not , to the hard drive unless it is a DVD-RAM disk . I can understand not allowing someone to copy protected material to another DVD , but to block it from copying to the hard drive makes the unit a dust collector . I went out and bought a DVD burner and use DVD + / - RW for time shifting my viewing now.Another negative is that Panasonic made it so the thing wo n't even play any DVD with a + in it . DVD + R or DVD + R/W , both of which work dandy on my other DVD player and in my comupter . So I have to have a separate DVD player to read DVD + Rs I burn with my DVD Burner . Lamo . I ca n't even use the thing as an expensive DVD player.This unit is just plain not worth the money unless you have a ton of VHS or taped material you want to move to DVD or if you are into video recording and want to copy that material to DVD . That it does well . You can also record unprotected DVD material through the analog inputs and edit it . And finally , you can use it to record TV shows to the hard drive or DVD , but I already had Replay TV which does a much better job of that.So , the lack of being able to send a DVD movie to the Hard Drive drops this puppy to 2 stars .
 I bought this unit based on information ... , which states the DMR E100HS 's ability to read images and video from analog VHS , DV connections , SD or microdrives etc. . . however all is not true , which I would have known sooner , if I had downloaded the manual.Basically the only way it can read MPEG4 videos on SD -LSB- not pc cards -RSB- is when the unit has actually written the file itself . It can only read JPEG-TIFF stills from pc or SD cards . The only way to import any video into the HHD for editing is by connecting VHS , S-VHS , or a direct feed from your digital camera , or TV.The unit it easy to work , and does a nice job with the DVD 's from VHS . You can also hook it up to your TV and record shows onto the HD.However , I would advise anyone interested in this unit to download the manual and read carefully so you undestand it 's limitaions BEFORE you spend the money .
 I have had one of these for weeks and have had Hell 's own time trying to get it to work with Win2K . When it is kind enough to let itself be installed , it stops woring when I restart . I got complex instructions from SanDisk support involving a registry edit and it failed again . Now they are telling me I need to use it with a powered hub . I bought one , and I will try it , but for now it is an expensive paperweight .
 Like the other reviewer our TV also took a long time to warm up/tune to other channels . We have had our tv for around six months and the thing is starting to die on us . When we try to change the channel or switch inputs on it we get black snow or a rollin screen . We have to turn the tv off for several minutes and as of tonight it is starting to lose the channel while on one straight channel . Very frustrating . Of course since it 's been six months since our purchase we have had to contact the manufacturer direct . Will be interested to see their response . ...
 Had to return my product . Would n't stay on to charge my nextar navagation system , it kept blinking on and off .
 Does not fit a 1994 geo tracker/suzuki sidekick . The stock connector for the radio is one piece , this product has three small connectors
 Its appearance is too bad . Its material is bad . Its not at all professional and bulky too . I didnt like it .
 The only good thing about this bag is the size . It is able to hold a large laptop and a few text books plus a few other little things . What is a turn down is the lack of water resistance . In one single down poor , water leaked into the bag and caused damage to the contents . One test book is completely water logged and the others have large amounts of damage . The customer service stinks . When I filled out their little comment/warranty form online , a massage said a reply would be sent within 2 days . It took them 5 . It 's been 2 days since I have responded to the reply , which did n't address my issue , and I have n't heard word from them . Once I return the bag to the store , I will look to buy from another company with a similar size of bag .
 I bought this bag for traveling . It is not very comfortable , the shoulder straps feel like they are filled with packing paper , and compared to similar priced bags the material is cheap . It looks great and has plenty of storage . I was replacing a 5 year old Targus Port Bag . Due to the edition of roller gear on the new port bags I decided to go with another bag . For my needs , I should have gone with a different company . Also to note is that the storage is great however , a fully packed bag will not fit in the over head bin of a smaller jet airliner .
 I 'm kind of disappointed , the seams are coming apart at the zipper . I 'm buying a new backpack , but not a Targus .
 This bag was too big . I needed a bag to transport my laptop to work and this was way too big for me . Maybe a college kid might like it more .
 I received this item torn and the seller didnt cover as much as they should for shipping -LRB- return -RRB- . I would NOT order from them ever again
 Pro ` sIt 's really roomy ... . ample room for my old brick of a computer Dell 15 '' inspiron 6800 and my tiny HP NC6230 . Good sized for overnight.Con ` sNo compression straps when you have a smaller load to carry.I ended up ripping the nylon on the bag accidently as it got hooked on the side of a gym locker . not as good as ripstop nylon.The zipper `` teeths '' are n't secure/strong enough ... the bag would separate at the zippers numerous times . Eventually , the zippers all broke loose in one night , even the separate zipper for the laptop .
 Good things about this backpack :1 . Plenty of pockets .2 . laptop protection is excellent as far as any drops or pressure . There are problems , though ... 3 . not awkward , standard feeling backpack.Cons :1 . Not at all waterproof . I ca n't emphasize this enough , it does n't keep water out at all .2 . Many of the pockets are weirdly sized , shaped and useless .3 . Main pocket has a strange cheap inner flap and I ca n't figure out the purpose of it.This backpack is worth 30 or 40 dollars maybe .
 The color is very off , looks like it has white on it , does not . And the grey looks green . Very frustrated with it but space is good in it . Just was really looking forward to white on it .
 Summary
 Though this backpack has ample room for what I needed to put in it , it 's construction is stiff and it is huge , no matter how much stuff you have in it - it 's like carrying a small child wherever you go . Also , the zippers are not the best quality - one is already totally broken and another on its way after only one year . The only plus is the separate laptop compartment - that is handy as I have a relatively large computer .
 It is a nice product , but do n't assume you will get the rebate without having to submit all your information more than once . If you use the rebate in calculating the cost , you are apt to be disappointed .
 DO YOUR RESEARCH ! Despite what the page says , this harness will NOT fit a 2004 GMC Envoy ! I was very disappointed - I had the harnesss soldered to my new head unit and ready to install , only to find out the hard way that I needed to purchase a different harness : - -LRB-
 There is no sound with Skype , I-movie freezes up and will not record . No available software downloads for this camera with OSX Lion . Total waste of money .
 Dont buy it from amazon ... . you can get it from the apple for for like 149 .
 Simply go onto the apple forum section of their site and you can see for yourself that actual users of the iSight are all having similar problems that I have also encounted . Oh , yes , it looks pretty and the picture is clear as anything . HOWEVER , you get a middle of the image distoration that makes anyone 's nose look twice its size and if you are conferencing with someone with an inferior connection speed or camera , they get flickered delayed images . But the biggest problem is that the wire that is supplied with the unit `` dies '' shortly after using . Even Apple suggests replacing it with a thicker one but at your expense . What you will get on your screen if you try to use the iSight is a warning saying that the camera is being used by another application . And Apple has taken the iSight off of many of it 's links pages . Seems in summary that Apple would like to sweep this one under the carpet and wish it had n't happend .
 This is a great camera , but does n't even come with any software ! Apple expects you to purchase a $ 30 program in order to use it for what it was designed for ?!? This is the ONLY webcam I know of that does n't include any software . That alone has cost it 4 points in this review . -LRB- ps . Since it 's a firewire cam , other software can use it , including some other videoconferencing apps , but you have to know what you 're doing , which makes this Apple product very user-unfriendly because of the missing software -RRB-
 I have to go with the thumbdown people.I bought an Isight on impulse , to use with my Mac . Looks very nice . Should have checked more carefully.So , to use it I need Ichat AV . OK , so another $ 130 later to upgrade to Panther , I have Ichat AV.Oh , only other Ichat AV users can talk to me . Do n't know any . Never mind I can use it as a webcam!Nope . My Mac is only 500mhz . Needs 600 . Sorry , you have a sexy looking piece of junk . It actually checks the processor , and unlike PC equipment , is n't even prepared to ` have a go and see ' . Alright , my PC running Win2k should see it . Nope . Crashes hopelessly.A few month collecting dust , I upgrade to XP - now I know it works.Nope . No drivers . XP generic driver gives a white washy useless picture , and as we know , no sound.Would love to hear from anyone who has overcome that problem , as it is undoubtedly a nice little toy , but for the money I wish I 'd gone for something less exotic.To be fair , Apples equipment though expensive , is slick and satisying . But the Isight is horribly let down by lack of software . Fast Mac users probably love it .
 -LRB- ... -RRB- I Chat AV ca n't talk to any other videoconferencing system , though , and Apple bundles none of the usual Webcam software with the iSight . You ca n't manually adjust the brightness , the color balance , the white balance , or the contrast . You ca n't snap still pictures with the iSight , use it as a video camera , or feed video to the Web . You also ca n't use the iSight as a surveillance camera out of the box . And despite Apple 's recent push for integration , iSight does n't feed into iMovie.here is third-party software for all of these functions , and the iSight worked well with half a dozen Webcam applications we tried . The iSight even plugs into PCs , where we used it with Yahoo! Messenger and NetMeeting . But on a PC , the microphone does n't work because it lacks a Windows driver -LRB- Apple says third parties are welcome to write such a driver -RRB- . If all your friends and colleagues sign up for iChat AV , the $ 150 admission price for an iSight might be fine with you . But given that the iSight costs more than any competing wired Webcam , we had hoped buyers would n't need to spend even more on third-party utilities to get full functionality .
 I have been a faithful Apple user for many years . Nothing as awful as this has ever been produced by Apple . The picture quality is terrible
 I loved the mouse . I loved the LED lighting . It was smooth and fit my hand perfectly . I loved the dual mode with the click of a button . But it lasted less than a year , and I 'm a moderate user at best - I do n't even game . So very , VERY disappointing durability . Especially for the money spent . I would n't recommend buying it .
 D-Link card will connect to a peer-to-peer network at home 80 % of the time on the first try . Connects to an open -LRB- non-wep -RRB- base station network -LRB- city-wide `` Cafenet '' wifi -RRB- with some coaxing.Connects to my work network -LRB- with wep -RRB- intermittently , at best . I do n't remember the last time I 've had such a frustrating experience . I done everything per D-Link instructions -LRB- i.e. if your software does n't work , disable Windows XP Wireless Zero Configuration -RRB- and still their software wo n't run . Windows will often associate with a base station but wo n't take a DHCP address . This card , on Windows XP , is an absolute nightmare - stay away . -LRB- I should mention it works on my wife 's Win2k laptop without issue . -RRB-
 Duration of Ownership
 Ok first of all if you ever want to believe any reviews , believe mine because I will tell it how it is and not in a cheesy goody two shoes way . I a tech crazy lover and this D-link dissapointed me . 1 . -RRB- The up to 108mbps is FIRMWARE as you will see in small print . Plan on calling their support to get the firmware downloaded because it is as easy as just downloading it and unzipping the file . 2 . -RRB- IT HAS NO SOFTWARE !!! That is like saying you do n't need a recovery disc for a computer . You know how many times technology crashes and having a disc rather than THE NET is a lot better . I was suprised to learn that the way to set it up was through the internet considering the fact that when you hook the device up it does n't know that you hooked DSL or Cable to it . Guess what , I was right . It took me a total of 4 days wasting my time and weekends just getting it `` up and running . '' The interface is confusing , the CD is for the manual you already have that comes with it -LRB- their stupid `` quick installation guide that is n't quick -RRB- , and you have to call D-link and spend hours floating around their phone lines till you get a level 95 technician . I also got the card which was another issue . When you get the 54mbps , supposedly you can get the firmware and get it up to 108 , but beware , the card ca n't do the same . Since it ca n't do the same , the two hardware 's ca n't work with each other making this an endless battle . D-link has ok support but you will spend forever trying to get it up and running . Plus I do n't think you can transfer files and truly network . I think you can only do wireless DSL and Cable which is stupid as well.Here is the best alternative I sware . ************* Microsoft ************ Yeah I was skeptical too . I have n't been the biggest Microsoft fan , but I will say that they got my vote . After this purchase I have a new respect for them . I am talking about the Microsoft BaseStation MN-700 . We are talking about $ same price $ and ** 10 min . setup ** . 10 minutes is all it takes to set up the laptops and computer . For those of you who have a built in wirless card , it will work with the Microsoft . It had many problems with the D-link . D-link would work for 30 seconds , then the net shut off . Then again , and again , etc. . Plus only one laptop was allowed on at a time with D-link . I call that useless . The basestation also allows you to print directly from a laptop to a printer wireless and transfer files from PC to PC . It comes with software and easy easy easy installation . It is fast . I am using it to write this review on my laptop.Go Microsoft . Do n't waste your time on D-link , there are better things to do . I heard Linksys , Netgear , and Belkin had problems . Netgear just has terrible support from what my next door neighbor told me . If you do go with D-link against my review , then do n't upgrade the firmware . Good luck : -RRB-
 I bought a `` matching '' DLINK wired/wireless router to go with this product -LRB- the DLINK DWL-G650 wireless cardbus adapter -RRB- . After spending three hours on my own and about an hour on the phone with tech support , I got absolutely nothing.The computer works just fine with the router when connected with ethernet cable . This wireless card did nothing though . Even though it said I had a 100 % signal strength , it would not communicate at all with the router . Sorry DLINK , your product does n't work and is being returned .
 This card would not work with the 624 router . I keep losing the connection and then the router would disappear from my list of available networks , while my neighbor 's network two doors down seems stronger than ever.Switched back to my old 22mbps Netgear card and the network has been stable so far . Not as fast , but at least it works and does n't drop me .
 I have a brand new compaq presario x1000 laptop -LRB- winxp -RRB- that this card -LRB- hardware version B3 -RRB- does n't work on using drivers 2.48 . The laptop is fully updated with all drivers and firmware , but this card still causes the touchpad to freeze and runs the cpu at 85 % utilitization for unknown reasons , except for some apparent hardware conflict with synaptics touchpad.The only reason this card gets 2 stars is because it does work on my old sony vaio fxa32 laptop running windows 2000 , but the best throughput i ever got was about 30mbps , even with the super-g router DI-624 -LRB- hardware version C -RRB- . Stay clear of h/w version B3 , which is stamped on the outside of the box .
 -LRB- + -RRB- Great price , high speed -LRB- - -RRB- HOWEVER before you buy this consider whether a cordless phone is used nearby . The DLINK card consistently drops connections when I use my 2.4 GHz phone even at 200 ft away . Yes , I should expect that due to the fact they use the same frequency but I NEVER experience interference with my 2Wire wireless card which was so much more reliant and is used at the same location . The DLINK card keeps dropping connections when the phone is used . It is incredibly frustrating and I am going to consider returning it.Third DLINK product I 've bought , third satisfactory result from them . I 've also used a total of 6 wireless cards and 3 wireless routers/access points . Although DLINK is n't at the bottom of the heap , it sure has n't performed at the top . Checkout 2WIRE -LRB- hard to get retail -RRB- or Netgear 's equipment .
 From looking at the D-Link website and talking to five tech support staff , it appears that there are countless versions of this card , each with different driver software . The one I got came with a CD with the wrong drivers . With tech support , I finally found the 8 mb driver file I was supposed to download . However , they did not provide any instructions on how to install the new driver . The normal `` automatic '' approach did not work . And their instructions did not match the screens I was getting on Windows XP SP 2 . So I called back again . And again . And again.Despite being given a case file , each time I was asked the same questions , including what , exactly , is wrong . And each time I was told to do the same thing
 This card worked OK for about a week , then I started receiving the dreaded BSOD error nearly every time I used it on my Sony Vaio . I tried troubleshooting the problem for hours , even going so far as to reinstall Windows , but nothing fixed it . It just seemed to happen randomly , with no rhyme or reason . After finding out that others had the same issue with different hardware , I concluded that the card was simply a piece of junk . Stay away from this product unless you want to deal with the hidden horrors of D-Link 's atrocious drivers .
 Had to return it . Absolutely would not work with Compaq Presario . Some sort of conflict with one of the chipsets . Purchased a NetGear card and it worked like a charm .
 I have had nothing but trouble with this product . no matter how many times i have dowload new , or older , drivers , the installation is never complete . their help desk neither has been able to provide with any help to this problem -LRB- though they have tried -RRB- . i will not spend money on another dlink product .
 I bought the DWL-G650 card -LRB- Version B4 -RRB- along with the the 624 Router -LRB- Version C1 -RRB- a few days ago . The installation was very easy . The install guide was the best I ever read.Only one problem , it did n't work . For some reason , I could not get a signal on my laptop with the DWL-G650 card . Several calls to D-Link did not solve the problem . Though the D-Link people are great and their e-mail service is also great , I still could not hook-up . D-Link told me to send the product back to Amazon since they believe it is either a bad router or a back card.I 'll change the star rating once I get this product to work . But it deserves at least 2 stars for the great install guide and the helpful people at D-Link . UPDATE
 I wasted two weeks trying to use this as directed , along with the DI-624 wireless router . I selected the WPA-PSK encryption format for security and found that it worked from 5 minutes to 2 hours at a time . Same thing with the old and fairly INsecure WEP encryption format . I emailed and phone D-Link 's tech support line and got responses that did nothing to help in any way . I spent weeks researching and reading ratings penned by numerous others to choose what should have been the best wireless networking gear for my environs only to find D-Link 's products a miserable failure , backed up by mediocre , faltering tech support .
 I 've been trying to get this thing to run for several months now , and it 's just not cutting it . Problems accessing multiple access points -LRB- corrupts driver , results in blue screen of death - nice debugging , Dlink - * not * -RRB- , weak signals , and a hopeless implementation of encryption protocols - basically your choices are
 I decided to replace my DI-704P wired network , which I had no problems with but just wanted wireless with my notebook . So bought the DI-624 along with the DWL-G650 . I live in a two story house . In the room with the router the reception was excellent -LRB- I used Netstumbler and Cirond WiNc -RRB- , but in the next room signal strength dropped to 75 % , 50 % in the third bedroom , downstairs 25 % and outside under the bedroom with the router 15-20 % . These numbers all seemed low . So I replaced both units with the same results . However , the story has a happy ending ... . Again , I replaced both units but with the Netgear WGR614 router and the WG511 notebook . All I can say is D-Link has `` POOR RANGE '' . With the Netgear setup - signal strength was above 75 % anywhere in the house and outside opposite side as the router it was still 60 % . The D-Link units need work ! In addition , with SSID broadcast off and the WEP at 128bit the D-Link card could not find the network . Netgear had no problems . I found this review of the Netgear WG511 on Cnet 's website . It shows the Throughput/Performance of 5 different cards including the D-Link and Netgear cards -- http://reviews.cnet.com/4505-3251_7-21056546.html?tag=txt -- Hope this helps you make an informed decision .
 installation was simple on my IBM T23 running W2k and I was up running in no time and getting good range & performance . after 6 mos , i upgraded firmware on my DI-624 and driver for the G650 and the G650 has been problematic ever since - it hangs my PC until I pull the card out . As others have noted , D-Link support didnt want to acknowlege the possibility that the card was bad . I 'm at the point of chucking it and trying another brand . I have no such problems using an Orinoco-based `` b '' setup while I am at work .
 After seeing good reviews at Amazon I purchased both the D-Link DI-624 router and the DWL-G650 PC Card . I upgraded the router firmware to 2.28 right away , and upgraded the G650 driver to 2.46 to get 108 Mpbs and WPA-PSK . The router seems to be OK , but the G650 gives me nothing but problems . I found that if my PC suspended , when it resumed the WPA pass phrase would be lost and I had to reenter it . Sometimes , I could n't get connected to the net even though the D-Link utility showed I was associated , and ipconfig / renew did not get me a DHCP address . I 've rebooted numerous times . I 've installed the newer 2.48 driver fix which caused me not to have wireless connectivity at all , so I dropped back down to 2.46 . I had to give up on WPA-PSK and use WEP 128 , and the only reason I bought this combination was to get WPA support . I spent hours and hours tinkering with this -LRB- in fact , days and days ! -RRB- and I wish I purchased a different brand combination of router/card -LRB- even though the DI-624 seems OK , I 'd prefer a single-vendor wireless solution -RRB- . After having the above problems with my IBM Thinkpad , I 'm trying a second G650 in my Dell Latitude C640 and I 'm having similar problems . Today , however , after having removed the G650 for a day and plugged it in again , I ca n't get the PC to boot all the way . Removing the card lets it boot . If I try to insert the card after boot completes , the system hangs completely . I 've removed and reinstalled the G650 drivers in an attempt to get a workable Dell . No luck . The one good thing I can say is that when the G650 is working , it gives me great coverage . I 've been able to roam anywhere in my two-story 4-bedroom home and stay connected to the net . In toto , though , I wish I stayed with Linksys , my previous wired router vendor .
 I bought one of these last week brand new , and will probably have to return it . The 108Mbps is great , but the card crashes my machines frequently . I have two toshiba tablet PCs , both freshly installed with Windows XP , and the card bluescreens either one at least once a day . It also often simply quits working , and requires a reboot to detect my d-link access points again . On install with the very latest drivers , it complains that the drivers are not signed by Microsoft , which should be a warning . They seem to be very crappy stability , these would never sell in Japan .
 All of my wired networks are with Netgear products and I should have stayed with them . A local electronics store was having a sale on D-Link products , and I wanted to go wireless , so I figured I 'd give them a shot . I did a little research on the Internet with OK reviews for this card -LRB- apparently for the `` A '' & `` C '' versions -RRB- and the DI-624 router , which I also have . Everything worked fine until I got the latest windows ME updates and now the card does not work at all . I tried both both the drivers that came with the card -LRB- v. 2.23 -RRB- and the latest -LRB- 2.48 -RRB- , but I can not connect to any wireless networks -LRB- and I 've tried many -RRB- . It turns out that I got stuck with the `` B '' version of the card , which a lot of other people are having problems with . I 'm just hoping I will not have to replace both the router and the card , although my friends have been able to connect to my routher with other cards without any problems . Needless to say , I just ordered a new Netgear wireless card and I am not expecting any problems . My current Netgear wired PC adapter is nearly 5 years old and I have never had any problems with it .
 The product may perform up to your expectations but I only hope you never have to interact with D-Link 's support organization . After dealing with conflicting , contradictory and completely erroneous information from their support organization , I have come to the conclusion that I do n't care to do business with D-Link again.I hope that if you do buy a D-Link product it works flawlessly -LRB- which mine did not -RRB- , and you never have to call their tech support organization .
 The card itself is more or less OK . Works with Windows 2000 and D-Link DI-614 + router.However , the software which comes with the card , AirPlus -- to find a network and configure the card is pretty bad . One has to be logged in as an administrator all the time to use it . If you have pre-configured a profile for a particular network -LRB- having logged in as an administrator -RRB- , the card will work when you are logged in as a regular user . However , there is no way to see to which network you are connected , what is the signal strength or if you are connected at all!This is on top of the fact that the software is shipped on a CD with a virus -LRB- Dropper.Netbuser.A in autorun.exe file -RRB- . Yet the hallmark of D-Link is its tech support
 When using this card my laptop freezes without any apparent reason . Sometimes it freezes immediately - sometimes after hours of use . All I can do is to reboot the laptop.Sent the card to D-Link and got a replacement but it still would n't work . Updating drivers does n't help either .
 Just like the title says . I am using Windows XP and I still needed the drivers to install the device , no problem . I do n't recomend the software that comes witht the card , it just plain SUCKS ! I also have the DI-624 wireless router by DLINK.I do n't recommend using WEP or anyother encryption . Instead , set filters to only allow known MAC address to access the network , others wise do n't expect to exceed 15-25 feet indoors.Plays well with other wireless networks , both 802.11 b/gBeware with the different Hardware Versions . I have the lastest which is B2 . -LRB- makes me question why they make revisions ? -RRB- I since made some changes thaT allows it to work beyond the 15-20ft . Here it goes : TX rate
 Did not work till I update router firmware to the latest one ; Using DWL-650 + I am able to get 22Mbit but with this one -LRB- DWL-G650 -RRB- getting only 11Mbit ; Have tried on IBM Thinkpad 600X with Win2000 and Sony VAIO Win XP pro and somewhat not always can get connected ; will use for few more days to see stable performance otherwise will return ; DWL-650 + looks better choice -LRB- for me -RRB- .
 I bought the DWL-G650 card -LRB- Version B4 -RRB- along with the the 624 Router . THe router was easy to install and configure . Work great.But this card was a pain . I have HP laptop with windows XP properly updated to the lastest service pack.Windows was complaining about that the drivers was not `` Windows logo testing '' certified ! Even with the latest D-Link drivers ... So , everytime I reboot my machine ... windows asks me to re-intall/configure everything ... totally unacceptable ... Let 's be positive ... of course , I got this card running ... it works great . . but I could not fix the problem above ... I did n't want to call customer support as well :--RRB- ... I tried a Netgear card after ... was working without any problems .
 There 's a reason why this card is so cheap and offers a rebate . It will waste endless hours of your time getting it to work.The people that gave this card good reviews either -LRB- 1 -RRB- are not using encryption , or -LRB- 2 -RRB- do n't have revision B of the card.I started out with the original drivers under WinMe . But I was frustrated because it would never remember my encryption settings . Also , I wanted to experience the much-touted `` 108Mps '' , so I downloaded the latest drivers . After that , nothing worked . The new drivers are complete junk . I 'm a software professional , and I spent about 24 hours over the last 3 days trying to get the updated drivers to work.I 'm currently using the old driver and the newer Utility -LRB- which you use to set it up and see what speeds you 're getting -RRB- . It 's unbelievable that such a well-known and well-respected -LRB- ? -RRB- company as D-Link would put out such a bad product . The hardware may be good , but it 's useless without decent drivers.Pay the extra money and buy a better card . I wish I had .
 Dlink does n't support WPA-PSK very well with Windows XP . If you are considering using this format , I recommend using another card . Or , you can use the built in Windows XP drivers -LRB- after upgrading using Windows Update -RRB- and bypass the Dlink utility altogether . This works , but you loose the ability to use the Turbo mode on the card.Dlink support is slow and it appears that it takes them many months to fix bugs in their drivers . Once they release new drivers , they also frequently have bugs . Maybe they will get it right one day , but I do n't have any confidence in their support today .
 I had the chance to purchase a B but decided to ride the NEW edge and get the G650 -LRB- Oct 2003 -RRB- . But when I plugged it in , it would not connect up to the LinkSys Router A/B . I had a friend try it at his house which was using the D-link of another version , and mine would not work on his PC either . He reloaded drivers even , no dice . He put his existing card back in and loaded fine . I returned mine . Second one , junk condition from D-Link considering mine was mint having never been used in a working mode ! It gave me a different error altogether . I had a co-worker try it on his laptop with WIN98 , but it did n't work there either , we tried various drivers . I then got a laptop with WIN2000 and it could n't load it either . Returned this one 2 days ago . Hopefully my next one will work ? The co-worker was using yet a newer version of D-link G650 , which had issues also . I really am sorry I did n't go B at this point in time . I only hope d-link will come through with try 3 .
 I bought the g650 with the DI-624 router . It was a disappointment . I could not get the card to see the wireless network , after having followed the installation instructions step by step . After much fiddling I found out that doing exactly the opposite of what was said let me connect to the router , after all . That is , disabling the `` utility '' and using windows to configure the wireless network . After that , despite getting the card to work , I was disappointed with range , speed , and reliability of the signal . I use Win XP Pro , and maybe the software problems are specific to this version . Anyway , the other card I have -LRB- TrendNet -RRB- works much better , even with D-Link 's own router . And just as the last drop , the indicator lights are far too big , and keep blinking all the time , what is enerving and distracting . Ah ! They do not work as described in the manual ... As a result of all this , including not being able to get all my house covered , I 'm back to my blue wires ...
 Did not install properly . DLInk customer services was not one bit helpful . Drivers have not passed Microsoft 's scrunity . I can not recommend this at all .
 I just puchased this item . After installation , my regular ethernet connection stopped working . It took many hours and a system restore to get it back into place . While using the wireless , my computer would sometimes lose the connection and could not be reconnected without rebooting . I am using Windows 2000 , so perhaps XP users have a better time , but I ca n't recommend this product . I 'm returning it and purchasing another brand .
 I bought the card because I had heard that D-Link had good customer support -- what a mistake -- after waiting on hold forever a hopeless technical support person says there must be `` some sort of hardware conflict '' and I should call my laptop maker . When I asked was n't there anything he could suggest -- he suggested returning it -- which I will .
 Install went smooth on my W2K/dell inspiron notebook . Everything worked fine for 24 hours then it just stopped . Worked with customer support for about an hour getting nowhere . This thing is junk . I 'm sending it back .
 I got this wireless card because I wanted to try to find one with a broader range than the one I currently have . This one seemed to be able to do the job , so I ordered it here on Amazon.After installing the software and inserting the card , my laptop completely froze . Restarted my computer and tried again and again and again . Each time , the card froze my laptop . I even uninstalled then reinstalled and tried some more ... no luck.It could just be some sort of incompatibilty with my particular laptop , but I highly doubt it . I think its much more likely that this wireless adapter is a piece of junk .
 Wow , I ca n't begin to tell you how absolutely terrible D-Link products are ! Bad , Bad , Bad ! I purchased a D-Link DWL-G650 Wireless Cardbus Adaptor for my Dell notebook running XP professional . I also purchased a D-Link DI-524 wireless router . I can tell you the `` D '' in D-link stands for `` Do n't work '' !!! First , the router has terrible transmission problems . I barely get a signal one room away , and it will flip from `` excellent '' to `` poor '' reception constantly . I also get kicked off about every 30 minutes . It does n't work at all more than 25 feet away.Second , the wireless card has a lot of difficulty connecting to the router . It takes anywhere from 30 seconds to 4 minutes to acquire the signal . I also had huge problems trying to use other networks while on the road . I developed a problem where I would try to connect to a network and my computer would completely crash ! I would get a message saying something like

 Okay these things are probably obsolete already but do n't buy one ! I bought this years ago and ended up throwing it away a few weeks later . It kept crashing my computer . I bought an internal card and it has been excellent .
 After three frustrating months owning this wireless card and trying to get it to work with my Inspiron 4000 , I am giving up . It has never worked properly , even siting right next to the base station . A lot of the time the card is n't even recognized by the computer as being in the slot . This is documented by D-Link as a problem with Texas Instrument-made slots , which the Inspiron has . Unfortunately D-Link 's customer service is so poor that you get a different answer each time you call . And then the solutions are something like `` reinstall your operating system , '' even though there is a documented problem with the hardware . Do n't buy this for use on an Inspiron 4000 !!
 I had no problems installing the drivers for this card when I bought it . Excellent signal strength , fast speeds . It decided to stop working about 6 weeks later . I have tried getting help from D-Link support and it has been no help . I have been unable to reconnect for 3 weeks now , and D-Link refuses to accept that it might be a problem with their product . My first contact with tech support was rude and patronizing . The second contact directed me to download a `` new '' driver from their website -- a driver which was older than the version that came with the card ! The third , fourth , and fifth contacts were no help either . I 've given up hope . Do not buy this card unless you have a lot of time to fix their bugs . -LRB- I 'm running Windows Me with a Toshiba PXC1100U cable modem and the D-Link DI-624 wireless router . My roommate has no problem connecting the router with his XP & Centrino-running laptop -RRB- UPDATE
 This is the worst 802.11 g card out there . Apparently , there are three versions -LRB- batches -RRB- of this card and the people stuck with version B are in for a major ordeal . Basically , they -LRB- D-link -RRB- have updated the driver 4-5 times and everytime they ix one bug , another pops up . I have had this card for about two months now and everytime I switch WiFi netwroks -LRB- home to school -RRB- , the card goes crazy and hangs my laptop . After that , everytime I restart the machine , I get the infamous blue screen and the laptop hangs . If I remove the card , the machine boots up perfectly . This is usually followed by me reinstalling the driver and getting pissed-off . The bottom line is that if you get this card , make sure that you get version A or C.I 'm not making this up ... see for your self at the D-link website -LRB- they only have 1 driver for version A and C while version B has 4-5 updates -RRB- . Also , just type `` D-Link DWL-G650 '' in google groups and you 'll see at least 100 posts about the same problem.By the way , I 'm getting the Linksys card . I have their router and WiFi game adapters and everything works the first time !!
 I had a good experience with a previous DLink purchase , so I chose DLink again and bought DI-624 and DWL-G650 this October . I upgraded both firmware and enjoyed 108MB connection for over a month without any problem.Then , first the router stopped working -LRB- It rebooted every 5 minutes or so -RRB- and was replaced . We had another fine week before the card started losing connection this time ; The signal strength became weak and often goes to no-connection . -LRB- We have another wireless card from Lucent which is working fine , so the router is not the problem . -RRB- I called the tech support and got the following recommendations : * Disable super-G because super-G is unstable ; * Do n't update Windows because the latest Microsoft virtual device driver does not work with this card ; Talk to Microsoft because this is a Microsoft problem ; * Do n't move around ; * Do n't use a wireless phone with the same frequency ; Neighbors ' wireless phones can also interfere ; * If you do n't like these recommendations , just return it to the store because we ca n't do anything about it.I followed their recommendation and returned it to the store .
 Installation was quick but signal range is extemely poor . Unless you want to work in the same room or floor the signal will be single to two bars max . I am also losing internet signal every 30 minutes or so . Now I have purchased belkin from circuit city with two antenas -LRB- forgot the model # -RRB- and things are perfect .
 Spent hours of time with my ISP and D-link people . Simply cant stand a conection for longer then 2 hours ...
 First I have to say that this is by far one of the worst products I have ever dealt with -LRB- and I am an IT guy -RRB- . I have worked with various vendors ranging from 3com to Cisco -LRB- including Linksys -RRB- and DLink missed every opportunity to create a return customer . I guess the best place to start is with technical support ... Tech support is quick to give up on trying to fix a problem ... First I was talk about another device I bought -LRB- 810 wireless bridge -RRB- which I wanted to use to connect my Xbox to my old Linksys 802.11 b router/AP . After a few tries I could n't get the two devices to connect and I contacted tech support ... They were quick to discredit my idea to getting the two devices to communicate and told me to return the item . I knew these devices could communicate because they could see each other and all I needed to do was some additional configuration -LRB- which I figured out on my own -RRB- . This also continued with my purchase of my 624 . I would call them and they would have no idea about how to fix the problem and have me send it back -LRB- I had to pay the $ 10 in shipping -RRB- . I only sent back the product once because the new device always had the same symptoms -LRB- I will talk about them next -RRB- . The product!The product quickly worked out of the box , but seemed to reboot -LRB- all connections -RRB- every few hours . I was busy at the time so I just dealt with the discomfort because the G was soooo much faster ! -LRB- I never did get the extreme to work ... -RRB- Well 6 months later it was rebooting every few minutes and I would have to either disable/enable the wireless connection or reboot the client machine . I then tried to install the latest firmware -LRB- making sure I backed up the config file -RRB- , well the router lost all configurations -LRB- and I have a lot of them -RRB- which I thought was no big deal because I had that file ... Well the file did not work ! Then after everything was back up the router continued to reboot every few minutes so I contacted DLink . They quickly gave me an RMA and shipped out a new unit -LRB- which had a crack in the plastic when I received it and there were no physical marks on the shipping box ??? -RRB- . This new device continued to reboot so I installed the latest beta firmware from the site which made the problem even worse . Contacted DLink to see what the problem was and they gave me static for putting on the new firmware -LRB- which they did n't know existed -RRB- and had me bring the router back to the older firmware . My question is why put the firmware up if you do n't want users to test it out to see if it fixes the problems . Anyways DLink had me return it again and then I requested my money back because I had already blown hours and hours of my time with this product and it really does n't seem to perform ... AT ALL ! My request was denied -LRB- big surprise right ? -RRB- and I went out and bought a Linksys router which rocks ! So to upgrade from b to g I ended up spending twice the amount of money because I had to buy two routers and pay for the shipping to return the original broken router . So my advice to you is to buy only Linksys , or Netgear -LRB- which my friends seem to like -RRB- . There is no reason why a company like DLink should continue to exist!BTW this device would reboot regardless of the network load , or if there was any interference from other wireless devices running at 2.4 Hhz -LRB- like phones -RRB- .
 Like so many other reviewers on this site , I 've had nothing but problems with this router . At first , I had to manually reset or reconfigure it once every other week or so . I made perhaps five calls to customer service , and while they always managed to solve the problem , each call took anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes , and the customer service agents always used different procedures and settings to restore functionality , leaving me helpless to figure out what was really going wrong . -LRB- I 'm a fairly tech-savvy person , but this problem was beyond me . -RRB- After the router began to reset more and more often , I did some research on the product -LRB- why did n't I do this first ?! -RRB- and discovered that I was far from being the only lost soul using this product . I 've never seen so many frustrated reviewers for one product . And now that my router needs to be reset , literally , two or three times per day , I finally ca n't take anymore . I 've been down to my basement and stood there for five minutes in the cold , waiting to power-cycle the % & * # thing about a hundred times too many . -LRB- As someone who works from home , I need my internet . -RRB- So I 'm starting D-Link DI-624 Anonymous , or DIA . It 's a simple four-step program.Step 1
 Works for about 3.5 minute intervals then disconnects . This product is the worst ever . Do n't waste your money . Replaced with a Linksys , now wireless network NEVER disconnects .
 I do n't know about the other reviewers writing good reviews , but I 've had the router for almost a year . I 've been having many problems with the wireless -- very slow speed , intermittent disconnection and even spontaneous reboots . I 'm tech savvy and have tried different settings to no avail . I have wasted much time trying to fix the problem.A month ago , I decided that I could n't live any longer with the frequent connection drops , and had it exchanged by D-Link . The old router has firmware v2 .76 . The new one has v5 .00 . I still get serious wireless problems with the replacement . The wireless connection often becomes very slow for no good reason , while at the same time , the wired connection still looks good and has good bandwidth . Given that what I have is a v5 .00 replacement , I think this product is beyond redemption.Given the numerous complaints about the wireless connection , that D-Link gave me a replacement that does n't really fix the problem does n't reflect well on them , either . I do n't think I 'll buy D-Link ever again , but if they pay me to give their product so someone I hate , I might consider .
 The worst piece of hardware I 've ever bought ! Even having the latest firmware in it , it just wont work right . Keeps lagging the connection and now D-link has discontinued the product . Just do n't buy it . Buy something from linksys instead .
 Out of the box my router never worked 100 % correctly . It would not keep the correct date and time , some functions did n't work as described . I was told to update the firmware , but when I did , the new firmware introduced new and worse problems , so I stayed with the old firmware and its problems for over a year . When I finally decided to go to the latest firmware , it was a disaster . It filled my inbox with logs of TWINGE Attacks . I contacted Comcast and was told by them that they have only had complaints of this problem from D-Link users . They tried to set up a conference call with D-Link , but it did n't succeed . D-link was unable to deal with the problem and said they would replace the router . But the RMA department would n't do it until more trouble shooting was attempted . The tech who was supposed to do it could n't deal with it and escalated to level 3 . The Level 3 tech asked me to send some of the logs , which I did . I never received a response to that -LRB- sent 8/28/07 -RRB- . When I received no response , I sent an email asking why , but received no response to that.Sept 18 I contacted D-Link again and was sent to a Level-2 person who then processed the paperwork to allow an RMA , and one was issued by the end of the day . When I read all the rules and procedures for the RMA I felt it was not worth the cost of postage to go any further . This is not a company I want to do business with . I 'd rather go buy a new router from another company with better products and support .
 Works good on short distance but not for the long haul . 30 foot ok 50 I would n't count on it .
 I 'm terribly disappointed with this router . It reboots whenever there is interference due to a cordless phone , causing all connected devices -LRB- including those using an ethernet cable -RRB- to lose their connections . It `` forgets '' about machines on the network , seemingly at random , so you have to unplug the router and plug it back in to get your network connection back . And the static DHCP that 's supposed to be in the latest firmware does n't seem to work at all . When I enabled it , it refused to give the static IP address to the machine I selected .
 The router starts rebooting over and over after I initiate a file transfer between two PCs over my network . It works great if you do n't plan to transfer files over the network -LRB- which defeats the purpose of a home network -RRB- . Upgrading the firmware to the latest version 1.25 did not help and neither did my two calls to their tech support .
 I bought d-Link 624 yesterday . - Could n't get it to work . Their advertized 24/7 tech support is a hoax . There was no one there . So bought Linksys instead . The last box in store , which was a good sign . I was up and running in few minutes . Linksys works like a charm . I was glad I had a choice .
 I consider my self to be an advanced computer user with very good knowledge of hardware and networking equipment setup . This is an extremely bad product by D-link . This router performed completely opposite to what it is advertised ... I am surprised that it was CNET Editor 's choice . I used this router to share a cable modem with 3 wired PC 's and two wireless laptops . One laptop had Cisco Airport Wireless adaptor and other had D-Link Xtreme G , DWL-G650 adaptor.Following were the problems I had with it :1 . The setup procedure does not help .2 . The wireless and wired network could not communicate with each other or simultaneously .3 . Wireless network was very difficult to setup .4 . The speed was hardly 54Mbps , but mostly just above 11 Mbps which is 802.11 b. 5 . Range was very poor .6 . Wireless network encryption does NOT work and could work only without it .7 . Does NOT work with other Network switch , u must connect PCs thru ' router 's switch .8 . I upgraded the firmware also but could not get advertised 108Mbps speeds inspite of using D-link DWL-G650 adaptor .9 . To top it all router reboots very often ... almost once every hour .10
 I chose D-Link because of their customer support 24/7 for the life of the product . I have gone through 2 DI-624 . DSL and Cable Modem -LRB- Road Runner -RRB- . It keeps DROPPING THE SIGNAL . From reading another review , its true that the firmware updates are what kills this router . Each update creates new problems . Everyone tells me to use Linksys and I am getting one now ... PS I have used D-Link for over 3 yrs !
 This unit is terrible , its poorly made , cheap does not work well with Macintosh computers and the tech-support is terrible ! The tech support - barely speaks english , is difficult to understand and the phone connections are awful - made me wonder why they even offer tech support . Trust me this is not a good product .
 I have both a D-Link Di-624 and a Linksys router . The Linksys has been rock solid for three years.The D-Link 's hardware is OK , but the company has awful track record with its firmware . With the DI-624 , none of the firmware above 2.50 works reliably , and every new version brings a whole host of new problems . If you are security concious and intend to secure your wireless network , I will not buy D-Link . They need to get their house in order.Just do a search on DI-624 and firmware , you will find numerous problems with the code . Including a number of DHCP problem -LRB- your wireless device will take an extremely long time to get an address -RRB- , frequent reboot -LRB- which cause the connection to drop -RRB- , SSID broadcast can not be disabled , etc. . . If you have wireless turned on , you can not stream music due to the frequent reboot . Do n't call your DSL or cable modem company for help , it is not their fault , it is the D-Link . Firmware 2.5 -LRB- two years old -RRB- works reliably but without current security features , and it is no longer available on their website for download . If you buy the router new and experience the above problems -LRB- most likely you will have firmware 2.7 -RRB- , and can not get a copy 2.50 firmware . Return it , exchange will not do you any good , as it is not a hardware problem .
 There 's a good reason this router is so cheap . I agree with the other reviewers who have noticed that this router frequently either reboots itself or hangs and requires the user to unplug it and plug it back in . Even the firmware `` upgrades '' require you to completely shut the router down and wait 1 min and then plug back in , and hope it works ... last upgrade I had to do this 5 times and finally it came back to life . I previously had a Linksys router and in retrospect wish I had stayed with that brand , though it was n't perfect.Suggest you search on google and find some recommendations for a good , stable router .
 I was very happy when I changed my DI-804 , which used to work very well for about 4 years when it started to ` behave ' strangelly . . after 4 year , it was really paid off , so I desided to move forward with dlink again and it seemed that 624 was the best choice . From the first day it started dropping the connection `` Network connection lost '' ... `` Network connection 100 MB full restored '' . . sometimes it rebooted `` too hard '' or so frequently that windoze can not obtain the connection again , so , I ended up with no connection at all ... it did this up to 5 times an hour . After I upgraded the firmware and the problem persisted , I realized I had to cry for help ... I called the DLINK `` support '' center and after an hour of idiotic questions -LRB- not related with product/problem -RRB- and several calls -LRB- `` you test that and call again '' -RRB- to be received by another tech which of course did not know nothing about the case and I had to tell the story all over again . . I returned it . . that was 6 months ago , it is again dropping the connections , loosing the connection.I can see there is no firmware for the last 6 or 8 months sothey seem not to be aware of any problems with these unitswhatsoever ... . hence I suppose I 'll get an identical unit , withthe same problems ... I 'll read some pcmag/pcworld reviews to try and choose a workingunit ... UPDATE : I have to update this review and appologize as the unit was not the one that was failing but was my tungsten , this router is still dropping the connection but the wireless is working ok.I have just upgraded the firmware to 2.70 and it seems like the router is more stable now , or maybe it 's just that my 2.4 GHz phone is broken and is now not interfering with the wifi radio?I 'll tell that when I get another 2.4 GHz phone ... I did not find a way to update the stars , but I 'd give it 3 by now . It is still a good piece of hardware .
 I had troubles with ths router - it did n't handle communication with Linsys G card . But the most surpising experience is one with customer support - unprofessional and rude . It 's a last time I 'm buying their products .
 Let me start by saying that I wish I had listened to the multiple negative reviews for this product . It seemed like the majority had no problems , and a friend of mine recommended this model , so I figured I 'd give it a try . Configuration was a nightmare . The install disc was useless and I ended up having to manually configure it . The settings just would n't take -LRB- I am a tech savvy person , by the way -RRB- . Finally after rebooting my computer 3 times -LRB- and rebooting the router itself more times than that -RRB- , the settings took . What should have been a 15 minute job took over an hour.It was fine for maybe a month or two , and then I began experiencing the same problems so many people have reported on this site . The router itself randomly drops and requires a manual reboot . This is a major issue for me since the router is not always readily accessible . I mainly use this for gaming , and it drops for me at least once a day , usually at the most inopportune times . I have n't tried upgrading the firmware yet , but I will be doing so tonight since I ca n't stand this anymore . According to others , it helps a bit but not much . This router is a lemon , pure and simple . If you purchase this , you 're rolling the dice . You may be one of the lucky ones and have no issues , but if you do , this router will drive you up a wall . Just be ready to have to reset the stupid thing at least once a day . Beware .
 Despite all customer support help including using the router as a switcher , this unit has erratic performance . It has been sitting in a box and awaiting an RMA # from D-Link to be retuned .
 When it works , it works fine . Otherwise , the continual dropping of its Internet connection is a royal pain . Absolutely no reason for that to happen . Update the firmware ? How about this D-Link
 I purchased this router yesterday -LRB- from the date of this review -RRB- . I was thinking to myself this is going to be a great router to keep the network going for a long time . Boy , was I wrong -LRB- and an idiot -RRB- . Every spare moment I got I worked on getting this running . Others have written 6 hours and then 5 min with the tech support . Trust me , it aint 5 min its 1 1/2 hours of my life that i can never get back . And besides , why does a product always need tech support ... c mon dlink make it easy . Personally unless your a `` computer networking genius '' stay clear of this one . And dont , if you do buy a router , get the fastest one because on my computers 60 percent is has high as it goes even 5 feet away from the router . Think what you want to ... my opinion on this product ... dont buy ... . try a microsoft or netgear.-Later
 The router is good - ... 3btech is less than dismal on shippingI ordered with a 3day select ups ship and received over the 3 dayperiod - they had some lame story about not shipping until the 1st full business day - . . which was two days AFTER I placed the order - they refused to do anything refund wise - I will never do business with them again -
 The other negative reviews are CORRECT on this one ; after 3 days of use , it began faltering -LRB- `` Network cable disconnected '' message in Windows -RRB- . It has now failed completely . The TS guys in New Delhi are of no help whatsoever . Avoid !
 Yes this Dlink product is notorious with rebooting problemas more users connect to the WLAN . Maybe 1 or 2 is not.But more than 5 then this Wireless Router starts rebooting.Also it 's gon na get warm faster than you think.Dlink is cheap . And you get what you pay for.PS . To Dlink Company
 I purchased my router a few months ago and i have this rebooting problem and its to the point it happens every 30 secs to 5 min . i called tech support and they are absoulutly no help and just make it worse .
 Be aware that if you buy this product , the Dlink firmware has historically been released full of bugs that are not frequently corrected . I am looking at Linksys or other routers to replace this one because of firmware bugs when using WPA encryption.Recently , Dlink released firmware 2.45 and then after many complaints , added a note to their site stating that it is a beta version . I would think that a company that had solid firmware would not have to go back and change a released version of firmware to beta .
 Pros
 Tried two different DI-624 's and tried every firmware update . Tried two different computers and tech suppoprt for several hours ! IT DOES N'T WORK WITH ALCATEL DSL MODEMS . I had to revert back to my DI-614 which works flawlessly and gets 5 stars . . You 've been warned ...
 I decided to replace my DI-704P wired network , which I had no problems with but just wanted wireless with my notebook . So bought the DI-624 along with the DWL-G650 . I live in a two story house . In the room with the router the reception was excellent -LRB- I used Netstumbler and Cirond WiNc -RRB- , but in the next room signal strength dropped to 75 % , 50 % in the third bedroom , downstairs 25 % and outside under the bedroom with the router 15-20 % . These numbers all seemed low . So I replaced both units with the same results . However , the story has a happy ending ... . Again , I replaced both units but with the Netgear WGR614 router and the WG511 notebook . All I can say is D-Link has `` POOR RANGE '' . With the Netgear setup - signal strength was above 75 % anywhere in the house and outside opposite side as the router it was still 60 % . The D-Link units need work ! In addition , with SSID broadcast off and the WEP at 128bit the D-Link card could not find the network . Netgear had no problems . I found this review of the Netgear WG511 on Cnet 's website . It shows the Throughput/Performance of 5 different cards including the D-Link and Netgear cards -- http://reviews.cnet.com/4505-3251_7-21056546.html?tag=txt -- Hope this helps you make an informed decision .
 Buy only if you do not need to use it or if you have lots and lots of time to experiment with settings yourself : - Worst customer service ever.-Technical support telephone wait time is horribly long.-Router reboots every few hours , even when there is no traffic.-Router drops wireless connection about once per hour requiring that VPN links be re-established . - Router can not configure any wireless channel but 6-Wireless link Indicator LEDs on both ends do n't behave as manuals describe , so are n't much help in troubleshooting.-Advanced features are not well described in the documentation and there are no samples to use.-Signal strength and quality is very inconsistent
 I have this router and just bought the Linksys WRT54G to replace it . BEFORE you buy the D-Link 624 go to DSLREPORTS and read the D-Link Forum section . As for all the trouble , I thought it was me . I get constant disconnects -LRB- rebooting router -RRB- I ca n't get my PocketPC with a Socket WLAN card to connect and my configure screens wo n't paint correctly . This router is a TURKEY . Those that got it to work are LUCKY ! I 'm on firmware 2.42 , which is current as I write this . I originally bought the 624 -LRB- at Costco -RRB- because my 614 + fritzed out . Why did I even waste my time . I learned about the DSLREPORTS forum by accident , did n't know of it before I purchased . The 624 is going back.COMMENT
 If your WLAN only includes 802.11 G based devices this device will be very usefulll for you . -LRB- It deserves 5 stars -RRB- Wireless setup is very very simple and effective . Firewall , Filters -LRB- MAC , URL , Domain -RRB- , Virtual Server -LRB- Virtual Server is used to allow Internet users access to LAN services -RRB- , DMZ features is very good and all of them is working without a problem . You can also do some fine tunnings for WLAN performance . -LRB- Beacon , RTS , DTIM etc. -RRB- 128 bit WEP encryption nearly does not have any effect on the WLAN performance . It is two times faster than 802.11 b -LRB- 13-14 Mbit real world performance -RRB- and worked in 90 feet without a problem . And I think the size and looks of the router is more cool than others . But here is the conclusions : Almost all system settings changes forces the router to reboot without asking to user!This device is not fully compitable with 802.11 b devices . -LRB- i.e HP iPAQ 5450 -RRB- There is no settings for wireless modes . I mean I could not set the router to 802.11 b only mode . Forcing the router to 11Mbit in performance settings is simply not working . If you have 802.11 g PCI/PCMCIA adaptor it is imposiible to slow down the router.In the case of 802.11 b compatiblity , I totally dissatisfied about D-Link Support.And remmember that 802.11 G is a draft standart .
 This router looses its internet connectivity regardless of a wireless or wired connection if you so much as look at it wrong.I could be working on my main desktop which is connected via RJ45 Port and the connection would drop -LRB- Cable is unplugged -RRB- out of the blue . Very annoying when you are in the middle of conversations . This is a new machine . The one previous did the same and so did the one before that.The wireless connection does the exact same thing.Appearantly there was a fix to this with firmware v. 2.76 which I did install , but the problem got 100 times worse . If the connection disconnected once every hour , it now did it 10 times every hour . The only way to fix that was to go back to the old firmware and live with the less frequent drops.DLink tech support is just as unreliable as their product . Their techs are inexperienced , redundant , and under qualified for their jobs . Their solution to every question is to reboot the router or computer and try a firmware upgrade . If that fails it MUST be a problem with all 8 Ethernet cards that I 've tried on all computers and laptops.I think that in the future I will upgrade to a better brand name .
 I bought this router and D-link wireless notebook adapter about 6 months ago . They worked fairly well for 6 months and then suddenly the router died . With further investigation , I found out that the power adapter is dead . After numerous phone calls , D-link gave me an RMA and I shipped the router to get them to - fix - it . After the fix , it has a wireless range of 1 feet and after that low/no signal . My notebook picks up signals from my neighbors who are 2 stories below my apartment , but not from my router which is 2 feet away . I am undecided if I would send it back for a - fix - again ...
 I purchased the DI-624 w / the DWL-G650 PCMCIA card . I did this mainly on the fact of the reviews and that it will do 108mpbs wireless.The router CONSTANTLY emits this high pitched tone . I checked the web for more info and apparently i 'm not the only one . It 's a design flaw with the Rev. C. model.I called D-Link technical support and between that gimp clearing his throat and coughing in my ears all he had to say was that it makes this noise while it 's broadcasting a wireless signal . So I turned off wireless access , and it still makes the same noise.I felt this odd because the HUGE WAP 's I have installed at work -LRB- that cover an area of 300 + yards -RRB- are completely silent.Skip this product if you can and definately buy outside the D-Link product line . Between my experience with this product and D-Link technical support , I will never buy any D-Link item ever again.As many other people have mentioned , i 've very weary about the positive reviews on this item . Whether they are actully customers or D-Link employees killing spare time .
 Just plain crapped out after 6mos . Always needed resetting even a few months ago , now just wont work . Replaced with netgears most basic 802.11 g and it solved all my issues .
 I have mixed feelings about this router . Once I got it set up the wireless connection and ethernet works great , but anytime I try to access the router 's web based configuration utility from my Dell Dimension desktop pc -LRB- which is connected to the router via ethernet cable -RRB- , the utility load AS SLOW AS MOLASSES . As a result , it takes almost 20 minutes to go through the `` easy '' set up wizard that should take no more than 2 , and all of that time is just waiting for the page to load . as a result of this , troubleshooting problems on the router has becore for me an all day affair.Also , I have discovered that if you live in the Atlanta , Georgia area and you use this product in conjunction with Earthlink DSL service , you have to set up the router with the `` dynamic IP '' setting instead of the `` PPPoE '' setting as D-Link recommends . Because I could n't figure out why the standard setup did n't work and the Web configuration utility ran SOOOOOOOO SLOOOOOOOOOOW , setting this thing up took all day . Again , D-Link Tech support was NO help whatsoever and even told me `` it should n't work with that setup , but i guess it does , so just leave it that way '' . Real professional troubleshooting.For some bizarre reason , though , the configuration utility runs just fine when I access it from the Compaq Presario 2500 laptop a bought several months later . I tried turning off all the security applications and checking for spyware/viruses on my desktop to see if that was casuing the slowness problem , but the PC is clean . I have no idea what is causing this issue and D-Link technical support refused to help me figure out why the router sucks with my Dell since that is `` an unsupported problem '' .
 Never seen a gimmick like this product . I am an experienced techie and I have not seen a useless product and a pathetic after sales service like dlink . The product does not work out of the box - may do for very few . I had 3yr `` old '' 3com products which worked well with every wireless device in the house . I thought I will upgrade to a faster standard using this product , but this product is shambles . Technical support is non-existent . you will NOT get thru , if you do , they will cut you off or blame their `` outsourced '' service in Denmark ! The router keeps dropping connection and you will be lucky if you get more than 30MBS even when in front of the router . I can ; t think what interference one could have in that situation ! I have never seen it go above 48Mbs even in `` Super-G '' mode let aside standard 803.11 g which gives you 54mbs . All in all if you don ; t want to pull your hair out , go for 3COM or LinkSys products which I believe do exactly what they say on the box and you might actually get some technical support !
 pros : all the unimportant features that it claims to do.very fast and pretty good range.cons : - all the features are useless if the router reboots and drops every hour . -LRB- even every minute sometimes -RRB- - firmware 2.42 drops my entire connection , which means i have to turn off my dsl modem as well as rebooting the router.-the newly upgraded 2.50 firmware is worse . people who are considering to buy this router will get the 2.50 version.-firmware 2.50 have issues with routers rebooting , not connecting , i ca n't obtain a ip address sometimes with my dell 600m . http://www.broadbandreports.com/forum/remark,11580469~mode=flat~days=9999~start=160the link will tell you what other people think about the frequent reboots.-terrible tech support.-the advertised 108 mbps does not acheive expectations . -LRB- extremely noticeable when transferring files from a desktop and laptop , vice versa -RRB-
 Seems like a good enough product - if would work . I set it up as a simple -LRB- wired -RRB- router , and got it to work . Problem is , about 80 % of the time , after it 's been on for awhile , I 'll lose internet connection through it . Remove the router from the picture , and my internet connection is solid . Put the router back in , and it will be solid ; for awhile . Then it loses connection again and may or may not resume proper operation some time later . Perplexed .
 It is fine when I use wireless w/o wep encryption . -LRB- although when I transfer files between two computers using this router , wireless lan is disconnected after few MB of transfer -RRB- I can surf web for long , and play counter strike w/o much of lag.But when I enable 64bits wep -LRB- 128bits also available -RRB- , it drop my connection after few minutes.So it keep ask me if I want to connect to available wireless network every 2 ~ 3minutes . And Of course , if I was downloading some files , then I get disconnected . I had to re-download that again.I can use it w/o wep enabled , but I do n't want other people stealing my bandwidth , so I 'm going to return this and pay $ 20 more to get linksys
 I am the IT Manager for my company and we purchased several of the DI-624 routers for our remote offices . Despite repeated resets and upgrading of the firmware they peform poorly and are unreliable . Save your money and consider buying the LINKSYS WRT54G or WRT54GS . I have purchased 6 of the WRT54G 's as replacement routers and have not run into a single problem . They are amazing ! If you do your research on the DI-624 you will see that most reviews show this to be an inconsistent product . Technical support at DLINK is not helpful .
 I intended to use the D-Link DI-624 to replace an SMC 802.11 b wireless system that was 2 years old . The SMC system worked really well , but it did need to be reset every few days and I wanted whole house coverage . After going through the D-Link 's simple installation procedure , I was up and running . Unfortunately , my range was reduced by at least 50 % from the SMC 's range . I upgraded the firmware and unplugged my cordless phones and still had the same mediocre results .
 This thing is junk with a Capital J. Range is lousy -LRB- I sit 20 ' away in my living room and I lose connection - 1 plaster wall in between -RRB- . At best , I get 27 % on signal strength and 21 % quality of data.When I first got it , I could n't print to my network printer from the laptop . I had to downgrade the firmware 3 revisions in order to allow network resources like the PRINTER to be used.I can be accessing email through my server and I 'll get an error that I ca n't access my PST file , so log off and restart Outlook , wait a few minutes while it resyncs the PST and then try again . By that time I may have lost the connection again . Power down reboot the router and it 's okay for a day or so.I could never get 108MBPS from it.With all of this , I 've tried contacting tech support via email 23 times and have yet to get an answer from them outside of the typical `` reset the router to factory defaults and start the configuration over with the ` Wizard ' . I 've been an IT professional for 7 years now and have configured Cisco equipment without a hitch . The ` wizard ' wo n't let me set things up the way I need it for my network , and even when I did once , it still did n't work correctly.Buy a Netgear , Linksys , anything but this piece of electronic feces . I wish there was a rating for -5 stars . That would be closer to my experience .
 Stay away from this router -LRB- and D-Link -RRB- . I purchased the DI-624 in September and after 30 + days , started having problems with the router rebooting -LRB- dropping connection -RRB- and locking up one of my Java programs . After many hours on the phone with their technical support people , they determined the router was faulty and should be replaced . I sent the router to them and they sent me an identical router -LRB- identical in every way -RRB- . Within days , the new router exhibited the same problem . After several support people tried to help me , they turned me over to what I think was a specialist with a call back number . After trying several things , he said to return the router and they would send me a different router that should solve the problem . He stated that this model probably would not work in my situation.He made arrangements and I completed the paperwork for the change . Then I received a call stating that I would owe an additional $ 30 for the upgrade . I am not into sending good money after bad , so I cancelled the upgrade and told them to send me another DI-624 . So , after six months of dealing with D-Link , I would advise others to stay away from this brand altogether .
 Now if I wrote a review for this product the first month I had it , then I 'd tell you this was the best wireless product I 've owned to date . I like the filtering , I like the menus , and I like the ease of use . The help needs some work , but I 'm knowledgable enough that I do n't care.Now comes the firmware updates . I started doing these because I 'd notice maybe some quirks , or they said they fixed something major . Also I like to keep up to date on everything.At the latest beta , normally I do n't try beta 's but I did to see if my problem that I 'll mention shortly was fixed , they 've really done a nice job on the wireless settings . Much better.Ok so what did they break ? Any hardwired form of connectivity . You can expect to loose your connection randomly on either the WAN port , or through any 1 of the 4 LAN ports . Very stressful if it worked for a few days then decides over the weekend that it 'll need to be rebooted 10-15 times before you quit.What makes this even more stressful is that you are still connected to the router wirelessly , and you can actively ping it at will . But if you , during it 's personal strike , ping it from say a computer on the lan side , it does n't respond . It goes completely dead . And the biggest problem is that rebooting it , or unplugging it does n't necessarily work . Sometimes you have to do it many times in a row.I 've reported this to Dlink many times over the last few months ... and ... tired of the service , or lack of . If its something simple they are good about talking to you , but you get a tad bit technical , and they ignore you.What do I buy now after investing in this technology ? Netgear ? I asked them a presale question and they told me to get the latest upgrade for the FIRMWARE of the device I was asking about !!!!!!! So I 'm lacking a little faith right now .
 Reboots randomly . Firmware has stability issues . Also drops WAN -LRB- PPPoE -RRB- connections randomly .
 All of these folks writing reviews about how great it works , just wait a while . It will break . Mine was good for about 3 weeks , now it just freezes up constantly . I know that many other people experience the same thing . Now I have to buy another one , it 's not worth my time to talk to support for two hours and then return it to them . You can get a linksys for about $ 50 . I strongly recommend avoiding D-link . BTW , the reviewers will names like `` darth nerd '' and `` geek '' work for D-link . When in doubt , check out their other reviews .
 Sometimes it works , sometimes it does . It works OK when it works . I went thru 2 of these and each timee my connection would either drop or my speeds would be really slow . I have no clue what the problem is . I work in IT so I tried all the troubleshooting knowledge I know before I contacted tech support = nothing . Upgraded firmware to no avail ... decided to return it all and bought a Linksys
 I bought this router for my new Verizon DSL connection and hooked up the Ethernet cables from the DSL modem to this router and from the router to one of my computers . However , when trying to configure the router on D-Link 's website , I clicked on the `` Run Wizard '' button there but got no reaction at all . Then I replaced D-Link 's firmware version 2.28 with version 2.37 offered on their site but that did not help , the `` Wizard '' button remained totally inert.I asked D-Link for help and they emailed me instructions for configuring the router without running the wizard , without explanation or apology for the dead wizard . Following these instructions brought me into a closed loop that returned me always to the same `` WAN Settings '' page . I described this to D-Link and they gave me yet another set of instructions for bypassing that wizard , again without comment why the earlier ones had not worked . These new instructions produced the same closed loop to always the same `` WAN Settings '' page on their site.I had told D-Link that I could not use the DSL connection without first configuring their router through which it passed before arriving at my computer , but they added to their latest instructions that if these did still not work , I should `` pull the power out of the modem for one minute '' and then try again . They never explained how I can switch off a modem that is not on in the first place , so it turns out that I can only configure their router with a functioning DSL modem but I first have to configure their router before I can get that DSL modem to function -- a typical chicken-or-egg problem.Until D-Link can fix its website to enable the allegedly simple configuration of their router , and until their tech support can understand the questions sent to them , this router is worthless to me .
 The router reboots itself unnecessarily . I 've isloated the cause of the reboots on my router . When a computer connected with a wired connection , is turned on after being off for a while or when I wake up a wired computer that has been on , but idle for a period of time -LRB- by moving the mouse -RRB- , the router automatically reboots . This seems to be a major flaw in either the firmware or hardware of this router ! There are many reports of self-reboots on the internet for this router . If you are simply using PCs in the house for surfing the internet , the reboots may not trouble you . But , if you are using a VPN connection , this may mean having to do a manual reconnect . Worse yet , if you are using a VOIP phone , and are in the middle of a conversation , your phone call will drop.When the router is up , it seems to perform just fine , although the administration screens for the router could use some better human factors design.But , I recommend you do n't get this router until you read consistent reports of the reboot problems being cleared up .
 EDIT
 This is my second router - my first was a wired , D-link DI-604 , which worked like a charm . Then , I bought this wireless one . Almost immediately , the problems started - random router reboots , like everyone else seems to have.Four calls to tech support got me nowhere , until the final , 2nd level support person I talked to suggested something interesting . I disabled the wireless capability entirely via the setup interface , and physically removed the antenna just to make sure . The support person said that if it then works without incident , that means something in the `` environment '' is sending a signal that is causing the modem to reset itself.Well , sure enough , the router is 100 % OK now . But , it 's also now not a wireless modem . The culprit ? In the next room , no more than 5 feet away - a 2.4 GHz Cordless Phone , bought around the same time as the modem . If I leave it unplugged , or if I leave the wireless capability of the modem off , I 'm OK . With both on , I get the drops.So , you have two choices
 I am an experienced IT guy and I know faulty products when I see them . The 624 has numerous bugs in the WLAN and the PPPoE implementations . I immediately ran into problems when trying to run a server behind this unit and when trying to connect different pieces of D-Link and non-D-Link WLAN equipment . Googling around shows many others having the same problems with these units , and D-Link support doing nothing to help . Main problems : - Frequent inexplicable reboots -LRB- UDP streams seem especially poisonous to this sensitive machine -RRB- - WLAN and LAN connection problems -LRB- can be solved by turning off WLAN functionality , but that kind of negates the idea with the product -RRB- - Loss of WAN connection over PPPoE.Will buy some other brand next time .
 This router frequently drops connection -LRB- a little window saying a network connection has been unplugged pops up -RRB- . After searching the net I found that it is an extremely common problem and as of yet , there is no fix.It 's usually for only a second or few but if you are in the middle of a transfer or if you are gaming , it 's really annoying.I would not buy this router again .
 d-link needs to get its act together . this router of airplus is a laugh . never seen so much problems from one equipment . lost connection , rebooting itself every half hour , losing signal , rebooting computer to get back signal . returned twice over a span of 3 weeks . fianlly returned back for good for another brand . a linksys speedbooster . now that works great !! tech support was n't helpful either . . spent more time on phone with tech than anybody else . still did n't get the problem solved . each one kept telling me to return the router back and get another one after there book runs out of troublehsooting ideas . tired of that ... :-LRB- the tech needs help with updatng there knowledge of the equipment and manners . d-link needs to rebuild there router again.its not worth it ... buy a linkys speedbooster or netgear instead .
 I purchased this with a Dlink G650 to use with my Verizon ADSL service . The install application is fairly simple , but , when finishing up the install it would not assign an IP address . The wireless connected fine but what good is it if it ca n't access through the DSL modem . When I tried calling Dlink I waited over half an hour and gave up . I tried calling Verizon who said they could only help me if I had a Linksys :--LRB- . . So I 've been trying to call Dlink support without success in getting through .
 Initially the system worked fine , the Network Card connected everytime and the firewall worked great . I had WEP and MAC filtering enabled -LRB- at the time the most security I could get for wireless -RRB- . I took the laptop on a trip , and when I returned , nothing worked . I had to literally strip out all of the security settings and then slowly re-enable them . The laptop would at times drop off the network , not connect , do things that made no sense , since none of the settings had changed . Also their customer support was n't at times the best of help either , they replied always by email , but it took two-three days for a reply . It just became too frustrating .
 I can not use the router because it comes without an power adpter ! Need to pay additional 20 dollars to get an adpter before you can actually test its quality
 The worst router that I ever use ! Super unstable , bad customer service . They are unwilling to repair/exchange/refund their defective product . The tech support only asked me to follow their troubleshoot procedure . However , it was n't to fix the problem even I followed their procedures for three times ! D-Link
 This product is actually the DI-624 Rev C. It 's a wireless router with an adjustable antenna , four 100 mbps LAN ports , and one 100 mbps WAN port . It has a pretty great feature set . I use the PPPoE support , DHCP server , WPA encryption , DNS and MAC based filtering , and the integrated IP firewall . All this is controlled through a relatively decent web interface.The problem that I and MANY others have had is with the stability of the device . It has a number of nasty habits ; like dropping the WAN connection then being unable to reconnect , stalling immediately after it receives a DHCP lease request , or spontaneously rebooting . These problems are intermittent which only adds to the frustration you feel when they occur . The tech support will have you do flash updates and careful reset and reconfig procedures . These do n't help . Because of these stability problems , I strongly recommend against buying this product .
 I have Comcast cable , with a Comcast provided Motorola Surfboard cable modem . I 'm trying to connect a PC , wired , and two laptops , wirelessly . I run through the little wizard app that comes with the router , but ... it does n't work . So , I call customer service , speak to people with heavy accents , they have me disable DHCP , WEP , change some arcane settings , and set up static IP 's on my laptops . Honestly , static IP 's ! So , now I am connected from my laptop at anywhere from 56 to 1.0 Mbps . And I 'm all of about 0.5 meters away from the router . Oh , and you have to press the reset button about 15 times before it actually works.Do yourself a favor and STAY AWAY from this router .
 why this router reboots by itself is beyond metruly worthless
 Used with Windows XP media center ed . Worked fine for 3 months and then started dropping connections every 1/2 hour . And I was WIRED , not wireless . Tech support was worst I have ever experienced .
 This was an awful experience . The first day we got it , we just used the land-line , and not the wireless . Every few minutes it would disconnect and re-connect spontaneously . We called D-Link support , got about a dozen people who knew nothing about the product at all , and eventually decided to drop it . The `` solutions '' they gave us did nothing at all . Once we tried using the wireless , the problems persisted , but in a different way . Instead of every few minutes , the dropped connections only happened a few times a day . However , the `` blackouts '' of information , within 3 feet of the router , lasted for prolonged periods of time , from 10-20 minutes . Nobody could do anything to help us . We 're hopefully going to return it soon for a Netgear .
 I bought this item july 29 and this is december , I am told that my rebate is in the system but it might take a while .4 months !!! the router has also give me problems from the start . I will never buy from d-link again ...
 This router would probably work fine for a simple home network or internet sharing , but it almost worthless for gaming . I wish I would have done more research before I bought it , seems a large percentage of people have the same problem as I do with it.With the original firmware it will reboot itself at random times , most of the time killing any connections I had up , games and file transfers did n't stand a chance . With `` updated '' firmware it only got worse for me . Instead of random reboots , I got reboots on about a 20 or 30 second schedule continuously . Completely unacceptable for anything but basic internet sharing .
 I found that many reviewer above like this router . For if i have a chance to change it , i will . I do n't know why it is disconnect many time after i turn on the router and use around 10 minute . First i suspect that the problem came from my internal wireless network in my tablet pc . But today , i know the true . I try to test many machine and they could not use an internet after they connect to this round around 10 minute . Beside my house there is a school and they have a wireless internet connection . I do not know which router product that they use but my computer could detect its signal every time that i open the computer from the morning until night . Whether i could not use the internet because not SSID key but i know the school has a good router while this router is just far from my laptop around 10 meter but always disconnect every 10 minutes . I suggest any people that purchase this product at the store should test it first before decide to purchase product .
 I bought this thing about six months ago , and while it worked out of the box , I started having trouble with it within a week . I put the router in my basement , and had one computer wired to it . I also have a laptop that I use with it occasionally when I am outside on my deck , etc. . Right about the time I started having trouble , someone else set up a wireless connection in my neighborhood on a Belkin router . I now know who it was , and from this computer to the edge of their house there is at least 250 feet of open backyard . From their router , I got at least a 20 % signal for several months , and I just hooked onto theirs eventually because my DI-624 was so unreliable and gave such a poor signal from my basement -LRB- 2 floors below me -RRB- . I returned from Germany to find that the signal I was getting from the belkin router was no longer as reliable as it had once been , so I went out and bought a DLink signal booster . Again , the product worked perfectly initially , but after two days I started having constant trouble with it . My computer would always stay connected to the booster , but the booster must 've been losing its connection to the router . So today , I figure , what the hell , I better give the booster a shot as my access point . So I hook it up , and I am now getting a 20 % signal , much better than the `` no signal '' or `` 3 % connection quality '' I was getting from my DI-624 once in a blue moon . So now , I have just disabled the DI-624 's wireless capacity and am now using the $ 70 signal booster as an access point . Looking into the logs of the products , I learned that it is the router that is frequently dropping and screwing everything up.My recommendation for anyone looking into this product is to look elsewhere . DLink 's tech support is located in India and the people are incredibly hard to understand and the advice they give is pretty worthless.The DLink DWL-G800AP Range Extender has worked very well for me , but I must warn you that DLink 's basic US tech support office is located in India and will ultimately not help you to solve anything.The only way I will ever buy another DLink product is if the product absolutely has to be a DLink or the router/extender will not communicate with it .
 I ordered this , waited 30 days , and never got it . I emailed many times , and never heard a word from the seller .
 Reboots itself if too much data is transferred . `` too much '' for me consisted of one SSH session and one World of Warcraft session , so I could n't do work while my roommate was playing world of warcraft . This is obviously unacceptable .
 I went wireless using DI-624 . It took a long time working with a phone tech to get it set up . Wonderful customer service , but it took over an hour . Then I had wireless ! It was incredible for three months . Until it quit working . Ninety minutes with their customer service reveakled the unit was broken . They encouraged me tio send it back . They replaced it . Three months of wonderful wireless . Now the second unit is broken.I am moving over to Linksys . Wish me luck !
 Bought this device even after some unfavorable reviews because of the big advertisement and it was expensive and thought that something bad would be really cheaper . Big mistake , the signal is so weak that I live in a 2 bedroom apartment -LRB- very small -RRB- and my systems report a low signal at 15 ft. Locks up a lot and have to reset very frequently , while the system is open -LRB- no security -RRB- it is fine but after some security configuration is a mess . -LRB- ... -RRB-
 I bought this router for its wireless capability and to replace my old router . This router is a real bag of troubles . It would randomly disconnect the wireless connection from my laptop , and sometimes , it would drop the entire network when the wireless connection attempts to connect . I had to go into the router admin menu and turn off the wireless feature -LRB- router reboots -RRB- , then turn it back on -LRB- router reboots again -RRB- ; why ? I do n't know , It just works after that -LRB- Note
 While tech support was helpful , they were not able to solve major connectivity issues - namely that the router dropped packets frequently . This meant that it kept disconnecting some applications . D-Link acknowledges that there may some difficulty using Yahoo Messenger , for example , especially with more than one computer at a time . An another note , the administrative tools were comprehensive but perhaps bewildering for novice users . The modem also lacked the ability to summarize all connected clients in a single screen . All of this is unfortunate given that the router typically receives top ratings for performance . In the end , it was more trouble for me than it was worth .
 I have a Pentium 4 3G , Windows XP-pro , Earthlink DSL , and an older , slower Linksys wireless router.I decided to buy the faster DI-624 . After three hours with three different tech support people , I gave up.I wish you luck .
 i am so disappointed because tech support was unhelpful . they could not get my laptap wireless running they blamed on my laptap . i was using smc wireless perfectly except its speed up to 54mbps .
 From the word go , this router has been painful . I have a 1-room radius from this piece of junk . Sometimes , I one bar on my iphone with it sitting ontop of the router!Easy set up and everything , just does n't work when set up !
 do yourself a favor and do not buy it , it constantly disconected.Customers support is not availble
 Opted to try this router after frying out two Linky 's over two years . Thought that I should be getting a longer usable life than I had been getting . Bought the D-Link 624 as replacement - huge mistake . This router drops the signal constantly , the firmware update makes almost no difference . Check of other web-reviews confirms this is a common , unfixable problem for the router . Do not buy .
 I called Tech Support and they do not know their product . First they claim that the antenna on the DI624 can not be detached . When confronted with their website saying otherwise they say
 Bought this router because of some good reviews that I had seen for the wireless features -LRB- 108 -RRB- ... But I also wanted to use it to connect some wired PCs to our broadband connection . After using it for a short while , the router seemed to lose the hardwired connections as if the router had rebooted . . this increased in frequency to the point it became unbearable...D-link suggested flashing old firmware -LRB- but the link to the old firware is dead and the latest beta firware does not fix this problem -RRB- ... . Do a search on Google for `` DI-624 reboot '' and you will see that I am not alone with this problem . Going to return and purchase another brand .
 Unlike my former D-704 router the case is plastic and it only weights about 1/3 of the weight and is pretty fragile . The web based setup is very straight forward for simple configurations , more complex ones take a little time because of overuse of `` ok '' splash panels in the UI.The big problem for me is that it simple will not route ! I use an Alcatel ASDL1000 modem and the two will not work together . It is difficult to pinpoint the problem but the modem works fine with my former d-704 router . Now the rub ... d-link 's technical support is terrible . Let me say that again ... the industry 's worst.After close to 10 hours on the phone mostly on hold or as a result of their automated system dropping my connection and then three promised return calls by `` senior support staff '' that never materialied I 've given up . What looked like a promising product is being returned . My friends who were awaiting my review have been steered away and hopefully this review will reach a few more ... Honestly , look at the alternatives which are very similar in technical spec but have much better support -- I think I 'm going to purchase the NetGear product now.Postfix : Finally -LRB- after 10 hours -RRB- talked to a level 3 technition . He was helpful and realised I did know what I was doing . Bottom line
 Constant disconnects with my Intel Pro 2200BG for no good reason . Works fine on default settings with no security enabled . Once I enable WAP + SSID broadcast off the router starts disconnecting roughly 3-5 times per hour . Problem can be recreated everytime when I reset the modem and enable WAP again . Uprading to latest firmware didnt help either . Go with Linksys instead .
 I have had this router for over a year . It worked well for the most part . But every once in a while I got problems with connection , for which I had to call customer support.Now suddenly it has become a big pain ... Both wired and wireless connections drop every 10 mins because router reboots itself . I have made over a dozen calls to tech support , but the problem has remained.The other thing is that D link tech support always tells you to go with basic 802.11 b config with no encryption -LRB- the most they would let me do was WEP , and always turned down WPA -RRB- . So even though this router has a lot of cool features -LRB- super G , WPA , gaming mode etc. etc. -RRB- , you are not allowed to use any of them . That is because if you try and it does not work , tech support will always tell you to turn all of them off . Thus all I have is a powerful router being used as basic 802.11 b.
 I had a D-Link DI-614 which as far as I can tell bit the dust . I am on Qwest DSL MSN Premium . So I went and got the DI-624 . First thing was put the CD in , well it kept telling me that my modem was a router -LRB- it is but I am hesitant about Actiontec wireless products until I get more info on them -RRB- . After numerous phone calls I found out I had to change my Modems IP , yet no one could really tell me how to do this , not D-Link , not Qwest , and Actiontec wanted $ 25 for a tech call . I finally figured it out and got it all running . Since then all I have had is dropped signals , I have to reboot , or reset everything every 2 days . I know it is not my modem , since connecting that directly to my computer , I have had no problems for 3 days , as soon as I put the D-link in the loop , BAM , wifes computer ca n't get online , son 's computer ca n't get online , I ca n't get online . Terrible product , tech support is someone you ca n't understand and has no experience . Stay away from this like the plague , it will only cause you heartaches .
 I bought this router so that I could use my work laptop at home with my home computer . It always had horrible range . If I was across the same room as the router , I would get two bars of signal if I was lucky . Recently , we moved the desktop to another room . That caused no signal reception from 10 feet with one wall in between.At work there is a Linksys with a booster antenna . I get max signal at my desk surrounded by a ton of other electronic equipment , steel , and concrete . So I thought maybe I just need an antenna . I bought the DLink antenna . Now from 10 feet I 'm back to the two bars of signal , with many dropouts.Recently I 've noticed the dropped connections with my desktop . That 's a new thing that was n't happening before.I would strongly recommend getting something else ...
 It never worked well . Allways desconnecting.Do not buy !!!
 When I plugged the device for the first time ... I allready knew I would have problem since the wireless led did n't light up normaly , according to the owner manuel it it suppose to stay light up when everything is ok , and start blinking whit network traffic , but no it had this steady blinking , indicating theres is a problem with it ... I was able to connect to wireless network . . without problem , but I would get lost connection in the entire network every 2 min or so , when I had a Wireless PC connected . After reading many forum on the web . . I found that I was not the only one , and in fact alot of people seem to have the same problem.One day after school trying to access the network with my wired pc , I was unabled to get a connection at all ... I was not even able to connect to the router . I reseted the router unplug the power cord ... I tryed everything ... and that was it , I took the router and it went right to the garbage !! If you want my advise dont buy this router . . even if some people says it 's find . . to many people seem to have issues with it ... just pass this one . . and keep your money to get a descent one !! Maybe for an higher cost but at least you 'll be satisfied !!
 I have a wired D-Link router that works great with my company 's Nortel VPN . So , I bought this wireless router for my laptop . After trying for days and days to get it to work I tried different configurations and contacted Tech Support . At first Tech Support offered suggestions to make it work , but did n't ask the right questions.It was only after my company 's tech support and I searched Google and D-Link 's website did we find that this D-Link router does n't support Nortel VPN with NAT . D-Link is a great product , but research first if it works with your configuration .
 I have had this router for 5 months . It will drop the wireless connection at random . So , I will be in the middle of something online then I am not online anymore . I have tried to work with D-Link tech support but they do not have an answer . It is not worth the money for this product.You will be missing your link and missing your money .
 If u want to keep others from using ur router u HAVE TO use encryption -LSB- with a key -RSB- on this router to keep them out . Found this out through Dlink tech support . Other routers -LRB- Netgear , Linksys , etc -RRB- can do Wireless Access Control with MAC addresses or encryption . Use both if u want really secure control.Well , I do n't want to bother with encryption and I do n't want other ppl using my router . Ca n't do that with this router . I wish I had known this b4 I bought the DI-624 . The indicator light interface in the front is very primitive . They are small , and blinking means normal . Usually blinking or a different color signals something is WRONG . There 's only one colour . Kinda counter-intuitive . The latest e-manual is outdated and does little explaination of the features .
 The revision A and B of this product is defective ; revision A/B has two antennas , this revision can not be updated to the latest firmware and has physical defects which make it operate at sub-par performance , not even a fourth of what was advertised . This is a fact and can be found on d-link 's website . If you buy this , dont be sucked in by the revision A/B 's two antennas , and larger packaging . Get the revision C which has one antenna , and smaller packaging . I am a victim of this trap . *** Update *** - At the time of this reviews writing I worked for D-Link , now I do not . The above review is an insiders perspective of a product I was forced to support .
 I dread hearing my kids walk down the stairs lately , usually it means `` dad , we 're offline again . '' I have to unplug this router at least every other day , and now my wireless printer wo n't work thru it , even wired to it . Very unhapppy , think I 'll return it .
 This product does NOT work as advertised.Dropped signal.Lost IP address.Won ' t save a new password.Bad firmware updates.Super G ? No way.Go with a known brand - LinkSys or anything else .108 Mbps ??? Not even close.In fact the last Firmware update states that they had to SHUT OFF several features because they did n't meet 802.11 g standards.Big waste of $ $ $ $ $ $ $
 I bought this and the matching card for my laptop . THey 've worked around 20 % of the time , and the amount of agony they have put me through is extreme . The laptop card was the worst , but the router is almost as bad . Bad software , difficult to use , and one problem after another.One of the multitude of times I talked to tech support , the technician actually told me I should have bought from a different company ! First time I 've ever heard that . Sadly , I give up . I 'm now going to take his advice . My only question is whether I repeatedly hit the dlink with a hammer and throw it away -LRB- which would be extremely catharctic -RRB- , or donate it to someone to make their life miserable.I will never buy another dlink product . -LRB- Though for what its worth , their tech support did try to be helpful . They could n't get it to work either -RRB- I 'm off to buy a linksys . I hope I have better luck .
 Spent 4 hours trying to connect the D-Link 624 with the Netgear WG111 USB adapter . Whole point is to begin using more secure WPA-PSK . Setup works with WEP and with no security , but even a simple PSK key will not generate an IP address on the Netgear.Call D-link - they tell me they will not provide phone support for WPA questions ! Shocking ! They will send me a FAQ ... I find various threads on the internet with the same problem.Also , many users have reported the router rebooting itself a lot - I had this as well . Managed to make it go away by re-orienting the unit & antenna per several user groups recommendations , but ... this seemed rather cheesy.Continuing saga ... Tried to get working with DWL-G122 & WPA-PSK , after 1 RMA , D-link informs me that WPA-PSK not supported on DWL-G122 , but they refuse to authorize an RMA . Manange to get it returned from place of purchase & buy DWL-G550 from Amazon - turns out IT does n't work with WPA-PSK either , so am returning to Amazon . Then tried to connect my laptop from work -LRB- using Intel 2200BG -RRB- - does NOT connect with latest FW on DI-624 -LRB- 2.70 -RRB- - support has me downgrade to 2.50 FW and voila , now my laptop works with WPA-PSK . This kind of grief you do not need.I am selling this router on eBay & will be buying a Linksys WRT54G - at least I can always run the Open Source code if the official Linksys code fails to work!Avoid this if you plan to use WPA
 I can not understand how others here say the range is great . It simply will not go thru the -LRB- brick -RRB- walls in my house even if the router is litterally feet away from the recieving pc . In a straight uninterupted line I get 25ft max .
 Would never recommend buying this router . It has been very tough for me to have a continuous connection . The router keeps on rebooting itself.After reading other people 's nightwares with this router I have decided to throw it in dump . And wont even buy any other D-Link product . I am switching to Linksys . They have great products .
 I do NOT recommend this router . It appears that Amazon has a bad batch of routers . I went through two units only to realize the problem was systemic . I would get constant reboot errors causing all wired and wireless devices to lose connectivity . I upgraded the firmware and still no avail . Do a search on google for yourself and you 'll see that many people are experiencing the same issue . I recommend that you save yourself some headaches and go with Linksys or Netgear .
 I bought this product 2 weeks ago ... With firmware 4.0 I got disconnection every 5-15 minutes . I upgraded the firmware to 4.03 and the connection is better , but is not enough ... I have a network with a wireless laptop and wireless desktop , when both are connected , the disconnection is every 10-20 minutes . I do n't recommend this product.If you search in network forums , you founded with the problem is very common.I 'm waiting for a new firmware , it could be my solution .
 This is a great router if you do n't plan on ever doing any serious usenet downloads or p2p file sharing.The massive traffic generated by either of these applications makes the router think it 's being pinged to death . Instead of filtering out the requests or doing something else , the router reboots itself ! How great is that . Several firmwares later and the problem remains.As of the 2.42 firmware , this router is vulnerable to the ` targa3 ' exploit , a test of which results in a reboot . Many other routers are not vulnerable to targa3 , but this one is.I 'd advise against the DI-624 . Its been nothing but trouble .
 While all other features of this product work fine , there is one key deficiency that is not evident to consumers via presales information . The problem is that computers with wireless network adapters can not access devices/computers that are physically plugged into the router 's ports . This was confirmed by DLINK 's level two support . DLINK simply wo n't talk to you about this limitation because they consider it a `` networking issue '' and therefore , you 're on your own -LRB- aka SOL -RRB- . How will this impact you ? Well , if you want to do file sharing between a laptop and desktop computer you 're going to have a problem . In my case , I have a DLINK DP-300U print server plugged into the router . I can print to it just fine via wire , but I ca n't print via wireless . Ca n't even ping it from wireless.I mean , the fact that you ca n't form a network amongst the devices connected to this product via wired and wireless connections is an amazing oversight . No , it 's not firewall software , etc. , etc. . Using a laptop with a USB `` wired '' adapter and two `` wireless '' -LRB- g and b -RRB- adapters , the same result appeared in all tests . Wired worked for communicating with devices physically connected to the DI-624 , but wireless did not.In case I was n't clear earlier , all devices , wired and wireless can talk to the DI-624 and they can access the Internet . Again , the problem is that on the DI-624 , wired and wireless devices can not communicate , making a home network a pipe dream . All devices in these tests interacted perfectly with the DI-624 's DHCP server and all were on the same subnet .
 If you google `` di-624 problems '' you will see many discussions . Especially many people seem to have the problem with the router dying out of blue . For some it reboots and for some -LRB- in my case -RRB- you have to manually unplug and plug the power again to make it go . Mine was first dying every few days , but recently , it has been dying almost every hour , although the behaviour is very sporadic and unpredictable . I upgraded to the latest firmware -LRB- Oct 2006 -RRB- and now at least it does n't die but I still get `` server not found '' error many times while I am surfing the net . And trust me I am an electrical engineer and i tried everything . I run a Linux server and made many networks and i think I know how computer networks work although that 's not my specialty per se.It appears that the problem is unacceptable quality control from the factory . While many people run the router happily , there are many who get into trouble eventually . It 's just random draw . I am surprised to see such a product being made with so little quality control from the product line.If i were you i would get something else , but if you found a good deal , then buy it , have fingers crossed and keep the receipt.While it 's working , I 've been generally satisfied with the performance whether wired or wireless . The user interface is pretty straight forward and it 's easy to setup . Nice port forwarding facility too for running those home servers . So at least two stars . However , again , I would avoid this product if possible .
 I purchased this router last year and it worked fine for about 3 months , after which it pretty much decided to randomly reboot or drop both of my Wireless clients -LRB- one Centrino laptop and one Dell PC with a D-Link Wireless PCI card -RRB- . D-Link support decided to RMA it -LRB- after 3 phone calls -RRB- and the * refurbished * replacement does the same thing . I later found out through various forums and my own testing that in `` high '' traffic environments , the D-Link is known for rebooting in what some say is a self-defense mechanism against attacks , but I suspect to be nothing more than poor hardware design.The poor -LRB- or just cheap -RRB- hardware design is evident in that wireless/wired clients appear to be bridged on the same internal interface because the MAC filtering list applies to both types of clients which is really annoying if you ever have guests that need to use the Internet , or if you work with computers ; you will constantly find yourself maintaining a list of MAC addresses for wired/wireless clients alike.For light , home use , this may be a decent router because you 'll probably never notice the reboots/drops like I did . The Linksys WRT54G is next on my list -LRB- cheaper , runs linux and is made by Cisco now -RRB- .
 I futzed with this for about a week . Had d-link tech support 's number programmed into my phone -LRB- power down the router , press the reset key , replug everything , yada yada yada -RRB- . I bought this router and the PCI wireless card for my desktop because of the excellent reviews I read on this item at CNET and PC Magazine . The PCI card froze my desktop EVERY time I turned the network on and the router would not connect to my laptop even when the units were a few feet apart . Exchanged for Linksys and have had not one call to tech support . I suppose this will work for a lot of people , but for me this operated as a 1 star product . Do buy from a place you can easily return -LRB- like Amazon ! -RRB- because if your experience is like mine , you will get fed up talking with the tech support people and try something else !
 I felt that my Linksys was n't putting out enough signal , so I decided to try a D-link . The signal problem went away , and that 's the only reason I give this thing 2-stars -- the signal is MUCH better than the Linksys.However , better signal does n't do much good if the router does n't work correctly !!! I frequently use VPN from home to get into the network at work , and 9/10 times when I try to VPN in , the router gets possessed and reboots itself for no apparent reason . It 'll start to log in , and then I look over at the router -- all of the lights flash on for a second , then they all turn off , then they all come on again -- and my VPN connection is terminated ! This never happened with the Linksys.Also , this router locks up frequently for no given reason . You 'll go to use your computer , and ... nothing . No response from the router . The only way to fix it is to unplug the power , wait a few seconds , and plug it back in . I emailed their tech support -- want to know what they told me ? Not much . They copied and pasted the FAQ page from their support page , telling me to try things I already tried , one of them being , `` Check your logs . Is there someone causing a lot of traffic on your network ? If so , you may want to block that person 's I.P. '' Oh , thank you for the suggestion ! Your router does n't work properly , so I should just kick my users off of it . Brilliant!Also , the static DHCP feature they added does n't work right . Everytime I tried to add more than one MAC address to it , the router froze up and would n't accept it.So , I 'm going back to the Linksys , and I guess I 'm just going to have to install another wireless access point to take care of this range problem . While the range of the Linksys might not be as good , at least the router functions properly ! I 'd also like to mention that this is the 2nd time I 've tried D-link -LRB- a different model this time -RRB- , and I had the same problems with the first one . Until they get the bugs out of these things , I will certainly NOT be buying another one .
 - The wireless range of this router in my house barely made it past 3 small rooms -LRB- about 40 ft -RRB- - This router frequently drops its wireless connection , and will sometimes reboot itself when both the wireless and wired connections are in use . - Latest firmware upgrade -LRB- v2 .76 -RRB- for this router locks out Xbox Live.Be prepared to open ports or use v2 .75 - The interface for advanced features -LRB- firewall ports , MAC filtering -RRB- is a bit clunky.I switched to a Linksys WRT54G . Much better range , and so far , no dropped connections .
 Drops connections every 15 minutes or so . Upon boot up the connection is `` limited '' . -LRB- Turning the router off and on is the only way I 've found to fix this -RRB- After upgrading to the latest firmware from Dlink 's website the connection now only drops about every 2 hours , which is still intolerable not to mention annoying as hell considering that I use the laptop in the SAME room as the router . Still have n't fixed the limited connection problem though .
 The DI-624 product line is completely defective.Do yourself a favor and search google for ` DI-624 reboot ' I have gone through 3 units , and each one of them exhibits the same problem . They stay connected to the internet for a while - sometimes a day , sometimes only 10 minutes at a time - and then spontaneously reboot , causing loss of internet connection for ~ 10 seconds , a re-connect with my ISP , which results in a new IP address.I have filed a Better Business Bureau report against D-Link , and I have spent months , actually months , trying to get a product exchange for a different model router.I would avoid this router.I have had great success with D-Link routers in the past . I had one function for two years buried under cables and dust without a glitch.The DI-624 seems unique in it 's fatal problems .
 After a few hours it began to reset every few minutes . I had the unit replaced , and the replacement did the same thing . I tried every trick I could find in all the online forums , and nothing worked . This is a piece of garbage . I switched to Netgear and had no problems .
 The Router works but the it does n't work properly . Both computers disconnects frequently while on line only . When I do not use the router , the main computer stays connected while on line perfectly . I should have probably purchased the router new instead of used . I am looking at the router right now and I can not use it ! Sorry for the not so well review !
 This router worked ok for about a month and then failed when I was in the admin page.Still kinda works , but I can no longer get into the admin page , and it takes forever to boot the router . I tried resetting it to factory defaults , but it doesnt respond to the switch.I was happy with it when it worked , but it failed too fast to be satisfactory . I went and bought another one however .
 I wish I read all these reviews before buying this bad product.I am having a lot of connection drops for both wired and wireless connections . Upgrading to the newest firmware did n't help it at all . I even think it became worse after the upgrade.I do n't write product reviews at all , but I decided to write my first review.Just an hour ago , I tried to send a 10MB file to my friend over ICQ , and I gave it up after having 3 connection drops.On the good side , it is easy to setup and it comes with some good features like MAC cloning , firewall etc. I tried to set a DMZ to one of my machines without much luck.I 'm sending it back .
 I was very disappointed by the way the technical support person handled my call . First five minutes into the call , he never asked me my problem / difficulties . He kept on asking my bio and more and more details about every thing about and around the router ! I had tried to explain to him that I have a very simple question to ask , but he showed no interest in listening to me . The product may be good . But if you expect a decent support from the manufacturer , this is definitely not the product you should buy . I returned it the next day and bought a Linksys and I am very much satisfied with it .
 I purchased this router with the DLink DWL-G132 USB adapter . I could achieve a `` Good '' signal -LRB- 3 out of 5 bars -RRB- when located in the same room with the router . At a distance of 20 feet , the signal strength fell to low . At my target location the signal was `` Very Low '' or dropped . I tried various configurations , and even purchased a high gain antenna , but the signal never improved . I replaced it with a Linksys router -LRB- WRT54GS -RRB- using the same adapter and the signal was `` Excellent '' -LRB- 5 of 5 bars -RRB- in the same room and in my target location , the signal was `` Very Good '' .
 This is my first wireless Router . I like the freedom that it gives me . I can take my laptop anywhere in my home , on the porch and even down the block . It does seem to need rebooting more than my wired router but , I 'm getting good at reseting it . It disconnects all the time . I would NOT recommend this router to others .
 totally stopped working in about 4 weeks ... the technical support is aweful , takes about 35 mins waiting time to get to the support , the phone connection can kill you , I have to hang it up and call again.I wil shun from D-link for everything from now .
 This is a horrible device . I have personal experience with 2 of this model and they are both defective in different ways . One drops network connections -LRB- on the wired switch portion even ... how hard is it to get a wired switch right ? -RRB- on a fairly regular basis for no explicable reason only to reconnect a fraction of a second later . The other has a wireless radio that works for about an hour or two then stops working and the router needs to be reset in order to get it working again -LRB- for another hour or two -RRB- . This is literally the worst networking device I have ever used , and that goes back to the old days of 10base2 . You would be better off making your own router out of gum wrappers and paper clips . It would be at least as reliable .
 Yes , this wireless router is easy to install and makes a nice combo with DWL-G650 card , and it looks perfect for a small home wireless network . It has only one slight problem
 I recently brought a DI-624 Rev C . In the begining it worked greatly . However , after 2 days , it became to show instabillities.I used to use it as a PPPoE to conect to my broad band and sometimes I experience some dropping in the WAN conection and them problens to reconect . To bypass this dificulty I have to set up my modem to conect the internet and them set the DI-624 to conect my modem ... Even after I do this procedure , the problem persists but now I do not have trouble to reconect the internet since the moden does not disconect.Thus , I do not recommend this product wile these problens continue to persist .
 I purchased this router hoping to share our DSL connection across our three computers , and share a networked printer.While set-up was flawless and the Wireless connection worked out of the box , we were not able to connect to any computers within our home network . After speaking with customer support they stated that the router does not support computers connecting to each-other , nor shared printers within the local network.Needless to say , this is going back to the store .
 I bought this product and had great speeds w / the G-650 PCMCIA card attached . However , I also wanted an external antenna to get better range so I bought D-link 's 120 USB network adapter . After wasting a Saturday night with tech support for over 2 hours , I finally realized the DI-624 does not work with 802.11 b , even it 's own products . My adapter kept connecting , then after 1 second , disconnecting . Tech support claimed that I needed to slow down my router so my 802.11 b adapter could read it . However , there is no way to slow down the router to do this in the first place !
 This item arrived damaged and for this reason I decided to return it because I was scare to receive another damaged wireless router in case I decided to change it for another router . I really did n't like all the money I had to spent .
 -10 StarCons : - DHCP networking - Problem with another 2.4 Gb devices like wireless phone - Restart the services without any apparently problem - Problem to setting ADSL services with VERIZON - Not connect a Linksys phone for Voip Adapter -LRB- block the device -RRB- I make 2 firmware update and continue the problem

 I DID FOLLOW ALL THE RECOMENDATION BASE ON THEIR WEBPAGE IN HOW TO INSTALL THE SYSTEM . THE EQUIPMENT IS GOOD . HOWEVER THE SIGNAL OF THE EQUIPMENT IS VERY WEAK . I DID CONTACT THEIR TECH SUPPORT , BUT THE SITUATION WAS WORSE . BETWEEN 5 TO 7 FEET FROM THE BASE , I DID HAVE VERY GOOD SINAL , ONES A WAS MORE THAN 10 FEET FROM THE BASE SIGNAL WAS GOING LOW OR VERY LOW . I DID HAVE COMPAQ BEFORE AND THEIR SIGNAL WAS BETTER BUT THEIR EQUIPEMENT WAS BAD . TRY TO LOOK OTHER EQUIPMENT I WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS ONE .
 This was a good router for almost 3 years , then it just stopped working one day . It froze up and the manual reset did nothing . The lights came on but I didnt have anything plugged in . It would not network LAN or send internet . All functions entirely DEAD . I think I 'm not going to even try to get a replacement , but will buy a linksys or something . Pissed that I do n't have wireless internet right now .
 I purchased this product , as well as the DWL-G520 PCI Adapter , in part because of the positive reviews I found on Amazon.com.After using the product and returning it after four days , I am very suspicious about the validity of these reviews.I installed and reinstalled and reinstalled the router and the PCI Adapter , downloaded patches from the internet and checked and rechecked the router 's configuration . Virtually every time I tried to access the internet over the wireless network my connection was either dropped or my computer froze . The directions that came with both products provided very little information , the DLink website was equally uninformative , and after reading the comments on this site about DLink 's customer service line , I did n't even try to call . After four days , I gave up and returned both products and purchased the Microsoft MN700 base station and the MN730 PCI adapter . I had both products installed and running perfectly within 15 minutes.Do yourself a favor and buy a different product . You 'll save yourself a lot of frustration .
 I purchased this product for my laptop and had full intentions of linking my laptop to my home network , but ... has n't happened yet.Why ? It 's not for lack of trying . I guess it 's too complicated for me to get resolved right away and I need all my computer running.I am running XP Pro on all computers . My desktop models are using a salite to connect to the internet and are using one as a host computer and the other links to the internet through the host . My desktops are networked to retrieve files and share printers.When I followed the instructions for the D-link-I thought it would be a snap , but ... NO!I linked the cable from the modem to the wireless unit to calibrate the d-link , but it must not have callibrated , because I could not go any farther.When I linked my cable from my existing router to the laptop-on-line to internet immediately -LRB- forgot to check about file sharing , oops ! -RRB- Since I did not want the inconvience of tripping over cables for my laptop , I again tried to get the wireless to work.Did a restore point on my desktop , just incas the network wizard did n't solve the issue . Sure enough it did n't and it messed up my network and internet connection to the other desktop.Resolved that by doing restores on both desktops-but still no wireless unit working . Guess I 'm going to have to spend some serious time figuring out how this is to work.I love XP Pro-it 's like Windows 95 was to Windows 3.1 when it came out , but ... I need more than the wizard has to offer to get my whole system operating efficeintly.I 've have debated over returning the unit and not going wireless for my laptop , but that does n't make much sense .
 Bought this and the matching pcmcia card for my laptop . Setup was very easy , and it worked just fine right out of the box.But , in one weekend 's worth of usage , I had horrible troubles with dropped connection . According to the Dlink strength indicator , I had the full 108mbps throughput , and I was only about 20ft away from the router . I returned it.This is the second time that I have had this type of troubles with a Dlink router/pcmcia card combo . No more dlink wireless for me.My configuration that has been working for quite a while now is a dlink 614 + wireless 802.11 b router -LRB- which does work fine -RRB- and a cheap Gigafast 80211b card .
 I bought this product as part of a package with a D-Link 108 pci card . It was easy to set up , and appeared to work well until it began regularly rebooting . A lot of people have had this problem and I had to search for a solution . I tried firmware updates and disabling features , but it did n't help.This router is a bit dodgy . I did eventually find what I believe is a solution to the rebooting problem -LRB- ... -RRB- that is working for me so far . But , all in all it has been a very disappointing experience . There is an obvious disparity between its excellent reviews such as on CNet and those numerous reviews by users having experienced problems with the device . This router has a lot of features , which attracted me to it in the first place , but is n't worth the trouble .
 The wireless connection drops at least once an hour for 30 seconds , disrupting web surfing , internet game play , and large file downloads.I 've had these problems with PCs running Windows XP and 98 using D-Link and Microsoft 802.11 g wireless cards.Also , it is impossible for computers hooked to the wired LAN to communicate with those on the wireless one , and vice versa.I 'm running the absolute latest firmware on the access point and the latest firmware and drivers on the wireless cards.This thing is garbage , do n't buy it .
 I guess if you 're satisfied with an open 802.11 g configuration then you 're set . Otherwise , steer clear of this pile.Let 's see : WPA-PSK does not work . It worked for a few hours then randomly stopped working . Not sure if it 's the router or the D-LINK XtremeG cardbus card . Other people have the same issue.The web interface is dog slow from one of the wired ports for no apparent reason . Works fine over wireless.This is a treat
 I returned the first unit beacause it would not detect a connection . The connection was not detected whether it was set to DHCP or static . It also rebooted itself constantly and would not keep a set time but instead would reset the clock back to 1 April 2002 ! What the heck ?! Technical support was useless ; I 'm convinced that they are min wage workers in some overseas location reading from a scripted algorithm , probably the quick set-up guide or online FAQ 's . I returned the second one for the exact same reason.Amazon has been very good about the series of transactions ; the return/replacement/refund process has been very easy .
 I wasted two weeks trying to use this as directed , along with the DWL-G650 wireless CardBus -LRB- PC-card for laptops -RRB- . I selected the WPA-PSK encryption format for security and found that it worked from 5 minutes to 2 hours at a time . Same thing with the old and fairly INsecure WEP encryption format . I emailed and phone D-Link 's tech support line and got responses that did nothing to help in any way . I spent weeks researching and reading ratings penned by numerous others to choose what should have been the best wireless networking gear for my environs only to find D-Link 's products a miserable failure , backed up by mediocre , faltering tech support .
 I 've been using a D-Link DI-614 + router and it works fine . I bought a DI-624 to upgrade from 11b to 11g . The 624 connected fine to the other machines in my home network and the computer showed an internet connection present , but no matter what I tried I could n't access the internet . All the settings were the same as the 614 . The computer would time out and offer to use my back up dial-up connection . I asked for help from D-Link tech support by email . They made a few very basic suggestions that did n't work , then stopped answering my emails . I gave up and returned the unit to Amazon for a refund . -LRB- Amazon 's easy returns are great ! -RRB-
 It might be a great product but ! it will not work with ALCATEL DSL modems ! I spent 2 hours setting this thing up and searchingin D-LINK web site just to discover that I ammissing a `` special cable '' that ca n't be purcashed anywhere . . They will sent it to me for free with-in 4 business days ... but , what will happend if the cable is too short ? then I will have to order another one ? This does n't make any sense.BETTER GET A LINKSYS PRODUCT !
 I have nothing nice to say about this product . I only wish I had read the reviews more carefully . Obviously , most of the positive reviews are planted . Typically these reviews are 5-stars , noncritical , never use a real name and have the nerve to thank D-link by name . They are often written by reviewers that only recommend D-Link products , 5-stars of course , and strangely all their reviews are submitted on the same day.Beware of D-Link .
 I have already tried two D-Link DI-624 routers . Why ? The first one , tech support said it was defective . The second one , they could not provide any help after going through all the troubleshooting steps . Actually , both had same issue . If you use COX cable , do n't waste your time , go ahead to get Linksys Wireless G. Cox supports Linksys only -LRB- and Linksys is from Cisco -RRB- .
 Will never buy D-link again . Do not know if D-link ever tests their product before releasing . These folks probably never used their own stuff . It 's just not working . Very annoying . Big waste of time and money .
 For the las 4 year i had 2 DI-614 , 1 DI-514 , 4 DI-624 and DI-784 -LRB- a/b/g -RRB- and all are dead !!!!! do not buy D-link if you are going to use your router a lot !!! after 6 to 12 months of heavy use you will get a lot of problem ... . d-link support suc *** s5 stars guys you will see it : - -RRB- PS
 Full Disclosure
 This device simply will not function at 108 speeds unless ALL of your wireless connected devices are 108 compaible . Let me make sure there is no room for misinterpretation here . If you have five 108mpbs adapters and a single 54 or 11mbps adapter , then your 108 adapters will run no faster than 54mbps . This has been confirmed by D-link technical support many times.Their sales page says the following though : `` Only D-Link 80211 . g Xtreme G with enhanced 108 is able to remain fully interoperable and compatible WHILE running at 108Mbps , ... `` Me thinks something is rotten in Denmark .
 As I write this I am ONCE AGAIN on hold with D link tech / customer support for well over 2 hours . I have spent many DAYS now on the phone with them , yes shame on me for not returning this stuff in the first place but I already had several machines with Dlink cards on my network so I foolishly thought that by sticking with the same company things would work well . WRONG!I have worked in IT for years and configured networks for 10 's of thousands , trust me , I know how to do this.This is just one of 4 new D Link products that I have purchased over the last 2 weeks.With out boring any one with the details suffice it to say that OUT OF THE BOX 2 of their products have been DOA . Router and an Access Point . Also 2 PCI cards that were completely incompatible with 2 of my systems.Then there is the false advertising plastered all over their boxes . Upgrade to 108Mbps with a free firmware download . Well when you go to the site it says not yet available for my revision . Then you talk to tech -LRB- brain dead -RRB- support and they tell you that Dlink will NEVER be writing new firmware for this product . DO N'T BE FOOLED!Then there is the endless hold for an RMA , worthless tech support , even at level 2 , and worthless non existent customer service.Stay away , do NOT buy their products unless you have a thing for endless frustration.I would return all of these products in total if it did n't mean having my network down for days . I will be replacing all of these products as soon as possible though.Go with another company .
 I replaced my Netgear B router with this one - what a mistake ! The connection drops always . I upgraded my firmware by 2 versions . Nothing helps . Netgear used to work like a charm . There is no reason for the connection to drop . I couldnt connect my laptops w/o interruptions.Buy any other product other than this . I would recommend NetGear . I am going to get NetGear for myself .
 This product is awful . I have exchanged it a few times and spent countless hours on the phone with them . It still keeps on rebooting itself every few minutes . Plus they keep costing me shipping and keep charging me for some parts I do n't seem to send back . When you have to send yours back and you will . Make sure you put all cable and plastic pieces back in . The worst I have ever owned .
 When it works , it works fine . Otherwise , the continual dropping of its Internet connection is a royal pain . Absolutely no reason for that to happen
 This is the single worst piece of electronic equipment I have ever encountered in my 30 + years on earth . I can barely even write this review because of fear that my internet will cut out due to my D-Link Router . I pray that when I press `` Post Review '' my internet wo n't die , and the words which I have read literally thousands of times
 This is a great router for the most part as the other reviews will tell you , but it has one big flaw
 I have been in the computer support business for 12 years and this is by far the most inferior product with the worst tech support I have ever experienced . I bought the product because it was the least expensive at the time . I got home and got it running fairly quickly . The first thing I noticed was that the signal strength was sub-par . I decided I could live with that , however . I then set up the port mapping I needed for my network . Soon afterward the router rebooted and disabled all my port forwarding settings . It didnt erase them , it just disabled them . It did this about twice a week for the life of the router . I woke up one morning and discovered that there was no signal strength at all from the router . I tried several laptops and sure enough , no signal - not even from a foot away . I called tech support and talked to a person who gave me a list of things to try and told me to call back if they did n't work and he would give me an RMA . I called back and was told that it didnt matter what the other guy said , I had to do all the steps with the tech on the phone or no RMA . I did that , and the guy told me , `` Your going to have to go through the crash recovery . I ca n't do that over the phone . I 'll send you an email and then call me back . '' The long and the short , Three tech support people and two floor managers later I got the case number for the RMA . I went to RMA.DLINK.COM and thier site is down . So make that 6 calls to tech support just to get an RMA on a clearly defective product . Good luck to you if you decide to buy this product .
 The product may perform up to your expectations but I only hope you never have to interact with D-Link 's support organization . After dealing with conflicting , contradictory and completely erroneous information from their support organization , I have come to the conclusion that I do n't care to do business with D-Link again.I hope that if you do by a D-Link product it works flawlessly -LRB- which mine did not -RRB- , and you never have to call their tech support organization.Good luck .
 I bought the DI-624 -LRB- rev C -RRB- with a DI-520 wireless PCI card for my other computer . The idea was to use it with my Westell DSL modem on Verizon.Networking the two computers -LRB- a couple of newer P4 Dells -RRB- was just as easy as Dlink describes . BUT
 I used to love D-Link so I replaced my old `` b '' - band di-614 + with this `` G '' - band Xtreme di-624 and what a day and night.I would give some stars for it 's performance and features but the hassle dealing with its problems is not worth it.Go do a Google search for `` d-link di-624 '' and you would read from countless victims of this product.It works great when it chooses to . But sometimes it just does not want to connect with the cable modem . Or it just keeps restarting every few minutes like most users have complained . It also seemed that one must use a special `` crash recovery '' method to load the newest firmware -LRB- 2.50 -RRB- . Either firmware for my Rev.C router yields the same results . Normally a couple reboots with manual network cable disconnect/reconnect would make the router ` fly ' again but would not stop me from constantly turning my head to the modem to check for connection light.I would spend a little more and give up some features for a stable and worry-free router . I would even consider buying the old `` b '' - versions but not this junk . I think paying consumers really want a stability and a worry-free , or at worst a fixable router .
 This is an inexpensive , easy to setup router / firewall combo.You 'll be fine if you do no online gaming or anything requiring consistent connectivity.There are ongoing , unresolved issues with DLink routers and how they handle a PADT packet from your ISP 's equipment.This router handles the command by not only disconnecting , but by also REBOOTING itself . This leads to a 15-30 second disconnect condition while the device reboots.I 'm sorry to say I really ca n't recommend this item -LRB- it 's rebooted 3 times while writing this ! -RRB-
 I 'm an IT professional and prone to breaking and consequently fixing things . This is my 2nd wireless product in as many weeks after I tried a Linksys wireless that did n't work and promptly returned it . Got this router cheap on a Christmas sale.This router suffers the usual D-Link products reboot problem . That is , it reboots every 5-10 seconds depending on your network traffic load . Since I use it for my home office , that means every 5 seconds . It is very annoying.After upgrading , downgrading and re-upgrading the firmware and trying suggestions other have on the web , I found that my problem can be solved by turning off the wireless radio . But what good is a wireless router without a wireless radio ?! To add insult to injury , D-Link informs me an RMA is needed and that I would have to pay for the shipping cost to D-Link and I would be without a router for a week !! I bought the router and was not expecting to have problems . Why should I pay for your mistake ???!!! P.S. Over Christmas I 've used a Linksys , D-Link and SMC wireless in order of most expensive to least expesive . Ironically , I got the SMC for free and it 's the only one that did n't give me any problems!P.P.S . I bought the router because it had a lot of features such as DDNS to link up with DynDNS.org ... it never worked !
 Ok , at first I was impressed . It worked right out of the box , not a problem . I have had the thing for 6 months now and suddenly its dead . Spent 2 hours on with tech support ... they ca n't fix it . Now they agree to RMA it but I had to pay for shipping ... they will look at it and then send us another one if it is broken ... in the mean time I have to deal with not being able to use the internet . . just use my roomates computer which we just connected now directly to the internet modem . This is ridiculious !! I plan on just buying a new one becuase I do n't have a month or two to wait on D-Link to look at it and tell me its broken nor the time to pack all this up and send it back to them at my expense . Come to find out all kinds of people have had the same problem . STAY AWAY ! Get a belkin or linksys router ... you 'd be better off .
 Some setup screens did not match the documentation , having extra fields that were not explained anywhere . The prompts for the fields that were there could have been better chosen to be more self-explanatory . I 've set up routers before and there were several things in the setup screens I did n't understand.I was happy with the range , which seems to be a little better than that of the comparable Linksys WRT54G -- though that might have had more to do with a slightly different placement of the unit . I would say the range is at least as good.I had to call tech service four times because of problems I had after the router was already set up and working . Each time I called , I had to give the full details of router , model number , firmware version , and so on , apparently because the techs often forget to save the information when they are done with a call , though they are expected to do so -LRB- each time I gave my phone number , they said , `` Oh , I see this is your first call . '' -RRB- . One of the techs was rude and hung up on me . Two techs gave me contradictory information.The main problem that eventually forced me to return the router , is that it resets itself occasionally , interrupting my connection for a second or so . This affects the wired-in connections to the router as well as the wireless . So with my desktop system , connected to the router with a LAN cable , suddenly I see the `` You have no connection '' balloon , then right away the `` You are connected at 100M ... '' . At times I 've seen them flashing on and off like broken traffic signals.Aside from the annoyance of these notices popping up all the time , some software I use -LRB- AT&T ; Net Client VPNS -RRB- notices the brief outage and shuts down , so it makes the router unusable to me.I was able to reduce , but not eliminate , the interruption by installing the version 2.50 firmware . Someone in their tech service told me that the cause was radio interference , and that the router would reset itself if there was a lot of radio noise in the 2.4 Ghz bands , e.g. from cordless phones . `` You understand we 're talking about a computer that 's hooked to the router with a cable , right ? '' I asked . Apparently he did understand this . When I pointed out that this was a stupid way to design a router , he hung up on me . Another technician swore that the router would not reset LAN connections because of radio noise , but did n't offer any other explanation , nor did his suggestions for changing settings solve the problem . In the absence of any other ideas , I have to conclude the first tech was probably correct . Since a poor design is the culprit rather than an individual defective unit , I returned it and will not buy a new one -- nor any of their other products , ever again .
 I purchased this unit in November and almost immediately there was a problem with the router rebooting itself . Sometimes it would reboot after a couple days and sometimes it would reboot every few minutes or so . This was very aggrevating . I downloaded and upgraded to the new firmware v2 .50 thinking this may take care of the problems . It did not . I emailed customer support and they suggested that I perform a `` recovery '' on the router . I was also instructed to call customer support in the event this process did not work . I followed their instructions and to no avail , the problem still continued . I called customer support and spoke to a very nice representative . He had me change a couple settings and advised that this should take care of it . In the event that it did not , he suggested that I return the router for a new one or send it to D-Link per their RMA policy and they would send out a different unit within a couple weeks . He advised that if I returned it to D-Link , they could not assure that I would receive a new router from them . It may be a refurbished router . After my call with customer service , the router problems began again almost immediately , rebooting itself every minute or so . I finally decided to give up and purchase the Linksys WRT54G wireless router . The Linksys router works perfectly so far . I would not recommend purchasing the DLink DI-624 router .
 I bought this product from Best Buy about a year and a half ago ; my family got cable and a wired network just was n't feasible with our layout , so we went with this D-Link device.Connection drops every few minutes , and sometimes it wo n't come back up until the router is rebooted ... which requires unplugging the router and the modem , then putting them through their boot cycles one at a time . When it works its best we do this every other day , at its worst we do it daily ; today it had to be rebooted three times in one hour.I 've tried multiple connection devices , DWL 122 , DWL G650 , DWL G520 , and whatever one came built into my sister 's Dell . Getting closer to the router has n't helped ; it still even dropped packets . -LRB- As an example , an instant message or two may simply never reach me . -RRB- Needless to say , my family 's looking for something new since their tech support 's suggestions were useless .
 I use DI-624 and DWL-650 with Dell 600m . The 108 Mbps or Super G just does n't work , the wireless connection drops every 10-20 min . Make sure you visit http://www.broadbandreports.com/forum and search for paeDISCONNECTED and you will meet many unhappy users there . I have tried both 2.42 and 2.50 firmware and many things suggested in http://www.broadbandreports.com/forum . The only way to make DI-624 and DWL-650 work for me is to disable Super G. DI-624 also works with my 802.11 b came with Dell 600m .
 I bought the product from Fry 's and forgot to check reviews before making the purchase . What a mistake ! I can testify that even with the latest firmware , the constant router reboot -LRB- PPPoE disconnect -RRB- is a common problem . I was losing connection every 2 minutes and reconnected repeatedly that basically rendered my internet connection completely useless . Do not waste your time on this product . Release a product with this level of QA makes a lasting impression - stay away from D-Link .
 DI-624 router frequently disconnects itself from all computers , wired and wireless , attached to it . What 's more , it will reboot and might take up to 5 minutes to establish a connection , which may happen in the middle of a download.D-link suggests that you downgrade the speed to 10Mb which will reduce files transfer speed in your network by a tenfold . But the issue is not resolve . Upgrading to new firmware -LRB- 2.50 -RRB- wo n't resolve the issue either . Furthermore , replacing the network card for a new one wo n't resolve the issue.If you want to spend many hours fussing , calling & e-mailing tech support and rebooting a router and reconfiguring it until you are red in the face ... go for it ...
 I bought two of these routers to use in a spread-out , single-floor residential setting with a mixed Mac/PC environment . I figured I could locate them at opposite ends of the house for good and , hopefully , overlapping coverage . Not so.Firstly , these devices will eventually drop the wifi connection and need to be restarted on a weekly basis if not more often . Secondly , they have TERRIBLE range . Using a variety of computers , I succeeded in getting no more than 30 foot range . I located the routers as high as possible and away from sources of interference , use only 5.8 GHz cordless phones , and experimented with different channels . They simply do n't perform well.Their customer support is absolutely the WORST I have ever experienced , and I deal with a lot of electronics for home and for work.After 16 months , the first of them has now completely failed . I 'm replacing it with a similar device from another manufacturer.I 'd give it one star , but it does , usually , work .
 I replaced a D-Link 802.11 b router with this `` new - high performance - high speed '' router . What a mistake ! Between the router and the included software -LRB- Network Magic -RRB- my network has slowed to a crawl . I am very seriously considering going back to my original setup.If I could rate this device at zero stars , I would .
 I have used older version DI-524 for an year and it was good and the signal strength was very good even in my study room when i place the router in hall -LRB- 1 room in between seperated by a thin wall made of wooden mix -RRB- but it died a week back , the reset dosent bring it alive any more.Bought DI-624 this week with much expectation , the installation was easy and i took my laptop to next room and the wireless network got disconnected . I tried with1 -RRB- super G without turbo2 -RRB- Super G with dynamic turbo3 -RRB- without super Ghopeless , no improvement in signal strength . When i stay near the router or with in 3 - 4 mts radius , signal strength is good -LRB- not excellent -RRB- . Even i dont have any other wireless device operating in 2.4 ghz . hopeless product . There is a ton of features , who needs all those without the device working properly .
 My first one kept dropping the connection and then reconnect on its own . I called tech support and they sent a replacement . Guess what ! The replacement had the same problem . I did a search and turned out that tons of users have this problem . This product is a real hit-or-miss so stay away !!!
 This is not a bad router , but it is not a good one either.Not only it does n't allow high speed downloading torrent files , it keeps rebooting itself if you do use any torrenting client program.However , for everyday web browsing , gaming , and network protection , it really does an OK job.I guess the only really great router D-link can give us is its 120 + dollars Gaming router . So if you insist on getting a D-link router and you have to download torrent files , do n't buy this one .
 I purchased the M version of this router , with MIMO . On my simple network -LRB- 1 wired XP , 1 wireless XP , 1 wired Win98 -RRB- , I could access the internet from all systems . But , even though file and print sharing worked when I used an old Linksys router , it did not work at all with this D-Link router . Tech support said the router was bad , so I returned it , with the same results . Then they said they would n't answer networking questions -LRB- that was Microsoft 's problem -RRB- . I returned the D-Link , purchased a Linksys , and everything worked perfectly . Based on my experience , I would NOT recommend buying the D-Link product .
 Whenever I enabled WEP my D-link router would drop connections . All 3 wireless devices in my home -LRB- 3 laptops -RRB- all indicate the router 's signal died . I called D-link tech support and they told me I should use MAC Address Filtering and not WEP since it 's more secure that way . What a complete B.S. !!! MAC Address cloning can get past this weak protection anyday . Is this their excuse for shipping a crappy router with broken WEP technology ? I 'll never buy from Dlink again .
 This router is easy to set up and easy to use , but the constant line-dropping , the constant rebooting and the wireless rejections cause endless frustrations.Despite all the evidence against this product -LRB- a google search for ` PADT TAG ' - the line-dropping problem - lists d-link routers in the first 14 finds !!! -RRB- , the D-Link company * flat-out * denies any fault or problem with their creations.Another classic case of the marketing department running the technical support !
 Installation was easy and everything looked great . Until I tried to access the internet via my browser the next morning -LRB- `` page can not be displayed '' -RRB- . All ideas of the helpdesk how to fix it did n't change anything -LRB- we exchanged about 20 emails -RRB- so that they agreed it was a hardware problem . I returned it and got the next one with the same problem . The answer of the helpdesk this time
 Wow . What can I say other than this has got to be one of the worst electronic purchases that I 've ever made . The DWL-G650 is a pretty good PCCard , however the DI-624 router is absolutely horrid ! From the moment I plugged it in it would n't quit rebooting itself every 1-2 minutes kicking me off the network . Firmware flashes did n't solve the problem at all nor did a replacement product . -LRB- Incidentally , Amazon.com was WONDERFUL about sending a replacement product -RRB- . How D-Link gets away with selling this product is beyond me . I 'd read similar reviews on the product with it constantly rebooting however I must admit that I 'd written those off as the typical `` home user '' that really did n't know what they were doing . Well , as a network engineer and systems administrator at one of the world 's largest computer companies , I have to throw my towel in to the absolutely worst network product I 've ever worked with here in the DI-624 . Please ... avoid this router at ALL costs .
 This would be a terrific router if it worked as advertised . The configuation screens are easy to understand and have a huge range of options . Wireless throughput , when it works , is fast and robust . The key phrase , however , is `` when it works . `` First , the firmware usually crashes every time you save a configuration change . Upgrades have not solved this . If you 're lucky you can recover by power cycling . If you 're not , you have to hardware reset and start all over.Second , if you do n't use a DLink receiver your wireless connection will cycle on and off about every 10 minutes.Finally , this is n't a problem with the router itself , but the `` installation CD '' is actually a 30-day demo for Network Magic , roping most users into needing the software . The manuals to configure the router yourself are PDFs hidden in the `` bin '' folder . That 's outrageously unethical.If you have a DLink receiver and already know how to configure a router , this might actually be good . But Dlink does n't deserve anyone 's business for this product .
 I was excited about these headphones because Creative usually has great products.I was sadly disappointed.The connector is clunky and surely going to wear out it 's flimsy wire on the jack.The bluetooth signal is weak , take a walk down the street and it begins to distort like crazy . It also distorts at high volumes which you will need to use anyway because the sound is so low.It runs out of power after only a few short hours.And worst of all , the headphones are impossibly tight , causing real discomfort . After only two days of using these headphones , I could n't take it any more .
 People here are complaining about uncomfortable headphones . Low quality connectors . Bad sound.They are the lucky ones!Connection is provided by Bluetooth protocol , Bluetooth requires pairing , and this `` device '' loses pairing as soon as adapter is connected to the sound source .
 1 . My head is not as big as Neal Cuveto , but the plastic arm broke after 1 week of wearing .2 . After about 2 weeks of use , the battery dies as soon as I put it on my head , or I put my hand between 2 ear pieces . I have to keep it charged all the time . It is not wireless anymore .
 Product is unsupported by Creative . I have a bigger head and they are uncomfortable to wear . Also , not working - though shown as connected . Not clear if they can be used with a bluetooth link seperate from the converter provided - which may be my problem . But as I said , not working and not supported.Dell also refuses to accept return .
 I ordered this product in August and have not recieved it yet . I just want to cancel the order .
 In short , decent sound was not offset by a high degree of discomfort from wearing these . They were n't particularly adjustable , and so if you do n't have a head that happens to work for them , it 's not going to work.I 'd recommend trying out a variety of headsets first , then checking the brands that seem to work for you . In the meantime , until the manufacturers realize that there is perfectly adequate `` fitting technology '' , we 'll stick with things that cost a fifth of what we 're paying for here and give a lot more .
 Avoid the Sony STR-DG710 receiver at all costs ! I owned it for 2 days before returning it . The promo literature says &#34; Optimized for Blu-ray Disc &#34; , and that is an outright lie ! I bought it for my PS3 for Blu-ray playback because my old Sony receiver only had digital optical audio input , and optical is limited to only 2 channel PCM . Well , guess what ? The HDMI audio on this receiver is limited to only 2 channel PCM . Dud ! You need to go with at least the DG810 to get 5.1 PCM audio . After a Sony tech rep told me that , I returned the DG710 and bought an Onkyo . Avoid !
 The left rear surround died after 2 years soon followed by both front speakers . Complicated setup , heat sensitive . Give it a pass . This is my third and last Sony product I will ever buy . I 've got a '70s era Pioneer in the shop that runs forever , I think I 'll give them a shot this time .
 Mine lasted all of 2 years and now it has stopped working . Up until now , I have never had a receiver last less than 7 years , so I am a little peeved . I ordinarily have good luck with Sony products , so I am fairly disappointed that this receiver died so soon . And FYI , I keep all of my electronics on surge protectors ...
 I purchased this Sony product with plans to connect a Blu-Ray to it . After speaking with the Sony customer tech suuport , I was told that the HDMI connections could not be used for either of the input-outputs because I have to hook it into my tv using a HDMI to DVI adapter . The Sony circuits would not support this type of connection , and would have to use a component type of connection . The unit is still sitting in the box.I purchased a Blue-Ray dvd player and it arrived yesterday . Needless to say , I did not purchase a Sony . I connected it directly into my TV using the HDMI to DVI adapter and had no problem . Sony needs to use a little more forethought when designing a product .
 I purchased this unit because of its reasonable price and HDMI capability . After replacing my existing receiver , I found that the front left and right channels and one of the rear channels had no output . After returning the unit and purchasing a replacement -LRB- of the same model -RRB- , I am well pleased . The set up was a snap . The automatic sound balancing worked perfectly . The HDMI works flawlessly . Once I got a working unit everything is good .
 It is a very good equipment , easy to use and sincronize with the Sony Bravia TV LCD , but I received this equipment in bad condition , I am an Amazon 's customer for year , and it is the first time I recived the product in not good condition ... . Please be carefuly with the packing and transportation you asign .
 Sound was very good but this system had one nagging flaw . By default Sony receivers are set to AV2 option which limits other universal remotes from being able to be programed to be compatible . This prevented me from using my SAT remote from being able to control volume on the receiver . I purchase this receiver to work with my Sony Bravia LCD with the hope of eliminating at least one remote but in fact added another just for volume control . I have seen in chat forums that other Sony receivers have the ablility to change from AV2 to AV1 . This is not supported in the documentation and tech support did n't have a clue . I have yet to find the work around for the STR-DG71 . Even if I had much of the funtionilty on the included remote would be lost in doing this . Sony needs to realize that though they have significant market share they need to play well with others . I wasted half a day , otherwise I 'm sure this would have been a great receiver . Too bad ...
 This unit has chronic failure of the left channel.I have had 2 units and both have exhibited the exact same problem . The left main channel arrived dead out of the box . I tried swapping speakers and wiring left to right - no change . I did everything Sony on-line and phone line suggested and nothing worked . Both the local Sony repair agent and Sony repair in Texas said 3 to 4 weeks to fix it . If there were a rating of zero I would have used that instead of 1 .
 The item arrived broken . I still ca n't believe that they sold me a broken item , when I went to turn on my receiver the power button fell inside the unit . I will never buy anything from Amazon again . I will tell everyone I know about my disappointment .
 This does NOT fit a 2003 GMC Sierra 1500 . I have the 6 disc in-dash CD factory stereo with the big Rectangle plug.This one has the setup fore 3 separate plugs coming in from the vehicle.Even though you follow the Amazon guide to select and see `` if it fits '' your vehicle , it is misleading.Wont bother to return this because it is Thursday night , I want my tunes in by Friday night . Looks like i have to go locally and get the plug .
 It listed my car as one that it will fit , but it did not and I ended up going to a local auto store and purchased one that actually worked .
 We ordered this harnes for my son 's Pontiac because it was supposed to be the correct harness . When it was time for the stereo installation we found out it was not and had to purchase another harness .
 did not match my car even when it said it would . After i tried it I could not send it back
 Yes , I know the fit guide says it does not fit , but i know the fit guide is n't always right , and I could have sworn i read a review that said it would fit a 92 camry . Welp , yes , sorely disappointed , had to go to walmart .
 Nicely constructed but does not fit my 2002 Oldsmobile Silhouette . The description `` For GM 87-05 '' is too vague .
 Althought it said it fit and the amazon garage feature said it would fit it does n't . It was for my girls 02 alero . I looks like it needs a 60 buck adaptor . I bought the radio because amazon said it would work . Not I have to spend 60 install a 40 dollar radio or return the radio and givemy girl the 40 bucks i spent on the radio for christmas . Thanks a lot Metra and Amazon . You ruined Christmas . J/K I am done with buying &#34; deal &#34; on amazon . Walmart is better .
 I had to go purchase a different wiring kit from a local radio store becasue this one did not fit .
 I could n't honestly say how good this is , because it turned out that the stereo unit I bought it for already had a wiring harness with it , so I did not need this one . Oh , and by the way , this harness did n't seem to fit my unit anyway . I only kept it because it was inexpensive and maybe one day it 'll come in handy somehow .
 Bought it for my 2003 Pontiac Sunfire . Hooked all the necessary wires up , disassembled the dash and popped out the radio , only to find that the harness DID NOT EVEN CLOSELY RESEMBLE the factory harness . If one is looking for sheer disappointment , have at it . Buy it in bulk then . Heck , go ahead and tell your kid Santa is n't real while your at it . Whatever tickles the ole pickle .
 Read the fine print . This does not fit ALL GM 88-05 . I have a 92 . Did it fit ? Not even a little . Amazon is always really great with returns though .
 This was indicated as the correct harness for my 2003 Pontiac Vibe , but is not . Find one that is the correct shape . -LRB- Also , per the reviews on that product page , the Metra harness sold specifically for the 2003 Vibe has a wiring problem -- I suggest a different product . -RRB-
 This wiring harness does not fit a 2001 Chevy Silverado . I had to purchase the right harness from the outfit that did the instalation for me .
 I bought this item going by what Amazon recommended . Do n't go by what Amazon is recommending you , go by its written in catalogs or consult a car stereo technician and save yourself time and money . I have a 06 Pontiac G6 and this wo n't fit .
 The product did not fit the range of vehicles the description said it would . Not worth shipping back to supplier.All total another $ 15 thrown away .
 It did not fit my 00 chevy silverado truck ! The connectors did not match . Item says it for all GM
 Part looked good but did n't fit.I even did the amazon fit checker . Kinda bummed but Im beginning to expect this from amazon . Oh well ill order the right one and be on my way .
 This does not fit my 2002 chevy as listed.What a waste of my time and money.At least it was cheap.but now i have to go get the right one and my truck is torn apart.I wish i could leave 0 stars
 Soldered all the connections from the head unit to this harness . Pulled out the factory unit , the connectors are different . i had to get the Metra 70-2003 Radio Wiring Harness For GM 98-Up Harness . The Metra 70-2003 Radio Wiring Harness For GM 98-Up comes with a red wire that needs to be connected the to fuse box and the red wire of the head unit . I guess the red wire on the Metra 70-2003 goes to nothing on the factor 2005 harness , no 12v , like the others have said . Connecting the red 12v wire to the fuse box is advanced . I 'm not doing it . Taking it to Best Buy for $ 160 .
 well this does not work for a 04 cavalier i went to autozone and bought another one make sure it fits before you soter it to the radio wires . I didnt and it took me 3 times as long to get my new radio in .
 AMAZON recommended me get this harnest for my HHR and it does not fit . I never contacted them because I just got a new stero last week and i ordered this a few months ago . Not sure if they will even refund my money .
 shipped very quick , came before expected . we were disappointed that it was the wrong one . but all the numbers were right .
 I bought this in anticipation of installing a stereo in my 2004 Chevy Impala . Yeah , the car audio place said it was n't compatible .
 This cable was supposed to mate with the harness in the dash of my 1991 Chevy S-10 and it was n't even close .
 If you have onstar , this is not the harness that you need . The one you need is between $ 90 and $ 180 , depending on where you go . Best Buy will knock you back $ 200 .
 I needed a harness for an ' 06 . This harness works for '05 and older . Too much trouble to return ... I just tossed it and used splicers to match my factory wiring . And a Haynes manual to get the colors right ...
 The part says 88-05 GM does not work with 04 cavalier . Had to throw part away not even close fit at all .
 This connector is not even close for a 2004 Chevy Blazer . Wiring with the harness was easy to hook up , but not all of the wires were not stripped and ready to go .
 I bought my son a bundle package that included this harness , however , it did not fit his 2000 chevy monte carlo LS . I had to go to Auto Zone to pick-up the correct one for the radio I was installing . The wrong harness probably works great in the car it 's suppose to work in but I gave it one star due to the inconveince I had to go through to get the correct one . So maybe this is on AMAZON and not on METRA . The `` Check if it fits '' did not work for me , because I checked and it said it would fit .
 Bought this for my 2001 Cavalier , soldered it to the radio , took that dash apart , then found out it wo n't fit my car ! They should provide more information what cars this adaptor will actually fit , instead of claming it fits `` GM 88-05 ''
 Do not buy the wiring harness if you own a 2000 to 2005 Oldsmobile , Buick Le sabre Pontiac Bonneville it will not work you will need pac cr2-gm32r to install a new stereo -LSB- ... -RSB- that 's where ya get it at good luck
 This product does not fit a 2005 Chevrolet Silverado w / OnStar and Bose Sound System . Instead the adapter for the OnStar and Bose Sound System is more than the price of the aftermarket radio I purchased . The correct adapter is about $ 130.00 at the lowest price I have found . Very Misleading on this product .
 I tried getting this product to work with my WinXP computer , and what wound up happening was a series of freezes , crashes , boot errors , and all sorts of miscellaneous problems . I finally just took the card out of that computer , because it was such a pain to deal with . Their tech support was non-existent . But , to make the best of it , I tried to put it in my Win2k computer . It took a few reboots and uninstall/reinstalls of the software and driver to get it working . But , once it got in , it worked just fine . A lot of effort though , if you 're not concerned about the wireless-g you might want to go with a USB adapter .
 I bought this card because I previously got the DI-624 router from costco and thought it would be a good idea getting everything from the same manufacturer . That was wishful thinking.The card never worked correctly . It installs fine , and the signal is always very strong , but the connection lasts 5 minutes at best . Eventually it will drop and neve reconnect , even though the signal indicator is still at 3 bars.First I thought it was my old Windows 2000 . So I upgraded to XP Pro . Same thing . Then I got a completely new mainboard , CPU , BIOS etc and thought that would do the trick . No avail . Even worse , the new PC started to have spurious hiccups , freezes and jittery games . All this stops when I disable the wireless card.D-Link tech support is clueless and suggest nonsense such as as ` it could be interference with your cordless phone ' . My Dell notebook with a dell wireless card works flawlessly in the entire house . So much to tech support.Summary
 BSD and system freezing is true . I removed this card and installed E-home and now I do not get BSD.I would like to find out , if all models of Dlink adapters have this problem .
 This card is supposed to plug and play with a PCI bus . Unfortunately , it does n't . It simply freezes the whole computer after a minute or so of running . No , I am not a numbskull , but an IT engineer with 40 years experience . What could be the problem . Well , first D-Link just do n't want to recognise any issue , and their web-site FAQ gives no answer . Yes , XP is patched to the latest and greatest . And yes the Drivers are up to the latest . And yes , I did try shifting PCI slots , messing around with the DMA on or off , and evening trying other drivers known to work with D-Link . But regrettably it is back to the store . D-Link , shame on you for releasing such an unready and crap product . I know that 50 % of us do n't get freezes , but what about the 50 % that do . Fortunately , I will get my money back . But no more fiddling around with cheap and untested junk .
 The product may perform up to your expectations but I only hope you never have to interact with D-Link 's support organization . After dealing with conflicting , contradictory and completely erroneous information from their support organization , I have come to the conclusion that I do n't care to do business with D-Link again.I hope that if you do buy a D-Link product it works flawlessly -LRB- which mine did not -RRB- , and you never have to call their tech support organization .
 Ok ... let 's face it . I 've read a ton of forums -LRB- because DLink knowledge base suck , and offer almost no support -RRB- . My conclusion is that 50 % of people who bought this card have their computer freezing each 5-60 seconds for no reasons while their computer was working at lightning speed before installing that card . The other 50 % say that it 's a very good card.So it mean that if you buy it , 50 % of chances that you just thrown out your money by the window because it wo n't work correctly.Think about it ... Just save some money & a lot of time . Just buy some other stuff ... there 's plenty of good companies doing very professionnal stuff for not much more $ than DLink . I wo n't suggest any of them ... but think about it . - No support -LRB- like i said , everything is going fine before you install this card . Then everything is going wrong when you install it . Then you call tech support and you get into the `` update your xyz driver , then update the other driver abc , then the other one , then get back to the old one , then change your DWL card from a PCI slot to another one . Put it closer to the case , put it far from the video card , put it ... In your ass finally . That 's what i call no support . -RRB- - 50 % of products should be in the garbage ... the decision is your.I 've been bad lucky ... i 'm in the 50 % who have freezing problem . I 've just burned another 75 $ . Good products = Plug it , and it work . If you have to go thru all the steps that tech support will ask you to do , that mean that someone have not done his job at DLink , and DLink even if they are aware , have absolutely no clue of what 's going on , and wo n't put people on this case ... . because they have other Wireless card to sell , newer , maybe better ... maybe not ... `` maybe '' ... it 's what describe DLink very well.For those who are putting that on your shelves to sell computer stuff , you should be ashamed . You contribute to this situation . If DLink ca n't sell their stuff anymore , believe me , they will solve their problems first , build themselve a name , then push some new stuff and they would be more carefull .
 I purchased this product , as well as the DI-624 Router , in part because of the positive reviews I found on Amazon.com.After using the product and returning it after four days , I am very suspicious about the validity of these reviews.I installed and reinstalled and reinstalled the router and the PCI Adapter , downloaded patches from the internet and checked and rechecked the router 's configuration . Virtually every time I tried to access the internet over the wireless network my connection was either dropped or my computer froze . The directions that came with both products provided very little information , the DLink website was equally uninformative , and after reading the comments on this site about DLink 's customer service line , I did n't even try to call . After four days , I gave up and returned both products and purchased the Microsoft MN700 base station and the MN730 PCI adapter . I had both products installed and running perfectly within 15 minutes.Do yourself a favor and buy a different product . You 'll save yourself a lot of frustration .
 i was skeptical about buying this product since i seen it at best buy on clearance and since i heard and read all of the horrible reviews on d-link products but i decided to give it a shot anyway since it would save me a good amount of moneyanyway to start off this card has a mind of its ownsomedays it will stay connected all day and night and other times it wontand when it dosent stay online beware this card will freze your computer up in seconds -LRB- im running a dell XPS dimension 3 With 1GB of DDR2 ram and a 3.4 mhz processor . . maybe im just an idiot and dont no anything about computers but that kinda makes me think that this product shouldnt be hogging my CPU usage -RRB- it also says that it has a 328 ft range indoors which is total of 10 meters -RRB- but funny thing is i cant connect past 50 ft.
 Usually you should discount reviews complaining about problems with a computer add-on
 I purchased a D-LINK G520 card for my PC running Windows XP Pro on an AMD processor . I am using is in conjunction with a D-LINK DI-624 wireless access point . I have downloaded and installed the latest drivers from the D-LINK website . I followed the installation instructions to the letter . The connection works fine , for anywhere from five minutes to an hour.After that , my computer freezes completely , every time . If I remove the D-LINK card and enable and plug in my regular LAN card , I have no problems . This is the only time XP has ever frozen for me , after over one year of use.I am in the process of testing the card under Linux , but as far as I know the only available drivers are in pre-production form.I am not certain what makes my PC different from that of the other reviewers , but if you search through you will note that several other reviewers have had the same problem . If the issue is solved , I will write another review explaining the fix . Until then , I recommend that you do not purchase this Wireless card .
 These DLINK wireless adapters have a known conflict with Sound Blaster cards . I tried to install one in my Gateway with Win XP and it would not work , after the third call to tech support they informed me there was a known conflict with Sound Blaster audio and told me to take out the Sound Blaster . Now I ask you what good is a silent computer ???
 I 'll bet you are n't if you are using this card.The reason I gave this ** rather than * is that it works great on XP and ME . But try using it with Vista running on a Core 2 Duo system , and the system freezes on bootup . My workaround is to disable the card , start up the system , then re-enable it . Then , it works fine . But one has to remember to disable it every time they intend to shutdown or restart their system . The D-Link website says there is a beta Vista driver , but I downloaded it and there was no change.And speaking of D-Link support , three years ago , when I purchased my first D-Link product , it was great . Now , they have apparently oursourced to Asia somewhere , and it absolutely sucks . The support rep had me trying to fix the problem by troubleshooting it as a generic network problem -- which it obviously is n't . It is a Vista/D-Link driver problem . He -LRB- or she -RRB- simply would n't accept the fact that there was no problem on my network.What was my final solution ? I drove two miles to my local Best Buy store and purchased a Belkin/USB wireless card for $ 17.95 plus tax . It works fine on my new Vista system .
 I bought the DI-624 and a DWL-G520 . Bad , bad , bad , very bad.The problem is the g520 . I can not get any decent signal strength . I even added a 6db microstrip antenna and it made no difference at all . More money wasted . All I can get under any circumstance is very low signal strength . It works somewhat until it drops the signal entirely . How useless it that !!?? This card is junk !! But at least it does n't freeze my computer .
 Since purchasing the D-Link DWL-G520 adapter along with the DI-624 router my computer has done nothing but freeze . As I have now read , I am not the only one with this problem and it has been a very frustrating experience . I am thinking now of moving the adapter into another slot but wondering if it would be worth my trouble . Perhaps I shoud just purchase from Linkys ???
 Bought the DWL-G520 from another internet merchant along with the DI-624 . The DI-624 works great , but this PCI card is the worst product I 've ever bought . Running on Win2K SP4 , it locks up my computer after 5 minutes of use everytime!After talking to clueless Level 1 Support several times and jumping their hoops -LRB- upgrade bios , upgrade sound card drivers , upgrade video card drivers , upgrade chipset drivers , upgrade OS service pack , use newest driver , revert to old driver , move the card to a different PCI slot ... -RRB- , I was finally able to have the card RMA 'd . But the same symptom happened with the replacement card they sent me . In all my years , this is the worst POS I 've ever come across and D-Link Level 1 Support is worst and most clueless support technicians I have ever encountered , EVER . Avoid this card if you value your time and money and if you ever need their support , skip to Level 2 support !
 This product caused my PC -LRB- HP 8660C with Windows 98 SE -RRB- to freeze every time after 5-60 minutes of use . Installing the latest drivers on the PC and the D-Link router , as well as two calls to customer service , did not resolve the problem . Reading the other reviews , clearly this adapter works on some PC configurations and not others . You might be lucky , or you might spend many frustrating hours trying to get it working . I returned it and bought a Linksys router and adapter with speedbooster , which work great . The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 star was the customer service , which was based in the US instead of India , and at least tried to solve the problem .
 I bought this PCI card and companion router -LRB- the DI-624 -RRB- upon reading reviews from several respected sources . To be blunt these components just never worked . In fact the DI520 card froze my desktop computer every time it was on ! Not a great way to be wireless ... Switched to Linksys and everything is great , fantastic , not a single call to tech support -LRB- compared to about 8 hours over five days with d-link -RRB- . In short , I doubt that this is a bad product , but it certainly is a one star rating for my experience . Finally , be sure you buy from a dealer that will allow easy returns because if you find yourself in a situation similar to mine , you will want to launch it and try something else .
 I have Two of these cards and ca n't get either of them to work in any of my 4 computers they have major driver issue 's that locks up your computer upon installing
 It started out great , no probs with connectivity . Then I updated the driver . After that if I left the PC on overnight , the next morning there would be a BSOD . Sometimes even after a couple of hours you would get one too , eventually I got tired of it and took the card out . I 've swithced to using cable now , had it out for over 6 months now and I do n't think I 'm going to put it back .
 My Dell Dimension XPS 400 Windows 98 SE has the Linksys WMP54GS card in it and it works perfectly . -LRB- The first time I installed it ! -RRB- This computer has a modem and did n't have a wired ethernet card.After trying the D-Link DWL-G520 AirPlus Xtreme G Wireless PCI Adapter 108Mbps card , which worked only once -LRB- after disabling the Dial Up modem -RRB- the Linksys card was the only card that the computer recognized , did n't freeze up during boot , and that connected to the wireless router the first time.With the WMP54GS , the dial up modem is still installed and enabled.I did n't have such good luck with my Compaq Deskpro P500 Windows 98 SE computer.This card stopped the computer during boot up , even before the screen shows the memory test . Something very serious happened during the bootup sequence that locked up the machine.It appears that older computers , especially Compaq , have unique charateristics that preclude using newer cards -LRB- read
 I purchased a DWL-G520 PCI card and installed it into my Dell 8200 desktop . The card works fine with my Belkin 802.11 g wireless router and seems to give me good data speeds , but the included software to control the card and modify the settings does not work . It will not recognize the card in my system -LRB- `` no card found '' -RRB- . I contacted D Link and they have a complicated procedure to remove the card , uninstall the drivers , reboot , reinstall the drivers , reboot , reinstall the card , blah , blah , blah ... Needless to say it did n't work . I also have a sound blaster card so maybe that is the problem ... I will be sending it back and getting the Belkin 54g PCI card . I have the Belkin 54g PCMCIA card for my laptop and did n't have any issues with the setup and use . If you go for the low cost solution ...
 I have had trouble with this piece of hardware since I installed it . I went through numerous conversations with D-Link support trying to identify the issue , installing different driver versions and none of them have worked . Do n't buy it , if you want my advice .
 I regularly get the BSOD -LRB- Blue Screen of Death -RRB- error message at least 1 time per week . The computer completely locks up . I have to restart my computer , losing whatever I was doing . D-Link as known about this for a long time , but through stupidity or arrogance , they refuse to release a driver update to solve this problem . I suspect they are `` done '' with this model and want everyone to buy their new MIMO models . I am finished forever with D-Link . BUYER BEWARE !
 I bought 2 adapters and a D-link router for my house . Both installs seemed to go perfect , the software install and setup of the firewall and encryption went without a hitch . I was up and surfing the net within an hour of opening the box , playing online RPG 's as well -LRB- I get up to 10 second lag spikes once every 10 minutes or so playing World of Warcraft , this is likely related to the driver issues explained below -RRB- . Then the problem showed itself ... BSOD -LRB- Blue Screen of Death -RRB- , lots of them.DRIVER _ IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUALIt is a statement I know well , I see it 3-4 times a week , once a day if I leave my computer running downloading a TV show I missed on a P2P . When I come home from work I can rest assured that some time during the day my computer will have went to the BSOD and I will turn my monitor on to see just that . When you hit the restart button and windows boots up again it will ask you if you want to make a report of the error , I have done just this in hopes there was a fix or I could find out the issue . You are put through to the Micorsoft website and given the info that the problem that has just crashed your computer has to do with the D-link adaptor and KNOWN driver issues . You are told to update to the most recent drivers and that if the issues persist to contact D-link -LRB- which is laughable , trust me , they wont get back to you -RRB- . The hardware seems to work great , when it works . The software on this product kills it . There is no excuse that the driver problems have not been solved , they have been around for a long time and exist for about 50 % of the customers that buy this product . D-link owes it to this huge group of people to work on this issue and release updated drivers that solve the problem . But as yet they have not done so , and it makes you wonder how much they care about those customers that are spending their hard earned money on this product . As such , 2 stars for their lack of concern . If they ever get those driver issues fixed such that the blue screen of death problem ceases to exist and getting rid of the occasional 10 second lag spikes of inactivity this would be a 4-5 star product easy.Wake up D-link , get this problem fixed.Windows XP Home edition SP2AMD 3700 +2 gigs of kingston 3200Geforce 7800 GTAsus A8N32 SLI DeluxeWD 36 gig raptorWD 200 gig CaviarD-link 520 Airplus XtremeGThe D-link is currently the crap component on an otherwise very nice rig , and the problem is all software and could be fixed easily if D-Link cared about the quality of its product and its customers . I can not reccomend this product until D-link shows some support for it , which may not ever happen , they are more likely to write it off and release something new , leaving all of us DWL-520 owners SOL . Sad .
 In spite of any positive thing you may have read elsewhere -- DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU ARE RUNNING WINDOWS 2000 . Your computer will freeze and crash . Save yourself the time and money . I had my new PCI card for only a week now and it 's going in the trash .
 I used this all summer long and had no problem ... HOWEVER , i recently moved to another city and as soon as I connected to my new wireless network , my computer FROZE ! I do n't know what else to do but get a new adapter . Nothing has worked to resolve the problem . I do n't understand why it worked fine for 3 months on one network but is total crap on another ... -LSB- sigh -RSB- .
 Like others , I had the computer freeze problem . I am running Windows 2000 Pro SP4 , and even after removing all my other PCI cards , this product still froze my machine . I downloaded and installed the latest driver from D-Link 's website to no avail . Be prepared to return this product .
 My experience is like a lot of others - I bought this unit with high expectations for good performance but found that it would regularly freeze up my machine . When I removed the offending unit the freezes were gone as well . Additionally , the installation manual had erroneous information in it . Ask yourself what kind of company would put out an untested product like this and still forge ahead with a clear conscience , and that just about sums up D-Link . I would recommend LinkSys or any other vendor until D-Link improves the quality , dependability , and reliability of their products .
 My experience with the DWL-2000AP has been very disappointing , not necessarily because it 's a bad product , but because of the way it 's being marketed and supported.I have two separate networks in my house - one on each end . Network A consists of the D-Link DI-624 Wireless Router which is wired to a DSL modem and a computer . The other network , Network B , consists of two computers and a network print server wired together via a 10/100 switch.I bought the DWL-2000AP based on the fact that one of its operating modes is that of a wireless client . -LRB- Wireless client mode allows a wired computer -LSB- or more via a switch -RSB- to communicate with another access point wirelessly ... at least that is my understanding . -RRB- The wireless client mode should allow me to connect Network B to Network A so that computers on Network B have access to the Internet . Furthermore , D-Link 's product description web page clearly indicates that the DWL-2000AP works with the DI-624 wireless router.After enabling the wireless client mode and configuring it to communicate with my DI-624 router , the two devices connected and I had full Internet access for all of my computers . This worked flawlessly ... until activity between the DI-624 and the DWL-2000AP ceased for more than five minutes . Thinking that I had configured something incorrectly , I checked my settings , and restarted the DWL-2000AP via its built-in web pages . Viola ... it worked ! Again , I browsed the Internet , and paused to read . And again , with no activity between the DWL-2000AP and the DI-624 , the connection dropped.I investigated this issue for the better part of a Sunday afternoon , testing various configurations , but to no avail . I then emailed D-Link technical support and got a response within two hours indicating that I should call the support hotline due to the complexity of my issue.I called . After 25 min on hold -LRB- the call is toll-free -RRB- , a support specialist answered , logged my issue , and walked me through a series of checks , but was unable to correct the problem.Lastly , the support specialist indicated that the wireless client mode was only supported from one DWL-2000AP to another . This , however , did not make any sense to me since the DWL-2000AP supports point-to-point , and point-to-multi-point bridging with another DWL-2000AP . Why add a proprietary wireless client mode if you already have a proprietary wireless bridging mode ? Realizing that the issue was beyond his remedy , I thanked him for his help and hung up.Obviously , based on how the device behaved for me , the DWL-2000AP was quite capable of communicating with the DI-624 router without issue . I temporarily resolved my disconnecting issue with a home-brewed Windows app that sent out a ping to the router every 4 minutes . This kept the connection alive so that communication was maintained . Since I was able to resolve the disconnecting problem , I believed that D-Link had a firmware bug and that the issue would probably be corrected in a future firmware update . -LRB- I guess I 'm too optimistic . -RRB- A few days later , I was checking D-Link 's support site for updates , and noticed that a firmware update for the DWL-2000AP had been posted . When I updated the firmware , the WAP and the router ceased communicating with each other altogether . Again I phoned D-Link tech support.I explained to the support specialist what my issue was , how I was able to temporarily resolve it , and asked when would D-Link have a correction . The support specialist vehemently indicated that the DWL-2000AP would only function with another DWL-2000AP in wireless client mode , and that there were no plans for supporting any other device with the DWL-2000AP in that mode.At that point I realized that my complaint was moot , and that , although D-Link was sitting on a gold mine if they supported what I asked , they did not care.After I hung up the phone , I promptly RMA 'd the wireless D-Link products I bought and returned them.I researched my issue further and found that Netgear easily supported my networking needs.It 's sad to know that a networking company has the hardware capable of supporting your needs , but is not interested in doing so . I 'll think twice before buying D-Link wireless products again no matter how nice the price might be .
 As had been plainly mentioned before in an earlier review -LRB- which I misinterpreted when buying it -RRB- , there is a caveat to this product , as confirmed by this unedited quote from D-Link 's own Tech Support website : `` Note
 I bought this AP to be a wireless client for my PS2 . Read the fine print , it will only act as a wireless client if you have another dwl-2000ap on your network . I tried and failed to get it to work with a di-624 wireless router . It doesnt make sense to me why they would even advertise this feature if it wont even work with their own products . DLink stated they were working on a firmware upgrade to make it compatible but no word on that yet . I 'm going to look at the Linksys wet54g next , hopefully I will have better luck .
 Quite disappointed with this product : - Sometimes does n't work , and restarting it through the configuration page does n't help . Needs to be restarted by powering it off and back on . - Terribly buggy javascript in the web configuration pages . The AP can not be configured with a standards compliant browser like Mozilla , and requires the use of Microsoft Internet Explorer -LRB- and even MSIE complains about lots of javascript errors -RRB- . That also means you need to have a Windows computer to be able to configure the AP . - When filtering Mac addresses , does n't give you the Mac address of a new computer in the drop-down list , so you could easily add it to the allowed clients . You have to disable filtering , restart the AP , connect to it from the new client , add the MAC address from the drop-down list , and finally re-enable MAC filtering . The alternative to this ridiculously convoluted procedure is to add the new MAC address by hand . - SNMP does n't seem to work . It can be configured with IP addresses for SNMP traps , but seems to never send anything there .
 I tested access with a lot of different wireless PC Cards , PCMCIA , etc , from D-Link , Intel , Dell , LinkSys . including D-Link DWL-G650 . The maximum effective throughput I was able to achieve was 1 Mbps . I am using the latest firmware from D-Link -LRB- the one they say corrects all the problems -RRB- . It does not depend on configuration -LRB- I tested all possible combinations -RRB- . It is compatible with any hardware , but with a very poor performance of 1Mbps . So little for a product that promises so much .
 Right out of the box , plug it in and it 's dead . SECOND TIME with Dlink products.So after 4 days and as many emails for support went un answered I decided to call . ARGH!After 45 minutes on hold with RMA dept I was told I need to talk to tech support first , -LRB- I do n't know about you but I 'm not sure why I need tech support to tell me how to plug something in -RRB- another transfer , another 45 minutes to be told it needs to go back to the shipper , in this case J&R Music World . And not one person that I spoke to was even remotely friendly . They all had the attitude that I was bothering them or something . I also have had problems with the DWL-AB520 PCI card adapter . I have 3 of them on three different machines but one is quirky . To which Dlinks response is it must be the machine and there 's nothing more they can do . It 's not , it 's the card . I work in IT and I 'm positive that it 's a defective card . But I 'm stuck with it.Even when their products work the transfer speeds come no where close to their claims , cut the speeds by 1/4 and you have more realistic speeds . I have setup multiple tests in the best environments possible.Bottom line , I 'm moving on to Linksys or Netgear . I have tried to stay with Dlink only because if you build a network with the same companies products you should have less troubles ... right ? Wrong.Be very , very cautious and think twice before buying Dlink products .
 What a piece of junk . I should have learned my lesson . Out of the seven Dlink products I bought 4 are broken . Never had this problem with 3com or Netgear . In fact I replaced this unit with Netgear 's .
 I finally found out why we consumers are suffering with tech support for this product and the same products of other brands.A tech for Dlink finally admited to me on the phone that when we purchase the latest and greatest G class routers and access points to create a wireless network , why we can not get it to work even with tech support.It is because of Tech support . Simple reason is that they are not up to speed on the glitches and major details needed to get us going . He actually admited that to me.Besides the poor manuels , the company did not train the techs as well as they should have . New Technology folks!To us , it is something better and faster and we jump on it like children to candy . New and Improved in advertising has been tempting us for generations and we jump in before they get the bugs out . This is why some work easy and some dont.It all depends on a thousand variables.If we dont have the patience to wait until they get all the bugs out , we will have to suffer on the phone with tech support.We are in a sense the beta testers for the various tech support teams.We can only blame ourselves in this particular instance .
 I just ordered the Fujifilm SC-FXA3-US Deluxe Padded soft case for my camera . It was only $ .50 cents but I was astounded to learn the shipping cost was $ 13.00 . How can this be permitted ? I work for the Postal Service and know our rates are the cheapest of all the competitors and would not cost $ 13.00 with anyone to mail , except for overnight delivery .
 although the main part of the case in which my camera resides is useful , I was dismayed when I received it as the strap had one clip broken and the first time I opened and closed the additional pocket , the zipper broke . The only reason I have not returned it for a new one is that the cost of shipping would make it too expensive .
 Well , I guess you get what you pay for . Threads are constantly coming out of this . It 's falling apart fairly quickly . I ca n't complain too much because it was so cheap.With that said it does seem to be padded enough to protect the camera .
 drive your car go to any supermarket.Spend same amount of money you can get much better stuff !
 The zipper was broken within one day , and the hook was broken within two days .
 Vista 64 will consume nearly all of the space on this drive as it create loads of files in order to opperate in 32 and 64 enviros . You will be left with about 10g of space after a little bit . It really is not that fast but it is cheap . And , it is 74gb not 740gb as it shows in the title .
 First of all , the picture quality of this is amazing and I had no complaints for the first 6 weeks before breaking down . It is currently being repaired at HP and has been out of service for 3 weeks . They have no clue when they can return it because of the number of people in front of me for there repair . I told them to just send me a new one but they would n't budge on there warranty policy . I just have to wait . So now Im out $ 2000 and have nothing.Normally , HP would do a FedEx overnight exchange on this product but because of the back log of repaires it is not possible at this time . I ca n't help but wonder , if so many are in for repair , is there a reliabilty issue . If I had my wish , I would want my money back and get a different brand
 When I first set this up it performed perfectly - picture is great , I bought it for DVD play back and use a PC for doing just that ; you ca n't beat XGA DVD play back using a PC . -LRB- well you could n't at the time anyway , but you can buy HD DVD players now which should do just as well -RRB- . 2 months later it kept shutting down with the Lamp Fail indicator lit . I phoned HP and after a few calls they sent a new lamp with little fuss , cheers HP ! But the new lamp had some sort of problem and it produced bright patches on the screen -LRB- the kind I did n't want - by the way HP I do n't think ANY of your users would be stupid enough to NOT try projecting a different image , DUH -RRB- . After another couple of calls HP sent a second replacement lamp , cheers again . Everything was fine for a few months , but now the main cooling fan has failed , so the thing overheats and shuts down . I could n't resist the temptation and opened the unit up -LRB- its just a bloody $ 5 fan crippling my $ 2000 projector -RRB- : THE GUTS ARE ALL BENQ ! This projector appears to be a rebadged BENQ projector . Only thing is that BENQ 's equivalent is only 1700 lumens / 200W lamp . HPs is 2000 lumens / 250W lamp . Is my HP fitted with an overpowered lamp perhaps ? Did HP decide to squeeze too much from their -LRB- ahem ... i mean , BENQs , or do I really mean ACERs ? -RRB- design?Conclusion : This projector looks and feels like HP - but does it last like HP ? I might be the unlucky one .
 We bought this unit for use at the office and it worked great for the first few months . Then it started searching for signal from time to time . Now it just quits working after about 30-40 minutes with the Lamp Fail indicator lit . A shut down wait 5-10 min and restart gets it running again , at least for a time.After reading the other review about BenQ insides did a little searching and found the BenQ PB8220 looks very much the same as the VP6120 . Hmmmm we feel cheated and are looking into repair/return options .
 The E550 is a good camera and this lens does do a good job of zooming in on the subject but due to the way the camera and lens are designed , you must have the camera 's zoom fully extended in order to use this tele lens . So this means if the subject is moving around a lot , such as my daughter playing soccer , you will miss the shots where the action has moved to close to you because you ca n't zoom out . As long as the action remains at some distance to you than this zoom lens is useful . I unfortunately have too many ruined shots because the action moved too close and their heads get cut off , etc.Another negative is that the viewfinder does n't show the zoomed in image , you must use the lcd screen to frame a shot , which can be difficult in bright sunlight .
 I have n't got this item because it is too expensive for what it gives . I have a Fujifilm E550 camera which cost is USD 250.00 by this date . This lens cost is USD 95.00 and it need a special adapter ring that cost extra USD 20.00 . That means you will pay USD 365.00 for a 8x zoom camera . For that price or less you can get a +10 x SLR like camera like the Fujifilm S5100 or S5200 .
 I wanted to give 4 stars , but I am unable to change the ratings.I am pleaased with this product , works well , we use it in our church .
 The positive reviewers for this product are shills for Cavalry . Check all their reviews and see they just post good reviews for all Cavalry products . The Cavalry products are cheaply made , loud , and unreliable .
 This unit requires disassembly to hook up wires ???? Has a sticker saying if you disassemble , you can NOT return . Requires software installation from CD , etc , etc. . NOT A PLUG N PLAY by any means . I sent mine back . Basically a 3rd world country low quality copy of a generally good products . Get a MAXTOR , SEAGATE or WESTERN DIGITAL if you want QUALITY ...
 Seemed to work fine when I took it out of the box and performed an intial back up . But a couple weeks later when I tried to back up again the thing would n't power up . Later on it seemed to power up , but the computer ca n't see it . Documentation is cheezy . Came with no warranty or return information . Do n't buy this crappy product .
 I bought this one 7 months ago , and admittedly it worked generally OK before it abruptly failed , but its unreliabilty is obvious from the beginning - it 's hot and sometimes loud , and is often not recognized by the operating system upon bootup . The worst thing is that it may fail anytime when you confidently entrust your most valuable data to it.Yesterday it totally failed to be recognized by my desktop , and I tried everything in vain to revitalize it , including reinstalling the driver , putting it in the freezer , plugging/unplugging dozens of times , and trying on 3 other computers . I eventually ripped the enclosure apart and used its internal IDE HD as a secondary hard drive on my computer , and it was promptly recognized and accepted by my desktop , and fortunately all the valuable data were intact.This external HD is shoddy and prone to heat damage and should be avoided by all means , unless you do n't mind having a time bomb to ruin valuable data . Trust me , avoid this silly dudue and if you do buy it , do n't backup your data to this unreliable device alone and be prepared to turn it into a 2nd internal drive when it fails .
 The FM stereo does not pick up well at all . I can not get many local stations . The description says it uses USB 1.1 for quick transfers . This is misleading advertising . USB 1.1 is the slower transfer method . USB 2.0 is the faster one.Where this device excels is in conjunction with a MP3 player . The rechargeable battery means you can use it away from a power supply for a long time . The sound is excellent.This would get 3 stars due to the slower transfer speed , false advertising , and poor FM . It gets 2 stars because the price is too high for a refurbished model.I got this for $ 19.99 directly from Philips web site . I would check there first .
 DO NOT BUY THIS FROM THE FACTORY DEPOT.I ca n't say anything about this product from other vendors but FactoryDepot sent me a remanufactured generic toner cartridge instead of the Verbatim listed.They have this remanufactured cartridge listed elsewhere for $ 10 less.If you 're going to get a remanufactured generic cartridge go to one of the other vendors like Professor Ink and get it for under $ 30 shipped .
 Bought this case for the F440 camera I recently purchased . I figured for $ 25 it would be a good case . It is worth about 10 bucks . One , it is not padded very well , and two , it only closes with a snap button , which makes it easy for someone to pop open , especially if you attach it to a belt-something to consider if you travel a lot . Anyway , I went to Best Buy and bought a nice padded case that fit the camera almost perfectly for $ 8.99 , and has an interior pocket for an extra battery or mem . card . I suppose it is stylish , but the utility to cost ratio is not very good .
 I expected a better quality case for this amount of money .
 I have owned an iPod mini for about 5 months now , and when the nano came out I was considering selling my mini on ebay and then buying a nano . Thank 's to my friend buying one that he dropped on carpate and haveing it break in half and another person I know do the same thing but have the screen only stop working I decided not to . The iPod mini is durable I dropped mine on brik pavers and it only has 3 scrates and it works perferct and it was n't in a case it dropped because it fell out of the belt clip that came with it . Try to find an iPod mini somewhere , and save yourself . But if you do go with the nano I 'm not to blame for the horrible design flaw when your 's breaks.P.S . - I forgot go to somewhere with them on display you can see that the black scrates easily so get white I you decide to ignore what happend to the people I know .
 The price keeps getting lower on Amazon & customer service does not respond to my inquiries . There are different prices throughout the day which is ridiculous .
 I have owned two iPods in my life . The first was the Mini , which was great , but I bought it because I did n't even really know about the other competition.When the Nano came out , I figured I 'd take the opportunity to replace my tired sad little mini . The clickwheel did n't pick up my fingers in some parts anymore and other odd little quirks , nothing serious however.I got the wee little nano -LRB- and yes , it is by far the tiniest thing worth even looking at -RRB- . The first thing I did with it was load up all the music in my iTunes library and then connect it directly to my logitech THX speakers . To anyone who says this guy sounds better than any iPod before , you are wrong . It is exactly the same . To determine the cause for this I looked up the specs on it , and they blatantly told me that the audio processor is identical on all 2g mini 's and the 5g iPods , and yes people , in the world of portable players , decoding is ENTIRELY hardware.That said , it still sounded good . Then one fateful minute , I got careless and cracked the screen . I thought to myself , well , I am kinda a brute when it comes to electronics . So i sent it back to apple and waited 2 weeks before I got my repaired little victim of pocket change . by now it was thoroughly scratched , which really does n't bother me because I figure , who sees the stuff in my pocket . Then the battery died ... two weeks later it comes back -LRB- apple has to be the most irritating company to deal with too I must say , they have a strong-held belief in their superiority over the rest of humanity -RRB- . This caused me a bit of irritation , but hey , stuff happens.I went out and got a protective case for it , just to be safe . When I pulled it out the next week , it was more scratched than ever before , apparently some lint in a stiff wind will scratch this sucker . Now it was to the point wher the screen was getting blurry -LRB- and ya , I know I should n't keep it in my pocket , but I 'm sorry , I do n't feel the need to show the entire world that I have a nano , and I figure , pockets were invented before the nano , apple should have made it `` backward compatible '' -RRB- By now I 'm getting a bit unhappy with the way I have decided to spend my hard-earned money , to the point that looking at the thing makes me angry . It still works , and they did manage to fix the screen problem from what I can tell , but ya know what ? I wish it was a bit more user-servicable -LRB- ie , I could have replaced the battery and saved myself 2 weeks of waiting -RRB- . Well , in short , I went out , looked at the nifty new color version of the Creative Zen micro , the microPHOTO , ooo ... cool name guys . It looked and felt more sturdy , I could hold it in my hand like a cell phone and play with it and I have come to rely on all the other features that Apple sells peripherals to take care of . -LRB- I can record stuff through a mic , listen to FM radio and use my standard backup program to treat the Zen as a portable harddrive , without any third party software , something that my iPod 's never really supported -RRB- . It is a dandy little machine , and it is all the rage , and I did like it at first , trouble is , when the shine wears off -LRB- like when you touch it -RRB- it is n't really all that special , it is kinda limited in features , and who really cares about album art when your screen is 1.5 inches across anyway ?
 I purchased my 4 GB iPod nano less than one year ago -LRB- it is still under warranty -RRB- . However , recently , the screen does not show up -LRB- even though it does light up -RRB- . I called customer service and I received an email and followed all the steps to restore my Ipod . Unfortunately , it did not bring about any changes . So my phone call was then directed to a manager named Janet , who I had to wait for half an hour to speak to . I explained for something that costs 250 , it should at least last more than a year . I did not want to have to deal with the hassles of sending my Ipod back and receiving a receiving a refurbished Ipod that is only under warranty for another 3 months . Although , I am under warranty , it still costs 30 dollars to have it shipped/serviced for that `` new '' refurbished Ipod . The other option available is that I pay 59 dollars to have the product under warranty for another year -LRB- and then the shipping/service to have it fixed is waived -RRB- . But what I 'm saying is , `` How can a customer have faith in a refurbished product when a brand new product could not last an entire year ? '' Janet , the manager , said that this was the only option for me , even though my Ipod was still under warranty . The `` warranty '' that they advertise is apparently , up to them to decide on the spot -LRB- they get to use their discretion -RRB- . I was then placed on hold again for another half an hour , only to be directed to customer service to have them tell me to go to a website to process the return myself anyways . I have lost complete confidence in apple products and apple customer service ; had I not invested so much in my Ipod I would thrown this Ipod away a long time ago .
 Ok , the 2 girls wanted one each . Looks simple , 1st page plug and and follow the directions . Well page 5 tells you how to change it , I have it plug in and charging going on 3 1/2 hours and still on the opening screen , do not disconnect .
 I guess the sales people forget to tell you certain things about the IPod , so I am saying this now : THE BATTERIES ARE NON-REPLACABLE . Sure , you can buy into a battery extension program for a maximum of one extra year with IPod AUD$ 99.00 ... But I do n't think I will waste my money on it . I 'll buy the Creative Neeon with replacable battery or the new Sony NWA1000 .
 The 40GB click wheel iPod I bought for my husband for Christmas last year died -LRB- hard drive fried -RRB- 360 days after he opened the box but one year and 3 weeks past when I bought it . Appeals to an Apple Store and the `` Apple Cares '' -LRB- how 's that for an oxymoron ? -RRB- phone line fell on deaf ears . They were unwilling to make any exception or provide discounts on a replacement , '' ... our warranty clearly states ... from the date of purchase ... '' . So , in all caps , if you must buy an iPod , BUYER BEWARE ! Think of this as a disposable purchase that will only last as long as the warranty .
 IPods are Rip-offsThe iPod 's not the only music player you can get , It 's just that there are MP3 players people have not met.If they just knew what the other players had in store for them , They 'd know the iPod stinks so bad it came from a pig 's pen.The iPods soar to the top of the list of MP3 players like kites , But why not get a better player with more gigabytes?Sandisk and Creative have some pretty decent devices , Yet people cling to iPods even with their retarded prices.The Sandisk Sansa E100 has many , many things , An FM radio , recording , and movies make it the king of kings.Does the iPod Nano have this stuff ? No , it does not!The Nano lacking all these features is definitely its weak spot.The Creative Zen Micro Photo also kills the Nano for an amazing deal , It has so much more for so much less that it 's basically unreal.Radio , recording , and replaceable battery make it a better player , For less than the Nano ... are you kidding ? It 's definitely a Nano slayer.There 's a player that blows the iPod Shuffle into outer space , It 's called the Samsung YP-U2 and it definitely earns its place.FM tuner , voice recorder , and screen make it a great buy , The fact that the Shuffle does n't have these things should make Steve Jobs cry.The Creative Zen Vision

 Love this little guy but I can hardly read the screen after 5 days of delicate use because it is so scratched up . I 'm extremely upset that my 249.00 piece of electronic fun is going to need plastic surgery soon to be able to use it .
 Pros : + Impressive design . Simple and very elegant . + Good support and integration from 3rd party.Cons : - Poor battery life . The UP TO 14 hours is realisticly 8 hours for new batteries . -LRB- Lets hope the battery last for a least a year -RRB- - Locked to iTunes . No every machine has iTunes installed . - One-way sync means no backing up your music . - Easily scratches . - Overpriced accessories . - No radio . - No recording . - Restrictive file format support . - OPTIONAL charger !!! For the price , who are we kidding.IMO , the Nano is not worth its value . Apple should be very proud of the campaigning job they 've done with the Ipod .
 This is a great sounding player with a lot of features that I really like . Unfortunately , I rarily get to enjoy them because the unit has so many problems . Pray you never get the exclamation folder . If you do n't know what I 'm talking about , consider yourself lucky . After multiple calls to the help center , downloading the latest updater software -LRB- two updates so far -RRB- that the help center said would fix my problem and all the bugs these units have , and searching the support site for advice from others that may have had this problem , I 've given up and am sending it back to Apple . If you get the Nano , make sure you also get the Apple extended warranty .
 I got an iPod nano no longer than a week ago , it is amazing absolutley fantastic , its a beautiful piece of machinery ... . but it sucks . Its great in sound quality , etc but the second day i had it the screen scratched , im ok with that I was pretty pissed but i got over it . The 5th day i had it it scratched the screen again . And the final straw was when the screen cracked completely and ruined the whole thing . this was because my cat jumped on the table it was on and it happened to fall off . So great all my money is gone to waste , i demanded a refund and got my money back . I went out and bought an iPod mini . Ill wait until I know for sure that these nanos are gon na be safe to walk around with . All the iPods are superior in holding up with a little abuse . But when you make silly mistakes like leaving in on a table that happens to fall apart it really makes you angry because you wish these things had some durabilty ... The only reason im not completely panning this fragile electronic is because it looks good , it sounds good , and the battery is ok . On the other hand its as fragile as an eggshell . How can you carry that around everywhere?Stick with the iPod Photo or Mini for now ... . you 'd wish you had when your nano turns to a scratched up cracked mess.Wait a year or so I say.By the way ... . that tv ad for the nano where the hand is playing around with the nano with his fingers flipping it around , is bs !! If that dropped your screwed , so I dont reccomend you do what the hand is doing in that ad !!
 I do n't really feel like going into a lot of detail about the problems I had with this horrible product , since I 'm sure all of the iPod-attics will rain down thier bizarre cult-like craziness on me , but here goes anyway.The first set of problems came when I found that you ca n't just plug the player into your computer and drag and drop files onto it - like every other mp3 in the world . You are forced to use iTunes , which changes the file format of the mp3 's into a special Apple file format . This angered me , as one of the reasons I bought the thing is so I could transfer the mp3s that I loaded onto it onto all of my friends computers . But that 's not possible thanks to Apple 's insistance on changing my mp3s into thier own speacial file format.This led me to the realization that marketing this product as an mp3 player , is false avertising , because it does not actually play mp3s.Next , after deciding to do what the iPod told me to do , I had to update the software 10 times before I could get a song to play on it . I tried to call customer support for help at one point and ... . let me just put it this way , there is no customer support.After many hours I got the thing working and got some songs on there . At this point I was actually excited about the product , because I was under the impression my problems were over.After a couple of days the battery started going dead after only 1 hour of use , even when fully charged . Grudgingly I called Apple back and , after waiting 2 hours on the phone , was authorized to send it back for a replacement.When the new one arrived I had the exact same problems setting it up that I had had the first time .10 days later the unit stopped working all together and would not even power on . I am still in the process of trying to get another replacement and I 'm beginning to think that I 'm not getting one.This has been an absolute NIGHTMARE ! Never buy anything from Apple , they suck and they are crooks !
 My first ipod broke after a month , it died , it did nothing . I called apple , mailed it back and received a replacement . The SECOND replacement , did not work properly , I sent it back . I received replacement number 3 , its dead , it does nothing . I have called customer service numerous times , and they have tried to reset it , I switched cables , I have tried everything they have suggested to me , its still dead . The customer service I have received is appalling , I have been ` disconnected ' a number of times . I wish I could return the whole thing and get my money back !!! DONT DO ITI would also like to add I purchased the ipod in February , I expect to be given a new one this month -LRB- June -RRB- so every month I get a new IPOD that ultimately breaks , its infuriating and ridiculous . I HATE IT I spend more time trying to get them fixed then I actually get to listen to it
 This is a delicate product . It 's all scratched up after only a week of use . They may be superficial , but lets face it , we 're paying a big premium because this thing LOOKS GOOD . It should look good for more than a freaking week ! Also the battery seems to take forever to charge , which is surprising . I hear that the new Sony mini players are a better bet.Update
 after buying 2 of these for family members it turns out they suck ! they scratch SO easy it not even funny . i gave them as gifts to some family members who were very excited but after opening them and passing them to 2 other friends sitting with us they were scratched how the heck can a brand new item get scratched in 2 min without leaving the hand ?!? come on apple get off you bottom and fix this prob or i will NOT buy your products this coming holiday season for the rest of my family -LRB- which is kinda large and they all want nanos -RRB- . untill apple sorts out this issue my review is 1 star but i really wish it was like -5 stars because thay how much it sucks . fix the scratches!hb .
 1st the ipod is expensive . It should at least come with a protective cover . 2nd i rarely used it and only when im in the gym . Quite to often when i go to turn the ipod on it goes into something called `` disk mode '' which freezes the unit up and cant be played . Theres not hard reset button so i have to go without listening to music for the hour or so im in the gym then take it home plug it in the cpu to get it to unfreeze . Im so pissed at this thing because im all exicted to finnaly listen to some music and get amped in the gym and the dang thing freezes . For the money i spent on this thing it shouldnt happen
 You can only load music into the Apple Ipod Nano through your computer on a program called ITunes . Loading the software onto your computer can be a major problem . I downloaded it and it refused to open . Apple 's literature and online `` support '' was useless . Simply stated it is not user friendly , it does not tell you what to do in plain English . As usual a GOOGLE search with a few key words produced a number of boards loaded with people with the same problem . Thank goodness these people are kind enough to post solutions . In this case it has to do with the fact that the ITunes software has to operate with another program , a player called Quicktime . If both of these programs are not properly installed you will have a problem . The solution seems to be to first remove both programs entirely , restart your computer , and then install Quicktime -LRB- alone without ITunes -RRB- first before installing Itunes -LRB- alone without Quicktime -RRB- . That 's how I got it to work after 2 hours of repairing , installing , uninstalling , etc. . Another problem is that it will not work -LRB- that means WORK after installation -RRB- unless it is installed and operates with `` administrator privileges '' meaning that if a child is using it they must have `` administrator privileges '' on the computer.Second problem - After you finally get ITunes to run you learn that once files are downloaded onto the Ipod Nano the only way that they can be removed is through Itunes with the Ipod connected to the computer . You can not delete them directly from the Ipod . Again instructions and support are not user friendly . They tell you to look somewhere on the screen -LRB- they are not specific -RRB- for the Ipod icon to start the delete process . What they do n't tell you is that it only appears for a limited time upon the initial connection of the Ipod to the computer . If you do n't find it before it disappears , you must disconnect and reconnect for it to reappear again , there is no way of just bringing it up on the screen again . And the deletion process is far from simple once you find the Ipod icon.Basically this thing is nothing more that a portable computer jukebox . The process of loading and changing songs in it should n't be so difficult .
 iPod Nano 's are exceptionally terrible . Do not buy them unless you have a spare $ 200 to waste . Mine broke in 32 Days , and apple will have nothing to do with the repair . Thanks iPod , for a waste .
 . . or any album , -LRB- e.g. many Dance , Classical or Progressive Rock picks -RRB- where the tracks run together seemlessly . In other words , NO GAPLESS PLAYBACK . Instead you get a split second of silence interrupting tracks that should run together without any disturbance.Completely unforgivable for a 5th generation product from the Market Leader!Bad Apple!GaryP.S . The MP3 format has a flaw which means some silence is always present at the end of a song . But the popular LAME encoding method for MP3s embeds a value containing the proper length of the track into the file so that the decoder can tell when the file should be cut and the next mp3 in sequence should start playing . The Rio Karma -LRB- 20GB -RRB- , and some PC-side players have this feature . Even `` Aeroplayer '' for the Palm PDA has this feature .
 Macworld magazine quoted Phil Schiller , Apple 's senior vice president of worldwide product marketing , late Tuesday having said that the broken screens were due to a `` vendor quality issue '' . Apple finally admits it.So to everyone who called those with broken/scratched Nanos idiots and liars , I say call yourself lucky that your 's is n't one of the duds , and ask that you apologize to those you flamed.To those stuck with the broken units , get back with Apple and demand a replacement for the DEFECTIVE product.I still would give this thing 0 stars if it were an option .
 This ipod is by far the worst thing I have ever had the misfortune to purchase . It scratches soooo easily , it makes it look a year old after the first week . It is ridiculously small , i almost lost it twice , why is it so small ? its so impractical . A few other points , you can only charge it when your computer is on , which sucks if you or going on a vacation or something . The earphone slot is on the bottom , which almost forces you to buy the ipod earphone accessories that apple sells , as well as the case and probably the dock as well ... - . - If you are going to buy this , do n't count on the initial $ 249 being the final price . you will have to pay 30 for the cases 40 for the earphones and another thirty for the dock . altogether it will be $ 349 plus tax >:-LRB- not good . look but do not touch !!
 I purchased my 4 GB iPod nano less than one year ago -LRB- it is still under warranty -RRB- . However , recently , the screen does not show up -LRB- even though it does light up -RRB- . I called customer service and I received an email and followed all the steps to restore my Ipod . Unfortunately , it did not bring about any changes . So my phone call was then directed to a manager named Janet , who I had to wait for half an hour to speak to . I explained for something that costs 250 , it should at least last more than a year . I did not want to have to deal with the hassles of sending my Ipod back and receiving a receiving a refurbished Ipod that is only under warranty for another 3 months . Although , I am under warranty , it still costs 30 dollars to have it shipped/serviced for that `` new '' refurbished Ipod . The other option available is that I pay 59 dollars to have the product under warranty for another year -LRB- and then the shipping/service to have it fixed is waived -RRB- . But what I 'm saying is , `` How can a customer have faith in a refurbished product when a brand new product could not last an entire year ? '' Janet , the manager , said that this was the only option for me , even though my Ipod was still under warranty . The `` warranty '' that they advertise is apparently , up to them to decide on the spot -LRB- they get to use their discretion -RRB- . I was then placed on hold again for another half an hour , only to be directed to customer service to have them tell me to go to a website to process the return myself anyways . I have lost complete confidence in apple products and apple customer service ; had I not invested so much in my Ipod I would thrown this Ipod away a long time ago .
 I am so sorry I wasted my money on this iPod . It 's unreliable and does n't work most of the time . The battery runs down fast ; iTunes frequently wo n't recognize it and I 've had to reset a dozen times . Oh yeah , it went back to the factory once . They said it 's fine . I wish I could get my money back .
 NO STARS ! MINUS SEVERAL BILLION STARS ACTUALLY.The demand for smaller and smaller devices has finally come to a dead-end . This product is way too fragile for the consumer market . Indeed using it as displayed in the advertising will get you a damaged Nano with Apple saying - ` Yes , well we may advertise people putting in their pocket , but we never expected anybody would . I 'm afraid keeping the Nano in your pocket is considered abuse of the product and therefore * NO * WARENTEED replacement or FREE REPAIR is available.DON ' T buy it or any other Apple product until they stop screwing the public like this .
 Dont buy it i bought one when it first came out and within the week i got it the screen cracked . The nano is so delicate that it can break in the palm of your hand . And the warranty does not cover it so apple told me to pay $ 250.00 to repair it . And thats the same price i bought the ipod nano for .
 On Feburary 10 2007 , I will have had my Ipod Nano for approximately one whole year . Not once have I ever dropped this thing -LRB- I bought the protective case the same day -RRB- and I have never experienced any real problems out of this product . My one and only complaint is the lack of battery life . Why after 10 and a half months am I only getting about 2 hours of battery life out of this thing ?? I refuse to send it in for a battery replacement so that the same thing can occur once again next year . I think that I will just purchase the Zune which has so much more to offer than the Ipod and I will advise all others to do the same . Besides , Microsoft rules over Apple anyways !!
 My husband bought me the Nano for my birthday . It has never worked properly . The second it is unplugged from the power source , it goes to sleep and can not be unfrozen until the battery drains completely , usually a day . This is apparently so frequent a problem that it is the # 1 troubleshooting topic on the Apple support site . The Nano can not transfer from mac to pc , despite the USB hookup . Customer service is virtually non-existent . On-line support consists email suggesting articles to read . The end . I decided finally after six months and 20 days to send the thing back , something I did not want to do because my Nano is engraved . Because I crossed the six month line , I have to pay $ 33 for shipping and handling because it has to arrive in THEIR box . The disclaimer page removes virtually all responsibility for anything needing repair and includes -LRB- starts off with -RRB- the promise to charge $ 100 for diagnostics unless a miracle occurs and they think the problem is actually on their end . If they actually fix the problem without charging me $ 100 or more , I will eat my Nano . .
 I received an ipod nano 4gb as a gift . It was great other than it got WAY scratched up in about a day of usage . After having it & using it for about 3 weeks , I had it in my pants pocket , when i took my pants off that evening it destroyed the screen . It still worked but the screen was completely damaged . It worked for a good 2 or so months later & then when completely dead . It would be one thing if all these problems came with a cheaper price , but $ 250 is an insane price to pay for something that will not be sturdy whatsoever & couple possibly give you less than 2 months of usage . I strongly recommend you pass this up & purchase a product that is actually reliable .
 I have just arranged to return my black nano due to the amazingly soft plastic that covers the front of the device . This material scratches even when wiping with a soft cotton t-shirt . The result is a device that looks as though it has been abused and neglected . I had only peeled off the protective cover and wiped the grease marks away when I noticed the first scratches across the whole length of the front . Damned annoying.Apple have an issue with this device and they need to fix it . Why should I be compelled to nuy a case that makes the player larger than it needs to be and why ca n't I put it , naked , in my pocket as advertised by Mr Jobs or wear it next to clothing?My advice , go and look at a display device in a store and make sure it is one which has the protective cover removed . You will love the size and the screen and the weight but you wo n't buy one .
 I bought a iPod Nano two months ago , and it suddenly stopped working . However , unlike my other portable electronics and cell phones that I have dropped numerous times over multiple years , m iPod had never even been dropped . However , when I took it to the Apple store , they said that they refused to do anything about it but told me that I could get 10 % off a replacement product . I strongly recommend avoiding this product .
 I got the black one and got a few scratches on it . I jog every weekend for about 25 minutes each morning . Condensation got under the screen and it 's not covered in my warranty . It still works but for this price , unexcusable .
 I purchased what was labelled as a new 4G Nano . When I received it the packaging had been opened and the CD had many hand and fingerprints all over it . The Nano itself had fingerprints and wear scratches all over the black finish . I do n't know if it was used but it sure looked it . Amazon did give me a refund after I fought for free shipping back to them . Maybe I 'm old fashioned but new means new not returned .
 I love the ipod.I 've had an iphoto for a while now and its great.I got a `` nano '' expecting the same quality albeit with a little less memory and bulk.It works but after only a short time 4 -LRB- days -RRB- it looks like its been through a war.Despite treating very carefully the thing is covered in marks and scratches.I disagree with some of the other comments listed here where people ask what do you expect.I expect after four days that something I pay over $ 200 for looks relatively unused.I 'll be returning mine.Hopefully I 'll get my money back.Don ' t get me wrong , I love ipods but this is a disappointment ... at least the screen did n't crack as a friends allegedly did .
 I 've had the black 4GB iPod Nano since 2/28/06 and the lcd screen has cracked on me today , 3/8/06 . I did not , repeat , did NOT mistreat my Nano in any way . I only kept it in my coat pocket to listen to whenever I went for walks or when I needed to run errands . However , today , upon taking it out of the Apple-provided cloth sleeve in order to turn the thing on , I was horrified to see a ruined screen on my VERY babied Nano . I have never dropped it at all , nor are there even any scratches on it ; the screen is simply extremely poorly constructed . I can not emphasize to those of you considering buying a Nano how much I regret buying this junk . I thought the well-reported issues regarding the lcd screens were overblown , but I promise you they are not . Hopefully Amazon will accept my return and grant me a refund so that I can buy a decent MP3 player . I warn you , buyer beware!EDIT
 It 's hard not to like a ipod that is so small with such a nice screen , however , the face of the unit scratches so easily -LRB- after 1 week of gentle service -RRB- that I ca n't imagine I will be able to see anything clearly on it in a few months . Apple needs to rethink the design or ship it with some sort of protective case .
 This is gorgeous and beautiful piece of art to look at but there 's a major flaw
 I bought my REFURBISHED 4gb ipod nano . it didnt last even three months . REFURBISHED = DEFECTIVE . very disappointed with the seller . i really hope to get a refund
 I purchased this item for my 20 year old daughter for a christmas gift . When I recieved the item it did not have a charger or any other accessories , so I had to order a charger on line . I waited a week to recieve the charger . After the charger came , my husband and I charged the iPod for 24 hours . The charge lasted 2 hours . We charged it for for 48 hours thinking the charge had not been completed . The charge lasted less then 2 hours . I contacted the seller via e-mail to see if we could exchange the item or get or money back . He e-mailed me and said we could exchange it but what was the problem . When I told him the charge only lasted 2 hours , he said that was normal . I e-mailed him back that it was not normal and we wanted to exchange . He never answered that e-mail . We are in the process of trying to get a new battery for the item . I will never buy another product from this person . He sells cheap quality and does not back his items . The iPod was badly , and I mean badly , nicked , dinged and scratched . It is a shame I wasted my money for my daughter 's christmas present . Luckily she is older and understands to some extent . I want to rate this seller VERRRRRRRRRRRY POOOOOOOR . I have purchased often on e-bay and amazon and it is a good thing this was not my first time buying or I would never buy again . People like him should not be allowed to sell junk !!!!!!!!!!!! you may contact me for further info . Robin
 The first generation ipod nano I bought can only play for about 5 hours before the battery is dead . My old ipod nano could last for 15 hours . I thought refurbished meant more than just Polishing the brass .
 This item was not in acceptable condition . The screen was broken . I E-Mailed the seller with no response . This person stuck us with a broken item . If I could give it no stars , I would .
 Good thing I did n't sell my ipod micro . This thing scratched way to easily . Did n't bother me until it stopped working altogether . Just froze up , must be the bad apple of the bunch .
 This small , portable music player is quite fascinating . It is composed of a synthetic byproduct of petroleum , known by most as plastic . The `` plastic '' this device is constructed from appears to be of the highest quality , however , when closely observed , I found it to be softer than desired , thus , it scratches easily . It plays music that is downloaded to it via a computer , either Macintosh or PC . This may be a deterrent to those of you who do not own a computer . When playing the music , it uses small phonic devices inserted into the ears . These are called `` headphones '' . Due to the nature of these `` headphones , '' dogs can not listen to your music.When listening to the music , I found it to be of satisfactory quality . This device is quite small which is its primary selling point . If you buy this device , you should be sure to have music to download to it , otherwise , there will be nothing to listen to . The music that I recomend is Wagner , Tchaikovsky , and Bach . I find this music to be of superior quality , and worthy of listening to.If you have any further questions , my email address is supremeruleroftheearth@yahoo.com
 1 -RRB- The ipod nano does not have recording ability2 -RRB- The ipod nano is too fragile3 -RRB- The ipod nano is only $ 60 less than a real ipod.Do not waste your money on an ipod nano .
 this ipod is bootlegg rly . its just too small . i like the ipod mini -LRB- i have in blue -RRB- and the regular plus photo iPods . this one is stupid . it only holds 10000 songs and for $ 250 ... . you can get a better ipod mini for $ 185 or 3000 songs for $ 250 . i think its better to get the other versions of iPods .
 I have always heard how intuitive and user friendly Apple products were -LRB- especially Ipods -RRB- ... what a joke ! I bought an Ipod Mini from Amazon a couple of months ago and finally got around to trying to set it up . The software does n't work -LRB- at least not in any obvious way -RRB- . I tried installing it and it went in fine but . . it did n't work . Itunes took the songs from a CD but there 's no obvious way to load them into the Ipod ... the on screen `` easy to follow '' prompts never appeared ! I tried installing the upgrade from Apple -LRB- version 6.2 ... my Ipod came with 4.7 -RRB- still no luck . My print user 's manual continually refers me to the `` Ipod mini user 's guide '' on the Ipod CD but ... it 's not there ! After 3 hours and several install and reset attempts I gave up . Apple has lots of online print technical help but no actual people available for customer support for non-technos like me . What a waste of time and money . Not the first Apple product I 've bought but it 's certainly the last ! Actually , I give it zero stars and consider it money totally down the drain .
 Pros
 4 GB . That is it . 4 . Any serious music listener knows that 4 GB is hideous ! If you want an mp3 player , get a creative nomad ! Those are even better than iPods ! GASP ! '_' < Whoa ! -RRB- Who cares about what Eminem uses or what the trend is ? Nanos still stink ! Why do people think that iPods are so great , anyway ? If someone can explain to me why , I will stop making fun of them . For now , I still am convinced that iPods are a waste of money . This 4 GB iPod is more expensive than a 40 GB Creative Nomad Zen Xtra Jukebox . If you do n't believe me , go ahead and compare the prices !
 I bought an IPOD Nano 4GB a few days ago from Amazon and after it got delivered , I couldnt bear it for more than 2 days and sent it back for a refund.This is one of the worst music electronic items anyone can think of buying.The ear bugs are extremely bad . Sound quality that comes from these headphones is extremely bad . The volume doesnt go high enough . Which means you really can not rely on this and will have to buy your own separate headphones.Next , the organization of files on the IPod Nano is extremely bad . First of all , you can no longer just copy paste items from your computer and paste them into the disck of IPod . For any single write onto IPod you have to use itunes . Apple has tried to make sure everyone uses itunes as they want people to use their product . They do not realize how ugly the itunes is.It doesnt matter if you want to put or delete files from the ipod , you always have to use itunes . You can not just browse the IPOD folder -LRB- as a usb drive -RRB- and delete or add files -LRB- songs or pictures -RRB- there.The equalizer settings are bad and there is no dramatic effect in the sounds when you change the EQ . Apple has done no effort to improve quality.All the song files need to be in ONLY one format . Either you choose mp3 or aac . itunes will then create a copy of your songs into that format and burn that onto ipod . This results in multiple copies of the same song on your computer and is highly annoying.You can noway organize the files on the ipod the way you desire . It is not possible to create custom folder structure and store files in your folder structure . For eg . you wont be able to create custom folders like of any name of ur choice , say `` John 's Favorites '' or `` My secrets '' . Ipod creates its own folder structure based on the song 's genre , artist , or album.The screen is super small and has a very bad resolution . If you try to see pictures on it , they look ugly . Any cellphone has a better resolution and quality than a Nano.Further you can not play video.It comes in a box with no printed manual . You have to install a software to find the manual . Further that manual is just a . pdf file and is not specific to the Nano and talks about using Apple IPODs in general . I am a computer professional and I found the user interface of the nano extremely ugly and non-user friendly.I would not recommend anyone to buy the nano . This is a very useless product . I would say it is just like a stupid ipod shuttle and shouldnt be priced for over 100 bucks.I will never be buying any IPods again . I would say try the Toshiba , Sony or HP music players.I believe it looks cool but thats it . It has nothing else but good looks . Usability is very poor . Anyone who uses an Ipod in front of me looks like a fool to me .
 Why would you want to spend $ 250 on a flash based MP3 player with capability to hold 1,000 songs -LRB- yeah right -RRB- when you could spend much less on much more . The Zen Micro is awesome and holds much more music and is not real big either . Everyone talks about how cool these are . My friend has one and I convinced him that he wasted his money . Well , I think they suck because they do n't deliver . Anyway , if you want to look at pictures -LRB- which is what a computer or camera is for -RRB- or want a small player that holds very little music , here you go . If you want something that is worth the money , buy a Zen Micro .
 The size and convenience are great , but still too many glitches with this . It has made downloaded music on my computer harder , as everything reverts to iTunes even if you want to download using Media Player , etc. . It 's not as user-friendly as it could be .
 This is truly my first bad experience with an apple product . Out of the box this puppy works great - however as soon as the ipod software updates the software on the unit - its dead in the water . Windows ca n't find it - and itunes wo n't run it . This happens with the june 28 , 2006 update - and it happened on TWO different ipod nanos -LRB- returned the first one thinking it might have been defective -RRB- and it happened on TWO different computers . Support from Apple was non existant , and a tech support actually hung up on me because they were closing . Until Apple sorts out the bugs - avoid this device . A truly disappointing experience . Shame on you apple !
 Ah , a love born of superficial appearances . OK , OK , so it 's unbearably cute when it pops out of the box , very sleek , even -LRB- dare I say it -RRB- sexy , and you fall in love . It works well , after you get over the glitchy software setup . But your admiration for its naked , unadorned form will be shortlived , because you must now immediately sheathe your Nano in a case for the remainder of its natural life , its ephemeral moment in the sun ended , because if you do n't , as one who bought before cases were included or even available , it will betray you and scratch like mad - in particular the view screen scratches if it touches anything , and Apple will laugh at you when you call and ask for a replacement screen . That sleek appearance is 100 % for naught - before you buy , make sure you like the case you 're going to have to fork over another $ 30 - $ 40 for . Did I mention also the armband wo n't also hold a case , so you 'll need to figure that out too . It works fine , and I do n't mind iTunes at all , but that 's not the point at $ 249.00 . Enjoy those precious few moments when it is brand new and not covered in scratches and finerprints . The thing will be despoiled before you know it , condemned to a life of marred former beauty , and all your fault . I could n't stand it anymore and handed it to my wife to take to the gym . In a case of course .
 Do NOT get the old Ipods . I got a first generation Ipod Nano several years ago for Christmas . It 's done well until lately when the battery life started getting weaker . Today I found out just how weak . I was covering the front desk at work when I left the Ipod on my own desk charging . My co-worker runs up to me minutes later and says , `` Something just exploded on your desk ! '' When I came and looked , I found the battery had exploded , melted the Ipod , and was emitting some very foul-smelling smoke . My co-worker said the thing hissed and flames shot out everywhere before fizzling out . Thank goodness I was n't sitting there at the time . After doing some internet research , I discovered this is not an uncommon occurrence in Ipods and some Iphones , especially with some of the older models , and people have been burned and property damaged as a result . Be careful . Let 's hope the newest and latest is also safest ...
 So this a good ipod , but mine does n't hold a charge very well . I listen to it for like 20 minutes and then it goes dead !
 Do NOT order this product with the expectation of getting it by Christmas and apply for their credit card for the $ 30 . savings !! You will be told the product will not arrive until after Christmas -LRB- actually after Jan. 2006 and we ordered on 11-26-05 -RRB- and they will have all your credit information . Very misleading site .
 apple is worse than microsoft . at least some people can still get the xbox 360 as they are trickling in . this stupid nano has been sold out for the last couple of months everywhere . its almost like apple decided to stop making them or something , this is rediculous . no information can be found as to why there is a shortage .
 You just bought a very over priced toy
 UPDATE : I have ended up buying an iPod Nano afterall . My first review was from my initial experience and what I learned from a few other owners . But after getting a chance to use one for a full day , I came to realize that some of my earlier complaints about the Nano needed revisiting and so I decided it was time to buy it -LRB- note
 BUYERS BEWARE
 IT SUCKS SO BAD ITS OVER EXPENSIVE AND CANT DO ANYTHING GET A SANSA
 Just use for 2 weeks . Then , you will notice lots of scratches ... If you do n't care about scratch , then it 's ok . But , scratches are really bothering for this luxury item .
 Everybody knows how great the Nano is as far as navigating it . . as far as the screen , How Cute it is ... However I HATED the sound so much . . I actually sold it at a $ 100 loss to a friend just 2 weeks after buying it . Actually the Nano sounds fine , UNTIL you add any bass , or eq with bass . It is NOT my headphones as I 've used Etymotic 4 's . . Koss Portapros , and nice Sennheiser phones . As soon as you add eq that also adds bass you 'll hear a tiny bit of distortion EVEN at the lowest volume.It 's not terrible , ... but somebody should LISTEN to this thing . Forget about I-Tunes , Forget about the pretty screen . . forget how cute it is . The sound is AWFUL -LRB- with eq -RRB- . . and 4 that reason mine is now sold . I got a lesser known brand Iaudio U3 player and it sounds 100 times better overall plays video , has FM , records . Nothing will match the GREAT navigation of the Nano ... but almost any flash player WILL sound better ... I also own an Iriver , and Sony Flash mp3 player . . Both truly sound WAY better than THE ipod!Apple really ought to fix this eq problem ... and nobody notices this ???
 I saw nothing in the advertisement to indicate this was a refurbished ipod . It seems to be working great but I thought I was getting a new one .
 I was dissapointed with my original order.I received the wrong part and when I called the number on the package for assistance , they tried to make it my fault that I received the wrong part . They said I got the part I ordered . I did not . I had a copy of my original order that I printed out and I did not get what I ordered . Then , I had to pay to return the wrong part , pay a restocking fee and then pay again to have the right part sent . I finally got the right part but feel I overpaid for it .
 Went to Circuit City where the TV was first purchased . Store associate had to purchase on line at Circuit City Customer Service desk in store for a replacement lamp . One of the vendors that came up was Amazon . Based on price , we decided to purchase . After a little over a year the lamp failed . The original lamp lasted 3 years . Amazon would not stand behind the product , giving only a one year warranty and neither would Samsung . Samsung gives only 90 days . I believe all warranties giving such a minimal time frame for replacement are ridiculous . Great companies like Sears especially the Craftsman line would give you a direct replacement no questions asked , insuring repeat business . I can not afford to keep replacing these costly lamps at $ 122.00 each . I guess it 's customer service SECOND now . I will no longer purchase a product from either Amazon or Samsung .
 ANTOnline sent a Lenmar battery were the case was barley held together by scotch tape on both ends once I open the package . The box was smashed but packaging was not . Emailed right away as instructed and waited for RMA or contact back . No response . Tried again plus tried calling but still no response so then I emailed Amazon . Amazon gave me a full refund after their investigation of the problem . Thank you Amazon .
 The purpose I purchased this battery was to be ready to replace the old one . The charge life was becoming low and I knew it was a matter of time before I would need a replacement.Just within the last few days , the inevitable happened and I was ready with the `` new '' battery . I was aware it would need to be recharged before use and let it charge for about two days as I did n't need to use my camera . When I did use it , it barely held the charge long enough to snap a few photos before the warning light appeared.Thinking it was new and might need a `` breaking-in '' period , I recharged it again for a few days and received the same result . I believe it is either defective or too old , but I have no way to tell for sure which it is . It may be both.I have always had good luck with Fuji , so I am giving them a little slide on rating this product for that reason alone .
 I bought the Maxtor 3000LS external hard drive because I needed to move some big files between two different computers in two different locations . One computer had 1.1 USB connections operating under Windows 98 and the other had 2.0 USB connections operating under Windows XP . The Maxtor worked on both , BUT ... 1 -RRB- It has no on/off switch , thus stays on ALL the time.Does not even `` sleep '' after no use .2 -RRB- It makes a lot of noise .3 -RRB- It came with NO instruction manual .4 -RRB- Something associated with this drive caused the CPU andmemory in one of the computers to become saturated , which resulted in the PC crashing often and caused theother peripherals on the machine to stop working.Everything on this PC returned to normal after the Maxtorwas `` uninstalled '' . It looked like some kind of USB `` polling '' problem .5 -RRB- It has no function lights . No ` on ' light , no ` in use ` light . Nothing . How much could it cost to put somelights and an on/off switch on the darn thing ? 6 -RRB- Sometimes after an hour or so , it will `` disappear '' fromthe device listing and there is no way to access it . Youhave to re-boot the PC in order to use it again.I gave it two stars because it did what I wanted it to do - but with a lot of hassle . I hate this thing . I 'll hook it up when I absolutely need it to transfer files , but the rest of the time I 'm going to uninstall it and throw it in the garage . Shame on you , Maxtor , for putting out a product like this .
 Bought one of these * & ^ % $ harddrive lasted less that a year , stored some pictures on it , did not use it more than 1/2 hr . When i tried to use it , it failed . Talked to the support and was told its shot . never buy maxtor againFred FriedrichCT
 This is a cheaper drive than I expected . I contacted tech support about some problems I had with this . The rattling noise that really annoys me is caused by the drive heads moving to a resting position where it `` rattles '' harmlessly . They told me its due to the fact its their low end no frills drive . I would n't have bought this had I known about the noise . Its very annoying.Also have a problem where the drive does n't come up on startup . They say sometimes data gets trapped in a buffer , and the drive wo n't work until it clears the buffer . But since its `` data '' the drive is refusing to purge it . Usually unplugging the power and removing the USB cable for a minute does the trick . But not this time ... . I may have a nonfunctioning drive until I can get to a repair shop when they open on monday ... Very unhappy right now .
 The A550 is the same mehanical design as the rest of the series . I had a Canon A540 that worked fine for 10 months then for no apparant reason the lens did not retract . This is known problem with Canon cameras -LRB- do a web search to find lots of instances -RRB- . I returned the camera to Canon since it is still under warrantee . They claimed that it had impact damage - which it did not - and wanted $ 103 to fix it . I will NEVER BUY a CANON camera again . I had the same problem with a Canon A20 a few years ago but that was out of warrantee .
 Buy this camera only if you feel like missing crucial shots that you would love to have . It is the slowest thing on earth .
 I got this camera after a lot of research and even after using it for a few months , it met my criteria . It takes really great pictures and I used it for about 6 months without disappointment , with the exception of diminished quality photos under low light situations . The reason why I rated this camera poorly , or more accurately , bothered to review it at all is because interested buyers need to know that this series of cameras is notorious for receiving a `` Lens Error '' message which renders the camera useless and is as costly to repair as it is to buy a new one . I got this message after only 6 months of use . I was not hard on the camera and I never dropped it . It did not get wet nor did I take it anywhere that got it dirty . I got online to try to diagnose the problem only to find that this is an extremely common complaint . I am really upset about it because it really is an otherwise good camera but I saved for a long time to buy mine and I feel pretty gilted at how short a time it lasted . I took good care of mine and now all I have is a hunk of useless metal so if you want a camera that you can throw in your purse or backpack or take to the beach where there is sand or the like - this most definately is not the one for you .
 I received this as a gift from my mother when my Panasonic Lumix was dropped in the sand and stopped working . She wanted pics of the grandkids and was tired of me using the broken camera excuse . I have now used it at my daughters gymnastics meet and outdoors at Red Rock Canyon in Las Vegas . The indoor pictures using zoom were all throw aways . Not a single shot came in focus . The lighting was typical gymnasium light , very bright . I tried shooting on about 5 different settings with and without flash.On to RedRocks . In some shots the sky -LRB- which was brilliant blue -RRB- came out white . In the shots where the sky turned out blue , the vibrant red rock looked over exposed.This camera is not worth the plastic it is made from . I am going to sell it on Ebay and go back to the Lumix for my point and shoot needs .
 I bought this camera in July and by August I was having troubles with it . It keeps on saying low battery and shutting itself off . I 've replaced batteres with fresh ones and cleaned the contacts . This camera is defective .
 This is the most useless camera I ever owned . I mailed my second replacement -LRB- third camera -RRB- back yesterday . Why ? The battery door would not open on any of the Canon PowerShot A550 cameras that I received.I talked to a couple of friends that were photography enthusiasts . They were not able to help me get the battery door open , which means I was not able to use the camera at all.I am going back to my film camera . At least Kodak knows how to manufacture a camera with a battery door that opens.A pox upon Canon and their quality control department .
 Canon PowerShot series cameras are battery eater.I have already sold it on ebay .
 If you are a novice photographer , you will probably not notice the oddities with this camera . In many cases , the photos are overexposed on sunny days . Underwater photography -LRB- in underwater housing -RRB- is so-so . It does pretty well in low light conditions -LRB- after manually setting the ISO really high -RRB- . The nifty little shutter on the front started to stick upon opening after owning it for 4 months -LRB- I keep it in a case , so this is definitely a mechanical design flaw -RRB- . Movies are of good quality . Gets good life out of rechargeable batteries . I 'd only buy it again if I could n't find another camera with this many features that took no more than 2 AA batteries .
 We ordered this camera for our daughter . We have never had any issues with having things arrive from Amazon sellers but this camera came to us in a flat rate envelope wrapped in bubble wrap . Nothing else . No original box either , nothing except the SD card that still had someone else 's personal pictures on it . The box was pretty much flattened in the mailing process and the cameras ' internal lens was totally crushed . When we contacted the seller we were told that 's how he always mails things and never had any issues in the past . He even neglected to respond when we asked for at least a credit for another camera . I understand that things get lost/damaged in the mail but to send a camera through the mail without much more than one sheet of bubble wrap and the mailing envelope is ridiculous ! Save yourself the frustration , time and money - buy elsewhere .
 I purchased this camera from a pawn shop , while I was trying it out the battery light kept flashing , I thought no big deal it just needs batteries . So I bought it and I have been replacng the batteries ever since , y the 3rd picture it shuts off . It does take great pics though but you just ca n't take a few and choose your fave cause you can only take a couple at a time .
 I bought the Canon A550 to replace a Sony Cyber Shot 2 mega pixel camera as a point and shoot camera and was so disappointed that after a week I returned the camera to Amazon . We also have a Sony SLR type Digital camera that is in a totally different league and we have a lot of fun with it . We also own a very nice 35mm SLR , and have taken some published photo 's . But I wanted something to carry around when ever I get out , or to use to take close ups for E-Bay . The macro on the Canon A550 has way too much contrast , and actually made a very expensive Sambar Stag Knife look plastic . Low light situations where not great , photo 's always seemed too grainy unless the pictures where shot in good to bright light . There was also a very noticeable curvature in the macro mode , close ups , and wide angle shoots . I took the camera out and took some photos of a near by lake , and the zoom did a nice job , but once it went passed the 4X optical zoom things got grainy fast.I guess for someone who just wants to have fun with a digital camera and does n't care too much about color accuracy this is probably a nice little camera . But when it comes to needing a camera that actually does reproduce colors and has a real macro , it 's the old saying you get what you pay for.Sony Cybershot DSC-T100 8MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom and Super Steady Shot -LRB- Red -RRB-
 I spent 30.00 extra to get this product expediated to the person I bought it for . The product was delivered 10 days later rather than 3 days ; thus , the present did n't reach the person I bought it for in time for their birthday . Therefore , I would advise ordering this from another company if you need it delivered on time !!!!
 I received my speakers with the same excitement I always feel when a new toy arrives at my door . One of my old Mission speakers had blown a woofer -LRB- after MANY years of wonderful service -RRB- so the first thing I did was replace it with ONE of the Sonys.Firstly , as I 've read in other reviews , these puppies are bigger than most bookshelf speakers but I put it in the place of my old one and loaded a Cd . My ear is not as sharp as it used to be but I 've got to say , the sound is a little muddy . My 15 year old Mission sounds Brighter and , surprisingly , just as punchy on the low end too . Do n't get me wrong , the sound is n't awful . It 's just not nearly what I was expecting after reading the other reviews . Obviously the price had something to do with the purchase but if I had to do it again , I 'd throw an extra hundred in there and go with an upgrade . Needless to say , the other Sony still sits in the box while my remaining Mission speaker plays proudly on . I really can not recommend this speaker unless your ear and budget are ready for nothing more .
 though they were good read other ratings sound is not good they had some damage on one bought yamaha6490 129.95 great should have gotten an other pair for 29.00 dollars more don , t like sony at all that , s why they were 109.00 will not listen to other people , s review any more
 I currently own a pair of bookshelves by Sony made in the early nineties , given to me by a friend who bought a a mini-shelf system consisting of a tapedeck/cd player / receiver and these speakers . The number on these speaker is SS-D555 and it seemed to be a close relative of the SSB3000 . I thought perhaps my speakers were about the same and ordered the SSb3000 as a replacement pair.Once I got them , I realized they looked a bit bigger , the woofer is 8.5 ' instead of 6.6 ' and the arrangement is different . Still it is a 3 way large bookshelf speaker.Now , the sound . I expected a similar sound with perhaps a few harsh highs that would go away after break-in . Instead , I got a little more bass but not clear well defined bass -- more boomy , boxy bass . And the mids were very muffled at points . Bear in mind , you only notice this if you had better speakers . I tried with mostly hard rock/metal music . I tried the Judas priest `` sin after sin '' record - it sounded boomy and muffled . When I switched back to the old - the sound was much clearer and the guitars were very noticeable . This happened with most music that employed guitar sounds . It sounded ok though with dance music . At times it sound good but it can not handle very complex music.The weird thing is I realize now that the SS D555 I own is probably a high end speaker . -LRB- I got it for free -RRB- I think it was part of a system that cost about $ 800 in 1992 . So it seems like SONY does not make speakers as good as they used to.I wish I could find out what happened to this line - perhaps it was discontinued.Anyway , I returned the SS-b3000 - it ca n't work for me . The deficiencies are too glaring.Has anyone ever heard a SS-D555 -- its simply amazing at least when compared to this one - the SS-B3000 .
 I gave these a try based on all the good reviews.For music , they sound terrible . I listen to hard rock and heavy metal.The frequency response is really uneven with brittle highs and early break-up . They do get loud . They 're good if you want some cheap house party speakers.They 're lively and image decently well for home theater use.I ended up getting some old Polks off craigslist for less money and better sound for music .
 Ordered Sony Speakers per a good review online . They arrived on time , but did not satisfy my ears . Their sound was adequate , but I planned to use them for listening to vinyl albums and like a crisp sound . I returned them and ordered Bose 301 's which work great for me . Thank you .
 I was pleased with the speakers initially , but after less than a year , there is crackling and serious sound distortion . I was using them with a 40-watt amp . Now I need a replacement .
 i was surprised that my pre-amp could over drive the speakers and cause them sub-woofer to flutter . i have to be careful with the volume and equalizer bass setting .
 This product is OK for letter writing or documents if you 're not printing a photo . I would n't buy it again . I make cards with prints and photos and never had this problem . I get green were there is no green in the print or Photo . I have to put my printer on Heavy Ink so I do n't get white lines on the matte pages . Go to Staples and buy Lexmark 34 & 35 for high yield ink if it goes with your printer model . Staples wo n't charge you for shipping , at least not today . So far on my search , they are the only ones that have a reasonable price in the combo pack & singles . I do recommend the products that come with your printer . I like the high yield because 95 % of my prints come out flawlessly . I am always searching for better paper and ink and comparing their prices from one store to the other . Amazon does sell `` Lexmark '' ink , but they do not sell # 35 , otherwise , I 'd probably buy it from here . Hope they do one of these days .
 I did n't work . My Lexmark 4300 did n't even recognize that this cartridge was installed .
 I bought this thinking it would be a good alternative for the original ink . Not So !! My computer does n't recognize it . And the color is very poor . Stick to original lexmark ink !!
 I 've only had this ink a few weeks and already it says it 's low . I do n't print much so I 'm very dissapointed .
 cartridge quit working after a week and only a few pages . printer says its defective . the old cartridge still works , so not the printer
 I bought the 4gig memory and only one worked . Tried to return it and was given the run around for almost two months . They told me to send it to amazon , amazon told me to send it them and back and forth . I was going to spend a little more and buy something different from them but after all the hassle , NO WAY .
 We had the old model for a couple of years until the head set broke . We loved it so tried to get the identical model again . Unfortunately it was replaced with a new model which was awful . Kept crackling and popping . We sent it back and were sent a replacement which was no better , so we just kept it and gave up . We did notice that the new model was made by a different company from the old one . We will now research for a completely different brand to replace the Acoustic one . Too bad as the original one was great !
 Due to static interference these phones can only be used for AM radio - I would rather use wired headphones than wireless with so much of static .
 This is the second set I bought from Acustic Research but this recent set is absolutly terrible . First of all it is difficult to set the headphones to charge . If they do not sit properly on the base they do not charge . Difficult to get them in the proper position . But worse of all , there is frequent static and then the sound shuts off for a few seconds . Save your money and DO N'T buy this product !!!
 Love this item . Exception , , quality . first battery charge failed after only two hours . Now have to use a separate battery charger .
 There seems to be a common theme developing here . Great headphones for the money but sometimes they fail to recharge . I think my set was even more defective because it gave me a wicked static shock when I set it in the cradle . I sent it back and would n't recommend rolling the dice on these unless you are a fan of Amazon 's return procedure -LRB- i.e. , it is a decent return procedure , this is more a reflection of the hassle of having to roll the dice on a product -RRB- .
 I purchased the AW722 headphones -LRB- shipped from Digital Media Research -RRB- , and have not been able to get a single sound out of them . DMR falls back on a no-return policy for headphones , and Acoustic Research has essentially no customer service . Their FAQs are lousy , irrelevant , or linked to irrelevant pages . When you receive a return e-mail , it always contains essentially no info or asking you for the info already sent , and it offers a URL for followup . Trouble is , the URL links to a page asking for your username and password , and I have found no way to register in the Acoustic Research website . Altogether unsatisfactory experience , and I am astonished Amazon carries this -LSB- product , seller , and manufacturer .
 The Acoustic Research AW-771 gave out when I replaced different rechargeable batteries . I used the headphones just for TV and the 771 was an ok product but experienced long start up times . I purchased the 772 and hate them . Cheap plastic , no range , louding hissing sound , strap above top of head causes discomfort and difficult to insert in rechargeable cradle . Bought the Sennheiser RS12 and most pleased . Returned the junky 772 which is a deplorable product and should be avoided at any price .
 We purchased the AW722 for my slightly deaf mother , who loves them . Very comfortable . However , they wo n't stay charged for more than four hours of TV time , and she watches TV all day long . The very short time they stay charged seems crazy to me , and I have no idea how to contact a manufacturer to see if this is normal . We recharged and drained and recharged three times , as per instructions , but even now , the charge wo n't hold more than four hours , five at the top . Too much hassle to go in and balance them in the cradle , then let them charge overnight , only to use them for four or five hours and go through this again . I 'll be returning these to where we purchased them .
 The first set of headphonnes I receieved a few months ago from armelectronics worked great . The second set I receieved from the same co. did not work at all and were returned . What bothered me was the feedback from the co. like I was Questioned was I using them properly and I said I was quite familiar with product as I have four sets which work great , in fact the last set I received from your co. worked great . In a phone conversation with the co. they asked me did I switch things around with working sets . I told them I did everything possible to make them work . I felt totally intimidated with this line of questioning and thought this was out of line . What should of been done at the begining of this sale was to appologize for this non - working problem was to replace it with a working set of headphones and I would have accepted that . They could use some brushing on good business policies . I only had 35 years in the retail business . Things like this happen and has no reflection on my doing business with Amazon . You guys are great ! Merrill Krieger
 I received these as a birthday gift . They did n't work right from day one . Acoustic Research did n't reply to my inquiry , Best Buy would n't take 'em back -LRB- no receipt , and too much time had passed -RRB- . I am very disappointed in these ... I 've spent more time messing with them , trying to make them work than actually using them.I understand that a few people have had good results with their headphones . I truly wish I was amongst the select few - perhaps you got a set out of a good batch ? My experience has been nothing but a bummer .
 Tried and tried and tried to use these , got 'm as a gift . From day one i 've gotten low static everytime . I bought them just to watch movies at home , always end up giving up after about 15 minutes . No adjustments would fix it , just constantly undercurrent of static . AVOID .
 This unit would fail randomly . Over the past 2 years of owning them , I 've had to exchange them twice and it may be a third . The headphones would just quit working without any indication . I 've never dropped them or abused in anyway . The components are just poorly built . The headphones are just not worth the money or trouble.Acoustic Research is owned by AudioVox corp. which when it comes down to support ; there is none . I 've had to replace these headphones twice by swapping out with Amazon already as AudioVox did not respond . AudioVox has won the battle.AudioVox will not back up their work on the headset.Very poorly made , will not last more than 2 years of use .
 These have lots of background noise and cut out . They are fairly comfortable , though do not adjust to a small head . We need them , so they are OK , but I am not impressed . They did arrive very quickly , Amazon was great as usual and cheaper than the store .
 I have to admit , I purchased these through Amazon for a really good price -LRB- less than $ 30 -RRB- , much less than retail . However , these things suck . They have no range , the sound quality decreases as the batteries drain . They do n't go through walls and I have to keep adjusting the channel even sitting right in front of the TV . In all fairness I also have a pair of AW771 's that have none of the above problems . Maybe I got a pair of lemons in these AW772 's .
 There is no way to directly contact Acoustic Research Repair for the wireless headphones very shaddy company . I would be very impressed if anyone can find the number I tried for hours phone and internet . .
 In July 2006 I purchased a set of aw771 headphones . After using them for 3 weeks I had to return them as the charger would not charge the batteries that came with the headphones . On August 20 , 2006 , I returned the AW771 headphones and purchased AW772 headphones . I used the new headphones until October 10th . I removed the batteries and unplugged the set as I did not have a need for them until early December . When I was ready to use the headphones again I plugged them in , recharged the batteries and sat down to use them only they would n't work . I tried 3 other sets of rechargable batteries to no avail . For both sets of headphones I had to turn my TV volume to maximum to get them to work . I have tried contacting Acoustic Research via Email but have not received an answer . Based on my experience with two different sets of headphones I could not recommend them .
 These Model AW772 headphones work OK on a few TV channels most of the time , but they fail to pull in some channels altogether . Automatic tuning is very fast for a few channels , but very slow for others . They sometimes lock onto an unknown channel or other source . The sound is very loud on some channels and very low on others for a given volume setting . Manual tuning is not available although a tuning label appears next to a false knob . Moreover , the instruction manual addresses manual tuning , which apparently was intended for the Model 722 , which does feature manual tuning . Batteries never seem to have a full charge or reach full voltage even after 24-hour charging .
 I 've been using these headphones for nearly two years now and am finally irritated enough to write a review . I had to return the first set a week after buying them due to the ` phones failing to charge -LRB- apparently a common problem based on reviews -RRB- . I was hesitant to buy the same model again , but they were the only thing in the price-range . The manufacturer claims that the base will transmit up to 150 feet through walls and floors . In that case , why I am getting horrible static at 20 feet across a room with nothing in between ? The auto-tune does n't seem to make any difference , although tilting and moving my head will help for a bit . When the static clears , the quality of the sound is excellent , too bad the shoddy reception ruins it . I can not recommend these headphones to anyone .
 Not exactly what I expected . The fit is very tight . Lanyard broke within a week . I guess you get what you pay for .
 If you love the sound of white noise , this is the product for you ! Simply plug into your ipod 's headphone jack , tune the iTrip and enjoy ! You will enjoy hours of your favorite songs garbled in a tangle of radio broadcasts and static . Spend the extra money and get a direct iPod input .
 Although a good idea , it will not work with the JBL `` On Stage '' . The base of the Sendstation is too big to fit into the iPod docking area.Save your money . Do not buy .
 I just received the dock extender and it does not work with the LifeProof case . Has anyone gotten it to work with the Lifeproof case ? It does not seem to be long enough to reach the phone .
 Probably just wonderful for iPod stands . But when I purchased this product within a month of the iPhone release , there was no warning that this did not work with the included iPhone stand . That has been corrected here on Amazon , yeh ! I was hoping to use the stand converter so that I would not have to take the case off the iPhone and still have it take up minimal space on the desk . It would be nice that another version would become available that fulfills this need and works with the iPhone dock . SendStation has other very useful products that are highly recommended .
 I got this player because I really wanted to play some of my parent 's old records , but I have been VERY disappointed with my purchase . It looks fantastic , and if that 's all you 're going for , then you should buy it immediately . If you want to play anything on it , then go for another player . The record player is made of the cheapest plastic possible . Mine broke after about a month and a half -LRB- of light use ! -RRB- . The radio worked well for about 2 months , but now it 's 50 % static , 50 % music . I do n't know if I just bought a `` lemon '' or what , but if you really want to buy this , I would definitely suggest keeping all of the boxes , wrapping paper , and receipts , because if you get one similar to mine , you 're going to want to get your money back .
 There seem like many reasons to like this CD player , which can play . mp3 data discs as well as conventional CDs . Additionally , both the user interface and the appearance are quite nice . My major complaint is that the unit I was shipped often exhibits playback punctuated with short periods of silence or refuses to play discs at all . This behavior seems independent of whether the disc is . mp3 or conventional .
 I supposedly upgraded my system 4 months ago ~ I enjoy having a disc changer so I can shuffle my music ~ I had an old 5-disc Panasonic which worked for years like a faithful friend ~ I was so excited to get a 6-disc changer and gave away my old one ~ but , now , I fight with this Onkyo to get it to play random continously ~ sometimes it will , sometimes it will not ~ I clear it over & over , clean the CD 's , however , this player seems to have a mind of it 's own ~ PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS if you like to shuffle your music & who does n't !
 random play sometimes plays all discs , sometimes does not . I always clean my discs , but sometimes they skip on this player . I 've owned a Pioneer cd player for 25 years and never have had a problem with it . . Not very pleased with the unit that I just purchased . Thanks
 Beware of this product . Mine did n't work correctly out of the box ; random would n't work at all and even sequential play would not always find tracks . After conversing with the manufacturer it was determined the unit was defective and to send it back at my cost , which was $ 50 . I would not purchase this unit again . Too bad as the sound of the unit was very good , much better than I expected .
 Bought this unit brand new in early January . Worked fine , no problems . Now not even 3 months later it appears to be dead . Frozen up . Can not open the tray which I have 6 cd 's in.I just cant believe a brand new cd player would last less than 3 months.UNBELIEVABLE .
 The unit worked fine for a little over a year . Then it started showing `` no disk '' even though a disk was inserted.I took it to the local Onkyo repair shop . It would have cost $ 161 to repair it , when I only paid $ 147.99 in the first place .
 I bought the refurb version of this player , and am sorry that I did . The tray on the first one would n't close all the way . The second one -LRB- yea , silly me ... -RRB- would n't play , and the turntable would n't turn . Both times , this was right out of the box . I 'm out $ 30 for having to ship these back . I guess that I 'll have to repair my 15 year old Sony .
 My Onkyo only lasted about 18 months before dying -LRB- i.e not playing cds correctly -RRB- . 18 months ! sheesh!The one best feature is that it plays mp3s.It 's drawbacks :1 . It takes about 20 seconds to power up before you can insert a cd .2 . The rewind / fastforward ONLY works by using the REMOTE , and not on the machine itself , and works poorly.When this thing finally started dying , it would play 10 seconds of a cd , then skip to the next , play 10 seconds of THAT cd , move on , , etcI was happier with my old Sony .
 I 'm not impressed with Onkyo , this is my second multi CD player from them and both have proved to be very frustrating . If I load up the carousel I can guarantee that at least one of the CD 's will not be recognized and the player will skip to the next CD . There is no rhyme or reason to this . I can take out the offending CD and replace it without doing anything to it and it will play OK . I will be moving on to possibly a Marantz CC-4001 very soon .
 I 've owned two of these models , and neither has lasted more than a couple of years . I wo n't make this mistake again . They seem prone to electronic glitches , refusal to read discs , faulty disc tray mechanism , and poor programming . My most recent failed model -LRB- bought in 2008 -RRB- would frequently not recognize a disc that had been inserted and skip over it . If there were multiple discs in the tray on random play , sooner or later it would refuse to play some or all of the discs . Then this past month it began to turn itself on -- that 's right , TURN ITSELF ON , with the display lighting up . I 'd hit the power button to turn it back off and within the hour it 'd be back on again . After a day or two of doing this it began to freeze up on discs , skip , and generally freak out , the display flashing random digits and messages the disc tray refusing to open , and generally refused to accept input from the control buttons . I finally pulled the plug to disconnect all the active input ; plugged it back in after a resting spell , and then was able to force enough response to free my CDs . I 'll shop more carefully for a replacement this time -- I 'm finished with Onkyo .
 I purchased this item new from Amazon in August of 2009 along with an Onkyo receiver . As an Onkyo fan with years of favorable experience having owned a high-end home theater receiver , I decided to get rid of my Kenwood 5-disc CD player -LRB- purchased in 1994 -RRB- and upgrade to the Onkyo DXC390 6 disc CD player . I should have kept the 15-year old Kenwood.Onkyo should be ashamed of themselves for selling something of such inferior quality . I doubt I used this CD player more than 10 times during the 2 year period I owned it and it stopped working . It is stuck in stand-by mode and though able to rest the unit from time to time using recommended methods , it simply does n't respond to any commands . The monster cable power surge protector still works great along with the receiver but the CD player died.This is a hit or miss product from Onkyo . You either get one that lasts a long time or in the case of what appears to be close to 50 % of people who write reviews for this product - you get a complete lemon . And Onkyo sits back and does nothing about it time and time again . $ 195 down the drain -LRB- is n't worth the $ 135 they sell if for today -RRB- . For me it is simple - I 'll never waste my money on an Onkyo item again -LRB- anything Onkyo including receivers -RRB- .
 Although I did buy his player a year and a half ago , I 'd say I 'd be lucky if I listened to 10 CD 's on it in that time . I had n't turned it on in 6 months or so and when I did so today , it just stayed on standy mode and would n't turn on . Nothing helped like unplugging it or trying to turn it on with the remote . Completely useless . I bought a new model too , not a refurbished one . This is the first Onlyo product I ever bought , and it will be the last . Now I remember why I always stuck to Sony players .
 onkyo dx 390I got mine about three years ago for a Christmas , and pretty much within first two months it did THE VERY SAME THING that other reviewers mention !! Just started giving me messages `` no disc '' , when there were clearly discs inside.By then it was too late for the return , plus it was a gift after all ... I guess I kept hoping it will somehow `` get better '' , since the friend , who gave me the CD player as a gift , really liked Onkyo , and trusted the quality of the brand , so I did not want to get rid of his gift ` just like that ' . WOW !! How sweetly naive both of us were !! -LRB- of course it never ` got better ' , on the contrary , within about 10 months it stopped reading all of the discs altogether !! -RRB- ... I just did not want to have to deal with it , so I never even attempted to call the customer support ... which turns out to have been pretty smart thing to do . As I am now reading all these 1-star reviews I am glad I did not , since it obviously saved me lot more grief , frustration and wasted time on the phone with nothing to show for in the end anyway ... Seeing just how blatantly indifferent attitude the company has toward taking care of their consumers is scandalous and reading all these reviews about it actually feels pretty appalling ... But it is utterly incomprehensible to me , how a product , that is clearly so flawed and defective as this one , can STILL BE ON THE MARKET ?! after all those years of complaints ?? ... and that 's why I am writing a review today , three years later after I threw the thing away.I was browsing Amazon electronics the other day , and just stumbled across this unit , and was completely shocked to see it is STILL being sold !! Unbelievable !! Yes , it MIGHT BE a decent `` quality audio '' player - IF you manage to NOT get a lemon ... Going by reviews on here , there is about one out of two chances of that happening , and in most cases the owners never got money back , just the product exchange if they were lucky ... and some of those replacement units STILL turned out to be rejects ... So even though it has been stated in many different ways , let me repeat it once again : There is roughly 50/50 chance that your unit will be useless within several weeks to several months after purchase , and most likely you will not have your money refunded.Why not just take the two benjis -LRB- the $ 100 dollar bills -RRB- , and use them to light up a cigarette ? or a fireplace?It will be more fun , and definitely less time-consuming and aggravating , than shopping for this thing , unpacking it , setting it up , and taking it to the dumpster shortly thereafter . -LRB- I am still a bit peeved ... can you tell ? : -RRB-
 Everything was going fine until we hit the one year mark . Now , it does n't work at all . I turn to the Onkyo support site to learn that all but two of their products carry and two-year parts and service warranty - and this is one of those two . Why ? I guess my story is the reason.One year ai n't long for this kind of money ...
 I purchased this unit 2 years ago . You would expect a product from Onkyo to be reliable for a long time . I had to repeatedly take the unit in for repair during the warranty period . It lasted one year after the warranty ended with very little use . From this point on , I will only purchase receivers made by Onkyo .
 I bought this item 6 months ago and does n't work now . I have to cut the power to see if im lucky and play a CD when is reconnected . I dont have a near option for send it for service , so I prefer to buy another CD Changer , but of course another brand .
 I would not purchase the Onkyo model DXC390 disc changer . I received mine last night and hooked it right up and it wont read not one cd . A complete waste of time , energy and money . I have had Onkyo products since 1980 and never have had a problem . Well , they wont get a second chance with me . I cant even give it one star because it doesnt work period .
 I bought this Onkyo CD Player and as soon as the 1 year warrantee was over the circuit board broke for no apparent reason causing a variety of mechanical failures . I called the company and they told me since it was n't under warrantee the best I could do was participate in their trade in program . For $ 80 I could send in my broken CD player , paying the shipping costs myself -LRB- which amounted to about $ 30 -RRB- , and they would send me a refurbished unit of exactly the same model with a 1 year warrantee , shipped to me for free . I went for it . But when the refurbished unit arrived it had more problems than the one I sent in . Onkyo had the nerve to suggest that it was damaged in shipping . This was absurd . The unit arrived neatly packed with no exterior physical damage . Their warehouse staff simply had n't checked to see if the unit was functioning before they shipped it or from the time it had been fixed to the time it was shipped the circuit board failed again , telling you something about the quality of the product . While Onkyo was willing to refund my $ 80 I still had to pay shipping back the warehouse . So , I paid $ 60 in freight costs to get nothing ! Save yourself time , money and aggravation - do n't buy this product !
 Bought this based on friends referrals and written reviews and it quit working after 1 year . Very disappointed .
 The unit failed after around 9 months of light use . It basically froze up and would n't play , eject or respond to any commands . Sent it back for repair under warranty and did n't receive it back for 3 months . Worked ok for maybe 10 hours of use , now failed again . Wo n't even power on . I give up and will order a Marantz CC4001 .
 Bought this two years ago and enjoyed it then bam , it is toast on the cd changer nothing happens , and random can not find any cds when other players play them just find , it is simply toast ! Bad product , and $ 150.00 for two years is expensive !!! PLEASE READ BELOW IT WORKS GREAT NOW I RATE THIS AT LEAST 4 STARS NOW.I have to change this rating To at least 4 stars ! , as it is working now and sounds great . The problem was the changer would not do anything just went into random mode and would not play , After unplugging , I took out the screws that held the outside metal case to the frame , and looked inside , at this point I could not see any obvious problem . So with the case off , I plugged it in and pushed the open button to have the 6 changer table slide out and there right in front of my eyes were two cd 's one on top of the other wedged so the player would not accept a cd ! My wife and I could not explain how we were missing two CD 's . If moving this player unit , remove all the CD 'S first as the slighest tilt of the case will upset the CD 'S in the unit and when you open the case , these unseated CD 's will simply fall below the player table and cause problems . Super Simple Fix . I had to share this to others who may have a similar problem . If you are missing CD 'S this may be the cause , Hope this helps .
 I purchased this item in May of 2006 and found it to be a good CD player . However , in the third year of its life , the DX-C390 began to turn itself on its own . I would turn off the CD changer only to find , minutes later , that it would again turn itself on without human intervention.When I returned from a week vacation , I found the CD changer in the play mode . It played constantly 24/7 for the entire week and the player was hot to the touch . I feel this is a definite fire safety hazard and will report this to the Consumer Product Safety Commission .
 While I like Onkyo and I think the products are made to last , I 'm baffled by how poorly the DX_C390 6-disc CD changer operates . It is incredibly slow as it cycles from song to song -LRB- it feels like it take about 30 seconds per track -RRB- , and it 's especially frustrating when the changer sticks on a track that does n't exist
 I was very annoyed to discover that there is no memory button on the front.To program the play list you have to use the remote-very fiddley.Don ' t loose the remote!Going through a cdrom and programing is clunky , hit and miss.Never let an engineer design the user interface -- as usual.Why by a 6 cd changer thats a pain the in A to program.No memory for the programed input either , so dont turn off the machine.The housing is very deep-a couple of feet.Since its 6cd it cant be helped .2 stars for such an egregious error in the programing interface .
 I 've had this for a little over a year now . It is a POS ! No response to remote or manual controls ! Wakes you up in the middle of the night when it comes on by itself ! Do n't buy ! It is a POS ! Invest in some other brand.Onkyo should be ashamed for putting out such garbage !
 I purchased the DXC390 unit in July 08 to compliment my Onkyo AV Receiver . At first all seemed well , but in April of this year the unit mysteriously turned on by itself , remained on and locked so that the carousel tray would not eject . I sent it to the warranty authorized service facility to repair . In about a week , it was returned to me and seemed to be fine again . This July just 2 days prior to my warranty running out , the same exact problem happened again . I got in touch with the customer rep at Onkyo , explaining the problem and voicing my concern as to why the problem was not fixed properly the first time . All I was able to get out of him was that my only solution was to send it back for repair , shipping it again at my expense , and that the only way Onkyo would consider replacing my unit was if the occurence happened a third time . Well I did the math , and , the cost of sending it back to the repair facility was approaching almost what I had spent for the unit to begin with . I decided to cut my losses and buy another CD player from another manufacturer . I am quite upset with the lack of interest and consideration displayed by Onkyo in this matter , and did not expect this from a supposedly quality electronics manufacturer , was I ever mistaken!Needless to say , I will never consider buying another Onkyo product and will discourage anyone else who may be considering buying an Onkyo product not to do so .
 Garbage ! Do not waste your money on this unit . Had it fixed three times by Circuit City . Bad laser light . Same problem over and over . After the third time unit will play but sound will turn off and on . Very annoying . Bought the same unit for a friend as a present . -LRB- I do n't know why -RRB- Two months later bad main circuit board . Unit would not turn on . Thought Onkyo was a good name . Will never buy one of there products again .
 We bought this in March 2008 -- it only lasted until mid-2010 , about two years , with very light usage . I would not recommend this player .
 I bought the DX-390 about 1.5 years ago . My use has been minimal . Recently , it started to turn itself on and the changer will not eject . You have to disconnect the power source to get the unit to shut off . I was going to try to get it serviced , then I read the reviews - many people are experiencing the same issue . I think that I would be letting myself in for a load of pain with no positive resolution . Anyone have suggestion on a good 5 or 6 cd unit ???
 This CD player stopped working after a year and half of occasional use . I had owned the previous model which was great and lasted about 10 years but looks like Onkyo quality has gone downhill . Google problems with this model and you 'll find what I 've experienced - machine is stuck on Standby and will decide once in a while to work . If you do want to take a chance on this player , I urge you to get the extended warranty since you will need it . Stay away if you can . If you ca n't , be prepared for when it stops working . Good luck .
 I like the display -LRB- Artist , Album , Song title , Folder Title -RRB- It plays the cd 's that it will play fine , however I found the following limitations
 Jan , 3 2008 Purchased from Amazon ... DEC. 5 , 2009 . The stand by light stays on but theres nobody home . Does not do anything . Guess it 's target practice now ...
 got this cd player and hooked it up and the thing could not read any disc very disappionted with it . !!!! sent it back for a refund .
 Had gone through two units , both powering up , and skipping over disks , showing no CD 's . Tried different CD 's , same problem .
 The other morning , the unit suddenly came on by itself . No surge -- nothing else was effected , the lights did n't even dim . Came on , but wo n't function by either the remote or the buttons on the face of the unit . Gone . Should have paid attention to all the poor reviews . A little under a year old . Heck , I 've had off brand units last for five years ...
 Our complaint is that it started having serious problems about 6 months after we got it . It will suddenly stop playing , or , will pause for 2 or 3 seconds then continue . We like the ` random ' feature , but that has completely stopped working .
 Well , buying this player was a mistake . We were in a hurry to find a multi-disk changer before our wedding . I always thought Onkyo was a good name and I had found some favorable reviews . The audio is fine with this player , but about 2/3 of the time it wo n't recognize CDs . It does n't matter if the CDs are commercially produced or home-burned , and I keep my CDs in very good shape so it 's not a matter of fingerprints and scratches . It 's also interesting that if I advance to about track 3 until the CD is recognized and then back up to track 1 it will usually work ... what a pain in the ___ . It 's done this since day one but with the wedding arrangements I did n't have time to return it to the vendor within the first 30 days.Now the changer is bad , but so far trying to get through to their support has been even worse ! For 4 months I 've been trying to call in at different times of different days during their support hours . First off , I always get `` your call will be answered in 59 minutes '' . After about 30 minutes I typically ca n't wait any longer so I have to hang up . Once I let it go on for 30 + minutes than was disconnected . This morning we 're up to 66 minutes -LRB- since I started this I 'm up to 72 minutes -RRB- on the phone timer and they say the call will be answered in 8 minutes . If I get anywhere with them I 'll update the review , but my current opinion is DO N'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS COMPANY 'S PRODUCTS , especially this model CD changer .
 I do n't typically take the time to write product reviews , but I also rarely feel as frustrated as I do right now.I purchased this CD player in March 2008 . Six months later it stopped working . Onkyo gives you a one-year service warranty and advised me to take it to the nearest repair facility , which turned out to be about 45 minutes away from me.It took the repair people 2 months to fix this unit . They had to order three rounds of parts , and basically rebuilt the entire unit at a cost that well exceeded the original purchase price . Fortunately , the warranty covered the expense.Unfortunately , the unit broke again a week later.I tried calling the original retail store for an exchange , but they referred me back to Onkyo.An Onkyo Service Manager refused to take back the unit or offer any compensation . He said I needed to go through three rounds of service repairs before they would offer an exchange . When I explained that their service center had already gone through three order of parts and still could n't deliver a working unit , he said there was nothing more he would do.I 'm not the kind of consumer that gets upset easily and makes unreasonable demands . But after all the hassle I 've been through with this product , I feel Onkyo should offer me an exchange . I have several other Onkyo components and am otherwise happy with their performance . However after this ordeal , I 'm inclined to find a different product maker.Caveat Emptor !
 I 've had nothing but trouble with my unit . With brand new CD 's it sometimes will play all the CD 's loaded , sometimes not . I have to turn the machine off and on and otherwise it will refuse to play CD # 2 or # 4 or whatever . If you are looking for a CD player that you just load up CD 's and hit play this unit does not work , but the CD 's play just fine in my older CD player . Onkyo support does not call/email/write back . This was a new unit . I suggest you save your money .
 After purchasing this changer I will never buy another Onkyo component again . Approximately 20 % of my CD 's will not play in the random -LRB- shuffling -RRB- mode , those that do play will frequently stop playing , the display timer does not work , and Onkyo 's customer service is non existent.When I contacted Onkyo about the problems the only recourse I was offered was to return it to the point of purchase for an exchange . I did not consider this a fair solution since J&R ; is 3,000 miles and 2-3 weeks away via UPS . There is an authorized Onkyo repair shop a couple of blocks away from me , but Onkyo refused to assist me by dealing through them . I have decided to just cut my losses , just go buy another brand of CD changer.and tell anyone who asks what I think of Onkyo products .
 Over the years I 've owned many cd players . After purchasing my OnkyoI was so impressed by the sound it produced that I purchased a second one for my other system -LRB- yes I have two systems -RRB- . The good news is that this player will play any disc and play through scratches and imperfections . The bad news is that both of my Onkyo 's developed problems after 1 1/2 years . The players would n't turn on or off from time to time . The drawer would n't open . Strange error messages lit up in the display area . To turn off the players I had to unplug them . Very disappointing .
 It looks good on the surface but looks are deceiving . This was n't very heavily used in our household but the first part we had to replace six months after purchase was the imaging module . That took the player out for more than a month while we waited for a part and then the repair person could not exactly match the original manufacturer 's part . Now it 's stopping in the middle of songs , turning off and on by itself and has once reported some kind of error code on the front pannel though after a short wait started working again.Don ' t waste your money on this piece of junk IMHO . Your experience may varry .
 My first Onkyo 6 Disc CD Changer died in March of 2011 . It had played music without interruption for 19 years . What a great piece of equipment ! Since then , I have ordered two new CD changers in the past month -LRB- March 2011 -RRB- and neither one of them compares to the first . There are a number of issues with the new version . They do a poor job of playing CDs that are copies of original CDs . They stop in mid song and quit playing . Then mysteriously moves to the last song on the CD . We have no clue what makes the machine do this . It must be possessed ! Finally , on some CDs , when the last song has played , the changer will not switch to the next CD . We are totally bummed out by this . The overall machine does n't have the same quality as the old model and appears to be of cheaper materials .
 Stay Away from this one . This is my first review on Amazon and I just wanted to let people know that my unit froze up at the first year mark as other people have posted . Obviously there is a design flaw and I would stay away from this machine . It stopped working and will not open . I am not even going to try to get it fixed or repaired . Very disappointed in Onkyo .
 Bought this product in June 2008 , and had good service from it ... until September 2009 . The unit refused to come on with the remote or manually . Pulling out and reinserting the power plug resulted in the unit coming on , which allowed me to get all but 1 of my CD 's out . The unit , however , will not play the CD that has remained inside . I expected a better product from Onkyo , but this has definitely been a bug disappointment . I certainly would not recommend this product . Heed this warning , and those from the other reviewers who had problems with it . I should have paid attention to the poor reviews , but instead , I took a chance and got a product for < $ 150 , to use for 15 months ... Works out to roughly $ 10/month rental of an Onkyo DXC390
 After having this CD player for about 11 months , it started switching itself on at random times . I changed the surge protector/power bar it was connected to and made sure none of my remote control devices was creating the problem . Once the surge protector was changed the program disappeared for about a week or two , only to resurface . Now the device wo n't even switch on . No other device connected to the surge protector -LRB- ADM tuner , Yamaha cassette player , Acurus amp , Teac turntable , Terk antenna -RRB- has developed any problems over the same period . A Lemon .
 Worked great when first connected to receiver / speakers . Then it just stopped working . Could n't even remove my CD 's that were inside . Amazon refunded my money , -LRB- minus shipping and restocking fees -RRB- . I only had it for 5 months .
 This CD player initially seemed perfect for us . We liked the ability to load multiple CDs , and loved the sound quality . After several weeks however , it would power on randomly with a flashing blue light . We would turn it off , but a few minutes later it would come on again . Some CDs would n't play at all . Often it would start playing in the middle of a CD that was no longer in the player . Unfortunately , although it was a good idea , we would never buy this one again . It had so many issues it was n't worth trying to repair so it was put out with our E-waste less than a year after we bought it .
 I love Onkyo products ... . They work and sound great and do everything that you could ask for ... . Except this one . After a little over a year , I was noticing that the CD player would turn itself on . Soemtimes it would start playing the CD , others it would start and pause it . There were even times where I could n't control anything . I did some online research and it seems that there are a good amount of consumers having issues with this CD player . It was great before the issues started , but for $ 200 I should n't have issues .
 Simply put , the unit stopped working -LRB- EE PROM error -RRB- , after only occasional use , in 18 months . All factory reset solutions were tried - to no avail . I suggest looking at other brands/products .
 This is the second Onkyo CD player my Grandparents have owned , and also the second Onkyo POS to die in 3 years . I 've had good luck with my Onkyo surround sound system , but after doing a little reading on how Onkyo is treating its customers with this CD player , I have to say I 'll never purchase another unit of theirs again . I understand stuff happens , but FIX IT when it does happen ! The thing just goes haywire . Does n't recognize CD 's , the Pause light keeps going on/off randomly , it turns itself on , shows EEPROM-XXX : XX messages on the front , does n't eject the tray half of the time , etc. . WORTHLESS ! My old 25 disc Pioneer changer that is all of 10 + years old is still working just fine . Guess I know what brand to recommend for her next purchase . Goodbye Onkyo .
 The random shuffle feature does not work . It stops to play CDs randomly and you have to manually restart to carry on playing . If you want to use the random play - DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT . The help from the support center is so bad that you might as well toss this in the garbage . In any case , how much trouble do you want to go through with on a product that costs $ 130 ? So save yourself all the hassle and buy something that works .
 save your money folks . this one aint nothing but a paperweight . very poor quality control . only good thing is I 'm returning within 30 days so I can get my money refunded .
 Bought this unit from HH Gregg in May 2010 . Had minor problems during the first year or so but they were tolerable . Last month it started turning on by itself and now it is completely inoperable . I was lucky to get my discs out of it as it will sometimes not turn on at all and none of the controls on the unit or the remote work . I called the local Onkyo Service Center and they advised that it is not worth repairing . So 18 months old and headed to the scrap heap . Do not buy this unit !
 What a disappointment to descover that the tray that holds the CDs would not open . This machine now resides in the garbage . I am now searching other brands with the hope that someone makes a CD player that is not junk .
 I bought a new Onkyo X - C390 early on March 2009 , so I do n't give a continously use to this CD Player ... Maybe I play 30 times in 9 months , and three days ago , this item was absolutly out of control ... First
 Product does not work -LRB- CDs are not read -RRB- and I do not see any service listed in Brazil for Onkyo . It was sold as new , not as refurbished , but it had a bump on the side . What action can I take?Onkyo DXC390 6 Disc CD Player
 I bought this new less than a year ago . It had problems reading certain CD 's right off the bat . It always had issues with the 6-disk random shuffle . It would often skip two or three of the disks completely when fully loaded in the random shuffle mode . It now will not read or play any CD . Spend a $ 100 more and buy a better player . This did not even last 1-year .
 First , I was surpriesed of how big the player is.But it still can fit on my TV stand . The height is a bit to long though.I hooked up with Onkyo TX805 and it sounds amazing . Also it has good features as blue light on when the Cd is playing , random play , track selection and so on.I bought this because my Philips DVD -LRB- Upscaling and Region free -RRB- has a major fault playing CDs which is it makes a small noise when playing CDS.But this Onkyo CD changer can contains 6 CDs and sounds great so I am happy to have this.After using it for a couple of months , it begins to avoid playing a lot of CDs.Lense problem starts .
 I bought this -LSB- new -RSB- from Amazon not quite 1 year ago and now it 's dead . The sound quality seemed great -LRB- but then again I do have a 70 's Marantz receiver and big JBL speakers -RRB- , but now the on/off gets stuck on standby , then the tray wo n't open , and when I can finally try to play a CD , it starts skipping then stops playing . I even bought a CD-brush cleaner but the problem was n't as simple as a little dust.Why are stereo components nowadays made so crappy that you have to keep replacing them ? Is everything made in China ? Too bad they did n't make CD players back in the 70s when stereo electronics were made in the USA and Japan with QUALITY . I certainly ca n't recommend something that falls apart in less than a year .
 I have had good experience with Onkyo refurbs in the past , so it was a shocker when the tray of this refurbished Onkyo DXC390 6 Disc CD Player would not open when first powered up no matter what steps I took and `` Mech error '' appeared on the display . Onkyo seemed to prefer that I return the player to Amazon for refund , but I chose to submit it for repair under their warranty to a service agent about 20 miles away.When is `` refurbished '' refurbished ?
 Cds do not stay in position . Drawer often opens with cds scattered about.In random the cds randomly stop playing . I expected more from onkyo .
 The sound on this when i hooked it up was great . I have an Onkyo reciever so I ignored the large amount of bad reviews . I am an onkyo fan and do remain one . THis is not the CD player you are looking for . AS I said it worked , looked and sounded great ; for a day . Then the tray stopped opening and closing correctly . Specifically , it stopped closing and playing CD 's . Back to amazon immediatey ... which by the way , with UPS pick up , is five stars for amazon !! Great return service . I am going to try the Yamaha , i know they make a good product !! And for the record ; For those of you that think single function CD players are obsolete due to DVD players ; think again !! I will get back to you on the Yamaha . I have a feeling I will be very happy !!
 I ` ts funny how you HAVE to give one star in your reviews ! This does NOT deserve a star period ! Like many others on here , I have had nothing but problems with this unit ! It will NOT play any cd 's at all . I bought this new from Amazon and will never buy another Onkyo brand product again . Oh , and Amazon sent me another unit , and guess what ? Same problem . Do NOT but this product !
 Just over a year old and just out of warranty my purchased-new DX-C390 started with intermittent unresponsive controls , whether at the panel or remote . Within a few months it finally died , no control response , no power , no nothing . I saw it coming however -LRB- and after reading all the unfavorable reviews -RRB- and managed to get my cd 's out of it . After reading of Onkyo 's lackluster customer service record on this unit I 'm tempted to toss this thing in the trash instead of spending anymore money on it , not to mention the frustration I 'm apparently in for . There are too many other options . Be warned , do not spend your hard-earned money on this garbage .
 This unit had great sound , but died after a couple of years of very light use . I would n't buy it again .
 I used my unit for about 2 years until the dreaded `` Mechanical Error '' display message appeared . It froze and that was it . I opened it up to retrieve my discs and could not find any obvious mechanical problem . It was sitting stationary for the entire time and was never moved from its original location . If you want long-lasting quality , try another brand .
 i took this out of the box after a room was remodeled , unfortunately , this was beyond the 30 day return window , , i am attempting to play new and nearly new cd 's , all commercially made , , the player will pick up 2 out of six discs , i have tried this with different cd 's , same results , , forget about shuffling , , , after the first disk is loaded , it plays one track , then it goes into an infinite shuffle mode , never finds another disk , i am not going to get stuck on a phone for hours trying to reach some customer service rep like other discouraged buyers , this will go back to amazon , and even if i get a $ 10 partial refund i will be happier than having this piece of junk taking up space . this should go to the local dump
 I bought this player based on the reviews found on Amazon . It worked well for about 3 years and then just stopped playing CDs . Nothing happened to the unit and has been in the same spot for 3 years . It just up and died .
 On paper this was the perfect thing for my purposes . A small cushioned case with 2 sections to put a small hard drive , cables , iphone and laptop chargers . Unfortunately it is n't really the best designed thing . The two mesh ` pouches ' inside are very loose and as such anything you store in them tends to slip out into the middle crease of the folded case when you unzip and open it . Ideally there should be some sort of elastication of these mesh areas -LRB- especially the opening -RRB- to hold in whatever they contain . This probably was n't done due to the case being very soft overall meaning any elastic would pull it into an odd shape when not full.Nice idea , poor design . It is n't a very complicated item so how difficult can it be to get this right ?
 Bought this item for daughters birthday . Quit working in less then 40 days . Sent back to audiovox for repair or replacement under 90 day warantee . Recieved confirmation they recieved it . 2 1/2 months and nothing . Do not recommend buying due to unreliability of product and company.approx .1 month later now and several calls to the company . No results in getting it back . Company making all sorts of excuses to why they have n't done anything with it -LRB- lost it . Send it to the wrong place for repair . Busy time so be patient -LSB- if they are that busy reparing their products then that tells me they sell a lot of junk -RSB- . Etc. -RRB- Will never buy anything from Audiovox again . I take back the 2 stars I gave it and rate it and the company at 0 starsNow January 14 , 2008 . Audiovox wo n't answer their phone anymore . All I have got for 2 months is a busy signal on their 800 number . Still do n't have it back and do n't except to . Now I have a feeling I know where the used ones come from they sell . If you read this review `` buyer beware '' . Even seller ca n't get them to give an answer to why .
 Ok , I 'm going to start off with the GOOD things first ... excellent amount of space for the price ... radio on it ... etc. . Bad things ... it stops working like 4 months into using it . Yeah , so this is my SECOND mp3 player this year ... I 'm actually thinking about getting a good ole ' fashion disk player to save myself the money.Simply put , you get what you pay for .
 IT SO CHEAP IN QUALITY ALMOST SEEMS LIKE A TOY . THIS ITEMS SHOULD BE IN THE PRICE RANGE OF $ 15 .
 not happy with this product . used it twice . went to add music and it completely froze up and would not work .
 This player is junk . It advertises all these features and it probably has them , if you can find one that will work more than twice . I bought one and it worked twice and would n't come back on . I called the seller they gave me a RMA number and I returned it . I thought that maybe I just got a bad player so I asked for an exchange , which I got with no problem . I did have to pay six dollars shipping for the return though . A couple of weeks later got a new player . It worked a whopping two times before it quit . I knew it would be six more dollars shipping so I threw it in the trash ... which is where every one of these players by Audiovox belongs as far as I am concerned . The only reason I gave it one star is because I do n't think I can give it a zero . Know this product is a zero in my opinion . It is just terrible .
 I do n't know if laughing or crying . I received this item , unwrapped it , charged the battery , loaded some songs and tried it . It was like 6 pm . That night I tried it and it worked . Next day I took it to the gym and used it for 40 minutes . I did n't hit it on anything or something like that . Then , suddenly , the image on the screen mirrored . It mirrored ! all the words and graphics were flipped and looked as if you were looking at them from behind . One minute later all the image blurred . I could n't read anything in the screen , but it still played music . I noticed it had a reset button on the back , I pressed it . It went back to normal ... for a minute ! Then the image blurred again and PUFF ! it turned off . I got home , tried to charge the battery again , the image on the little screen was in a blur again . I disconnected it from the power
 I bought two of these for my teenage grandchildren for Christmas . The reviews listed here were good so I thought I was getting a fairly decent MP3 player for a reasonable price . These items have turned into a nightmare . One of them has been at Audiovox since just after Christmas because it has never worked . We sent it to the repair center we were directed to and were told it would be fixed by the end of the week at Easter , after having to call them . We still do n't have the item back and called again last week and were told that the center we were told to send it to for repair does not do that item so they sent it off to another repair center . The other player which did work in the begining does not work any longer . It quit working about a week after the warranty . Since I had ordered these items for Christmas early , the warranty was only good from the purchase date , not the date given as a gift . Along with these MP3 players I had purchased the I-Dog , which needs an MP3 player to actually work properly . Needless to say it was an extremely expensive mistake to purchase this item . I give this item zero stars .
 We ordered this MP3 player as a gift for our daughter . It worked for 10 minutes before 4 of the 6 buttons stopped working -LRB- no it was n't dropped or mishandled -RRB- . I called Audiovox to get it repaired under warranty . They had me send it to Alco Electronics , their designated repair facility . In January , it was signed for at the repair facility . From there nobody has admitted to `` having '' our MP3 player . After no less than 20 e-mails and phone calls , Alco does n't return phone calls or e-mails , and Audiovox rudely says it has forwarded my complaint to the repair facility and it is out of their hands , no refund despite their warranty 's wording . It 's April now and I still have n't gotten a working MP3 player or a refund . I am taking action with the Better Business Bureau . This was a cheap product even when it was working ! Build quality is poor , the removable faceplate sits flimsily on the player , the buttons have excessive play , though audio quality was decent for the 10 minutes it worked . In working condition it is n't half as good as the Sansa Clip that I bought to replace it . I will avoid Audiovox products from now on . I 'd give it zero stars if it were an option .
 Looks are deceiving . I have n't taken this item out on any serious adventure yet but out of the box it feels rather flimsy . The light in the back that swivels is tough to maneuver and I think it will probably break off sometime . The front light is kind of dim . The radio and flasher are OK . Everything works as supposed to , I just wish I shopped around before I picked this one up .
 Ordered this based upon the photo . You will not get whats in the photo but a zippered soft case , which is not what I wanted .
 For the price this bag is great ! Because of the size of todays handycams , digital cameras , cell phones , etc. you 'll find they can all fit into this one bag , which makes it easy to carry them all -LRB- & carry on airplane -RRB- when on vacation .
 The side pocket zipper does n't close!Good size fits DSC HX1 and all his acessories .
 I bought this for two reasons .1 -RRB- The previous samsonite bag I bought -LRB- `` Samsonite Worldproof 3.02 Blue/Black Deluxe SLR , Digital or Compact Camera Bag '' -RRB- is sturdy and very good .2 -RRB- Reviews from others with average rating of 4.5 I just received it and is a total useless product . I would never expect such a product from Samsonite . Here is what I could find in few minutes :1 -RRB- Walls of the bag are very thin bend like papers2 -RRB- The zippers are not good3 -RRB- The front pocket does not have a zip - what do you expect to put there . Its no good for anything other than big items like battery charger , cables etc. 4 -RRB- The adjustable partitions inside the bag are also not sturdy.Go for `` Samsonite Worldproof 3.02 Blue/Black Deluxe SLR , Digital or Compact Camera Bag '' even if it is $ 7 to $ 8 more . Do not risk your camera or camcorder .
 The box says dual component HD inputs . The set has only one set of component inputs . The DVI-D port does not support HDCP so it will not work with any new DVD player and set top boxes with DVI output since most have HDCP protection on them.I bought this from a local store -LRB- Fry 's -RRB- , returned it . Philips ' tech support is clueless about their own technology . The wonders of outsourcing!I would not buy this TV since it is not `` future proof '' . No DVI-HDCP and no HDMI . DVI input works for PC only . WTF would someone buy an expensice plasma for a computer .
 Sound goes out , customer service and tech support from Philips Magnavox is horrible , they told me my TV did n't have speakers , then they said it was the Sound Processing board , then the went back to the TV did n't have speakers , Now they admit the TV does have speakers but the board will take a couple months to order , ship and install . I WILL NEVER BUY FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN
 I would completely agree with the other review that states the DVI port is the only HD port on this TV and it does n't support HDCP -LRB- New Security for HD content -RRB- . I bought this TV when it first came out thinking it would be useable when more HD content was available ... . WRONG ! I just updated my receiver and DVD player and connected them with an HDMI to DVI-D cable thinking I was set for HD . The entire time I was setting up my new receiver and DVD player I was patting myself on the back for having the foresite to buy an HD ready TV . After getting everything setup I get NO picture on this TV and an HDCP error on the receiver because the TV does n't have the $ % # $ * & $ HDCP security . This was just another $ 5K wasted on technology that is n't supported by the industry or Philips . I just ca n't believe they are still able to market this TV as HD-Ready when it is quite obvious that HDCP security is going to be required for any device receiving HD content . Also , they are making sure that it 's illegal to provide any kind of adapter in the U.S. that allows the security to be bypassed and older devices -LRB- 3 years or less included -RRB- to be used with the new equipment . Do your homework before you waste this kind of money on a TV.I now have the most expensive computer monitor known to man , which will work until Microsoft finishes their version of HDCP for computers -LRB- Longbow -RRB- and makes it completly obsolete.I am just amazed at the complete lack of knowledge displayed by the so called `` expert '' reviewers on the Internet and in the stores who seem completely uneducated about this very real easily reproducable issue .
 small opening in the eyepiece makes the use of this counterproductive , as your eye needs to actually get closer to the piece . If you wear eyeglasses , like I do , forgeddaboutit !
 First off the photo listed here on amazon is not accurate of product . I went back and forth on whether or not I liked the adapter/magnifier . Ultimately I do n't use it anymore , you lose a small percentage of the view finder with the adapter on it , and considering that most dSLRs -LRB- i use d200 -RRB- are 95 % of the actual sensor/image area to begin with , losing another 5 % is not how I want to be shooting .
 So I lost the DK-21 that came with my camera while doing some night shooting . Big deal , I thought ! I had been looking at getting a magnifying eyepiece for a while and I was was really excited to have an excuse to try this out . As soon as I popped it on the camera , however , I knew that it was n't going to work for me.The first negative is that it cuts down on viewfinder coverage slightly , although if you hold it up directly to your eye it 's not that noticeable . The real problem is that it further reduces the size of the viewfinder hole . The thing is tiny , and if you wear glasses -LRB- like I do -RRB- then looking through this allows you to see only about half of the frame . With this on I was unable to see any of the exposure information at the bottom of the Viewfinder and I had to physically move my eye around to be able to see any corners or edges . I would compare it to trying to look through your viewfinder from several inches away , without actually putting your eye up to it.Terrible ! I feel cheated .
 I bought this initially with for my D40 and recently tried on my D300 . The optics are small and restricting cutting one 's field of view with eye glasses . I gave it a 1 star because Nikon did not do their best buy took shortcuts . It can be made properly and yes it would cost $ 50.00 but it would be a big hit and improve your viewing image . As it stands a total waste of money .
 I purchased this magnifying eyepiece for use with my Canon based on other user suggestions . Contrary to what others have said -- the eyepiece does not fit correctly on the XTi - it sits slightly too low and obscures view with an almost unnoticeable magnification . The magnification is not sufficient enough to justify purchase IMO . I also tried using it in conjunction with my eyepiece extender from canon to make up for the lose of magnification - bad idea .
 I owned this monitor for 12 days before sadly deciding that I just could n't keep it . The monitor looks great . The picture is sharp , bright , and beautiful . If you are the sort who will use your monitor only for desktop application work , then I can recommend this monitor . However , if you plan to watch any video or play any games then avoid it.Samsung claims a 4ms refresh rate for this monitor . That is a marketing way of saying it 's an 8ms model . This difference is in what is being measured . When monitors are listed as 8ms refresh models , the time refers to a pixel 's on-off-on time . In this case , only the on-off time is being timed . However , that being said , the refresh stats can mislead anyway.When I would watch recorded TV on this monitor , I would clearly see white trailing ghosts behind every moving object . Faces would wash out and become very bright . I played Half-Life 2 all the way through on this LCD , just to give it a fair test , and the results were poor.As there are no buttons on this monitor -LRB- save the power button -RRB- , all image adjustments are done with included software . The software is poorly designed , at best in my opinion . If you are running a firewall -LRB- I run ZoneAlarm -RRB- , and you enter into the color adjustment app , after about a minute it will lock up an XP machine , requiring a reboot . Work around this by manually adding the software to your firewall 's allowed list . I 've read that the software is trying to look for IP address 0.0.0.0 and that causes the problem . Also the apps are rather large and they add about 3 icons to your quick launch tray.I returned this monitor and exchanged it for the LG Flatron L1920P . A much better deal . I have only had this one a night , but after playing 10 levels of the same game , no ghosting . And the image is just as pretty .
 I bought a Premium laser HP Q5949A compatible toner cartridge and had n't had it for a month when the cartridge started leaving streaks on prints and when i went to take the cartridge out toner spilled all on the carpet . i will not be ordering any more cartridges from this company again . worse toner cartridge ever !!!
 Because this is an Apple product , I did n't read the reviews carefully . Did n't expect serious problems.The big issue
 I 've had three Mighty Mouses for my iMac , and after this last one , I decided no more . They all work just fine until they get dirty and quit working . Apple , in their infinite wisdom and greed , made these so that they ca n't be cleaned without breaking into them and dealing with the incredibly intricate interior components , and then putting them back together with Super Glue . So when it happened this last time , I just went out to OfficeMax and bought a wired Logitech m110 for $ 17.11 -LRB- incl tax -RRB- . It works just fine , plus is hugely cost effective , considering what Apple charges for their Mighty Mouse . This is the first time since 1984 that I 've encountered an Apple product that sucks -- I hope this is n't a trend .
 Although 321 Express -LRB- where this item was ordered -RRB- told they are located in Oregon , this item took 3 weeks and one day to arrive in Michigan BECAUSE it arrived directly from Beijeng China in a mailing envelope with no paper work , and no manufacturer 's number on the item . The roller ball on the Mighty Mouse does not move the scroll bar to the left as it should . I would never have ordered from this 321 Express -LSB- ironic name -RSB- had I known ahead of time how long it would take . Who would have dreamed it was going to be shipped directly from China ? The shipping was only $ 4.99 , but we did not know that would put our item on `` the slow boat from China '' . The shipping time was not known until AFTER the order was placed . We ordered from this company because it had the best price . The lower price was not worth the wait , for a partially -LSB- ? -RSB- DEFECTIVE Mighty Mouse . I will never buy from 321 Express again . VKJ
 I purchased the apple mighty mouse on here , and the description completely failed me . Although I got a pretty great price for such technology , it was VERY used and dirty , and I find now after using it that it it obviously slightly broken . I 've worked with many mighty mouses before and this one was defective . It makes the cursor jump around on the screen , and does not do anything very smoothly . Good thing I kept my magic mouse , I will be more careful in the future .
 Just as other customers already said , very simple
 I 'm a heavy graphics and presentation editor , and liked the idea of horizontal scrolling.Bought four of them for the office , and for the first few months they worked fine . The size and position of the side squeeze buttons takes a little getting used to , not optimal for most people , re-positioning the hand is often necessary . Then the scroll ball started sticking . Followed the recommended instructions to clean it , not much effect though . Surfed the web and found others with similar problems.Followed a website advice , took it apart , tried to access the scroll ball directly , but the components are not designed for that kind of behaviour amd re-seating was difficult . One of them now has a non-smooth base , useless to use . The other three are relegated to spreadsheet navigation , as the use for general graphics and imaging work became too frustrating , a scroll ball lock as you are trying to cut and paste or move a complex set of images was happening too frequntly.Maybe it is OK for light users , but can not recommend it as a full-time mouse .
 If you are looking for a two button mouse , get one with well defined left and right sides . With this one , it is not easy to click left or right due to the one-piece hard shell - sometimes getting the opposite result .
 The MM scrolls with a rubber ball on the top surface of the mouse . Like most mouses with a ball for scrolling or moving , particles of dust can get inside the chamber where the ball sits . The mice with rubber scrolling balls seem to be especially susceptible to this problem . My mouse worked fine for about 2 months , I loved it . But then the scroll function got erratic . I could feel the ball `` skipping '' on something inside , which is obviously built up dirt or dust . After a month of this , the mouse no longer scrolls.Now , most mouses with scroll balls have an easy way to remove the plate covering the ball , so you can take the ball out and clean it , and the sensors surrounding it . Unfortunately , the geniuses at Apple designed the mouse in such a way that you can not do this on the Mighty Mouse . So guess what ? When the scroll ball gets dirty and stops working properly , you get to THROW THE MOUSE AWAY ! Hey , why bother making it cleanable , just give Apple another 50 bucks - it 's DISPOSABLE!I 'd really like to meet the designers of this mouse and ask them what they were thinking when they put it together . If you want to buy a disposable 50 dollar mouse , buy all means , plunk down the cash for this piece of junk .
 It was the most horrible mouse I ever bought.It has of course wonderful design , nut disgusting functionality . As it is designed actuallt as one button mouse it keeps mistaking which button you are actually pressing . The roller is too small so it frequently miss your rotating , and you have to use more power , so you get some of the mouse buttons mistakely pressed . The cord is too short , so you can put it just near your mac . I got rid of it , and using my old mouse , and really amazed who convinient it was ... It always gives me the correct button i am pressing !
 When I first bought this mouse , I was pretty excited . The scroll ball is fun to use and feels precise , and it 's a nice aesthetic match . But after using it for a few months , I have some serious gripes .1 . The right click . Although when I sit there and deliberately push the right side of the mouse I always get a right click , when I play games with fair frequency I end up getting a left click when I expect a right . Pretty critical when you 're playing games , in fact , I 've stopped using the right mouse button and started to use option-click instead . So from four buttons we go down to three .2 . The squeeze . It requires an awkward hand movement and an inordinate amount of strength . It 's unusable . So from three buttons we go down to two .3 . The middle click is accomplished by pressing on the scrolly ball . Theoretically you can press in the middle of the mouse , but due to the already existing left/right precision issues the only way you can be certain you 're getting a middle click is by pressing the ball itself . This too is an awkward reach , and it 's an irritant when you left-click instead of middle-clicking by accident when you 've highlighted something in an xterm and want to paste it elsewhere , as often you end up highlighting something else instead.So for me this is effectively a one-button mouse with a somewhat cool scroll ball.Somewhat cool , because most programs still do n't support any kind of horizontal scrolling , and some do very stupid things . If you are a Firefox user you will HATE this mouse since Firefox maps left and right scroll to page forward and back . The scrolly ball is very sensitive , so when you scroll up and down a page you will inevitably end up accidentally navigating Back in your browser instead.All in all , it 's probably the worst Apple product I 've ever bought . Interesting concepts , terrible execution .
 This is simply an awful product . Even the reviews on the MAC website concur with this opinion.The problems are numerous
 It 's nice to see Apple finally moving toward two-button mice , but this just is n't the answer . Maybe it is just my hands , but I find it impossibly hard to separate the left and right mouse button . More often than not I am right-clicking when I try to left - . It practice it means I keep doing stupid stuff like removing elements from the Safari toolbar when all I want to do is click.Mine is now collecting dust in favor of a traditional two-button mouse.I do , however , really miss the scroll ball . I know many do not , but for me a normal wheel seems hamstrung once you 've used the ball on the mighty mouse .
 This is hands down the worst mouse I 've ever used . I 'm a programmer at a design agency , so we all use Macs , including this mouse . Repeatedly using this mouse over many hours cramps my hand , wrist , and shoulder on my right side . I recently worked overtime on a Flash website , and at the end of the deadline my hand was so cramped it was painful to extend my first finger.Aside from the less than optimal mouse shape , the biggest problem is the scroll dot . The more use your mouse gets , the more likely it is to stick so you ca n't scroll at all . You can unstick it by holding the mouse upside down and vigorously rolling the ball in all directions . However , despite doing that regularly , I still have problems scrolling up with it . It takes more force to scroll up now , which cramps your hand and stresses your wrist.I do not recommend this mouse for anybody who uses a computer more than a few hours a day .
 The scroll ball is a good idea , and I enjoyed it while it lasted , but mine is n't working anymore after just 1 month . Otherwise , the mouse is ergonomically awkward , feeling more like a plastic potato rather than a computer device . The side buttons are touchy and can be accidentally triggered when moving the mouse . The mouse lacks a defined left and right button too , leaving you to control-click to get contextual menus.Here 's a tip -- get a better designed , 2 button mouse with a scroll-wheel . If you need to scroll horizontally , press SHIFT on the keyboard , then use the scroll wheel . If it 's all configured correctly , you can scroll horozontally through the window . Apple markets this mouse as the only one that lets you scroll horizontally , but this is not the case .
 The cord on this mouse is so short that I am unable to use it with my Apple lap top . I am right handed and all of the USB ports are on the left side . The cord is n't long enough to go around my computer to the other side .
 The mighty mouse is a good idea , that was n't implemented correctly until theApple Magic Mouse . The quick version of this review
 Buy this product once , regret it for the rest of the time you own it . Yet another example from Apple of a beautiful piece of design with no regard for functionality . Scroll ball frequently fails , making using this $ 50 piece of garbage a blistering frustration . I 'm using one right now and ca n't scroll at all , up or down . Right-clicks are often not recognized . You 'll end up wanting to throw this thing out the window . Save yourself , your money , and your blood pressure . Avoid all Apple peripherals . They are famous for failing . IMO , this is yet another monumental abdication of responsibility to a loyal customer base . Strongly recommend boycotting this company until it acquires a conscience .
 I use this mouse at work , because it was an `` upgrade '' which came with my new computer.I have a simple Logitech at home so I am comparing the two , I guess.scroll ball-The new feature for the Mighty Mouse is the scroll ball . The ball scrolls up , down , left , and right . At first this seems useful , but I have found my monitor is wide enough that I do n't really need it . So seldom do I use it . At home I might because my monitir is smaller . But most site are built on Up and down in mmind , so maybe this is too ahead of it 's time.buttons-the left and right click are housed under one piece of plastic , so I always hit the wrong one , I tend to hit toward the center of the mouse itself , so I hit the center of the mouse , confusing it . I hate this feature or lack thereof , form should follow function not other way around . look at all other mice.shape-the basic shape of this mouse is a flat oval , again nice to look at but no support for your hand , no place to rest your palm , as the mouse does n't curve up to meet your hand.side buttons-becasue of shape these are hard to use , also they take too much pressure to make work . the shape of the mouse frsutrates you.message for apple , form follows function .
 Wherever Apple 's brand is connected with quality and good design , it wo n't hold here . A mouse is hardly - what you would call - the product of advanced engineering , yet Apple managed to produce something so useless , it resides on my desk with a scrollwheel , that was never meant to give you good grip , and that 's now jammed . I wo n't even go into the details of randomly swapping clicks . Yes , i know Macs have no need for a right-click button . Should it not work properly then for only that reason ?
 1 . it does n't differentiate very well between right and left clicks2 . the scroll thingy gets clogged and wo n't scroll down any moreother wise it 's great , it would be great I mean , if it were n't a defective design , apple seems to always want to sell stuff before it 's ready , maybe in a year or 2 you 'll be able to buy a functional mighty mouse
 Do n't get me wrong , I love Apple stuff ; and part of my passion stems from having something more unique . Unfortunately when it comes to this `` mighty '' mouse , Apple failed miserably . It 's hard to imagine how bad it can be , given all the versions and trial data available since the original 2-button Microsoft serial mouse . Lets face it , an input device behaves the same regardless of whether it 's plugged into a PC or Mac . You certainly did n't Apple make an attempt to change the layout of a QWERTY keyboard . So how come Apple did not take all the lessons learned from the likes of Microsoft -LRB- HW division -RRB- and Logitech and come up with something better ? Instead , you get this piece of junk that 's neither ergonomic or convenient .
 Hey , I feel this is like a BIG step back . I had already got used to a wireless mouse and then we have to go back to a corded one?Thanks but no thanks , It is so simple to make a wireless mouse that I have no doubt Apple -LRB- being so innovative ??? -RRB- should come up with one VERY soon ... THEN I 'll buy one ! Meanwhile I 'll continue to use my old Microsoft Intelli Mouse.Now I 'm a little dissapointed .
 I got a wired Mighty Mouse bundled with a brand new 24 '' iMac . After -LRB- trying -RRB- to use it for a while , it 's now relegated to a drawer for backup duty in case a better mouse breaks . I have two main reasons for giving this such a poor review : -LRB- 1 -RRB- The design is inconvenient to use for all of the many reasons other people have documented . The `` regular '' mouse has evolved over the course of many years , millions of users , and scores of manufacturers for a reason
 At first I was excited about the mighty mouse . The scroll ball worked very well , freely scrolling in any direction . The side squeeze buttons were a bad idea , because they could activate by holding the mouse too tight , but they can be disabled easily . But the mighty mouse has a much more serious and annoying design problem ... The scroll ball gets dirty , and there is no way to open the mouse and clean it ! The scroll ball collects dirt over time just like the trackball in older mouse . But thanks to the brilliant engineers at apple , there is no way to open and clean the inside of the mouse without potentially braking it . After a while you will loose scroll functionality and have no reasonable way of fixing it . Within three months of use , I could scroll down but not up . The apple support people instructed me to clean it by repeatedly wiping the top of the mouse with a cloth . This only sort of cleaned it , the inside of the mouse was still dirty . The scroll ball only works on and off with this method , so cleaning it this way is clearly BS.I 'm still struggling to understand apple 's reasoning with making a mouse that you can not open . Apple has made trackball mice for years , and each one let you open it to clean the inside when the ball got dirty . This is an essential feature . I do n't understand why apple thinks a scroll ball on top of the mouse would not need to be periodically cleaned exactly the same way.If you are buying a new computer from apple , I suggest getting a regular two-button optical mouse to go with it .
 i bought this about a month ago and i 'm sorry i did . when i use the scroll ball it always jumps me back to my previous page on the internet which gets very irritating after the tenth time in five minrtes especially when using firefox . highly unreccomended .
 Finally someone at Apple realized that a single button mouse was not enough for the complex tasks so they decided to put a bunch of designers to create something completely new . Something no one has ever seen . A mouse with two buttons and a ` special ' button that allows you to go multi directions . At a bargain for just a bit under $ 50 . For $ 50 you get a super duper high tech mouse that has so much precision that you can get a whopping gazillion dpi for dead on accuracy . But do n't go looking for that spec in their website . It 's super secret .
 Oh , great . Somebody at Apple decided it was finally time to give up on the single-button model , but they had to save face , so they decided to -LRB- a -RRB- leapfrog the scroll wheel and -LRB- b -RRB- not give up on the one-button look.Now , the trackball sounded like a good idea to me ; being able to scroll around in two dimensions could be convenient , particularly on badly-designed Web pages where I have to scroll horizontally on each line -LRB- usually I just give up on those -RRB- . But the capacitance trick made me suspicious -- I remember the capacitance buttons of the early 1980s . Buttons that you can push just by touching , and not get any feedback , were a Bad Idea.So today I stopped by the Apple Store in Cambridge , and tried out a Mighty Mouse . The first thing I noticed was that , if I rested my hand on the mouse , the trackball was out of reach of my fingertips ; if I wanted to use it , I had to pick up my hand . -LRB- This might be because my fingers are longer than average -- I have the same problem with most scroll wheels . -RRB- Also , the trackball was * tiny * ; I could see my fingers cramping up really quickly if I used it heavily.The next thing I noticed was that , yes , the capacitance trick worked , and you did have to actually press the button , not just touch it . However , it works only if you touch it on just one side of the mouse . If you click on the right side , while also touching the left side , it 's going to register as a left click . So , if you rest your hand on the mouse , then you have to lift your hand off the mouse in order to do a right click.It 's a failure . I really do n't understand this
 This mouse is without a doubt the worst mouse I 've owned in the past 20 years , and I 've used a lot . I 've used it on an iMac for the past four years , and it constantly presents problems , such as :1 . The side buttons are very difficult to squeeze and have no clear function anyway .2 . The rollerball becomes dirty and freezes after short periods of use . Even when I get it working again after a thorough cleaning , it works erratically in controlling the scrolling .3 . The mouse uses up batteries at an alarming rate .4 . The mouse is grossly overpriced . I can get a reliable USB wireless mouse for half as much.With this mouse , Apple appears to have indulged its cleverness in design without paying any attention to usability , reliability , and functionality . This one belongs in the iApple Hall of Shame .
 I 'VE had a wireless Mighty Mouse for about 6 weeks . Yes I was one of those gyped by Apple into purchasing hardware just before a new release . In any case the mouse is not one of Apples strong products . Apple seems to favor style over function and indeed while the mouse looks cool it does n't work well.The right click functions intermittently -- it 's not a clearly defined button and if you do n't push in the exact right location or push a little to hard you get a left click . Very strange for such an `` innovative '' company.The other problem is that scrolling simply stops at times . Many others have this same problem it 's apparently due to a long standing uncorrected design problem . With this mouse in normal use skin oil or some other `` contamnant '' easily gets on the roller . To get it to work again you have to somehow clean it . Instructions this range from simply turning the mouse over and moving it on a clean piece of paper to taking the thing apart.I 've never , not once , had a mouse problem in the PC world . Those considering a switch to Apple should ipurchase a non Apple mouse as Apple does n't appear to know how to make a reliable functioning product.Pros -- It looks kind of cool.Cons -- It does n't work well
 The mouse itself is sleek , slick and effortless to use . However , it loses ALL of it 's stars -LRB- and Apple loses alot of my good will -RRB- , because of the scroll wheel issue . If you do n't believe me just go out on the ` net and search `` mighty mac scroll down '' and watch the anger rise up from cyberspace . I am FAR from alone.I bought my iMac Pro in December of 2007 and I 'm ALREADY on my second mouse - both of them with the same exact problem . After a very short while , you will notice the scroll wheel not working when you 're scrolling down . ALOT.So , you have to stop what you 're doing , blow into the hole AND / OR clean the wheel with a damp cloth AND / OR turn the mouse over and roll it around on a cloth or a piece of paper to dislodge whatever miniscule dust or dirt particle gets in the wheel house of the mouse . You ca n't open up the mouse without a major hassle so you 're left frustrated and wanting to switch to Logitech bad . It does n't seem to take much - any microscopic little bit of dust or dirt that gets in there will see you spending plenty of time trying to get the thing working properly . And when you do fix it , it wo n't take long for the very same problem to recur.On the other hand , it 's a great mouse if you work in a freakin ' clean room.The store felt replaced my first one at no cost and when I was there to pick up this new replacement the guy said `` I doubt you 'll have much better luck with this one , to be honest '' .
 The product review claims , '' ... detect where you 're clicking , transforming your sleek , one-button mouse into a two-button wonder . '' To use the right hand click on this mouse , one must remove the left part of your hand from the mouse or it will register as a normal click . This is extremely inconvenient . Next time Apple should try to make a true two button mouse or change the logic of their software . I should n't have to change how I use my mouse to accommodate a product with a UI flaw.-Opinion from a new mac user
 I 'm a big mac user , usually love their products , but I got ta say ... this mouse has turned out to be a disappointment . Two reasons :1 . The right-click/left-click technology has never worked .2 . The scroller just stopped working today ... after owning it for only a matter of months . I can no longer stroll down , just up and side-to-side . I 've just ordered a new mouse .
 One thing apple lacks is the ability to design a mouse that is easy to control . At first I thought it was cool , apple came out with a mouse that had 2 buttons with the scroll plus the squeezable sides . First thing I did was turn off the sides , I could just grab the mouse and it would activate the sides . I also have a problem with the scroll ball it 's way too sensitive!Now I wish I would have spent have the money and bought a Logitech !
 The scroll ball , is horribly designed.If your finger is even slightly damp , it will stop working.Finally one day it just refused to scroll down anymore . Back to the design boards Apple , in the meantime , I 'll stick to Logitech .
 I was excited about my Mighty Mouse , because I do a lot of horizontal scrolling.Downsides : The short cord -LRB- VERY short -- get an extension if you do n't have a laptop -RRB- is a bit of a bummer , and the left/right click recognition is a bit messed up , and the side buttons are basically useless -LRB- I am unable to get my fingers into a comfortable position to use them -RRB- ... Upside : That said , I still liked it . I like the programmable scroll button and the feel and size of the mouse . I like the quiet whirring the scroll ball makes when I spin it.Ultimate downside : So why 2 stars ? Well , maybe mine 's a fluke , but after two weeks of standard business use , my scroll ball has stopped working . I consider that unacceptable and it makes me think seriously about returning -LRB- not exchanging ! -RRB- the product .
 The Mighty Mouse is undoubtedly stylish and very clean-looking . I got mine with my iMac , and it matches the computer and keyboard very nicely.Unfortunately , being a matching accessory is all this mouse does well.As other users have mentioned , the clicking will take some getting used to . Even after six months , I still do n't always right-click properly every time.The sensors on the sides are interesting , to say the least . At first , it seemed like a good idea to be able to view the Expos&eacute; by putting some pressure on the mouse . But once I started using mouse-heavy programs , like Photoshop and Maya , I had to disable the sensors because I was constantly pressing them accidentally.Finally , the scroll ball - the reason why I am writing this review . About a month after getting my computer , the scroll ball started acting up . It would only scroll in one direction , due to dust and dirt inside the mouse . This normally is n't a problem , but since Apple designed this mouse with only the design in mind , the user is unable to clean the inside of the mouse . Why ? Because it does n't open ! -LRB- Sounds just like the first generation iPods that needed to be shipped back to Apple for battery replacement , does n't it ? -RRB- Scroll functionality returns after a few days , but then the scroll ball will start acting up again within a few weeks . It 's very frustrating to use.What surprises me the most about this mouse , though , is that some people actually look past its flaws and buy MORE of them when they break ! I really do n't understand that mentality . If something malfunctions , I tend not to buy it again . And again . And again.I 'll be buying a new mouse soon , and it will definitely not be an Apple-made mouse . I prefer other companies who put the functionality of their product before its design .
 I got this mouse for the sleek design and its nifty scroll ball - great for zooming and scrolling sideways in audio editing applications.The bad news
 i 'll keep this short : i hate this mouse ... im using it right now . ive cleaned the ball twice this morning , and it still wo n't scroll . it worked fine for about two months , then the problems started . the two side buttons are useless and difficult to push in . it is overpriced and has never functioned right after those first two months .
 I use this item at work . So far in the span of about 2 months , 2 of them have broken , meaning the middle ball stopped scrolling downward.Another complaint I have is that the left and right mouse click is n't reliable because they actually are n't separate buttons . Periodically the mouse also goes into spaz mode where it will autoclick by itself for long periods of time -LRB- up to a minute -RRB- . I 'm not impressed , and have to replace 2 mice now and will not purchase another unmighty mouse .
 The scroll wheel does not work . I am on my third one and it needs to be thrown out the window.This is a huge distraction from my day .
 I am a fan of Apple products iMac , MacPro , MacBooks and iPhone -LRB- i have them -RRB- but the Mighty Mouse is one of the WORST product ever ... Sure it looks stylish and nice , really cute mouse but I am so annoyed by the fact that the scroll ball stopped working only after a few months of using the mouse . And I have pretty dry hands/fingers , ... no grease at all . I read comments online about people complaining that they had problems with it but I thought to myself , nah , that wo n't happen to me since I do n't have greasy hands ... WRONG !! The mouse ability to attract dirt and dust and stuff is amazing . I try to keep it clean -LRB- I clean it regularly once every two weeks -RRB- but it still accumulates dirt and stops working !!! Wow , just wow Apple , making a nice mouse just for the eye and not for the hand to work ... If you are reading this review and thinking about shopping it , please be warned this mouse looks good , but after a while all you care is why it does n't work ? Not how cute looks !!! I followed the instructions to disassemble the mouse and cleaned it . It now works but I think this process is tricky and it is not something I recommend everybody doing . I never had to clean the other mice that I owned -LRB- Microsoft mouse ... -RRB- Dear Apple , I will not be getting your new Magic mouse ... I know it looks good and has multi-touch and all that glitter , but you lost me ... I am shopping now for a Logitech Performance Mouse MX.Bad Apple ... bad apple
 I 've had two of these fail in less than a month , for a $ 50 mouse , that 's dismal . I have a $ 10 Macally two button mouse that is going to last forever , but it does n't have a scroll ball , just the standard wheel.Apple screwed the pooch big time on the mighty mouse , the scroll ball has the functional lifespan of a snowball in hell . Within a week or two under normal conditions , the little rollers inside the ball mechanism get gummed up with human detritus and the scroll ball stops working , usually in the down direction , the most used and needed function , of course.I cleaned mine , from the outside , does n't work for longer than a few hours or a day or so . Cleaned it from the inside , removing the trim ring , disassembling the ribbon cables , removing the ball mechanism , cleaning the rollers . That lasted another week or two , a couple times , then it kept getting worse , cleaning multiple times a day , then it stopped working . The ribbon cables and connectors are not made to be worked on.I 'd say the mighty mouse is worth less than $ 10 .
 I have had two of these , both with the same problems . The roller ball works well for a period of time and then fails due to what appears to be a jam . I agree with the many other reviews that the left and right click could be improved upon as well , but it seems secondary when the scrolling ball has failed completely.The mouse looks ok and suits the mac in aesthetic but not in function . My suggestion for anyone out looking for a mouse is to evaluate your need and find a mouse designed specifically for your application . ie . portablity , graphic design , low price , etc. . If the Migthy Mouse was $ 15 , I would still recommend against it.I must admit , it amazes me that apple has not designed a better mouse . There must be more margin in ipod , iphone and itunes for them to spend too much time on this well publicized problem.A last chance way to try and save or extend the life of your failing Mighty Mouse ... I can often clear the jam by rotating the ball in various directions for a couple of minutes but inevitably it fails again.With all this being said , the customer service department has been great with apple in the past . Let 's hope their mouse development department catches up quickly ...
 Pretty good mouse at first.We use this on a family computer that gets lots of use . The scroll ball is constantly out of order and it is just plain annoying to be dealing with fixing it all of the time.This seems like form over function problem .
 this mouse came with my intel-imac 17 '' , and i loved it . the 360 degree scroll is something fascinating and very intuitive to use , and also the lateral button was very good as `` expos&eacute; '' . maybe i prefer the rough finish of traditional mouses better instead of the shiny one of the mighty mouse , but that 's no real issue when the mouse works.but in less then 3 months of use , the scroll stopped working and after research in the net , i found that the mouse has a serious project issue that prevents it from being properly cleaned
 I bought the MIghty Mouse when I purchased my MacBook without out any research on Bluetooth mice . This thing has caused me nothing but problems . I am now on my third mouse -LRB- replaced free from Apple -RRB- because the scroll ball quits scrolling one direction -LRB- the current one which i 've only had for one week no refuses to scroll up -RRB- . It also periodically quits working all the time . And because of the fabulous design , I ca n't take the mouse apart to do any cleaning.Because of the single button design , I have a hard time getting the right click to work half of the time.Lastly , for some reason , if I turn the mouse on while the computer is already up and running , the Bluetooth wo n't recognize the mouse -LRB- it has no problem recognizing the keyboard -RRB- . I then have to turn the Bluetooth off and then on again to get recognition.Please DO NOT buy this mouse .
 I 'm on my third Mighty Mouse in 3 years . At $ 50 a pop , I expect them to last longer ! Inevitably , after about a year or so , the trackball stops scrolling in one direction or another . I tried cleaning it with compressed air , but no luck . I always admire the MM 's functions for 12 or so months , and then BAM ! It chokes .
 Good Mouse until they break . 9 months and then the scroll ball died . Same thing happened to a friend . Poorly made , and Apple only gives a 90 day warranty . Not happy for $ 60 .
 This product has a unique idea in the scroll ball , and kudos to Apple , whom are always thinking of new ways and ideas . Apple is the best computer company by far on the planet when it comes to innovation . But innovation does n't necessarily mean great products.The Apple site somewhat falsely advertises the right click as a `` powerful secret , touch sensitive technology . '' Not so , this mouse is not `` touch sensitive '' in the way the side buttons are on a cinema display or on an ipod , for example . It simply detects which way you press ... and beleive me , if you 're not too clear on that , right click becomes left click real easy . I found after many weeks of using this that I found myself using a moderate amount of force with 3 fingers -LRB- r/s -RRB- and virtually pushing the mouse on it 's side to get it to consistently right click.Another issue are the side force buttons . It takes way too much touchy force to get this customizable feature to activate . After practice it works fairly well , but you have to squeeze with a decent amount , and more critical , the timing has to be quite exact.Finally , the scroll ball 4th click is also iffy . You have to press the scroll ball down with the mouse to activate the 4th button , but this is easier said than done . Works 9/10 times . But that 10th time , well , you end up left clicking.I am an Apple fan through and through , own a Powerbook Ti and Mini Mac -LRB- OSX 4.4.4 Tiger -RRB- and a 20 '' Cinema Display ... . but this mouse squeaks , not roars .
 I have had the Mighty Mouse for several years . Scrolling works OK . My Microsoft mouse seemed to have much better/smoother scrolling.The roller ball was the first to fail . I had the mouse cleaned and the ball worked poorly for another couple of months - then failed completely.I have talked and blogged with many others who have had the same problems . Apple needs to upgrade their mouse products .
 You 've heard others call this the `` world 's worst mouse '' and I came here to agree . Not only is this thing overpriced , it is also terribly designed . The Design . Be careful , after 2 months of using it , its pretty much injured my wrist . I 've never had this problem with even the cheapest 2 dollar USB mouse out there . The Tracking . Absolutely horrible . There are times when you do n't know why there 's tracking delay , even though the battery is full . You make adjustments on the setting and it pretty much mess up the tracking even more . Its extremely frustrating because you ca n't fix this problem even by replacing the battery . . I now have two generations of Macs and the only reason why I have them on both occasions is because this thing comes with the box , and the same problems goes with both . I know people who basically threw away this mouse because of the same reason .
 When it works it 's fine . The first few times , you can clean it with an alcohol soaked cloth BUT almost invariably the scroll button on top gets so gunked up it ca n't be cleaned without literally cutting off part of the bottom to get at the items -- a highly skilled technician task . check on the Internet by searching for `` cleaning apple mouse or scrollbutton '' and you 'll see for yourself . Apple should be thoroughly ashamed of producing such a defective design .
 I dont know if they have something against real two button mice or what , but please , this one is just horrible . Its tricky to get the right click to work . You have to press in just the right place or it doesnt work . The little microscopic ball thats suppose to be the scroll wheel isnt doing much for me either . I work a lot with my hands so they are pretty rough . A lot of time when I roll my finger across the ball to scroll , my finger rolls across it but the ball doesnt move . Just buy a good two button mouse and you will be better off . Please try again apple , I hope the second attempt is the charm .
 I just bought my first iMac . I love the computer but hate the mouse -LRB- it came with it -RRB- . It is always jumping all over the screen . It is hard for me to control it . The scroll function works okay and the design is nice and sleek . I am definitely going to get another mouse before it drives me nuts .
 This mouse is incredibly difficult to use . There 's actually only one button
 I have had the wired Mighty Mouse for three months with my new Intel iMac . A few days ago the scrollwheel stopped working . I used a textured cleaning pad on it and it now is fine . I hope this lasts but at least for now I have my scrolling capacity back . Forget right and left click capabilities , they do n't work . I wish Apple would finally give it up and create a fully functional professional quality mouse . This is a start but that 's all .
 I own this product and it worked great when I first bought it . After a few years , the side buttons went out , then the main button started to tweek out . It would click on everything and anything ... when I was dealing with files and folders , they would all of a sudden disappear becuase my mouse was clicking on them , accidentally , when I was moving it across the screen . I had a lot of trouble with this because I hadno other mouse to plug in and return things to normal . i pretty saavy with electronics , so I opened it up - there 's some very fragile circuit tape on the inside which broke fairly easily - not a user friendly schematic . I would n't recommend buying this product .
 This receiver has two -LRB- 2 -RRB- component video in ports -LRB- SAT and DVD -RRB- but it only has audio out for one -LRB- ! -RRB- . Insane . It could have 200 component video-out ports but if only one of them is capable of audio then what is the point ? I have never seen engineering this poor fron a brand known for quality . Advertising this as a product with two component out ports is blatantly lying to the customer . If you do n't mind crawling around behind your entertainment center whenever you wish to change from cable to DVD , this is the receiver for you !
 A co-worker of mine bought this receiver and had me come over to hook everything up . He got it because he wanted to eliminate as many wires as possible . Well come to find out the HDMI only does video , NOT audio . Also like someone else pointed out you can not change any of the audio inputs so you are stuck with only one option . I would recommend spending a little extra money on something better , which should not be hard to find !
 Bought this receiver thinking it would give me incredible sound with myBose 2.1 system but was disappointed . I had an older sony str model and got great sound and deep bass . This model , however , does not push my sub to it its potential . It sounds like my bose computer speakers . Stay away !
 I just got this unit and must say that I am disappointed . It maybe because I was expecting it fully decode hdmi audio instead of having another optical in for the same source . So when I connect my PS3 I can not listen to full uncompressed audio in LPCM which is available only in hdmi . If you have only optical audio to take care of , you will be find with this receiver . But if you are looking at it just because it has `` HDMI '' , beware and read the fine prints .
 As an audio receiver it is decent , but if you are looking for an A/V receiver , do n't buy this product . It advertises as a 2 hdmi passthru , but you only get 1 optical with video , and at 1080i and no audio thru hdmi . You will end up buying an hdmi switcher that can handle 1080p and audio thru hdmi to minimize cost/clutter in all the cables . -LRB- ie . might as well bought more expensive product . -RRB- In all the confusion consumers have on trying to buy a quality receiver , I wish Sony would stop making inferior products , and sell just 3 models that better fit an audiophiles profile .
 Bought this on the Black Friday from BestBuy as there was a great deal ... had to return it as the left surround speaker connection was not working when hooked up . . also Front A speaker connections were not working ... I went to exchange it . . but the other Receiver had the same issues when tested in the store ... so returned this item and bought a Yamaha 5.1 Channel Receiver ... it is working just great ... I am not sure if the receiver itself is too bad or my luck : - -RRB-
 HDMI is supposed to carry both video AND audio signals . This receiver carries only video , non included opticla coax is required for DVD player and optional optical digital calbe is required to crry sat TV , only the video is carried throught the HDMI - very misleading spend a few more bucks and get the audio with the video .
 After having owned the Sony STR-DG1000 for the past 3 years , I had very high expectations of a Sony A/V amplifier . So , when the time came to add a new amp with an additional HDMI input , I jumped at the STR-DH510 as perfect for my needs . Unfortunately it is not . The sound quality is poor - even with the treble turned all the way up , there is a steep roll-off to frequencies above 10kHz . I have switched back and forth between the STR-DG1000 and the STR-DH510 a few times now , using my KEF speaker system on each . I am not imagining it - the STR-DH510 sounds vastly inferior to the STR-DG1000 , to the point where I can not enjoy music on it . I am just constantly reminded of how much better the audio would sound if I were listening on the STR-DG1000 . Additionally , analog video -LRB- composite or coax -RRB- does not pass through to the HDMI output , making this amp a poor choice for people like me who have built an HDMI link into the wall.Overall , the product is a big disappointment and I 'll be returning it , perhaps to go buy another STR-DG1000 .
 I bought this based on the Sony name but after doing so it reminded my why I do n't normally buy Sony products . The set up is very confusing and the biggest con is you have to use a TOS link cable to get sound . I eventually found this out after searching on line . The volume is not earth shattering but that can actually be a good thing as there does not seem to be any distortion .
 After less than 4 months , I 've had to return the unit . The front display indicates `` Protect '' and the receiver does not work . This is NOT an isolated problem , as there are numerous blogs on the internet regarding this issue . I had anticipated reliability when purchasing a SONY product , not failure . I 've mailed my receiver to SONY 's service center in Texas and awaiting its repair , and in the meantime , I 'm without an amplifier .
 This reciever is a POS . You probably cant even buy these anymore , but if you are thinking about getting one from somewhere on the web , DO NOT !! Here 's the problem . It says it has HDMI inputs -LRB- 2 -RRB- . Well it does . But guess what ! They are useless . All they do is pass the video on to your TV . You have to run an audio cable as well as the HDMI cable to get the sound to play on this POS . Now I have read some reviews say , `` so what ? they pass the video only . so ? all you want is to pass the video cause the audio should stay in your reciever '' well thats true , but you dont get the audio from the hdmi cable . In other words , all you need to do is plug an HDMI cable directly to your tv and then an audio cable to your reciever ... same results as having what this POS has ! Also , there is no TV HDMI input . Only DVD and Video 2 . AND you can only use a coax for sound on DVD and ONLY a fiber for Video 2 hdmi inputs . AND you can only connect the DVD with composite or HDMI . . not component . In other words , you are very limited to how to connect your gear . But for my mom , it works out ok , cause shes so cheap and it was only $ 127 . And its better than the alternative
 I hoped that this reciever would be decent quality piece of equipment for the price -LRB- not asking for perfection , or even close for that matter -RRB- , but was truly dissappointed after the purchase . This unit 's max volume was very low compared to the competition , and at about half volume I could already hear distortion on my fairly expensive Polk Audio speakers . I threw this thing on Ebay within 15 minutes of opening the box . Not bad for the price if sound quality is n't even a little important ...
 Like others , I had the issue with these breaking at the ear piece swivel . This is from normal -LRB- light -RRB- usage . Having only used them on a few plane trips over the course of 6 months . These headphones are discontinued . So all Logitech could do is offer me a refund.I also was beginning to have an issue with the sound going in and out on the right side prior to the breakage described above . Too bad about the poor construction.The sounds was good , and nice features while they worked -LRB- which was not long -RRB- . The noise canceling worked well to reduce airplane noise and passenger chatter . The ability to work as normal headphones once the battery is dead , which is a nice bonus . The case is nice as well , which has pockets for the -LRB- enclosed -RRB- 2-prong airplane jack adapter , and even a pocket for an iPod . I really did like these headphones , too bad they did not last .
 I never liked the radio interference with this headset . It even picks up RF from my computer and nearby cell phones , but I continued to use it at my desk to reduce noise while studying . However , in less than a year , the small plastic piece that allows swivel of the ear piece broke when I was trying to adjust for comfort.I am an engineer by profession , so I looked at the joint and realized it was not sturdy enough - a very poor design . I never even traveled with these head phones . Logitech is difficult to contact for support and since I can not find my receipt , I am out simply of luck.I also noticed this product seems to have disappeared from Logitech web site . Probably because they had so many customer complaints about these problems.This will probably keep me from considering any Logitech products again . I am shopping for different brand of noise cancelling headphones now .
 My headphone broke at 3 different locations during a span of 11 months . This headphone is of very poor construction . The plastics used is low grade and breaks easily even with gentle use . Either the design is bad , not they used the wrong type of plastic.Logitech used to be a name-brand with good reputation . Not any more . Based on the numerous reviews regarding broken plastic pieces , I think this item should be recalled .
 One of the ear pieces broke of the band in less than two months . Very unhappy since these were n't cheap !
 These headphones sounded great but are poorly constructed . The right ear piece broke after using them two times . I called Logitech and they informed me that it has been discontinued and I would need to send them back for a refund . Sad that it is not listed as being a discontinued item with no warranty support . Beware
 Not only is the performance marginal at best , the durability is equivelent to the $ 10 headphones . 2 year warranty is until you open box , so try some other headphones .
 I think someone else mentioned this -- the connection between the headpiece and the right ear piece broke off when I tried to adjust the headpiece . This means that the right headphone piece does n't sit up against my ear anymore , which makes them pretty useless.Aside from this problem , the sound quality is pretty bad ... Would n't recommend these .
 Well , I guess it is true that you get what you pay for . When the earpiece on my Bose QC2 broke , I thought I would take a chance on these as a low cost alternative , especially after seeing the positive reviews . As soon as I tried these I knew I made a big mistake . Sound quality was poor , and when the noise cancelling feature was put on , instead of getting quieter , the feature actually created more noise than when it was off . I can only surmise that the people who gave this a positive review have not used a high quality noise cancelling headphone . I would also point out that the lead warning sticker - which is required by California law , does not appear on any other headphone I have seen - it is certainly on the the Bose . Personally , I would not like the idea of lead so close to may brain -LRB- at least what is left of it . -RRB- Needless to say , I returned these the next day . On a positive note , I discovered that by calling Bose Factory Service , they were able to repair my QC2 headphones for a nominal fee .
 I ordered these headphone on the recommendation of a coworker , and they do work great - at least up until the left side stopped working altogether . I imagine it is a loose connection inside , but I 'm not sure I 'm up to the warranty process , and not sure who I should start with . It would be nice to buy something and have it work for at least a few weeks .
 For that much under the list price I thought , how could I go wrong?Fuzzy noise on high notes . If you enjoy listening to loud music , these are not the headphones for you . When it `` peaks '' on crashing cymbals for example , it buzzes like a broken pair of speakers . The bass notes are very good and the noise canceling is decent . I thought I could use these for monitoring sound with my videocamera , but the slight buzz -LRB- sounds like a slight wind -RRB- when you turn on the noise canceling feature is counterproductive.My brother has Bose headphones and they handle a wider range of frequencies much , much better . If you 're going to spend the money , get Bose . Otherwise , just wait for a cheaper alternative .
 They are fine headphones , except that the swivel piece connecting the earphone to the headset is cheap plastic and breaks easily . I had to put mine back together with a metal bar and tape , so I look like a dork with them on and they do not fit into that cool carrying case anymore . I did not mistreat these things - just tried to extend the earpiece to fit my head and * snap * . I checked other sites and many reviewers have had the same trouble - one cheap piece of plastic ruining an otherwise fine product .
 This is my second -LRB- and last -RRB- pair of Logictech Headphones . After reading a Wall Street Journal review , I bought my first pair . I liked and used them for about 6 months . Unfortunately when storing them in its case , I somehow twisted and `` broke '' the right headphone . The right headphone just dangled like a broken arm in air . Figuring it was my fault , I brought a second pair . Deja vu . On a flight at takeoff -LRB- I was requested to turnoff and remove this `` electronic device '' -RRB- they fell off my lap onto a carpeted floor and again the right headphone disconnected and just like the first , dangled limp . Rather ticked me off . The poorly designed minimal plastic swivel connections are totally inadequate and unable to be reconnected.I like the Logitech Headphones when they work , but please do n't buy them unless you will be extremely extremely gentle with them , as they are poorly designed .
 got these headphones as a gift about a year ago and just started to use them more frequently . sound quality was better than I thought for what I expected from logitech although I feel the noise-canceling feature was weighted in one ear -LRB- the one with the battery -RRB- and that produces a hiss which is kind of annoying . Then they started to just fall apart . first a little black square panel . then another piece cracked off . actually have tape on them . Within the next year I 'm thinking they 'll just turn to dust . There are better headphones out there , but if you are dead set on these they do n't sound bad .
 My office purchased 12 of these . In less than a year all but two sets are broken . One pair broke the first time taken out of the box . they broke at the ear piece junction with the head band ... same place others have stated .
 Everything about this product was great , until the swivel mount broke after one day 's use , despite treating them very carefully . When I called Logitech to arrange a refund , the customer care rep told me there had been several similar problems in the last few days . Logitech could not have been more helpful , and are giving me a full refund . Delivery from TigerDirect also good .
 I bought these headphones for $ 60 , i thought the deal wasnt that good but i wanted good quality headphones , they sound good not great though , and the worst thing is that they broke within a week or so , cheap plastic , so i would go with another brand like sony or pioneer
 It worked great for about a year , then it broke just above the ear piece . The mechanic design has flaw . It breaks easily .
 I received these as a gift back in November 2007 ; he got them through TigerDirect . I used them daily at work , an office setting , until , like others , the left swivel attachment broke . As a temporary fix I taped them until it just got on my nerves . The packing slip said that the 1 year replacement was for AFTER the manufacturer 's warranty was up ; doing my research on Logitech I saw that that period was for 2 years . So I was golden , right ? WRONG . I called Logitech and simply because I removed a STUPID little round sticker with a P and three numbers on it from the actual headphones , it voids the warranty . NOWHERE could I find anything telling me NOT to remove this stupid little sticker . And besides , how long would something like that really be expected to last , anyhow ?! I 'm really fed up with Logitech . Do n't give them your money . -LRB- Indeed , TigerDirect can not replace them until November 2009 ; called them to be sure -RRB-
 I have been on a buying binge to find the right noise-canceling headphones . Sennheiser 's PXC-250 sounded okay but the noise canceling was totally ineffective . Audiotechnica ANC7 's audio quality and noise canceling were great but they leakage was such that you would share whatever you were listening to with whoever was within 25 yards of you . I returned both and tried the Logitechs after doing much research . The phones are comfortable and the passive noise cancellation works well , but the active noise canceling is nothing to write home about . The audio quality is mediocre at best . All in all , they are n't terrible , but they are way overpriced for what you are getting . At any rate I ended up with the Panasonic RP-HC500s and so far I 'm very happy with them .
 it sounded and functioned great until it broke at the same weak spot others have mentioned ... . the right ear piece swivel point ... . I only used it about 8 times before it broke ...
 Bought this pair of headphones before the Christmas holidays to use for my trans-pacific flights . I jumped on it because tigerdirect has such a good deal on a supposedly quality pair headphones from most of the reviews that I read . I have to say that I am disappointed . The sound quality is decent , but that is about it . One plastic piece covering the wire fell off the 2nd day of my usage . Then , the battery seems to run out fairly fast -LRB- I had to change my Energizer battery once every 3-4 hours ! -RRB- . I was thinking maybe I got a defective model or something . I already returned this model and will probably spend more to look for a better brand-name headphone .
 Does a reasonable job of cancelling background mid & low frequency noise.But sound quality is very poor.I have some $ 25 old noise cancelling headphones which have much better sound quality .
 I ordered the Logitech Noise-Canceling headphones as a Christmas gift for my adult son . When he received them , they were broken -LRB- the mounting on one of the earpieces was broken in two -RRB- . He contacted TigerDirect -LRB- the company that shipped the headphones -RRB- and they refused to exchange them . They would only accept a return . He returned the item and confirmed they had received the item by 1/14 . It took until 1/28 to receive a credit to my account . The headphones might be fine if they work , but this company 's customer service is terrible .
 Careful with all the good reviews because I made the choice based upon them . The headphone has a serious flow on noise canceling part . I remember one professional review about this humming sound when you turn it on but did not expect this at all . It burns your ear out simply because it 's so damm loud right out of the box . It works turn it off but do n't expect high sound quality . My earbud came with HP laptop sounds much better . One star for sturdy case though ! Other than that I do n't want to waste my time on it . I have to return the same day I got this .
 Its not a GREAT speaker soundwize , its just ... fine . But if you are in an airplane or in a noisy environemnt , is gr8 . In other words , if ur in a noisy place where listening to music is impossible , this headset is pretty great , but if you are in your room and feel like listening to music , you wont like the sound : -RRB- All in all , its a good headset , battery lasts for weeks . Am talking about like 8 weeks , not 1 or 2 . Cheers : -RRB-
 Cable connection flaw meant you could only hear anything you connected to the headphones through one ear pad and even then the volume did n't go above a whisper . When you pushed the cable end a bit harder into the receptacle on the headphones you heard full sound but the cable connection slipped out and could n't be made to stay in . Wearing them as noise suppressors worked well on a 1 hour 20 minute plane ride , but there was too much pressure against my ears for it to feel comfortable . I had to return the item .
 So , I was attracted to these earphones because of the price . They seemed like a great deal but the poor quality construction was evident right off the bat . The first pair that I ordered were broken during delivery -LRB- right near the top of the `` U '' - shaped arm holding the phones in place -RRB- so I had to get another pair . They worked great for about 2 moths but after even gentle handling , they finally broke and are now not usable.I 'd recommend them only if you get a * really * great deal , but even then , expect to replace them soon .
 I do n't normally write reviews online but I felt I had to in this case . This was a cheaply designed pair of headphones . I bought them about 4 months ago and both sides have since snapped . It was not due to negligence on my part but simply trying to adjust them on both occasions . I would recommend spending more money for quality headphones from another company or even spending less somewhere else because you 'll likely end up with a better product.The sound quality was n't poor but it was n't excellent either . I would not consider these `` noise-canceling '' either . Noise buffering , maybe . They should be advertised as happiness-canceling headphones .
 I had these for 6 months and they worked well BUT , the right speaker broke off . Since it was Logitech , I figured they 'd stand behind their product but , after several emails it was sorta resolved . This is the feed back I got from Logitech 's help desk ... `` I have been informed by the Warranty/Replacement Department that the Noise Cancelling Headphones are refund only . `` So BE CAREFUL if they break on you , you 'll be paying shipping costs again .
 I used this headphone for only one trip . It broke at the earpiece where you rotate.It does not sit on my ear now and therefore it is useless.I did not read the reviews of moany oithers who experienced the same problem . After spending 75 $ I feel cheated and would not recommend it to anyone .
 These worked great for about a year , then the frame broke just above the ear piece . That side just flops over now , not sitting snug against my ear and all sorts of sound gets in . They can no longer function as noise canceling headphones . They were n't abused , or dropped , just not much structure or strength in the design in that area .
 I purchased these headphones in January 2007 and I will soon be on my fourth pair in six months . The first pair received so much radio interference that I frequently heard FM stations come through . The second pair developed problems likely related to the detachable headphone cord , but Logitech would n't replace just the cord . The third pair arrived with the right earcup broken . The fourth pair will likely take three weeks to arrive due to a backorder . Warranty replacements require a great deal of phone or e-mail time , a pick-up arranged through DHL , and then at least a week 's time without these headphones . For a product that commands a premium price , I expect good service . Logitech has not met my expectations.When these headphones work , they produce good but slightly muddy sound with the noise cancelling feature enabled . When this feature is disabled , they let a surprising amount of sound through . I 've found that the noise canceling works very well on buses and airplanes , and it even drowns out a nearby air conditioning vent very well at work . However , I would not recommend these headphones because of their low build quality and tedious support procedure .
 I found these headphones produce reasonable quality sound and would recommend them except that the folding joint broke on my second flight and trying to get through to Logitech for repairs would make it seem that they are located out of reach of all communication systems .
 The swivel just above the left ear cup broke , leaving it dangling by the wires . Super glue should correct this , I can do without the swivel action .
 These things are very shoddy . The hinge at the headphone is a weak plastic tube that apparently snapped during the packaging at Logitech.Others have complained that the earpiece was breakable . Ours was broken when the box was opened . This is planned obsolescense in action ! In this case it failed before we got it . Do n't buy these !
 I received this product as a gift and was very impressed at first . I listen to music at work , and being able to have the noise from other offices cancelled out was great . However , after a few weeks , the wire connecting the headsets to the Mp3 stopped working . I contacted Logitech , and initiated a warranty replacement . After a few weeks , which was too long in my opinion , I received my new pair , which appeared to be brand new . Again , things were fine at first , but after a while , I started hearing some crackling in the right ear . It was n't that bad at first , but now , the headsets are not usable . I am very disapointed with the quality of this product . I was impressed at first , but now , I am looking at a different brand . I would recommend that you do the same .
 I do speakerphone testing and have noise files on my PC . So I play the noise file and conclude that these are pretty much worthless . They reduce maybe 3 dB of noise at best . And it seems to be lower frequency noise . I found these to be an absolute waste of money . I would do 0 stars if they would let me .
 We tried to go through all the set up menus , but no luck . It would play US DVD 's but not European DVD 's . The sellers were very cooperative in the return and credit . We purchased the Phillips and it worked right away .
 This Adapter was bought for my daughter 's computer , because the first one broke . This one lasted about a month and malfunctioned , causing damage to my daughters computer . After repairs and replacement of adapter we wish we had researched this product better . It was a costly lesson .
 I bought this television from Amazon . Twice . Both times Amazon sent the wrong t.v. . The reason is because this television does not exist . If you do n't believe me , look on samsung 's website . The LNS1951D and LNS1952D are not produced . The `` D '' at the end of the product ID stands for `` Integrated ATSC Tuner . '' If you buy this t.v. , you will not receive the `` D '' version . You will receive the `` W '' version . The `` W '' stands for `` without Integrated ATSC Tuner . '' The ATSC Tuner is not included on Samsung Televisions until they are 26 '' or larger . I had to send both televisions back and eventually settled for a Sharp with ATSC Tuner . Clearly Amazon refuses to acknowledge this problem and continues to falsely advertise this item . Oh , and Amazon was n't exactly apologetic either . After wasting a month of my time and hours on the telephone with customer service , they merely offered to refund my money . Thanks Amazon .
 This was not a simple plug-n-play . . Windows 7 played havoc with thedrivers , after finally locating updated drivers was able to get ti going.There is no noticeable noise reduction between these high priced adaptersand a low end model . Was definitly not worth the purchase
 I purchased this battery based on the positive reviews . However , the first battery I received was defective and was exchanged by the provider . Still optimistic , I received the replacement unit . Unfortunately , the battery fails to perform to the same levels as the original battery provided by Apple.The battery does not hold a sufficient charge to ensure the computer goes to sleep when nearing depletion nor does it provide notification to the system to alert the user when the battery is almost dead . Therefore , if you are n't extremely careful you will lose all unsaved work when the battery is depleted.Further , the battery is depleted much quicker than the Apple battery in both normal operating conditions and when the computer is in sleep mode . Although the battery registers the same charge , its performance is certainly lower performing.But , the battery does work and is a cheap solution if you ca n't afford the OEM part . If I could purchase again , I would spend the extra cash . I 've lost too much work because of a battery that does n't notify me when it is running low .
 It worked OK for about two weeks , then stopped taking any charge . Piece of garbage . Stay away ! On the other hand , whaddya expect for the price ?
 Battery pack did n't last very long before completely degrading . It does makes an amazing coaster though , so it now sits on my end table with a nice chilled glass of ice tea on it .
 I have a charge cycle of around 12 times . Capacity drop by over 25 % . Not a quality product . Not recommended .
 It has been plugged in for most of the time I 've used it . It has just a few dozen cycles on it , if that . It has not been left uncharged for a long time , nor has it been overcharged by some super high voltage fast charger.Now it just barely holds any charge . All it does is keeps me from losing data if I lose power or the power adapter is unplugged . Nearly useless .
 The battery looked a bit used and scratched ; worst of all it just plain did not work . I tried to charge it but it remain in 0 % no matter what I did .
 I bought this battery just one year ago and it has had minimal use . It is now unable to hold a charge . I wish I had the `` official '' apple replacement productWasabi Power Laptop Battery / Notebook Battery for the Apple PowerBook G4 15 '' M8859T/A , PowerBook G4 15 '' M8859Y/A , and PowerBook G4 15 '' Titanium Series
 Purchased battery for wife 's older G4 . Performance was very poor , battery will not run computer without power cord for more than 20 or 30 minutes . Just about where it was with the old battery that I was replacing . Net we are out 24 bucks and wife must still use her G4 tethered to electrical grid . Some days you are a bug and other days you are a windshield .
 The company sent me the wrong part . Because they are not part of Amazon , I had to return the item and reorder it elsewhere .
 This battery has been great for my limited ` off charger ' use but has finally died after just 7 months use.I 'll give it 2 starts as although it is poor quality I 'll still probably by another one as $ 27 is cheap to resurrect my 8 year old Powerbook .
 The battery does not live up to any expectations , the lights do not come on when you press on the battery tester and the charge is not as long as expected . Would never buy from this company again unless they change their products .
 For the first few months after I got the battery , it worked wonderfully . I could use my laptop without having it plugged in for a couple hours at a time , but as time went on that period of time got shorter . A couple months ago my laptop would suddenly just die , and then I 'd have to plug in the charger and have it charge all over again . In the last couple weeks , if it gets unplugged it 'll only give me a minute or two before it dies completely.I would not recommend this battery to anyone .
 This battery is rated as a 5200mAh one but on arrival it was only a 4104mAh , which is 78 % of the supposed rating and even less than the original Apple battery specification . There is no excuse for shipping a product with a bad specification like this , whatever the reason . It likely means this may have been old stock and had deteriorated with age buy that is not acceptable for a supposed new replacement product even if it was not going to last long term .
 I felt very disappointed that the battery 's life did n't last more than 4 months . They are less expensive that if you buy them in apple ; however you get what you pay for . The last battery that I bought directly in apple was more than 120.00 but it worked for more than two years .
 It worked nicely for a few months and now it literally holds power for less than 10 minutes . This happened with under 60 or 70 cycles . I wished I had just spent the extra money and got a real Apple battery .
 This battery lasted just over a year and now holds zero charge . When you unplug the charger it will instantly shutoff the computer . Very disappointed .
 First battery I was sent did n't work . I charged in -LRB- in the computer -RRB- for 24 hrs , and it was stone cold dead . They promptly sent me another , and it fried my computer . Tech says the computer is unfixable . AAARGH .
 These buyers before me must have owned some pretty crappy cases ... because this case is awful . The case is light and feels cheap , the panels scratch easily.The power supply shelves had to be bent inward to fit the power supply properly.The 120mm back panel fan has plastic arms that you must pull through to the outside wall , in order to secure the fan in place . but each of the cheap rubber arms break as u attempt to pull them through.Also , the harddrives can not be screwed in , they instead sit upon small rubber mounts to keep them from moving forward ... but if the case is turned on its side ... the harddrives will bump side to side and move around.the cd/dvd drives can not be screwed in securely either . When you try to screw the drives in you must use the provided holes which are not level , and you cd/dvd drives look terrible through the front.the side panel opposite of the window is a real pain to remove as well.This should be more than enough warning to any of you considering the purchase of this case ... which should be worth closer to 60 dollars rather than 120 .

 I bought the Astro 220 and two dc30 collars for upland bird hunting - pretty expensive for a retired guy . I am tech savvy and in fact used to teach GPS and GIS at a state university.Garmin needs to go back to the drawing board . The units are a great idea , if they work , which mine do n't . I have sent the handheld and collars back to Garmin twice and have spent hours on the phone and on email with tech support trying to get it to work properly.First , I was constantly getting a `` lost communication '' error message even when my dog was in plain sight . I was told to reprogram the unit , not a simple task . I did that and it still did n't work right . I sent the transmitter back , got it , did n't work , reprogrammed it , worked for a couple days , then was not recognizing the collars . So I reprogrammed the collars to the handheld . worked except I could n't get the status symbols to work , so I called Garmin and after a 1 hour wait , talked to tech support . He gave me a complicated correction , and it worked for a couple days . Then , it stopped recognizing the collars , so I got another RA and sent it back . I received a new ?? handheld , which worked for a few days and AGAIN , I had problems with the handheld recognizing the collars.Right now I am damn tired of fooling with it . It is not working and I guess I will just go back to beeper collars if Garmin gives me a refund.Some people seem not to have these problems - I 'd like to know if I am the only one experiencing serious problems with the collar recognition , the status symbols , incorrect direction and distance , and `` lost communication '' error messages .
 First my compliments to both Amazon and Garmin , for great customer service and warrenty.The Astro GPS Dog Tracking system worked great in EZ going terrain , however in much of California , we have low hanging trees , thick brush and fence lines . First time I used it , my dogs bayed up a nice boar `` 151 yards to the north east '' . The next time I used it , in about two hours of hunting in brushy terrain , my three dogs broke three antenas and destroyed two harnesses.The sending unit with antena , is held by the harness directly above and on top of the dogs shoulders , getting hit -LRB- and destroyed -RRB- when going through or under these obstacles . The optional way of mounting the sending unit -LRB- to the dog 's collar -RRB- does not work very well either.Garmin was great and willingly sent free replacement parts yet I sent the entire unit back and received a credit . Discussed with Garmin Tecs and they said they are working on another design . They should also come up with a better battery pac system . I anxiously awaiting new design and will reorder if and when available.The current harness/antena system probably works fine for grassland bird hunting yet not for tough cover where dogs are going all out to catch a pig.Hurry up Garmin and get it fixed ! Perhaps if they do n't come up with another design a competitor will come up with a dog GPS system that will stand up to the test .
 I ordered 3 of these DVD players -LRB- all from different sellers -RRB- thinking it was the `` perfect '' gift for my two neices and nephew for Christmas . When they showed up I realized they could only be plugged into a TV ; there was no viewing screen to watch personal movies . I felt it was a little decieving how they were advertised as `` Portable DVD players '' but made no mention of the fact that they did n't come with a viewing screen . Unfortunately , I did n't realize this until it was too late to send them back and find something else for my neices and nephew at Christmas . Very frustrating .
 Received a box of electronic parts but NOT ONE SHRED OF INSTRUCTIONS or any piece of paper . If I can figure out how to install this in my helmet maybe I can get it to work . If so I 'll post a followup on its quality but for now its a zero start item .
 It did not work with my HP laptop - the cord kept slipping out - not a good seal .
 Product was the wrong adapter - could not get reimbursement - or rather get a return code to this date - very difficult to deal with the company - still no results in refunding .
 This is the second different Creative Zen MP3 player that I have purchased within this past year . The first one was for my grandson who is 20 and I paid over $ 200 for it . It played for about 5 months . Fortunately I had purchased an extended warrenty for it . The second was the Zen V 4 GB and that was for my 14 year old granddaughter . That one played less than 2 months and cost about $ 140 . I would think that , since they cost quite a bit , they would be made to withstand the wear and tear that young adults give them . Manufacturers certainly must know that they will be used practically 24/7 .
 My daughter bought the 2 GB and about a month later the screen went black but would still play . It quit altogether eventually . Not sure what happened.This one I ordered for my other daughter and she is also having problems . It is stuck on one song , frozen and wont play . Trying to contact company ... we 'll see how that goes .
 This is very nice little gadget here -LRB- maybe even too small for me -RRB- . It sounds fantastic , the earphones are pretty good , so is the radio . Video player though is useless . It is promised to have 15 hour battery life ?! Might be so , but with embedded Lithium ion battery it is 40 % less a year from now . Since the battery is not replaceable , lifespan of the player is only few years . Before you buy , consider that after the battery is worn-out , so is the the player .
 Only had this for a week and just like the other customers stated about it freezing up , that 's what it did for me and it 's just what it does best . It freezes . Someone said that it can always be reset . BULL ! I did n't pay what i 'd paid for it to reset it time and time again . Take it from me and other customers , do NOT buy this , you will end up returning it to the store .
 I purchased the 8GB Creative Zen V Plus player during the first week in February . -LSB- ... -RSB- :[ ... -RSB- I loaded up the software on my computer , then hooked up the player through the usb cord . I let it charge for 6 hours like the instructions state . Then I proceeded to load some of my music onto the player . So after the music was loaded , I disconnected the player from the usb cable and started to listen to the music . The sound quality was good , the player is easy to navigate in the menus , etc. . . The problem was about half the music I uploaded was not on the player . I could see the folder and menu option for the artist or genre but the actual file was not there . So I plugged the player back into the usb cord , and pulled up the file location on the player through the computer . The file was there and I could play it just fine through Windows Media Player . I tried to access it again through the player and it was not there . Then I accessed through the computer just fine.All my songs , all 4,500 of them , are in MP3 format from 56kps for my audio books to 192kps for the songs I ripped from cd 's . The player just would n't read about half my songs . There was really no rhyme or reason on whish songs it would recognize . I would load an entire album of 15 songs and I could only play 6 or 7 tracks . This happened with my entire music collection.So I thought maybe the firmware was out of date so I uploaded all the updates from creative which did include a firmware update . It did not solve the problem . I then uploaded some of the same songs that would not play on the Zen V Plus onto my 3 year old Rio and original Ipod Shuffle and they played just fine . I was frustrated at this point so I called the Creative Customer Service . -LSB- ... -RSB- -LSB- ... -RSB- I also do n't plan on buying anything from Creative again.By the way , after all this , the problem never was fixed.Also , when doing research on this product , I came across a couple articles and reviews that stated this player would play DIVX files . This is not true . This player will not play any files without being converted first . I took an AVI video that was 100MB and it converted it into a 1.2 GB file . The format they use is absolutely a waste of space . If you want to upload an entire movie on MPEG or AVI format , it will end up taking the entire 8GB of space if not more . I converted the movie Cars for my son on a short road trip thinking I could have my music plus his movie . I was wrong , the movie took up 7.1 GB after being converted.I would not recommend this product to anyone . As much as I do n't like the IPod , I would recommend it over the Zen V Plus because
 After 94 days -LRB- 4 days past the labor warranty -RRB- the back light went bad on my Creative Zen V 4 GB . I contacted them and of course they told me if they found out it was negligence I would have to pay all -LRB- I got it on Christmas Day it never left the house and I only listened to it at bedtime -RRB- . Then they tell me I 'm responsible for all the shipping and a $ 25.00 diagnostic test -LRB- Now is n't this part of the `` labor '' warranty that 's good for a year ? -RRB- not according to them . So , just to get it to them it would cost me shipping and the $ 25.00 up front for the work '' -LRB- oh , diagnostic test -RRB- '' plus all the parts if they can fix it . If you 're not going to buy an Ipod at least save yourself the money and get a San Disk , plus they last longer .
 I wanted to like this player , but we could n't get one that worked . After researching the features , I recommended this player to my wife who wanted a small flash memory player to use outside . I 've had good luck with my Zen Sleek Photo , so the the Zen V looked like a good bet.The first Zen V we ordered had a defective navigation joystick . It would n't scroll up or down , even after upgrading the firmware and resetting the player . Creative tech support said we should return it , so we exchanged it for a second one . The second one had the same problem , so we gave up on the Zen V and will pick out another player as soon as we decide on one.I 'm hoping we just had unusually bad luck to get two defective players in a row , but it 's left me wondering about Creative 's quality control . On the plus side , Amazon made the return/refund process pretty much painless .
 Pros
 Two years ago I bought a Zen Nano Plus for my son . He wanted something that would hold more music so I bought him a Zen V 1 gb . Within two weeks it froze up on him and he could n't use it . I was able to bring it back to where I had bought it . Then I upgraded even more and bought a Zen V. 4 gb . After less than two months that froze up on my son and he has n't been able to get it to work since . Meanwhile , he gave me his old Zen Nano Plus , which is still plugging along.I do n't think I will buy a Zen again , until they fix this problem .
 I puchased one of these for my son , and just a few days past the warranty expiration , the device starts freezing up . He e-mailed with someone at Zen -LRB- there is no phone number available for these people , btw -RRB- and the player has been declared broken.I am very disappointed in this product .
 I received this MP3 player less than 24 hours ago , and within the first hour of operation the unit froze up while I was fast forwarding through some text . The unit remained locked up until the battery got low enough for the unit to turn off automatically . I am returning it for a refund .
 Save your money and buy an IPOD . This product does n't even come close and Itunes is so much better to deal with . I sold mine on ebay .
 Gave it one star because there was no option for zero . Died after two days of use , would not turn on or reset . Previous Zen Nano , same thing after six months of use . I guess that would be my last Creative product .
 For one , I am not a fan of Apple as a company and will always buy anything but an IPod . From quite a bit of research I figured the Creative Zen was one of the better options.This player generally works fine , but has two flaws that REALLY bother me ! One of the most important features of an MP3 player is the ability to put all your music in it and then hit `` random play '' to have it cycle through your music . This does about as bad a job of that as could be possible . It will constantly feed you some of the same songs on a regular basis while seemingly never getting to some of the others . As a software developer , this really bothers me because programming a random search algorithm is generally one of the easier things you can do , and if you need to pair that with keeping a little document to reference of what has already been played so as not to repeat things too soon , that also is not hard for even the most junior programmer to do -LRB- i.e. , Creative has no excuse why this feature is so bad -RRB- . Then the fact that it does such a poor job of this has to make you wonder about just what else doesnt work so well but isnt so obvious . Some of the other negative reviews here indicate other problems that I havent encountered , but would be indicative of some poor programming by Creative . I think the menu system leaves a bit to be desired as well and results in too much navigating and clicking around to do simple things -LRB- i.e. , the software is not as well designed or configurable as it could be -RRB- . I am also pretty sure this unit doesnt allow you to record the radio , but it is so hard to tell because their documentation is thoroughly inadequate and does n't even give a basic walkthru of 90 % of the features.Now to the thing that irriates me the most . I am not one who cares to buy music online ... so 95 % of the MP3s I have come from being ripped from my CD collection . The software program that comes with this , of course is geared to work with this particular player . So , if you rip using it , it will do more work and can save a copy to your player and your computer hard drive at the same time at a very decent speed . It is a much quicker process than using Windows Media Player or Music Match Jukebox to rip the music and then copy it to your player . After spending 2 hours shuffling CDs and ripping directly to the player , I realized it was ripping in WMA format . That sucks , because I want MP3s ... as long as I am taking the time to shuffle CDs and rip , I want to be able to burn the SAME MP3s to CDs so that I can burn them to CD for archiving and play the MP3 CDs in devices that can do that ... MP3s tend to work on all brands , not WMAs . Anyway , I go to the settings area of Creative 's software package and change the setting for it to rip to MP3 ... and low and behold , I can do that ... ONLY IF I buy their MP3 ripping support package at an additional $ 9.99 . WTF ? Yeah ... nice ... it is an MP3 player , but I have to pay more to rip my CDs to MP3 format ! There is no TECHNICAL reason for this ... it simply means Creative is using the opportunity to withhold a feature you will WANT so they can get more money from you . There is no other way to put that . It is pathetic and unnacceptable!Contacting their technical support is absolutely useless because they clearly will not read your problem and respond to it in a personalized manner . Instead , you will get form responses stating their policies or pointing you to `` how to do it with Windows Media Player 10 '' . I am sorry , but if I am paying $ 150 + for the player , I certainly expect the software to do all the standardly expected things . I did not see any disclaimer on the box about having to pay extra for MP3 ripping . I went back and forth complaining to Creative about this particular issue and how I felt it was wrong for them to charge for it . All I got them to admit was it was something that was available in prior versions of their software that is not available any longer without buying the package for MP3 support . After many iterations , it got to the point where their responses didnt even match the situation ... prompting a new term , I will call e-ignoring me . ; -RRB- This is why this player deserves only 2 stars . The unacceptably bad Random feature -LRB- which requires you to skip songs regularly -RRB- is worth a star deduction in itself , but their terrible customer service and price gouging policies are truly unacceptable . There has to be a better option than a Creative Player and I would recommend most people look for it . When buying something like this , you should n't have to get additional software and I have talked to many people who own players from other companies where the software does rip to MP3 without further charge . Ripping through an external program and then loading the player does work here , but it is certainly slower . Windows Media Player makes the process too cumbersome for my taste . Music Match Jukebox does ok , but they purposely make the ripping process slow and then constantly bug you with popups to try to get you to upgrade THEIR software with their own $ 9.99 -LRB- or more -RRB- purchase . I am tired of companies always trying to make a buck at the expense of the customer . With Music Match , I understand , the basic player is free ... with Creative , sorry , we already had to pay for the product , to have to may more to rip MP3s is essentially making us pay $ 10 + more for a product we already purchased.As others have pointed out ... this will not hold the amount of songs they advertise because no one sane uses an 64KB rate ... even 128KB is hardly good enough . I do 160KB and will end up getting between 600 and 700 songs on this unit . But , this `` problem '' is the same on all players , their song claims are just unrealistic to the real world ... just know that going in ... if you want oodles of songs , go for the hard drive models that hold 30GB ... but , 700 songs is ALOT more than it seems and the flash memory players are still better for running and such ... jolting and bouncing has no effect on them in terms of theoretical wear and tear.If not for the fact that returning electronics is a pain and there are usually restocking fees , I would have returned this unit . I bought my son one as well that has not been opened and since that will have the same problems I encountered with mine , we are returning it . I told Creative I wanted them to give me the MP3 support I expected for free or I would return my son 's unit and post this honest -LRB- but unflattering -RRB- feedback here . They would not even acknowledge my request -LRB- which I think was reasonable -RRB- , so here my honest assessment is . You might disagree with my assessments , and that 's fine , but if I read what I am writing here , I would have not bought this player ... and I wish I would have at least known all of this before hand . Then I could have made an educated choice rather than be so disappointed by the things this player and software do poorly .
 I originally bought this Mp3 player because I was looking for a good alternative to the iPOD -LRB- I think the iPOD is overpriced and I try to avoid hype -RRB- . When I bought this I was initially pleased because you get a lot for a good price . First night I sat down for 2 hours and loaded music -LRB- yes , it loads music very slowly -RRB- . I listened to music for about 30 minutes and then turned off player . I turned back on player 1 hour later and when I went into the menu to select a song the unit froze up . I found out how to reset unit but it kept freezing at the same point . Basically I had to erase EVERYTHING and start from scratch . I have high tolerance but after the 10th time of having to do this over a two week period I 've had enough . The software is EXTREMELY flawed and unreliable . There is no system in the software that provides for formating your mP3 and wave files automatically so you basically have to do so within the program you recorded them from . Consistently I would download music and tracks would either not show up on unit or would freeze unit until it was reformatted . I returned the Zen and immediately purchased an iPOD nano . I am very pleased with my nano . For less hassle and stress , go with iPOD . It 's reliable and its quality is unmatched .
 So I got this as a christmas gift one year and was very happy with it . It 's a great mp3 player with a good navigation menu -LRB- much better than a sansa or an iPod -RRB- , good features , and great sound quality . It was all I just perfect for about the first year . Thats when the problems started . One day it froze up , but I reset it , no problem . About two months later it froze again . And again . And again . And again . Lately it wo n't even turn on long enough to hit the play button before it freezes . As one could imagine , it 's completely useless now . I 'm looking into replacing it with either a Sony Walkman or a Creative Zen -LRB- the new one , not a Zen V -RRB- and I hope whatever I decide on will be more reliable . Overall , I would not suggest this to anyone , because even though it seems great , the reliability of the software leaves something to be desired .
 I have owned an RCA LYRA -LRB- 128mb -RRB- phillips player -LRB- 256mb -RRB- and now this . I can honestly say that this on is the worst . I dont usually do reviews but i felt compelled because this player is terrible !!! It freezes up often and when it does you have to wait for the battery to completely die before you can charge it up and turn it on . all the features on it are great but if you ca n't turn it on what does it matter ? Just check the creative web site , you 'll see , i have never seen such an eloborate `` trouble shooting '' page . It seems these players in general have so many problems they have devoted pages and pages on helping you fix your mp3 player . my unit is only 6 months old and is currently out of order . I 'm waiting to hear back from the email customer support -LRB- because the phone support costs $ 15 a call after the first 60 days , I was only able to take advantage of the phone support once :-RRB- . Dont waste you time with this product .
 I received a replacement part since the first one was n't working . This one does n't work either . I 'm 100 % sure the Treo is working fine . I sent several emails but got no response .
 I wanted to use this to play music in my car , but it does n't play out stereo . Good thing it was super cheap .
 I was satisfied with the product but the speed of delivery left alot to be desired .
 This adapter did not work on my Samsung phone . It is not designed for music but rather to convert a regular land line phone head piece to a cell phone head piece .
 I just got my adapter and it blows . If I put it just a little ways in I get stereo . However , everytime I put it in until it snaps in All I get is the right channel . So , Moto Q users beware ! It doesnt work . Also , when you move about the one channel you do get crackles and pops . Dont waste the cash .
 I read reviews here where people complained of crackles during their workouts . But I figured I 'd just be walking to work , not jogging , so i 'd have no problems ... WRONG!Any movement at all will cause this cheap technological nightmare to make crackling , popping , snapping sounds . Even just walking at a normal pace , with your iPod in you interior jacket pocket . Or in you shirt pocket . Or in your coat pocket . Or in your hand.Very UNportable . Boo .
 It came incredibly fast , and the condition was great but , it was really loose inside my phone input . and the main reason i bought it was to talk with my beats by dre . headphones on xbox live , they didnt work . All i could hear is my buddy speaking but he couldnt hear me . ONLY buy this if you plan on listening with a mp3 -LRB- no voice control -RRB- .
 I had high hopes for this product , I got it for my girl friend for xmas . Story is , I love the beats by dre head phones and she does n't understand why so I decided to get her a pair , problem was her phone only had a 2.5 adapter , so I get her this and believe xmas is going to be great and all work out . This adapter ruined my present , it cut out , u stick it all the way in and it would n't work , it would work half assed if u pushed it in the device half way but seriously it still sounded vey bad , I would highly recommend spending a few more dollars and get a reputable brand so u wo n't have the same problems I encountered .
 First of all this is very loose and falls out easily . At least it did from my Samsung phone . When I did shove it all the way in , I could only hear out of the right side from two different sets of headphones . I had ordered one of these from another seller before and it lasted me a year before it broke . It was more expensive than this one , so I got what I paid for .
 Not very practical . Really cheesey connection . Every move of this adapter results in scratchy static noise .

 This product did n't work properly . It states `` Stereo '' but it did not work in stereo on my cell phone -- by the way , I have a Verizon VX8350 . If anyone has that phone and is looking to use this adapter , do n't bother unless you want only one channel to come through .
 After the fact I now see some folks that sell this same product clarify it will not work with a Blackberry -- this amazon listing does not state that . I received it and it is mono -LRB- not stereo -RRB- unless you insert it only half way into blackberry and wiggle it . So be careful and confirm your particular phone 's compatability with a 2.5 / 3.5 adapter ,
 Does not work . Sits in a drawer and is not useable . Only sends sound to one earpiece . Do n't waste your money or time .
 Does not list the models that are compatible
 All seemed to go well until I tried to find a clear FM station . I spent the entire time I used it , a one hour trip , trying to find a clear station . I finally gave up and turned on the radio . I have since returned it for a refund . I live in a somewhat rural area . Maybe it would work better in a city .
 I got this flash for a sweet 16 I was going to do for a friend and it stopped working when I got to the event ! It was past the warranty but when I explained the malfunction the company was great and exchanged it . The new one I got got the battery cover broken and I was n't able to fix it : -LRB-
 I do n't know if I was unlucky and got the one bad drive off the line , but I have to share my experience with you all as a strong warning.My drive has been a nightmare experience
 I was happy with this changer for 14 months . . then it expired . I bought it new . . and played it moderately . I 'm going to replace it with a Denon .
 Madcatz is usually a pretty reliable brand as far as accessories for video game consoles go , but they 've let me down this time . This component cable set appears to be well manufactured , but is a little thin as far as the wire gauge goes and the output to my TV shimmers and wavers constantly . Output is bad for both games and DVDs -- I do n't know how anyone can buy these cables and use them . In fact my Intec S-Video cable looks much better and it 's constucted of higher gauge wiring . I ca n't see spending the ridiculously overpriced $ 50 - $ 80 for `` ultra-premium '' offerings from Monster Cable or like brands , guess some middle ground has to be found from the high rated Sony or likely more reliable Intec brand .
 After two weeks of trying to implement e-mail instructions from Epson , this scanner still refused to work . I returned it to seller and was informed it was phased out by Epson . Good ! Now no one else will suffer the frustrations of trying to get this scanner to operate .
 I bought the 4990 to reproduce photos and slides . To steal a line fron another review , the results are suitable for refrigerator art , but just barely . Photos made from slides are particularly terrible . I would say results from any enlargement are unsatisfactory for any purpose.I do n't blame Epsen . Their products are generally as good as their competitors , often better . I think the problem - at least for me - is that I believed the hype that high end scanners produce professional or near-professional results . This claim leads to unrealistic expectations for people who know what professional work looks like . The results are barely good enough to send copies of pictures to close family members . You certainly could not use one of these scanners in a professional endeavor , or even for serious hobby work.It makes great copies of text , but so do scanners that cost $ 100 . My advise is to buy a scanner for $ 100 to $ 200 for text scanning and hire a lab to do your photo and slide work .
 Sorry to have to write this , but I have never ever wasted as much time on any product as I have on my Epson scanner . You install it , it works for a while , and then magically disappears so no apps will recognize it . This has happened on multiple systems , so there is a flaw at their end , not just one configuration file on one PC . Even EpsonScan does not recognize it . This is with the most current drivers off the web and following the install instructions to the letter .
 My six months old 4990 has a noticeable film deposits under the glass . The glass was clear when I bought it . Apparently other owners of the 4990 have had identicle problems -LRB- discussions at howtofixcomputers.com -RRB- . Epson will clean it for free if the 4990 is still under warranty , but this is not a one time problem , but a continuous one -LRB- you have to pay Epson to clean the glass after warranty expires -RRB- . The film is visible when the 4990 is powered up and the interior light is on . With the lid out of the way , look at the glass at 10 to 30 degrees angle . I hope your glass is clear .
 I bought this scanner for scanning x-rays & slide films . It does a very poor job of doing both . The software is very primative with few options . I see no difference between the quality & performance of this scanner as compared with one that you would pay $ 99 for .
 This scanner did several transparencies very well . When we tried a regular scan , the belt made a harsh grinding noise . The office directly across from mine even commented on hearing it . The weird thing is that with this terrible noise is that the scan was great . If you can handle a loud , grind ... great pick-up .
 I have n't tested my scanner yet so I 'm keeping my fingers crossed but my review is on the way my machine was recieved . The scanner was in it 's original epson box -LRB- no outer protective box -RRB- with no seal or taping making the box easy to access at anytime in the shipping process . There was a 5 inch piece of tape over the box flap that appeared to be from UPS as it said to `` Stop and inspect before opening '' . Unfortunately my landlord signed and I was unable to send back directly . So when opening the box the lid and base were wrapped seperately but not sealed . The only thing actually sealed like you would think when coming from the company was the manual that had tape to seal closed . I have always ordered my computer equipment online and had it shipped . Everything always comes taped up shut and pretty inclusive . I feel like I could easily wrap up everything the way I found it -LRB- since there was no tape involved -RRB- and send it back today . Maybe this is normal for epson ? I will contact Amazon to see if they would like the machine back or have me test it . It was a pretty expensive piece of equipment not to have it appropriately packaged . If the box itself had been sealed I would feel better about it not being tampered with or missing something .
 I looked up this product on google -LRB- epson 4990 scanner -RRB- and the ad from amazon said espon 4990 PRO for 398.99 with free shipping . I click it on and get directed to buy a non-PRO version of the 4990 with no free shipping . bummer , bought it somewhere else .
 I tried mounting some 8 lb speakers with these , and had absolutely no luck . I can see these working for super-small speakers , but not for anything like bookshelf speakers . For one , to claim that a mount can support 10lbs , with no mention of the distance to the mass center is just idiotic . The ball-and-socket joint is meant to resist the moment created by the weight of the speaker , multiplied by the distance from the ball to the center of the speaker/mount assembly 's center of gravity . If you have deep speakers , even those weighing much less than 10 lbs , especially since the heaviest parts -LRB- the drivers -RRB- are farthest away from the mount , then the ball wo n't hold.I tightened the allen bolt and tightened it to get it to hold , with no luck , and then the bolt sheared . What they should indicate is the moment capacity of the mount , as shear is simply not going to be an issue . Thus , OmniMount should say that this mount has a 30 inch-lb rating -LRB- which would be 5 lbs at 6 inches -RRB- . But put 8 lbs at 4 inches , and it will fail.It is useless to say that this kind of mount has a 10 lb rating . The truth is , it would probably hold 30 lbs at one inch , and 1 lb at 30 inches.If you have one of those POS Bose cube systems , go for it , you 'll be fine . But if you have anything approaching real speakers , forget it .
 These will not hold anywere near the rated 10 pounds without ` drooping ' . I questioned the design when I first saw them advertised , but saw several good reviews so went ahead and bought them . DO N'T Be fooled ! They may work great for some little PC type speakers that weigh a couple pounds , but when tasked with holding an 8 pound speaker , they just drooped , no matter how tight the ball fitting . Do n't waste your money on this unless you have really light speakers . I am very disappointed because I 've had good luck with some of Omnimount 's other products . Also the included hardware was junk ! Had to go to the hardware store to get decent mounting hardware .
 These mounts are a good idea for small speakers , but do not attempt to hang a speaker approaching the rated weight . My 8 lb speakers will NOT stay in place no matter how much you tighten the set screw . The ball will just not hold . I will need to buy something else for my purposes .
 I purchased these headphones to listen to my iPod nano while at my desk at work . They are open-backed which allows me to hear the phone ring or other people talking when played at moderate volume levels . The fit well and are easy to put on or take off but do n't dislodge when I bend over or stoop . I hoped they might have the same speaker elements in them that Koss puts in their KTXPRO1s -LRB- a very fine , inexpensive over-the-head model -RRB- but sadly , that 's not the case . These have only barely adequate bass and high frequencies that can get a bit harsh . iPod 's pre-set EQs can make them listenable.Pros
 Do n't buy these things . Mine broke less then a month . If your a heavy user of head phones do n't even contemplate buying these . Its made out of some brittle plastic stuff that crumbles with just the little pound of pressure . The only good thing about these phones is that they can fold up and be stashed in your bag and ready to go but you still have to make sure they do n't get crushed by anything.What made it even worse is that I have a casing on my Zune and the plug wo n't fit all the way in , so if you just yank on the wire just a tiny bit the sound stops flowing and usually my Zune comes with a pause sequence just in case the phones get disconnected but with this headset it does n't work like that , so it would take me hours to find out the my player was still on play and that my battery was almost dead.Also the sound quality is n't that great I recieved better sound and bass out of myPhilips SHS391 Behind-The-Head Headphone -LRB- White -RRB- 's then these things . Keep looking and Good luck !!!!
 This product fits my Samsung mp3 player like a glove . And it provides easy access to the headphone and usb cable jacks . Also none of the buttons or the lock switch are affected in any negative way . That being said , I bought this item hoping it would provide some protection for my player and it truly disappoints in that category . It 's too thin to help out at all if I were to drop my mp3 player . And it does n't even have a cover for the screen or navigation buttons . Well , I suppose it does , the screen protector is sold separately . Whose idea was that ? So unless you buy this sports jacket and the screen protector , you wo n't even be able to carry your player around in your pocket without scratching it .
 I 've been through two of these drives -LRB- IOGear Ion Combo 250GB -RRB- in the past 10 days . The first arrived DOA . no big deal , it happens . I ordered the second one from amazon.com , just to start completely fresh , and it stopped working after 5 MINUTES !!! a call to tech support got me even more mad . their solution was to swap drives with me . sounds fair . until i found out it was going to take AT LEAST 10 DAYS FOR THEM TO SHIP IT OUT while they `` work on some drives there ! '' so i 'm supposed to wait around for them to fix up a refurbished drive and ship it to me in replacement of a drive i paid full price for?i do n't think so.DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM IOGEAR . 3 year warranty or not , you will be sorry!there 's only a star on the rating scale because you have to pick at least one .
 Stay away from this . First week I blew the sub and they wanted $ 200 for a replacement sub that is not worth it . Much better subs for allot less money .
 I purchased Athena Technologies subwoofer from a e-retailer , and Athena Technologies customer service refused to service the defective subwoofer . I am stuck with a $ 250 dollar subwoofer that does n't even power up .
 I know cabling spans the universe of cheap to cheapest ... but this one was BAD.This listing is unbranded , and therefore , you may have better luck than I , but the seller that I got this cable from was sunwill -LRB- dot -RRB- com , as they were using Amazon as their distributor , and it qualified for my Amazon Prime shipping . I would at least avoid THAT cable ... you can roll the dice with another seller -LRB- and hopefully a different cable -RRB- if you like.There was an irritating and constant hum over this cable . Not something passive ... but HUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM nearly as loud as the audio at a soft to normal listening volume . Just to be sure I did n't have any issues with my hardware , I used two different cables that I had before but opted not to use for this project -LRB- one was too long and one was too short -RRB- and the hum was not present . Clearly bad QC on this item.Needless to say , it is being returned -LRB- something I do not often do with my purchases here -RRB- ... and I am stuck waiting for the UPS man to come and take this away !
 Cable was cheaply made . I gave it a try anyway . I used it as a cable for auxillary input of my stereo , never played with it once installed . a few months later , it is dead ! Buy from a different place !
 I did not receive this item as of 2-13-10 . The local post office said that they could not prove that the package was delivered , and said that they did not care , there was nothing they could do for me . I emailed the Jay at Citi electronics and he said that they would reship the order but as of yet I have not received it .
 I purhased this in November as a Christmas gift . We just discovered today -LRB- 12/29 -RRB- that the product is defective right out of the box . -LRB- Total distortion in the left channel -RRB- Having just read through Computer Brain 's return policies , I am not sure what resolution I will have on this.Will update this entry when that is known .
 I just got this speaker wire alonge with Pyramid 's so called 8 gauge power wire and was disappointed in both . This is not 12 gauge wire -LRB- closer to 16 gauge -RRB- and there 8 gauge power wire is actualy 12 gauge according to standard wire strippers . I do not recommend this wire , it is way thinner than advertised .
 The product supplied was not what it claims to be - 12AWG cable . It is realistically a 16 gauge wire -LRB- at best -RRB- . The spool and wire supplied was not the same as the product displayed on Amazon either -LRB- only similarity was the product discription on the label -RRB- . Given I live in New Zealand , it was unrealistic to return the product due to shipping costs ... have subsequently purchased some Monster Cable on Amazon -LRB- 5 stars there -RRB- . If you want a quality 12 gauge cable , do not purchase this product ! If you have very low product expectations , this product may suit your needs .
 DO NOT BUY THESEthey do not stay onthey are flimsy , and the headband part is as soft as a piece of yarn - no stability at all.the cord is too shortthe sound is mediocre at bestno matter how carefully you wedge them behind youre head they do NOT stay putthe detachable parts fall off every time you take a step . forget about running in them !
 Anything more than 99 cents for this product is a rip off !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Cheap chinese plastic . Your Ipod could fall off anytime . . BUYER BEWARE !!!!
 One was fine and is still working great . The other one did n't even work for one month . : -LRB-
 First time using this brand . 4 stars only because I havent used them all . 5 stars so far.Love burning at higher speeds.DON '' BUY :
 I own 3 of these units , and they cause me nothing but trouble .2 are plugged in at my home computer and 1 is at my office for my laptop . They run fine for hours or minutes , and then unexpectedly stop working . . they drives becomes inaccessible until you turn the unit off and then on again.The two at home have started to corrupt data because of this problem .
 Could only get to work intermittently with an olderDell PC and a PowerMac G4 . The keyboard would rarelywork when the PC was selected . Iogear , please go backto the drawing board !
 Do n't order anything from Tiger Direct ! When I received this item , the USB power cord was missing and the manufacturer was different from the one I ordered . I was n't surprised that there was a problem because right on top of the package was a form with the procedure for returning items . When I called Tiger Direct , I was disconnected multiple times but finally got through their maze of a phone system . I was told that they could not just ship me the missing cable . I had to repack everything in the original boxes , ship it back AT MY OWN EXPENSE and wait for them to approve the return before they would ship me a new item . What kind of customer service is that ?
 I would buy this except the airflow is wrong for my laptop and I believe could damage it . Averatec notebooks are very powerful packages for a relatively modest price , however they do run hot , just like their more expensive cousins . I do need a cooler , but it has to be one that blows air toward the bottom of the case , since that is where the air intake is located . A negative pressure would work against the computer cooling fan and would likely in higher internal temperature . The widely distributed Targus works the same way . I do n't know how many laptops have the air intake on the bottom , but that is something to check before buying one of these coolers . Amazon could really help by being sure that the information was included in the description of all such coolers . Some tell you and some do n't . I 'm still looking .
 I got this product about a year before I really started using it , when I got my driver 's license . I was doubtful of the sound quality of adapting through the cassette deck , but it was cheaper than an FM transmitter . It actually sounds really great , and there 's really no distinguishable loss in sound quality . The only downside was that it constantly clicked all the time -LRB- the cassette itself , not the sound from the stereo -RRB- , but I only noticed it when the volume was very low or silent.Then it changed . Now , after about 2 months of use , it has lost all ability to play midrange , and instead crackles loudly in its place . Turning the midrange all the way off solves this , but then you 've got no midrange .
 Product arrived as described by other reviewers . I formatted per recommendations , and all was fine.USB connection works fine . Firewire - no joy.When writing from Firewire port , about 40 seconds into a write , there is a loud ` thunk ' , and the unit has to be reset . Tried several configuraiton alternatives , but ca n't get around the firewire problem.Attempted multiple times to get Tech Support from IOGEAR . First attempt - ignored . Second attempt - ignored . Third attempt - they told me they did n't do customer support using the Online Help Request on their web site . They finally advised me that if it was within 30 days of purchase , I could exchange it with the seller . Unfortunately , it took 6 weeks to get that answer.I bought this unit due to price and the 2-year guarantee . Now I wish I had spent a little more . Makes a pretty good paper weight .
 i originally bought this for the price despite the reviews - i figured all i would be doing is storing music and movies files , so i would n't need any expertise.my problems started within weeks . when i connect to a computer -LRB- regardless of whether it was a pc , mac or laptop -RRB- with either the firewire , firewire adapter -LRB- 6-pin to 4-pin -RRB- , usb 2.0 or into a usb 1.1 port , it wo n't read it . the external drive `` thinks '' for a little bit , but the drives just do n't show up.this has been going on for quite some time and i still have n't figured out a pattern of why it wo n't be read when it 's plugged in . i 've tried turning on the drive , then the computer , then pluggin it in . i 've tried turning on the drive , plugging it in and then turning on the computer . i 've tried turning on the computer , then the drive , then plugging it in.i called iogear several times and finally was told that they think it is a usb port power issue . my laptop , by the way , is a brand-new dell xps , so i 'm wary that it does n't have enough power , especially when plugged in . besides , the problem presents itself with desktops as well . and on top of that , the external drive has it 's own power supply!i tried a different usb cable and it worked for a couple of days before doing the same old song and dance.i asked them to send me a new usb cable for my drive -LRB- figured i 'd get something free out of it -RRB- and because the customer service rep did n't speak english very well , i repeated the model number and serial number and specs of the drive several times.without fail , i received the wrong part for the wrong product.i just want to get my music off this drive and toss the drive . argh .
 If you are an OS X user , and want to make a bootable backup copy of your hard drive , do not buy this drive . -LRB- ... -RRB- Do n't make the same mistake I did-I did n't return it immediately , because I thought I was doing something wrong , I did n't imagine that any firewire hard drive would be screwy enough to not allow booting from OS X. Aaargh . Now it 's too late to return it , and I 'm stuck with a USELESS hard drive .
 I 've had this for about 2 years now with no problems ... then two weeks ago -LRB- with no hardware/software changes -RRB- , I starting getting ` Windows - delayed write failed ' errors on the drive when playing music via Windows Media Player . It is connected to my XP system via USB 2.0 and has about 20.5 GB used -LRB- mostly music -RRB- . Now these errors seem to occur at random.As far as I can figure , it might have to do with the amount of data on it , but with only 20.5 GB used -LRB- out of 160 -RRB- does n't seem likely.I really do n't have time to goof around with this -- so I bought a Seagate external 160GB HD -LRB- USB 2.0 -RRB- , but am unable to even copy data from the Iogear drive to the new one . I am going to try deleting all the non-music files from it and see if I can at least avoid having to reload everything onto the new drive . Good thing I only used the Iogear drive for temporary back-ups ... if the data had been important I would be in trouble !
 Mine just sputtered and died . It 's four months old . Started really using it a week ago . Enough said . Frankly , this seems par for the course as far as these external drives go . Seems like one-in-ten go up in smoke within weeks of use . Do n't put anything on these drives you might care to never see again .
 Seller sent generic 5.25 inch box with no fan . Waste of my time and money . Will have to wait for refund for days , weeks , or months so I can get the one I need from another seller . Do n't waste your time with this seller . I believe the act of sending the wrong unit was malicious and intentional in order to cop excessive profit . Beware .
 i purchased this camera on this site nearly a year ago . since that time , i 've taken it on two major vacations -LRB- alaska and paris -RRB- and was dissappointed with the results . my friend and travel companion purchased disposable cameras and took better pictures than i did . a month ago , i went to montana on vacation and took pictures with the evoca . each one turned out with a bright halo like ring of light surrounding the boarder of the photo ... 50 % of the pictures were completely indistinguishable.i tested it again in las vegas with the same halo like result . so much for the high price tag and fancy lens ...
 Like the earlier reviewer , I got one roll -LRB- no use at all -RRB- when the order form said I would be getting 2 . I 'm on hold now with the people who make the film who are trying to figure out whether I should ship it back and start over somewhere else or what.Amazon FIX the TYPO , guys !
 BEWARE !!!! I ordered and only received ONE roll ... that does not help much when machine requires TWO ! Talked to customer service and they ca n't give me a straight answer yet . The internet said it comes with TWO ROLLS
 I too ordered this item thinking it was a 2 roll pack and received onlyone roll . Company did not bother to make good . Just told me to return it .
 I have used the Omnimounts twice
 I bought a pair of these - excited to be able to mount my new Klipsch bookshelf speakers . They also included the needed adapter plate to work with the speakers . I had a smaller pair of Klipsch previously mounted using the Definitive Technology Pro-Mount 90 's . These seemed very similar in design to the ones I had already been using and had the needed 20 lb rating vs. the the 10 lb limit for the Defintive mounts . The Definitive mounts had worked perfectly . During the installation of the first one , I was unable to get the mount to support the weight of the speaker ... it just kept falling until the back corner was against the wall . After multiple unsuccessful attempts - I decided to remove the speaker and check if I could see anything obvious . At this point , the adjustment screw was frozen and would not turn no matter how hard I tried . I ended up having to unscrew the entire mount from the wall . Clearly , I would not recommend this for anyone trying to install a 20lb . speaker . Amazon customer service was of course amazing and paid for the return of the mounts . I since ordered the Pinpoint AM40B mounts which installed effortlessy and easily support the speakers . Although these mounts may work for lighter speakers , I would not recommend them .
 I wish I would have listened to the 2 star reviews ... . But I went with these because the manufacturer of the speakers I bought -LRB- Ascend Acoustics -RRB- only sells these so I figured they HAVE to work . Unfortunately I was wrong , and to boot , I accidently tossed the boxes in recycling so I ca n't return them . Decent concept with poor execution . You simply can not tighten the clamp tight enough to hold a speaker over 5 pounds . I tightened them as tight as I could and within a few minutes the speakers were drooping . I highly recommend bottom mounts if you have heavy speakers because these stink ...
 Idea of using an Allen wrench to tighten in tight area between the speaker and the wall is a very bad idea . Especially not easy to do when you 're on a ladder , supporting your speaker with one hand . Would be much easier if I could use ratcheting socket wrench . Ca n't get it to support 15 lbs . speakers . The speakers end up resting against the wall . Maybe you 'll have better luck.Directions that came with them seem to be bad photo-copies . Get on-line directions - not the highest resolution but better than the ones that come with the package .
 I bought a pair of the 20.0 wall mounts to hold my 10 pound speakers . One worked and one did not hold.I saw the other poster 's comments that said maybe I was n't doing it right but I tried at least 10 times before I gave up . I even took them apart to compare the one that worked with the one that did not . I could not see any difference . The nylon ball on the one kept slipping and within a few seconds my speaker would droop and end up pointed at the floor . I tried tightening in small increments and also tightening to my maximum ability . No luck.The Omnimount website made no reference to how to fix this and so I am trying to send them back to where I bought them -LRB- I did not buy them from amazon because they would n't ship to Canada where I live -RRB- . These look and feel like top quality items . I think they would be perfect ceiling mounts but for wall mounts the company has to provide a better idea of how to set them up .
 The range of motion is so limited that I ca n't aim the damn speakers right without a lot of fuss . The design is such that screwing them into the wall is just this HUGE pain in the butt . The plastic is brittle instead of having some malleability , so when I messed up and drove a screw too far in it instantly cracked , rather than having any squish . Poorly engineered all around , and not even the the best price on the market . Would not buy again .
 These mounts may work well for speakers less than 10 pounds , but they are certainly not good enough for he speakers I had at 13 lbs . and the notion of actually attempting to mount 20 lb . speakers is laughable . As others have said , the actual build quality and materals is quite high ; however the weight rating/engineering is woefully inadequate . I purchased some very nice screwdriver type hex drvers and was able to put a great deal of torque on the mount but my 13 lb . speakers still sagged .
 Not really much to say . They do n't do what they advertise they will do , which is hold a speaker up to twenty pounds without sagging down . My speakers only weigh a little over half of the product 's rated capacity , and the manufacturer of these speakers specifically recommended these mounts to me . Very disappointed.Contacting Omnimount 's customer support only yielded a repeating of the information that is clearly stated in the provided user manual , which I had followed to the letter , and retried over and over unsuccessfully to get them to hold.I wish that I had gone with the cheaper future shop mounts made of cheap hard plastic that I used to mount my home theater surrounds instead of spending almost $ 100 for these things . If I have one good thing to say , they appear to be very well made of solid materials however this unfortunately does not lead to improved performance .
 The mounts are very nice construction and the kits are good , but frankly they do n't work that well . I have 14 # speakers on each mount and no matter how hard I have tried to tighten the bolts , the speakers sag until they touch the wall for a wall mount . I have had someone else hold it up while tightening with both hands and a wrench until I can turn the bolt no farther . 30 minutes later it has slowly slid to the wall . For a lighter speaker it may work , but the mounts should n't be rated to 20 # .
 There are several reviews that reference the fact that heavier speakers sag with this mount . I found the same thing to be true . One mount i purchased held the speaker nicely while the other would not hold the same position even after numerous attempts . I did find an easy solution . I used small piece of wire -LRB- i.e. . a coat hanger -RRB- cut to the proper length to use as support at the bottom of the speaker to keep it from sagging . It is really a shame that i had to find a solution to this problem in that these mounts are pricey , but it works perfectly just the same . It was a lot easier than shipping them back to the retailer and finding another option .
 Ordered four of these overpriced hangers . urprised the items look different from the picture . The ball is actually BLACK !! How does that happen ?? Returned immediately .
 First there is only one in the package , and I thought it came as a pair . I bought the white one , but the ball was black and not all white as shown in the picture.It looks very sturdy , but the screw was too big for my Cinema 800 rear speakers , so I had to send it back and get the white ones from Definitive Technology which were about the same price for the pair .
 I returned this product . It only comes with one mount . I felt the description indicated there would be two . I went to Wal-Mart and was able to purchase a pair that worked great for less than $ 9.00 .
 Installed this on a new build and immediately the fan started spinning loudly and to think this unit is supposed to keep things quietly . The following day , the system would not boot up at all due to a Thermal Control Module -LRB- TCM -RRB- that went bad overnight . I tried calling CoolIt Systems technical support line and someone is supposedly calling me back . Well , I been waiting for over a week now and still no return call . Will try again .
 I bought this , hoping to reduce the temperatures on my core 2 duo extreme running in an evga 680i motherboard . The evga has a very large chipset heatsink which obstructs the freezone , not allowing me to install it correclty.I attempted to contact the company -LRB- coolit -RRB- to see if anyone had installed on this motherboard , but received no response . I contacted the retailer I purchased this from , and was informed it could not be returned.caveat emptor
 The Arrow T50 staple gun used to be a simple , dependable tool . I had one for 20 years and never had a problem with it . My staple gun disappeared from the job site , now I know why -- the old ones worked , the new ones are junk ! After 2 hours of frustration trying to tack insulation , jams every few minutes with Arrow brand staples -- I took a hammer to it ! Save your money and buy something else !
 I understand this product is cheap , but for me , it 's just too shoddy to justify purchasing at any price . It 's frustrating to use and it 's just plain stupid that Arrow would tell anyone this thing is `` Heavy Duty '' . Compared to WHAT ? A Swingline desk stapler ? At least the Swingline does what you expect it to do . The Arrow does NOT . It bothers me to see `` Made in America '' on a shoddy product.What 's OK
 O.k , all I was trying to do was build a `` cat condo '' ! I simply needed a staple gun to staple the carpet to some wood . I remember my dad had a staple gun that worked great , and would shoot staples across the garage . So I went to Home Depot to get a staple gun . I found the Arrow T50 that looked pretty familiar , so I bought it along with two boxes of different size staples . I took it home , loaded some staples in , and could not get it to work . I tried to hold it at different angles , and tried everything I could think of . It finally started shooting staples , but only about 1 out of five would work ... So back to Home Depot I went . I returned the thing along with the remaining staples , and hoped to find a `` better '' one . There were not really many other options , so I thought I would try another one ! So I bought another T50 along with more staples . I took it home and again immediately had problems . I loaded the staples and it did n't work ! I tried to remove the staples , but they seemed stuck . I tried to use it again , and eventually got some stapling done . I tried to load the second round of staples , and it jammed completely , and would not work at all . I just do n't know why this thing wo n't work . I have the correct T50 staples of different lengths , and none seem to work correctly . I believe this is similar to the one I remember from long ago , except I remember the staples being wider . I do n't know how Arrow could have made these things this long , and yet they work so badly . Did they change the design ? Did they cheapen the parts ? So I have to go back to the Depot again for the return . Maybe I 'll see what Lowe 's has . Stanley also makes a stapler , so maybe I 'll give Sears a try too .
 This stapler is not worth a penny . It constantly jams . Every time I reload , it takes about 10 jams and half of the new clip of staples until it starts working . And yes , I am using genuine Arrow T50 staples for reloads . I know this is the only stapler like it on the market , but you would be better off with a hammer and a box of staples . Save your $ 20
 as someone else said , perhaps it is only the particular one I was unfortunate enough to buy , but this is maddening to use this tool . I 'm at the Amazon website right now looking for a replacement .
 Works great for putting 1/4 '' staples through thin material . But if you are trying to put 1/2 '' staples through even a few layers of paper or fabric , bring your hammer , because you have to help the staples for the last 1/8 to 1/4 '' . And of course , the staples will just bend then.Tried to use this to tack roofing paper down and most recently for reupholstering some dining room chairs . Again , the 1/4 '' staples worked fine , but once the fabric was double in places , the 1/4 '' was n't long enough , and the 1/2 '' did n't go in all the way . And yeah , I was leanin ' on it too.But it does never jam .
 Garbage , utter garbage . I 've had every incarnation of Arrow stapler , from the classic to the `` upper end '' models and they ALL FAIL shortly after purchase even with Arrow brand staples .
 I had an old Swingline that worked great , but got broken at a job site . Never had any trouble with the Swingline . However , the Arrow T50 RED is a piece of crap . I was trying to staple nylon webbing to a canoe set and spent most of my time clearing jams and trying to figure out why staples would not fire , even though the stapler was full and seemed operational . Planning on retuning the T50 RED for a refund . Do n't waste your money ... find a better quality staple gun .
 I bought this for putting up xmas lights . It ran through about 100 staples , jammed up , and there is no way to take it apart to clear the jam , so now it 's a paper weight . A real piece of junk . It says it is made in USA , I doubt it -LRB- quality is Chinese -RRB- but if it truly is , no wonder US businesses are fading fast .
 I bought this because it was supposed to be a quality item made in the USA . turned out to be a piece of junk . Even though I use Arrow brand staples , the gun jams constantly . Not only that , they can be a real bitch to load , especially if you use a short length of staples . Buy another brand or model before you waste money on a T50 .
 I offered to purchase this for a family member for Christmas and after researching a lot os sites found what I thought was exactly what I wanted here . The PICTURE SHOWS the stapler in a case with the two attachments that I was looking for . The attachments are also listed in the description . My brother already HAS the stapler but I bought the whole package to get the case and the attachments . ALL YOU GET is the staper . Could have bought that at HOME DEPOT FOR THE SAME PRICE . Now I have no gift and look like an idiot because I trusted AMAZON . First time buyer and VERY DISAPPOINTED . PUT THE ACTUAL PICTURE SO WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE BUYING !
 Ok , I 've had nothing but trouble with this stapler , and it quite possibly could be a simple defect in my particular one , but I have to comment , regardless.I put up with this staple gun for some time before moving on to another -LRB- Stanley , actually and has n't jammed yet -RRB- , because this one just kept jamming ... over and over . Despite using Arrow staples , in all sizes recommended for this model , I just could n't get more than 3-4 staples in without it jamming again.Seems that others have had better luck , and that 's good . Maybe my issue was just a fluke . Just be aware , there could be more out there with the same defect as mine .
 Just adding to the chorus . I purchased one , with Arrow staples , used as directed , and the gun simply does not work . On the first 20 tries , it spit out about 5 staples , then it stopped working altogether . I was checking out the action and I think the way the gun is built , it fails to push the staples to a position that is square prior to contact with the firing pin . Unfortunately , I can see no way to get into the gun to remedy that defect . I 'm amazed that , with so many reviews like this , stores still carry this product on their shelves . Perhaps you 'll get lucky and buy one without this defect , but how can you trust a company that sells broken tools ?
 I 've owned a couple of these over the years and they work great for awhile . Then , without warning they just stop working and I have n't been able to why or how to fix them . I do n't abuse them and I keep them oiled . I 'm ready to try a different brand . I would pay extra money just to not have to buy a new staple gun every 2 years .
 This is a review of the new RED staple gun from Arrow , an upgrade from the T50 . After trying two of the guns I will not try another . The gun is very powerful and can flush drive a 9/16 staple into hard pine very nicely . However , I had a some problems with the gun . I had many miss-fires when shooting into all materials . I believe the weak spring used to advance the staples might be to blame here . My guns were also very hard to open and fill with staples . The release did not operate properly . Third was when shooting into hardboard with 1/2 staples some drove all the way in and some stood proud of the surface , making it necessary to use the hammer . The last thing was the firing handle would come out of the socket when using it and need to be relocated back in place . All time consuming and frustrating.I am still looking for a better solution . Maybe the Duo Fast CS-5000 ?
 I bought this because of the `` Professional '' indorsement . I figured hey , if a guy had to make a living using this staple gun then it should be what I want to put up insulation and radient barrier in our two story addition . I liked the vast selection of T50 staples and Brad nails that it used . Well I 'm on my second one , and it started jamming and miss firing only after about 1hr of use . I thought this ca n't be , this thing is so damb rugged that Bob Vila should have one of these in each hand . I liked how easy it is to squeeze and when you turn the lever up to the + , it realy sends them home . but when you have to squeeze off 5 times to get 1 staple to come out not so good . I did notice that when I cranked up the power lever , it would chew up and break staples inside the gun . Both guns performed the same only the first lasted a little longer . I realy want to beleive in this gun , to the point that I want to send a video to ARROW . I still have a long way to go putting up that insulation . Maybe I will trade down to the $ 16.99 old fasion all crome model .
 After light use -LRB- homeowner -RRB- for three years , a a ring broke and the clevis pin fell out , rendering the staple gun useless . Warranty ? Two years . Parts available ? Yes , for $ 1.00 plus $ 5.15 shipping from Arrow , for a total of $ 6.15 for a tiny steel ring that should have never broken . Obviously Arrow QA thought this was good enough . In sum , if you need a light-duty , not very comfortable stapler that is cheap at the outset but expensive to maintain , buy this stapler .
 I bought this staple gun because staples are not being made for my 40 + year old Bostitch any longer , and this stapler seems to be one of the few choice around . I am really disappointed . It does not seat the staples like my old Bostitch , so I end up driving most of them home with a hammer . This stapler is poorly designed since the amount of pressure needed to shoot staple does not result in a seated staple . My old Bostitch was easy to push and still seated the staples .
 Never worked well . Needed 10 trys to get one staple in . I did used correct arrow staples .
 Second Arrow stapler I 've had ... both broken within a year . DO NOT BUY ARROW UNLESS YOU ONLY NEED A ONE TIME USE TOOL .
 If you enjoy constantly having to take a stapler things apart to remove jams , then the Arrow T-50 `` heavy duty '' stapler is for you . And I never ran any kind of staples through it other than Arrow.Picture this
 I 'm on Amazon looking for a new staple gun because the current one I 've been using is an Arrow T50 . I 've spent more time trying to un-jam the gun and load new Arrow brand staples into the gun than one should ever have to do over the course of a lifetime . Simply put , this thing does not work properly . It constantly jams and pops open . Highly advise going with another brand .
 Garbage , utter garbage . I 've had every incarnation of Arrow stapler , from the classic to the `` upper end '' models and they ALL FAIL shortly after purchase even with Arrow brand staples .
 The product I recieved looks nothing like this picture , mine had no led lights letting u know it was working , and sata drive plug goes I 'n the top . Just by looking at the product I received U can tell it is very cheap , I used it once , worked fine now for It to work you have to push the IDE contact on an angle , it 's obvious the contacts opened up already after one use .
 Really think the product would have been what I was looking for except it did not include drivers and when I tried to contact the supplier they had gone out of business
 This unit works sometimes . And it usually works on newer disks . I think the SATA part always works , but the IDE is hit-or-miss . When the IDE connection does n't work , the similar Vantec device that I have always works . Weird , I know , but that 's how it is . This is repeatable -- two different Western Digital WD2500JB disks will work with the Vantec and not with this `` Cables '' unit . I tried both disks and both adapters twice each . I recommend the Vantec one instead .
 This product does not come with any sort of instructions , but I followed the photo on the cover of the box plugging in my SATA HD . The minute I plugged in the power cord , I smelled something burning and saw smoke coming out . Immediately unplugged the power cord , but the HD is gone .
 Do not buy this product . It is so cheaply made that just putting it together it broke . The power adapter did not work , the power cables would not go together . You get what you pay for . Get the more expencive one . Dont waste your time with this .
 Received the item today . Took it out of the box , attached an old but operational 80gb HD . LED on the power block comes on , drive spins up but the computer will not recognize it . Next tried a newer , operational 120gb drive . No power to drive . Next tried a 320gb SATA drive . No power to drive and the drive adapter was getting EXTREMELY hot within 10-15 seconds . Also the MOLEX to SATA adapter required to attach the SATA drive to power IS included but is so shoddily made it is unusable . The pins are not seated into the connector , just inserted through the shell making it very difficult if not impossible to use . I 've contacted the seller about a refund and plan to just bump up to a better made item . I am just hoping it has n't destroyed the drives.Don ' t bother . Save your money . If you insist on trying make certain you do n't try a `` mission critical '' drive out of the box as I 'm not certain this thing wo n't cause a MAJOR drive failure . On second thought , just do n't bother in the first place .
 I ordered this from a company called HDE . They did not send me the Cables Unlimited product , instead they sent me a generic product that they advertise for less than half the cost of this item.My review is rated solely on the company HDE sending the wrong product .
 I have one drive with all my info on it that I was hoping to transfer after my PC crashed . Unfortunately , it 's the same Seagate that another reviewer never got to work . No luck . . just would n't power up.It powered up my Maxtor , but there 's no data on it so I ca n't say if it actually might have worked.Extremely cheaply made . The pins in the power connector were so tweaked I had to straighten them before I could even plug it in . I was surprised I was able to plug it in without snapping any of the connectors off.Very cheaply made , really cryptic instructions , and did n't work for me . I 'm returning it and will gladly pay more for something better made that might actually work .
 The product seemed to be well designed and power brick large enought to do the job but ... There were no cables included to connect to any of the three old laptop hard drives that I wanted to connect . Data or power connections were not able to connect to this product . I was able to return to Amazon for a refund . Thank you Amazon for backing what you sell !!
 I was able to use this perfectly with some old IDE drives.But I lost all my wife 's iTunes music and personal data connecting this contraption to her old 250GB SATA HD after installing Windows 7 on a newer HD . It basically fried the board so it was no longer responsive -LRB- platter does n't spin -RRB- - even when installing it back into the laptop it used to live in . I bet the data is still there , but I 'd have to pay a recovery service big money to get the data off the platter . So because I paid for the cheaper version of this , I now have an unhappy wife.Buying this device falls into that category of `` penny wise and pound foolish . '' Go higher end and do n't risk the damage of SATA equipment because of a low-end SATA power connection . I no longer trust this thing - it 's going in the trash .
 Be Warned
 Be warned Cellular Factory intentionally put up the wrong pictures on this listing . This is the cheapo adapter with no activity lights . You might as well buy it elsewhere for half this price . Cheap , cheap , cheap . False Advertising .
 When I first purchased this I thought It did n't work . I plugged it into the hard drive and connected the power cord and nothing . I forgot about it till I needed something off a hard drive and figured I 'd try plugging it into a spare plug in my computer for power and use it just for the SATA to USB that did work . Why the power supply that come with would not work I do not know and for less than $ 20 I am not to bothered to bug the seller .
 It has been over 2 months and I am still waiting . It is a good thing it was not medical supplies .
 This enclosure is great except that it does not have any automatic power shutoff and it 's passive cooling is in my opinion not enough . I have a 500 GB WD Caviar drive in there running all the time , probably wasting a lot of energy because when my computer goes into standby mode to save power , this drive for some reason continues to run , so it is always fairly warm . I have to physically turn it off at the switch to save power . Maybe I am missing something , but I guess I thought it would be smarter than that . Other than that , it is lightning fast , and it does my full backups -LRB- > 300 GB -RRB- much , much faster than USB hard drive enclosures . As far as speed goes , this is a great model . If I could do it over , I would buy an enclosure with active cooling .
 Worked fine but I used it very little and the unit has died after about a year of use .
 I purchased this unit because of the wireless functions of the rear suround sound speakers , but have since upgrated the speakers that came with the unit to wired ! The unit is on the cheaper side with several of the functions not being as high quality as I would have expected .1 -RRB- The CD/DVD tray only comes out about 75 % so you have to have the disk flat and slide it into position .2 -RRB- It seems that the only way to get it to open the CD/DVD tray is to turn the power on first -LRB- other CD/DVD players we have had will wake up on their own if you press the eject button -RRB- .3 -RRB- The remote has been nothing but problems as you have to press the buttons 4-5 -LRB- or even more -RRB- times before it will actually register , even being directly in front of the unit ! -LRB- forget about being at any great angle -RRB- . There are NO universal remotes that will replace this -LRB- as per JWIN 's website -RRB- as they do not use standard codes for their units/remotes ... so you are stuck with this one ! I tried to see what it would take to either repair or replace the one we received and JWIN said it would take about 3 weeks to repair , under warranty , or it would be $ 15 if we wanted a new one ! 4 -RRB- The speakers do sound fine for the unit -LRB- you get what you pay for -RRB- but the wireless system started having problems when we started turning up the volume , as we started to hear a little crackle/static from them . We since have hard wired the system -LRB- using a 3rd party receiver -RRB- and they sound GREAT ! The wireless receiver does have an EXTREMELY bright blue LED on it that lights up the entire room !!! 5 -RRB- Subwoofer has basic knob controls and is easy to adjust and does a good job.Overall I would say that this would be an OK system for someone that wanted a basic home theater system , but if you could save a little more for a different brand , you may want to as there have been others with the same problems I have had !
 I was disappointed to find that the system is not totally wireless and I am having trouble contacting the manufacturer regarding the remote control for the DVD player . This remote pretty much controls everything and it does n't work at all .
 The product sent does not fit the computer.The item does not look like the photograph - wrong mechandise was sent . It has no value to me at all . how can i return it ?
 I have had my Intuos2 now for 2 years . And as of today , it has ceased functioning twice . I had to send it back to Wacom the first time for this SAME problem
 It is slimmer then others but is n't very rugged . The waterproofing is not very good compared to other otterbox lines . If slightto light protection is all you need then it will work fine but if you drop it alot and lots of water get the bigger bulkier one that hold up to punishment .
 From the amount of money I spent on this thing I was extremly disappointed . First of all , it wo n't let you copy any real movies-it will eject the tape and say `` tape is copy protected '' . This is the main reason I bought the thing . Second of all , the # 2 tape deck became contaminated and just showed wavy lines . I tried a head-cleaner tape but it did n't help one bit . No matter how I ajusted the tracking it would n't work . This occured just 3 months after purchase . BUYER BEWARE !
 We have only had our Go-Vidio Dual Deck VCR since August of 2000 . After about 1 month . . the 2nd deck started tracking extreamly bad . We have used the `` auto '' tracking and `` manual '' tracking and it does not seem to work . Also , We have tried to use a head cleaner on the 2nd deck ... It still tracks extreamly bad ... I 've been very unhappy with this purchase . . I 've tried to call for help and all I get is a recording that says all the people are on other lines and to call back ... I 've done this repeatedly and never get anything but this recording ... Where do I go for help ?!!!!!
 this product is for you . No one should be confused ... this product is not the most current model from Wacom . The only reason why you would buy this product is if you are in love with the color blue and do n't mind the older software . This product is bundled with Photoshop Elements 1.0 and Painter 1.01 . Painter 1.01 is not compatible with OSX . In contrast to customer reviews , Photoshop Elements 2.0 has NEVER been bundled with this model . If you want the more current software Wacom offers with the 6X8 tablet -LRB- which DOES include Photoshop Elements 2.0 and a newer version of Painter , which is OSX compatible -RRB- then buy the newer model -LRB- XD68USBPLAT -RRB- . It is gray . I was told by a Wacom rep that the only difference between the two tablets is the color . The tablet itself seems to be a great product . Again , no one should ever be confused about what they think they are buying . Hope this helps .
 The video tutorials are great . The program is average compared to others out there.My biggest peave is that , after trying a number of programs , I found one I liked better . Dan Oaks refunded only my purchase price -- NOT THE 200 % HE CLAIMS HE WILL DO . He continues to ignore my emails.Downside , they charge for modules and recipe book add-ons .
 After reading all the other reviews I thought these would be a good buy . Once I received them , very quickly I might add , I put brand new batteries in one and began to try them out . Sound was so low you could barely hear the movie playing in our Chrysler Aspen . I went to move the volume button and nothing changed so I thought the volume button was broken . So I had ordered 2 so I went and tried the same thing with the second headset , same issue . I then decided to plug it into my MP3 player thinking it might be the IR but same thing . I am not sure if I could have received 2 bad items but not taking a chance and will return them both and buy from a local store so I can test them out first . I wish these would have worked as they seemed to be a good deal .
 Very poor IR quality , the ear cushions come off with ease and the kids lost two the first day . The volume is very low . They are very large and dont fit right on my toddlers .
 I purchased wireless headphones before that were not as fancy looking but that last me for a few years . This one stopped working after a couple of months . I 'm a busy mom of three whose kids go to school far from my house . I drive 500 miles a week , and did n't fit in the time to try to return it until now , and my return window is expired . I would not recommend purchasing these headphones .
 I purchased this bag for my Nikon D90 . Since I just bought the camera , I do n't have too many lenses and accessories . Even then , I had some trouble to fit in my kit lenses . So I retured it and went for a new one.Pros - Easy to carry -LRB- but good if you just one/two lenses -RRB- Cons - Too small , highly priced for a small sized bag .
 This bag is way too cramped . I have a Canon T1i camera body , a 70-200mm zoom , a 50mm fixed lens , Tamron 10-24mm zoom and a speedlite 270 flash . It takes all of my patience to cram most of it in the bag and zip the lid closed . No way all of it will fit . From the photos on line it appeared to have room for a camera and up to about 4 lenses . I just received it 4 days ago and I am shopping for a replacement already . Maybe I can use this one for my point and shoot camera and camcorder .
 The device is no longer supported by the manufacturer , so when it arrived broken , there was no way to get the parts I needed . I was n't aware that people could sell discontinued or unsupported merchandise on Amazon . It was a disappointing experience .
 I bought this for a trip to China to charge cameras and batteries which do not require a voltage converter . Chinese receptacles require a three prong plug . The top prong is longer than the lower two angled prongs and actually opens the ` doors ' for the lower prongs to enter the receptacle . This adapter only has the lower two prongs . Why not state that this adapter will work in all countries except China and ... Fortunately , the hotels we stayed in loaned us converters so we could charge our equipment.Will not buy Kensington product again .
 Well , for starters , this product will not convert any voltage for you . So , the statement in its description `` is suitable for most consumer electronics ranging from 110-volts to Mac 275-watts , to 220-volts to Mac 550-watts '' is wrong and intentionally put to mislead people.Second , the product will not support three pin devices so if you want to put in a three pronged pin into it , that wo n't work.Third , it gives a huge statement about able to work in 150 countries . Well , it doesnt support the three pin plug of europe used across EU , wo n't work in India and SA as the plug it fits into are vertical plugs and not three pin plugs and in that position , it will break before handling the weight . Wo n't support three pin operation in these countries and wo n't even fit in the plug . In Australia also , it will work only with two pin support -LRB- which is my biggest crib with this product -RRB- . The built is cheap plastic and not sure it will take a fall to the non-carpeted floor.Not sure why this product is still present with all the false claims and such a low quality .
 This adapter does not accept 3-pronged U.S. plugs ! There are some reviews for this product which indicate it does work with these plugs . Those reviews are WRONG !!! It is inexcusable to design an adapter like this that does not accept 3-pronged plugs , that 's why I 'm giving it just one star . This is also the first time in a decade I 've been disappointed with Amazon , their product description should make it very clear that this adapter accepts two-pronged plugs only .
 The form factor on this gem is fantastic ! However , the adapter will not accept a three prong , grounded plug . The plug will go in after using much force . It worked fine for 2 insertions . After that , the internal fuse blew . The spare was used and the fuse blew again . Finally , I threw the adapter away . I would not recommend it to anyone who wants to use a grounded plug .
 This unit looks great , but it does not accept 3-prong US so it 's not very useful for a laptop power supply and not only that , but it also failed to function about halfway through a 2-week European trip , meaning I needed to replace it at the airport . Neither convenient or well made enough to stand up for a single trip .
 I tried to use the adapter in 4 different outlets in Germany . It did not work in any of them . I plug in a roommate 's adapter into all 4 outlets and her adapter worked . It was disappointing to find out when I was out of the country .
 It worked for few months after that it is spoiled . Not working any more . I think it is very cheap -LRB- not in the price -RRB- product . I never recommend to anyone
 I love the design for this adapter . I travel a lot all over Europe and South America and it was nice to have an adapter so small with so many options . However , it only lasted a week before it stopped working and that 's the only reason I 'm not leaving a 5xStart !
 This thing is pretty useless to anyone from the US , using this abroad . The adapter does not accept any US plugs that have a 3rd anchor prong on it . So you wo n't be able to plug them in at all . It will work fine for plugs that only have 2 prongs . But , for me , not being able to plug in my laptop makes this a total fail .
 This would really be a nice product , that is if you never have to plug in a grounded device , such as a laptor recharger . It only accepts two prongs !
 Did not work in India . I traveled to Gujarat , city of Vadodara . I had some limited success using this product in the New Delhi airport coffee bar , but not once did it work once in Vadodara . If you are going to India , use a different product .
 I bought this adapter for international travel.It never worked.It arrived DOA , although I only found that out after it was too late.I was very lucky in my travels to be in places that had plugs that were US friendly and electronics with 110-240 transformers.Avoid , do not buy . You are better off with the Radio Shack plug adapters.Buyer Beware !
 I am living between Europe and US and travelling a lot in Asia , I can tell you this adapter is not convenient at all - simply my french laptop power plug is too bug to fit in this adapter I had to buy an other adapter . In addition the fuse blew off after the 2nd device connected . Last thing this adapter has not USB plugs . Do not buy at all this adapter it is fancy for nothing .
 This adapter is a piece of junk . I took it to Italy and it worked twice and then quit working . I tried different outlets ... everything , and no luck . Fortunately I always take a back up adapter but with all the devices that need charging having only one is a hassle . If I could rate this 0 stars I would . Save your money and do n't take a chance on this worthless device .
 I was very unhappy with this product . The information on the web site states that this is good for chargers . When I received the product the packaging clearly stated that it is not for use with chargers . That was the only use I had for the adapter . I returned it and the cost of shipping , as I expected , and the cost of the prepaid label were deducted from my refund . I feel that I was penalized for incorrect information posted on the web site . I am usually very satisfied with my purchases from Amazon but this was not the case for this order .
 I had bought this item due to good review before I went to a trip to Bulgaria . However , it plugs in but does n't work . Why ? I do n't know . how should I deal with it now ? Is it a defect one ? I have no idea , to me I just lost 17 dollars for an experience . -LRB- do n't buy electronic items from a book store , even it 's cheaper -RRB- Fortunate I also bought Targus travel adaptor set that save me .
 It broke during my first trip and the second time I used it . I was trying to charge my camera battery .
 Works in australia , does not work in western europe or asia ... if you do n't feel like searching for a power adapter in a foreign country , do n't buy this ...
 I used it once and when I went to recharge my cell phone in Paris it did n't work at all causing me to have to call the states with my credit card and costing a small fortune - Horrible product !
 but this will not work with 3 prong plugs . UNLESS you want to CRAM it in there so hard that you ca n't get it out without the thing almost coming apart . It 's such a great sized adapter too , but it had to go back .
 I bought this device thinking I would save money over buying multiple plug adapters for Germany and Australia ... big mistake . I found that I could buy single plug adapters for each country for just $ .99 each .
 This adapter is certainly not small . It is large because it is an all-in-one , which sounds good , but in reality does n't cut it . It is so big that it sometimes will fall out of sockets . The internal fuse also blew-out when I was overseas rendering it useless . I am now using the much smaller regional adapters which can be purchased at Office Depot or Staples for $ 3-4 .
 As someone else stated , WILL NOT WORK WITH 3 PRONGED , GROUNDED PLUGS . How ridiculous . Of course , my laptop 's ac adapter has three prongs , like many others , so it will not work with this . Also , when traveling abroad , the trick is to bring a power bar so you can plug in multiple devices at once , where only one travel adapter is needed for the power bar itself . Unfortunately , most all power bars have 3 Prongs , so it wo n't work with them either.Stupid . Stupid . Stupid .
 This same design is sold by several companies , and has two major drawbacks : * European-style plugs come with prongs of varying thickness , including some where the thickness varies thoughout the length of the prong . This adapter is only able to handle the thickest ones when excessive force is applied and the mechanism will cause the thinnest ones to stuck so that you can not pull them off ; * The adapter consists of two parts which are linked in a fragile way , a break is almost certain to happen .
 This thing is crap . Fuse blew 1st time I tried to use it . Could n't find a fuse for it til I returned to the US . Found a cheap adapter in a London luggage shop which worked perfectly . Skip this one .
 AUUUUGH !!! After hours of rattling through website after website , learning the difference between a converter and an adapter , having a crash course in watts and volts and hertz and computers and hair dryers and coming to the brink of insanity because , it seems , there is n't a website in existence that gives enough information about these accessories to learn what a 4-second encounter with the actual item in its package in a brick and mortar store would tell you -LRB- for instance
 I have read a review that says this product also works in INDIA but came to know that neither of the given 4 different power plugs does n't fit indian power outlets .
 I bought this item for my trip to China . It did not work . Luckily the hotels that we stayed in had an adapter we could use . I called Kensington about my adapter , and they said I could return it and would refund my money since they have a 90 day return policy . I bought the adapter in September and sent it certified mail within their time frame . This is currently January and have not heard from them . My advise to those thinking of using it for China . Do n't waste your money on this item .
 Nice idea ; slick item . But , the fuse pops all the time -LRB- very normal / basic use like charging a laptop -RRB- . Unfortunately , this makes this adapter completely unreliable and useless . You do not want to find yourself in a foreign country having to look for a replacement fuse ...
 I bought this to use with my USA lap top - which has a 3 prong plug - something pretty standard and it only takes a US plug with two prongs . So I 'm currently traveling outside the USA and can not charge my lap top using this . Have to buy another over here . This travel adapter is completely useless . Nothing in the product description makes it clear that you are unlikely to be able to use this for a lap top . Misleading - only useable with my cell phone cable ! A complete waste of money !
 on my last trip my friend had one she bought on the plane and it worked great . I bought this one recently , went overseas and it did not work ... then came back and found out that the return window had expired ... so basically paid for something that did n't work and ca n't even get my money back on top of the huge inconvenience given I had n't brought with many the many adapters I used to carry with me ... very , very unhappy !!!
 I was in Europe with this adapter and the internal fuse blew . Guess what , I could not find another fuse for it ANYWHERE and ended up buying a cheap adapter at the hotel . As large as this product is there should be an extra fuse -LRB- at least 1 -RRB- in another compartment somewhere.Plus , as noted in other reviews it will not accept 3 prong plugs.Once I came home I tried to find a replacement fuse , still no luck . Threw the unit away.Not recommended .
 I only used it a few times in the span of about three months and it just not working anymore . I have no idea what is wrong
 This thing is a piece of junk . I would have rated it zero stars if possible . I took it to Italy and it worked about 5 minutes . This is a plug adapter and should be a very somple device . Using the plug that fits in Italy 's two-prong 220-240 V recepticle , the 110-120 V 60Hz/220 -240 V -LRB- 50Hz -RRB- cell phone charger worked maybe five minutes . I checked it to be sure that the adapter plug end was properly positioned and properly locked in place - which it was . I tried a couple of other low voltage devices set to operate in duel voltage and it would not work . I messed with it for quite a while and could never get it to make an electrical connection - we stayed in several locations and it would not work - period . It was never overloaded -LRB- cell phone charger -RRB- - it 's a huge waste of money and this thing was very expensive for it 's intended purpose . If you need foreign adapters , buy a kit with the individual plug adapters - you will save money and frustration .
 made by kensington - sold by amazon - what could be wrong , right ? wrong !!! saw the reviews only after the third prong of my mac book air power supply got stuck in it.can ' t believe amazon still sells it as compatible with a laptop power supply despite all the negative reviews - do n't even have the time to return it - will just use it as part of the power supply for this trip .
 This adapter is very convenient but wo n't work with hair dryers or medium to heavy power users . It has a 2.5 amp fuse . I plugged a hair dryer into it and the fuse blew immediately . That is it can only handle up to 275 watts at most .
 I was hoping to do a lot with such a product . however , it did n't work either with small devices such as cellphones and cameras nor big ones . It seems great product but unfortunately it deserves this star because there is no zero star .
 I 'm not sure about other brands , but this item will NOT work with Dell laptops -LRB- 3-pronged plugs -RRB- . If you own a Dell , look else where .
 I bought my laptop in China , and I lost my plug adapter somehow , so I want to buy a new one . And even thought it costs 13 dollar , but I still think it is worth it . But when I got it today , I cant use it with my laptop . How can you call it an international plug adapter when you ca n't plug in Chinese charger ? so disappointed , a waste of time , and a waste of money .
 Stayed at two hotels in the UK and this device did not work in either one . Would love to get a refund of this piece of junk . I have a number of other Kensington products , all of which work reasonable well , so this is a particular disappointment . Luckily for me , both hotels had built-in US plugs .
 As I have found it , these all in one packages do not work well . Especially this one . Tried using it in Germany , and it failed . Yes , it was a problem that it does not work with three pronged plugs , but it was a bigger problem that it would n't even work with two pronged . I tried everything , and I know it is n't a voltage problem .
 Item returned.I give it 2 stars because I hated to have to return the item . It seemed sturdy , easy to use , and was compact and offered the variety of plug types on both the male and female ends . I tried out all of the male end plugs and they all fit perfectly into the power strip I also purchased which accommodates all plug types . But as for the female end of the adapter ... nope.It is advertised as being universal and great for computers/computer accessories , HOWEVER , they do NOT state that it WILL NOT accept a US grounded/3 pronged plug -LRB- which A LOT of laptop chargers have , especially Macs -RRB- . Perhaps there is just some trick to getting that round 3rd prong to fit into that rectangle 3rd hole -LRB- which I presume is meant for UK 3 pronged plugs -RRB- but I could not figure it out . The plug on my MacBook Pro charger would NOT fit in the rectangular hole at the bottom . Yes , I could have purchased a prong converter , but I should n't have to . When I see `` all in one '' or `` universal '' I expect it to be just that and not require additional adaptors in order to use it . Perhaps certain grounded plugs are smaller than others and that explains why some were able to use this product while others , like me , were not . Several people have argued that this product does in fact accept a US 3 pronged plug , but NONE -LRB- that I have seen -RRB- have bothered to go into any detail beyond that . If I 'm wrong , please explain what you did to get this to work , or better yet , show me . Or at the very least tell me what product you had that actually fit into the grounded plug slot . Because it surely was not a MacBook charger OR a Simran Universal Power Strip/Surge Protector .
 there are several reviews that say this does work with three prong laptop plugs . I ca n't figure it out so can someone explain ? I have a Mac and the plug does n't seem to want to fit it .
 Wrong adapter , not satisfied with order at all !!!! Was supposed to get an adapter for us-everywhere else but got opposite
 Since I travel out of the country frequently , I had hoped to avoid bringing my bag of various connectors . I got this and the first time I tried it in Argentina it did n't work . I will try it once when I return home before I toss it , but was n't worth bringing along and also quite bulky . The different connectors do not move very easily either . It 's too bad because would have been a great idea and I have other Kensington products that work.Addendum
 As has been said , this item is a complete piece of junk . The package and labeling advertise it as a plug for use with computers and computer accessories . Except all modern computers are three pronged -LRB- ie , they have a ground -RRB- . This plug does not have a female three prong US . It is thus completely useless , and I am returning both of the ones I purchased .
 I bought this travel plug adapter for my wife when she was traveling to Europe and Asia . However , it does not have the input for the 3-pin U.S. plug and had to get another adapter to fit onto this unit . It is well built but definitely not a universal , all-in-one travel adapter as advertised .
 Nice product but it worked only 1 week with my 90W laptop , then blew the fuse . Should ship with an extra fuse .
 I should have read all of the reviews . I bought this for my computer for a business trip recently . When I got to Europe , I pulled it out and it did n't work with my plug ! Good thing I had bought a universal igo converter for the plane , because I was able to use it for the trip . Very disappointing !
 This product does NOT support laptops or other products that require a ground -LRB- for US plugs -RRB- . I have a standard Dell laptop , so I assume it 's very common that most US laptop plugs have the third plug for the ground . They market this product for laptops , but this product has no hole for the ground plug and the website/description does not explain that . I had to buy a different adapter with at the airport , so basically this product ended up costing me $ 60 .
 This one broke on the 2nd day . Luckily , I took another model with me as well so I was n't stranded . Ended up buying another one on the plane . I like the all in one feature though .
 This is an old design that has two significant flaws.On the input , as others have noted , it only accepts unpolarized two-prong plugs . No polarized plugs , no three-prong grounded plugs.The European adapter is an odd shape although perhaps it would fit . BUT it is the older ungrounded European plug . This will not work in grounded European sockets.This should be made clear in the product description.I 'm returning it .
 do NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !!! I PURCHASED THIS PLUG ADAPTER FOR MY TRIP TO EUROPE AND THE MOMENT I PLUGGED MY MAC CHARGER IN , THE FUSE INSIDE THE ADAPTER BLEW.I REPEAT , DO NOT BUY THIS . THEY SELL FAULTY DEVICES AND HAVE INCONVENIENCED ME THE FIRST THREE DAYS OF MY TRIPtalk about a stressful first three days . i took my adapter to an electronics store and the worker tried 5 new fuses in the adapter -LRB- with a camera charger plugged in -RRB- . one by one , my plug adapter blew every single fuse . I 'm telling you , please do n't ever buy this product , save yourself the hassle it caused me
 I just returned from China . While there I had to request an adapter from about 1/2 of the hotels because this one did n't fit . Also , while you can force a 3 prong plug into it , it is too difficult to do and then remove for this to be considered usuable for a 3 prong plug . I would n't buy again and depending on the cost and trouble may return this one .
 Similar to other consumers , I found out too late that this does NOT support electronics -LRB- i.e. your beloved computer -RRB- that have 3 prongs . Found out when I was already abroad - such a shame and waste of money . I had more success using the $ 7.99 adapter I purchased in the Target travel section under the `` Target Home '' brand .
 I took this with me to Peru and it never worked . Fortunately oneoftheother members of our group had a converter that worked so was able to charge my phone on her converter .
 I regret not having read the reviews . If you want to use a grounded -LRB- 3-pronged -RRB- US male connector into the female part of this converter , fuggetabout it.If you believe you 'll never need to insert a grounded plug , it seems fine ... fairly compact and sturdy .
 It does what it needs to do for standard 2-prong devices , but if you have a 3-pronged USA grounded plug , you 're out of luck . The bottom opening where the rounded ground would be is too small/narrow and typical plugs wo n't fit . I 'd look elsewhere .
 Dont buy this product ... . no good for 3 point plugs ... incorrect pictures have been uploaded in the product description ... I bought this product to use in brazil ... of no use . . switched back to the one from monoprice ... way better
 I bought this adapter for a trip to Egypt . It fit in the Egyptian outlet ok . I used it once to charge my camera batteries , it worked fine . Next I used it with my hair dryer and it would not work at all and it has n't worked since . For the price , it should work longer than one use . I would be very wary about purchasing this product .
 This is a nice plug adapter but it 's NOT a voltage converter . My laptop , camera and gadget chargers worked excellent with 220 volts . I was n't so lucky with my wife 's curling iron and hair dryer . Telling her she looks great is no substitute , so be sure to double check her gadgets too.Some European lamp outlets are recessed into the wall , so the plug will be seated flush instead of sticking out . They are elegant and beautiful , but too small for this plug adapter.Finally , bring a power stip unless you want to move the hotel furniture each time you change a plug .
 First day I plugged this in , it blew a fuse . Never worked !
 I am going to France and needed an adapter for my appliances . After purchasing -LSB- ASIN : B0002H4YUI Kensington 33117 International All-in-One Travel Plug Adapter -RSB- -RSB- I found it would not work without another purchase of a devise to change the voltage .
 I bought this for a trip to Italy . My wife used it with her blow dryer for the first time and after about three minutes it died . For five days we thought it was her blow dryer . My wife was on the verge of trashing her dryer . We found out later that it was the adapter and not her dryer . We bought a really cheap adapter for two euros and she was able to use her blow dryer with out a problem for the rest of the trip . Since we took the instructions with us , and followed everything it said , I 'm hoping we can return the product . We also double checked to make sure that the voltage on the dryer was set correctly.I would n't waste my time or money on this product .
 I find the adapter easy to pack and use . Follow the instructions and it works .
 from the time it arrived , noticed that the pictures taken were always dark . even in broad day light . by playing with exposure stops one can make scenes brighter , but the pictures turned very grainy . thought did not know enough to use the product . so not only read the manual twice over , but bought a guide form gary friedman on how to work with this camera . all in all a waste of money . went to the repair center in bangalore , india - was informed it has a defect , but can not be repaired.so stay away from any marketing messages . stay away from sony cameras - especially the dslr .
 I had the chance recently to try a A100 . With all of the glaring reviews about this item , and a set of lenses + very nice program flash of my old Minolta Dynax 7000i I was willing to get a body of the A100 next to my Nikon D70s.It 's a decent DSLR , feature-wise , and the steady-shot feature is a big plus , but I found the following items a big negative :1 . Above ISO 400 there is a considerable amount of noise . The ISO 800 is virtually useless and ISO 1600 is just a joke . There are tons of discussions about the A100 noise on user groups , typically from users who already own a A100 , and recommend to use ` Noise Ninja ' and other post processing tools to fix it . Ridiculous . My D70s produces better image quality at ISO 1600 than the Sony produces at ISO 400 . This makes this camera virtually useless indoors , unless you 're willing to ignore the visibile picture noise , or print pictures at 5x7 only -LRB- in which case you may well purchase a 3MP snapshot camera which will work quite as well and probably produces less noise -RRB- .2 . I found the white balance to be off too much in standard lighting situations . I had to do quite a bit of post processing in Photoshop . Also , the camera I tried under-exposed every single shot .3 . Mirror noise / slap is quite loud . Too loud .4 . Flimsy built . This was quite disappointing -LRB- Canon and Nikon doing a much better job at that -RRB- .5 . Flash does not popup automatically . There are numerous indoor snapshot type of scenarios where you do not want to be thinking about this .6 . Related to 5 .
 I pre-ordered this camera from Sony because it uses the Minolta lens mount . I was so excited to be able to jump into digital and still be able to keep my lenses . I received the A100 on August 17 , 2006 and the power went off and stayed off on September 24 , 2006 . I called their Tech support who did not recognize the name of the camera -LRB- their website does n't recognize it either -RRB- . The first question they asked was if I had turned it on ! After we went through all the other possibilities I had alread tried , they suggested I hold the `` power on button '' . Of course , this is a DSLR and has a slide switch for power . I was told to UPS it to them in Laredo , Texas . Everyone knows UPS has no respect for electronics and I was afraid it would come back to me in pieces . Also , I was told by the Tech that if something did happen to it in transit , it was my problem not theirs . I then called Customer Support . The girl who answered was rude , she got mad at me for being upset my five week old camera was not working . What did I expect a working camera for $ 900 ? I could not return it because they have very strict rules about the four week limit . Mine lasted 5 weeks . No apologies , no explanation , no `` do n't worry we 'll get this handled '' . They made it quite clear that I was being very irritating with my call . I asked for a Supervisor and was told none was available , but she would have one call me within 3 days . It 's day 2 and still no call . I wish I had never heard of the A100 . Sony definitely does not stand behind it 's product . I will never buy anything from them again . I wanted to put no stars on this review , but the system wo n't let me .
 I am really frustrated with Sony and my Alpha DSLR , a product with inferior build quality and a customer service that lays the blame on me instead of acknowledging quality problems . I have bought it sometime in 2007 and only had problems with it . After some weeks it just would n't turn on anymore and it took Sony several weeks to get it repaired and back to me . Now when I take pictures the resulting file shows a different field of vision than what the viewfinder showed me . Even worse , there is a black right upper corner in every one of my picture . After several tries to get to the right person to help me , Sony told me that any repair would cost a fixed amount of 114.56 . Without even knowing what is wrong with my camera . Asking if this functional failure is normal for a Sony product after three years , I was told that this is normal `` wear and tear '' . For me a camera that is expected by the producer not to last longer than the guarantee period of one year , is not worth paying for . My next camera , or any electronics product for that matter , will for sure not be a Sony product . I recommend for everyone planning to buy one of their products to think hard about how long he/she plans to use it for .
 I bought this camera for Christmas after having spent several weeks reviewing test reports -LRB- such as on -LSB- ... -RSB- and reading user opinions . I wanted to buy a DLSR because eight to six years ago I owned a nice SLR from Minolta and was very happy with it . After buying our first digital camera -LRB- a compact 6 MP SONY DSC-V1 -RRB- we have n't really used our SLR anymore . We have used our compact V1 a lot , maybe shot 7,000 pictures over the last three years , and even though being happy most of the time there have been moments where I wanted to have a real SLR/DLSR back . So , at the end I decided for the SONY A100 over Canon or Nikon for a couple of reasons :1 -RRB- We have been very happy with our SONY V12 -RRB- We were very satisfied with our SLR from Minolta and the A100 is based on earlier Konica/Minolta DLSRs3 -RRB- The image stabilization -LRB- steady shot -RRB- seemed to be a major advantage4 -RRB- Sensor cleaning -LRB- anti-dust -RRB- mechanism5 -RRB- I could potentially use an old objective from my MinoltaAfter having received the camera and after having shot maybe 100 pictures -LRB- not too many , I admit -RRB- , most of them test pictures where I took the same scene with our old V1 , I must say that I am quite disappointed of the picture quality . I do n't know whether it is because of the 18-70mm lens that came with the camera -LRB- even though I have read that the quality of that lens is actually not that bad -RRB- but it turns out that the pictures with the A100K are worse than those taken with our V1 , which I find quite amazing , and disappointing.The test pictures that I have taken with both cameras were taken at home , with and without flash , in various modes -LRB- e.g. AUTO mode , program mode , shutter priority , etc. -RRB- . I played with the ISO settings , the flash level and the EV settings for the exposure compensation and so on . The scenery was colorful -LRB- many objects/toys with different colors -RRB- and allowed a good comparison of color reproduction and sharpness.What I can see so far is that for some reason the pictures with the A100K are quite blurred , even though I use steady shot -LRB- also with flash where steady shot would not be required -RRB- and even though I set the sharpness already to +1 , as recommended by many users . Still , the image quality is disappointing , in all modes that I have tested so far . It turns out that our V1 gives really better results , even though it is a fairly small lens -LRB- from Carl Zeiss , though -RRB- , a much smaller sensor and only 6 MP . The color reproduction on the A100K seems better and more natural , on the V1 the red is typically over-pronounced . The other , very annoying impression is noise . I read about noise issues for ISO settings above 400 ISO but there were some users that mentioned that you hardly shoot at 800 or 1600 ISO , which I found convincing . However , now , in this typical `` home environment '' I can see that on some pictures even the noise at 250 ISO is significant , I mean , you look at the picture and one of the very first impressions is that it is quite noisy . You look at the EXIF info of the picture and it tells you that the ISO -LRB- I shot in ISO AUTO mode -RRB- is 250 or 320 . This is really very bad . I did n't expect that I would have a `` noise problem '' for a typical daylight picture at home even , under certain circumstances , not all pictures , of course.I will definitely return the A100K . I think I will try another DLSR , maybe the 10MP Rebel from Canon , otherwise I will stick to my V1 or look for a newer model . We realized in the last two days how superb the V1 is , actually , by having this comparison with the A100K ...
 Like others have said in their reviews , the camera is decent , but the cusotmer service is horrendous ! I purchased the camera in July , 2007 from Ace Photo and the camera arrived very quickly . The problem started when I tried to download my first set of photos -- I could n't do it automatically as there were corrupt files . I figured it was my memory card so I purchased another one , but had the same problem . And , on the camera , there is an error code for formatting memory cards . So , I called Sony Cusomer Service and I was unable to talk to anyone that had actually seen the camera so they walked me through algorithms that were not at all appropriate for the problem . In fact , they could n't even find the error code I had in their list . Even so , they made me spend 3 hours on the phone with various agents going through processes that made no sense for the problem I had . In the end , they told me I would need to purchase a memory card from them -LRB- becuase they could n't verify any of the cards I was using would work correctly even though they were Dane-Elect and Sony ! -RRB- and if that did n't work then I could send the camera in at my own cost for them to repair it . I am amazed that Sony treats customers in this manner ... it has definitely made me think twice before purchasing Sony products in the future .
 This camera has not timelapse recording !!! -LRB- Cameras with a time lapse feature can be programmed to automatically shoot a number of frames over a period of time or with a certain time interval between each frame . For instance , a camera on a tripod in time lapse mode could be set up to shoot frames of a flower opening or a bird building a nest . -RRB-
 I bought these even though there were n't any reviews on them , because I have had good experiences with other Panasonic products . I guess I ended up as the Guinea Pig , because these headphones simply do not do what they promise . The main purpose for buying them is the noise cancellation . I tried them during an airplane trip and I could not hear a difference in ambient noise when I turn the switch on or off . I have experienced other noise cancelling headphonses -LRB- Bose and Sony/Aiwa -RRB- and there is a very perceptible noise reduction.Other than the fact that they do n't work , the design is very cheap . The roll up mechanism does n't work too well and the case is bulky and made from cheap plastic .
 it does say that it comes with a psp and the game hustle but thats not what it comes with . It only comes with a sound system . which is ok I guess . so if that is what you want then order but if not then do n't .
 I know I could be an odd fluke - but I brought two of these and returned both of them due to defective RAM modules . When I contacted Sony support they were not helpful at all . I would hesitate to recommend Sony 's product to anyone else .
 I bought this computer two years ago , I was well care with UPS , the CPU fan stopped working and even the CPU has a control to turn the computer off when it is hot the GPU does not , so it burn out the GPU , to replace it I have to change the entire motherboard . A $ 2000 computer that last only 2 years ? For me since Sony products are not the old high quality they used to be . A similar experience happened to me with the Blu-Ray reader of a PS3 .
 I would STRONGLY recommend AGAINST buying this computer . While it is sleak and modern looking with lots of bells and whistles , it wo n't be long before it breaks . My motherboard randomly failed after only 13 months of use and cost over $ 800 to replace . When I got my computer back from Sony after having them replace the motherboard my cd/dvd drive no longer worked and they tried to tell me I had to pay to have that fixed as well ! 3 months after having all of this fixed , now the computer wo n't even start . I am an IT professional and kept my computer in optimal conditions and care at all times so it was definitely not from my use that caused this computer to break .
 This computer while very attaractive is NOT a Mac . It runs the HUGELY flawed and buggy Vista . So given that I took it back . Buy a Mac , youll be doing yourself such a favor . Not viruses or spyware or bugginess.Just Mac goodness without all the flaws that makes Windows based PCs such garbage .
 This player had good picture quality and sound , however , the unit boke just over a year after purchase . The picture still works but the audio no longer comes through . It is going to cost $ 150 to repaire and the warranty just ran out . Needless to say I will not purchase a toshiba as my next player .
 I ordered my Toshiba SD 1200 in August of 2000 . It was broken out of the box . After 6 weeks of waiting , I got it back and it never quite worked properly after that . Nothing you could take it back for -- it was quirky and unreliable , deciding on one day that it could not handle layer changes , on others that it would not read a disk that it read fine the previous day . Well , last night when I ejected a disk , it literally flew out of the tray , still spinning . Now the unit wo n't do a thing except sit there . The warranty has expired , of course . I will never buy a Toshiba product again . If nothing else , they have quality control issues .
 Toshiba DVD 's beep annoyingly when you open the tray , close the tray , use the remote , and even beep during the movies randomly acccordingly to several reviewers . So if you are annoyed by beeps do not buy this or any other Toshiba DVD player .
 This was the DVD player in the living area which we do not use often . We 've only had the player less than two years and it says Disc Error no matter which DVD you put in it . Movies that worked previously do not work now . I read the entire manual looking for some trouble-shooting advice and found nothing referring to Disc Error . Then I finally called Toshiba 's 800 # and was told to unplug the unit for a few minutes and then plug it back in so it could `` reset '' . I did this several times , for up to an hour at a time and nothing changed . I asked the Toshiba rep on the phone what else could be done and they said nothing except they could look up the nearest service center . Assuming the repair bill would be at least $ 100 I have since gotten rid of it and bought another DVD player -LRB- of a different manufacturer and spent $ 102 -RRB- that has a much better record of reliability and long life , plus many other features that the Toshiba did not have.If anyone knows anything about the `` disc error '' message I would love to know what it is and I could fix this one to give to my niece .
 It looks obvious that it 's not an ordinary bear because one can see the camera lens in the bear 's eyes . Plus it needs a video player to record what happened during the day time . Video player and video tapes are not easy to get nowadays .
 This was not at all what I expected . The picture is terrible . It is hard to get the bear to sit in a position that works for the camera . It says that you can see in almost any light , but you ca n't . The camera is obvious in one of the bear 's eyes . This was a terrible purchase . I would not recommend it .
 If you are looking for a 5x7 portfolio , skip this one . I bought it for times when I did not want to lug around my 11x14 portfolio and was expecting the same snug fit for prints . However , this pages are 5 1/4 x 7 instead of 5x7 , so it actually cheapens the look of 5x7 prints in it .
 I 'd be happy with this cleaner if only it did n't cease to function . The first lasted under three weeks of thrice-weekly use . The seller replaced the unit and the replacement lasted about 6 months.The failure mode is like this
 eFortune promotes this unit as a 60 watt 1400ml capacity cleaner . I specifically purchased this unit because it was supposed to be an upgrade in power from the unit I was using . When it arrived , the unit has a label underneath which lists it as only 50 watts of power and only 1000ml capacity . These units are being mis-represented , and you are paying more for it over the slightly less powered units for sale .
 First machine did n't function but a few seconds at a time . Replacement from seller three weeks ago works , but so poorly produced that already the plastic case has cracked from the vibrations . Cleaner has not been moved around nor bumped . For the price , it definitely should have held together more than a three weeks ! I wish I had spent $ 20 - $ 30 more and bought the fully stainless steel professional machine .
 Terrible product , malfunction at first use and had to deal with returning it twice . Finally got refund thanks to amazon 's policy .
 Item does not charge the elf 200S cannon power shot digital camera battery when it is advertised as capable of doing so
 This product is definitely not worth $ 12.99 . It fits my NB-1L battery , but it does n't charge unless there is some kind of weight pushing the battery down into the charger . It 's very light and does not seem to be of very high quality . I 'd say it would be worth 4 or 5 bucks .
 After my usual reviews of products on Amazon I bought this product based on what customers said and my need . I must say that I 'm not satisfied with this replacement battery as I am still getting messages saying that my battery -LRB- although fully charged -RRB- is out of juicy !!!! Not sure what to make of it .
 I ordered this item because it is advertised as suited for the Axim x30 . It is n't . In fact , the packaging itself says X3 . So I have now two completely useless batteries that I paid more in shipping for than they themselves cost.The line - Hitech - Replacement X1111 PDA battery for Dell Axim X3 , X3i , X30 PDAsimply is n't true .
 So you need to copy data onto Hi-MD minidiscs ? But why ?! You have to plug your minidisc player into this thing and copy the data off the memory card onto your minidisc player , but you 're not done yet . You need to then copy the data off your minidisc player onto your PC using Sony 's software . The major advantage is that a Hi-MD minidisc holds about 1 gigabyte , but that advantage is only economic
 There 's little more to say ... great item , almost a `` must have '' , but forty bucks for a half ounce of plastic is absolutely criminal .
 Under Product Description : This lens hood is designed for use with EF 16-35mm f/2 .8 L III got this for my Canon 16-35mm f/2 .8 L II USM lens but it is NOT made for it . I should have done my homework instead of trusting the false product description here . What I really need is the Canon EW-88 lens hood .
 It 's nice to have the appropriate lens hood for what is a relatively expensive lens , unfortunately Canon take advantage of this desire and exploit their loyal customers with over priced bits of black plastic , this is one of those bits of black plastic that you will want but should never have to feel so ripped off when obtaining it . It fits very well , looks good , has a nice furry inner surface , but I suspect that it 's shallow profile means that it will afford little if any benefit to the performance of the lens .
 Bought this for my parents and i was envious of it . sounds so good . then this past xmas i bought them an ipad and a cable so they can watch netflix on it from the ipad . this shuts off the receiver . turn it back on , a few minutes later it will shut itself off . google researched and i 'm not the only one this happens to . it was working fine for a few years until the ipad was introduced , never once shut itself off . experimented , plugging into different inputs , testing voltage from the wall outlet , etc. no dice . super bummer
 Not only did my receiver break two months after I got it , Onkyo would n't help me at all . Try another brand .
 I bought this bag for our video recorder . It is a nice bag but way to small for a recorder . I kept it to use with my digitial camera . It is a perfect bag for a digital camera . I would not recommend it for a video recorder .
 This item was obviously made to fool people into thinking that it is practical ... it sound practical , but it does not reel back in and it did not fit into the Palm connection port . So , I threw it away !!!
 good product , however it does not work with all TV 's , I have a Sylvania and an Emerson , both digital tv 's and this remote will not work with either one of them .
 Pros
 I got this remote as an upgrade from my R6 , because the R7 has more memory and the nifty back lighting feature . It is easy to program and to `` teach '' codes to , however it does not work properly for my Insignia -LRB- LG and Zenith -RRB- converter box.It will only turn it off , and not back on . I spoke with tech support twice . One lady said that the remote is not programed to work with the converter boxes . Another rep walked me through several attempts to delete codes and try anew , etc. , but nothing came of it . He agreed that it 's odd that the remote wont turn the box on , but said that it would happen with any R7 , and not specifically mine . If that were not an issue , I would rate this remote higher.Secondary cons :1 . It 's hard to see if the buttons are blinking during programing because your fingers will cover up the lit portion .2 . The navigation circle button is difficult to use and control . It is made of a hard and smooth plastic , not a rubbery one like the other buttons . It 's difficult to only click down or up once , and the SEL button is raised quite high and gets in the way.I 'm going to go back to my R6 because of this issue.If you do n't have a converter box , this remote is ok ... for the price .
 Had to send item back would not even programme anything ! amazon does not even cary it any more so do not konw if I just got a bad one or what . I guess i will never know . bummer though sounded like a nice remote
 So I was ready to buy a Uniiversal remote and I thought `` hey that 's a cool looking remote and the packaging design is spiffy and the capabilities boasted by the manufacturer sound great , okay , I 'm on board '' . I get the thing out of the box and it feels a little bit light , as if made entirely of cheap plastic , I install the batteries and I sit down to program some functions and NOTHING . I changed the batteries and tried again and still no luck . It 's too bad that the first review of this product has to be a negative one but I am sorry to say I will be returning this plastic piece of junk in favor of the less expensive Sony competitor . Sony , a name you can trust to work right-out-of-the-box everytime . No I do n't work for Sony , Hopefully , their universal remote will work for me .
 I 've tried programming the R7 to control my Sony Wega TV by each of the 3 methods -LRB- and with all possible settings for the macro power function -RRB- and it always power cycles the TV when I select that component . Tech support was friendly , but was n't able to help with this problem . Probably not good for the CRT . Otherwise it works fine .
 This is good for the price but unfortunately it wo n't work with my Dish DVR . Wo n't even lear the codes . Want a great universal Remote ? Try the Logitech Harmony 510 . A bit more expensive but worth the money .
 If you have a dish network satelitte box the chances are slim to none that this remote will work out of the box . The problem is that code 122 does n't work and there is no working code for dish in the remote . You will have to make it ` learn ' every key on your old remote . Not all that hard , but it took over 20 try 's for it to learn the info button . Quite a pain , but what really made me give this product only 2 stars is their technical support -LRB- or lack there of -RRB- . After having the same problem with 2 different R7 remotes and being told several times by their technical support that it was a problem with my sat box , I borrowed an R6 -LRB- also made by Universal -RRB- and programed it with the 122 code . It worked perfectly . After confronting their technical support with this proof that their is something technically wrong with their programming their response was that I should buy an R6 instead . Dah , this is technical support ?
 I read up on quite a few of the remotes and settled on this one for the positive reviews and the cost . I bought two of them in fact , one for both of my tv 's . I am tired of having 4 remotes . I found out shortly thereafter that this remote wo n't control my Dish Network 921 receivers because they operate on UHF . This is one of their highest tech receievers as it is a DVR/HD/dual tuner receiver . I wasted more time when I called URC and they told me to call Dish Network and that they could help me make it work . They had no idea what I was talking about and they told me that they do n't support 3rd party remotes -LRB- ca n't blame them for that -RRB- . I did n't like that I was transferred to India and that the person , hearing what I needed thought that I wanted to buy another remote , but that is another story and the state of customer service most of the time these days . The problem that I have with URC is that 1 . They sell a remote and their website has no compatibilty chart with common devices . Logitech does and I should 've spent the extra $ 50 apiece and bought theirs . 2 . Their customer service , knowing that they had sold a remote that would n't work with Dish Network , could have offered to exchange and upgrade it -LRB- at my cost of course -RRB- , but they did n't offer that . My advice , buy your remotes from someone who guarantees compatibility . I have a couple of paperweights that I intend to resell used here or on Ebay or craigslist at a loss
 I was very pleased with the difference this product made in my home audio system , but about 16 months after purchase and regular use it stopped working . The repair was very costly , and the source of the trouble is still unknown .
 I purchased the KLH ASW 10-100 as said in my other review . Originally it lasted less than two months , then the amp stopped working . Two and a half weeks later I recieved another amp from KLH for free . After installing the amp the sub only worked for less than two weeks . I have in no way abused this sub by playing it too loud , it simply lacks quality . Unfortunatly I have nothing to show for the $ I spent since amazon 's return policy is 30 days . Whatever happend to the amp I also like to add that it is possibly a fire hazard as for my room smells like something has caught on fire .
 not a quality piece . i usually like KLH products , but this is definitely a case where you get what you pay for.the sound is loud , but very boomy and not controllable at all . i played around with it for a few hours and had to take it back - it was worthless to me . and i 'm not an audiophile.i eventually bought a jbl PB10 and it 's considerably better . it 's twice the price , but worth it for the improvement in sound.best of luck !
 When the unit worked , it worked well . Unfortunately the built in amplifier is of poor quality , and doesnt last long . I dont recommend this to anyone .
 This subwoofer worked great during action scenes , but during the quieter scenes it had a really annoying humming sound coming from it and it made it hard to concentrate on dialogue . I played with all the dials and made sure the wires were plugged in correctly , but it did n't help . After the warranty expired , so did the subwoofer . I have to give the subwoofer a rating of 2 stars because it did perform well during action scenes , but that is the most I can give it . I will never buy KLH speakers again . It was n't worth the aggravation and added expense in the long run .
 I never had a problem in the past with directv , but clearly this product is treated differently internally by the company . I ordered it from a customer service one night , assured that it would work . A few days later an installer came to our house , tried to install it and was unable to get it to work . When I got home , this new receiver did n't work , our other receiver no longer worked and two long cables were suspended on the outside of the house whereas all cabling ran though the walls , hidden from sight.We called directv and they tried to troubleshoot the loss of service . During this time , they evidently activated the new receiver . When they could n't get it to work , they scheduled a subsequent installer to come back to our house . The new installer refused to repair the work of the first installer because he said that the first installer `` botched '' the original installation . Evidently , the second installer was only authorized to clean up the installation but because it was n't actually installed correctly , he was n't going to work on it until the first installer returned with their mutual supervisor.We considered this to be a waste of time and asked them to remove everything and return it back to where we started . After the second installer spoke with his supervisor and a directv supervisor , they removed all the equipment , restored our previous systems and left.Directv called a few days later and said that they were sending a fedex pickup for the receiver . We told them that the receiver was taken by the installer . The installers returned a few days later with the box and apologized for everything that occurred . Directv sent a fedex label which we used to return the receiver.We never received the 600 credit for the receiver even though multiple customer service representatives tell us that our record shows that the box was returned and that we are due the credit.Evidently , no one is authorized to credit anything over $ -LSB- ... -RSB- . We 've been told by some supervisors that once an order is activated , there 's no one that can issue a credit over $ -LSB- ... -RSB- . We are out $ -LSB- ... -RSB- and we have been actively abused by some directv personnel who insist that since the box was activated , we can not receive a credit even though it was authorized , returned and permitted.I 've never been able to get a true understanding on this issue other than it 's clear that directv is very sensitive to this particular box . I think it might be either a known defective product , a difficult installation or both but I can assure you that if they ca n't get it to work , they have no means by which to credit you.I 've initiated a charge back with the credit card company and intend to switch to comcast when we move in two months . For what its worth , we were a $ -LSB- ... -RSB- a month customer with directv in the past with perfect credit and payment history .
 This box does not work as a high def receiver for Direct TV . It only works for standard def and as a TIVO . Is not what is advertised . You will regret wasting your money if you want a high def DVR box . It is out dated and wont even pick up high def satellites ! STAY AWAY !!!!!
 I had to send my receiver into DirectV for service after only 3 months . The first refirbished one they sent back also failed . The second worked but they charged me $ 1000 because they thought I did n't return one of the receivers . It took an hour on the phone to clear that one up . DirecTV is putting up new HD satellites that are not compatible with this receiver making it possibly useless in the future . I canceled my service because I was n't getting good satellite reception and when I tried to sell the HD recorder , I found out it was n't worth half what I paid for it and the access card is not transferable . Any new owner must buy a new card for $ 89 . For 9 months of DirecTV I am out $ 800 . I am done with the dish !! I am only giving it 2 stars because the TiVo software is so good . Be advised that future DirecTV PVRs will not be TiVo .
 The new DIRECTV HD DVR unit is inferior to Tivo in major ways.First let me say that I have used the new DIRETV HD DVR unit for more then one month . Also I own more then one of these units , I have three and have experienced all of the same problems with all three of the units.These units are poorly made.During playback of recorded programs I have experienced stuttering and eventual freezing up of the video & audio . The only way -LSB- & the way DIRECTV told me to correct this problem -RSB- to correct this problem is to unplug the unit and restart everythingm , which works but thne it starts up again in a couple of hours . Also the only other way to fix the problem I was told by DIRECTV technical support was to erase and reformat the hard drive , which I did -LSB- and lost all recorded programs doing -RSB- only to receive the same results as unplugging the machine.Aside from the above also I have experienced shows that recorded but no sound on the recording would play . The only way to fix this was to reboot the whole system again same as above.Also I have experineced shows that say they are recording in my to do list and even on the guide but they do n't show up as recorded on my playlist . Same thing as above on how to correct this.Programing wise it is inferior to Tivo which is much simpler to use & has better `` Wish List '' , `` Date Programing '' , `` Season Pass '' features that make finding and recording shows much easier . It is especially poor in finding your favorite sports teams and recording sports events.Besides being much easier to use in recording , Tivo is also more accurate in it 's recordings . With Tivo you could search ahead 3 to 4 weeks in a calender to record shows whereas DIRECTV 's unit in many cases is only good a week out.When I put in a Series to Record sports event like UEFA Cup it records many soccer events that have nothing to do with the UEFA Cup etc. I love my DIRECTV but I hate their HD DVR unit , it is a terrible product . I 'm canceling my serivce and switching to Cable with a TIVO unit .
 I have been a DirecTV customer for five years now , and my previous experiences with digital recording are with RCA Ultimate TV . I recently bought this receiver when I decided to upgrade to the HD era . I bought my beautiful plasma TV and I hooked up my receiver with eager anticipation . The box functions about 98 % of the time , so I 'll give it a bit of credit for that , but the interface and software of this device are very very poorly designed . The simplest way that I can put it is that the Tivo experience is vastly inferior to the Ultimate TV experience in every imaginable way . My wife and I both frustratingly agree with this after battling dissonace with this product.It 's impossible to fully describe why this product is so mediocre . The best way to do it would be that the menus and functions are all laid out poorly . Nothing is ever as easy or fast as it should be . Do you want examples ? Let me give you a small handful .1 . With this box , you can not watch TV while scheduling a program . To schedule a recording , the box completely switches to menu screens . With Ultimate TV , you can watch TV in a small box in the corner while setting up another recording . This applies all over the Tivo box . You ca n't navigate any menus at all while watching TV .2 . The remote control that comes with it is a lousy design . It 's almost perfectly symmetric so that you ca n't feel which buttons are which . Add that to a poor sensor on the box that wo n't detect the remote from any kind of sharp angle , and you have a very annoying experience .3 . There are only three fast forward speeds with this box , vs. Ultimate TV 's four speeds . In addition , there 's an annoying half second delay between when you press the fast forward button and when the box actually starts fast forwarding .4 . There is no one touch recording with this box . A glaring omission , to say the least . To record something on TV , you have to go through three or four menus to finally get a recording started .5 . If you have a recording conflict , Ultimate TV gives you the option of immediately resolving it . This box does not . It only gives you the option to cancel a recording that you just set up .6 . Tivo has really stupid brand names for all sorts of functions that should have simple names . Your recorded shows are called `` My Now Playing List '' instead of `` Recorded Shows '' , or something like that .7 . There 's a delay before every menu comes up . This box just works very slowly .8 . THERE IS NO FUNCTION THAT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH SPACE YOU HAVE LEFT . You have no idea if you have five hours left or two hours left . This is an incredibly stupid ommission . Every recording medium ever made except for Tivo shows easily and clearly how much space you have left . Ultimate TV certainly does . Tivo does not.Nothing , by itself , is a big problem . It 's all of the little annoyances that give you the impression that this is , overall , an inefficiently designed product without the user 's convenience given much consideration . I highly recommend only buying this receiver if it is your last resort . I 'll probably never buy another Tivo product again . There are a lot of recorders better than this one .
 I was hoping to write a positve review this evening , but DirecTV was unable to active my unit due to their systems `` updating '' all evening on a Friday night . The 1 star rating is n't for the HR10-250 , but for the ongoing issues I 've had with DirecTV customer service . They have been getting more expensive and less customer focued over the past year , which is disappointing . If they can actually get your service set up it is pretty good -LRB- as long as you do n't have to interact with anybody in the company for any help -RRB- .
 Known issues with recording series , recording HD content , recording at all.Mine get about 40 % of what is programmed . DirecTV refuses to replace saying , and this is a quote , `` the inability of the DVR to record series is normal therefore we are not authorized to do a replacement '' Spent 3 hours on the phone , was hung up on 3 times . By far the worst customer service I have ever experienced in my entire life . I will be paying the 300 dollar fine to end my service early.DO not get it .
 A total piece of junk -- cheap inside and out . I received this as a gift , and am dreading my in-laws asking about it . It died precisely one day after the warranty expired . Very slow to crank up compared to others , frequent freezing , unresponsive remote control -LRB- you could get married and divorced waiting for it to respond to commands ! -RRB- Poor picture quality with frequent waving and picture edge disintegration . Finally , it refused to give up a DVD , forcing me to take the cover off to retrieve it . Believe me , I have 2 other DVD players , and you can do much better for the price . Try Sony , Panasonic , and Toshiba . I 'm sure you work hard for your disposable income ; do n't waste it on this . My Sony has been playing flawlessly since I bought it , and it is over 2 years old now , and really was n't much more than this , and in fact , the prices have come down since I bought it . Nothing is a bargain if you are throwing it away right after the warranty expires .
 This was my first DVD player - the price brought me into the market . That 's the one thing I 'm grateful for because it introduced me to how wonderful DVD 's can be - and I was hooked.But the operation of this player was very buggy and I quickly got very irritated w / it . Maybe because I had a defective unit , but from the look so fit - I do n't think so.I returned it and went out and bought an RCA DVD player which is the cheapest DVD player from a company I recognized . It was about $ 200 and worth every bit of the extra money . I 've never had a glitch w / it and I love owning a DVD player . I have n't used my VCR since !
 You get what you pay for . This unit 's remote is very fragile . Keys constantly stick . The unit has trouble reading just about any disc and is very tempermental . Very cheap feel to the controls . Save your money . /
 I purchased the `` Oritron DVD 200 DVD-Video Player '' as a second player , and it could only play a few of my DVDs . It suffered from severe skipping as well as audible pops and clicks . Overall , it was a total lemon !
 I agree with the gentleman who said this player sticks a lot . I have had nothing but problems trying to get different DVD 's to work in this piece of work . I would never purchase another Oritron product . The only thing I liked about this player was the price but I will probably go out and purchase a different player as soon as I can afford it .
 About 6 mos ago I was in market for a DVD player and wanted to pay a little as possible for a completely satifcatory machine . Lots of research , reading of reviews and finally settled on a Toshiba SD1200 . 6 mos later I can only say great things about the quality of the viewing and machine . I stumbled across the negative reivews on this player and wanted to provide cheapskates like myself an alternative player that was hassle free . When I was purchasing their were many issues with the low-end Sony -LRB- reportedly since corrected -RRB- but I took the leap to Toshiba and would recommend it to others . Pay the extra bucks and relieve yourself of 2 hours on the phone with customer service .
 I was shopping around a basic digital camera and encountered this product . At first sight , this camera looked great . It has 10Mpixel and all common features , yet a real bargain price tag . The user reviews I found on the web were mostly positive . But once I tried it , I have to say I was very unhappy . Quite simply , auto focusing works only under very bright conditions and this camera does not have manual focusing . When I tried to take pictures in my home under normal room light , auto focusing failed quite often and the images are terribly blur . I do n't know if this is true for all of this model or specific to the unit I got , since nobody else has reported this kind of problem . I hope more people would post a review of this product which shed some light on the focusing performance .
 It is useless , do n't wast your money . I bought thinking it is a good Camera after seeing from my friend . Unfortunately my friend 's and mine had the same problem
 The worst camera ever ... the battery will be over just for 10 shots ... Even the price is very low , dont be tempted by looking at 10 MP and price .
 We purchased a new unit that was defective and we contacted Epson as instructed by Amazon 's Return Policy for this item . We were sent a refurbished replacement for our new unit priced item instead of either a new unit replacement or the option of a refurbished unit replacement at a reduced price . Because of this experience , we will probably purchase all our new electronic equipment from a local store where we can get what we paid for should a problem arise .
 I would strongly urge anybody that is considering an Epson printer to be cautious . Although I certainly do not EXPECT your experience to be the same as mine , as an active consumer I wish to convey my frustrations with Epson care/service/support . About two years back I had an Epson Stylus Inkjet -LRB- forget which model now -RRB- that failed while still under warranty . I mean , the printer FROZE my computer and there were HUNDREDS of crossed out -LRB- RED -RRB- printer icons all over my screen . Then I began getting code imposed over my desktop screen with words like `` printer failed '' in the message . Yes , at the time I had an Apple computer , but that 's of lesser relevance ... I called Epson , as my printer was still under warranty for about 8 more weeks . They said they recognized this sounded bad and wanted me to send the printer in -LRB- at my expense , start the tab running $ -RRB- . I did . On the same call , they said they could either send me a new printer , or I could - under THE CIRCUMSTANCES I had - go buy one from a local store to have immediately and they 'd reimburse me . I opted to buy locally . I bought ANOTHER same model while mine was in transit to Epson -LRB- tab $ increase -RRB- . Then came the true frustration . Epson spent NEARLY 3 months in `` processing '' my return authorization . They acknowledged they had received it . They would NOT reimburse me for a new one . They claimed that they needed to determine if my printer was failing due to defect or negligence -LRB- I included SCREEN SHOTS in the return box of nasty printer icons covering my frozen computer , how can that be negligence ? -RRB- . After many , many calls to Epson service , they continued to say they could not yet reimburse me . At one point , they even tried to say that I should NOT have bought one locally as their standard procedure would be to send a warranty replacement from their warehouse . On this point they quickly withdrew , since I had phone records of who I had talked to.Needless to say , after several months go by , I was told with finality that : `` Epson would not repair nor replace my printer because it was no longer under warranty . `` Now , I had a relatively NEW printer from them -LRB- this one started having printer head alignment problems in the first few months -RRB- and they had held my returned inkjet printer from OVER A MONTH from BEFORE my warranty expired . Now , instead of being out only the original $ 250 for my original printer , I had patronized a company that had given me difficulty with ANOTHER $ 300 , and also about $ 20 shipping , and about 50 hours of my time.I 've had a Canon i950 6-color inkjet with borderless printing that I am extremely happy with since then . Cheers .
 This photo printer , and all commercial photo printers , are inkjet based . This is something that everyone should be aware of.A lab print from film is dye based , as are most digital printers in photo stores/pharmacies . The reason I am saying this is that although the inkjet printer may do a good job printing the picture , there are two problems :1 . the cost of ink2 . all ink will fade , not only over time , but with moisture.because a lab 's prints are dye based , they do not fade and moisture doesnt affect them.Just something to keep in mind .
 I purchased one -LRB- from a local store not Amazon.com -RRB- , brought it home and printed a photograph that I had previously printed on a Kodak EasyShare printer -LRB- my mother-in-law 's -RRB- . The resulting photograp was horrible , it had a very green tint to it . I then adjusted the various enhancement controls within the printer , the green tint remained . I checked the troubleshooting section of the manual , checked/cleaned the print heads , and still the problem remained . Given that the product is still on the market , I suspect I had a broken unit.I did not like the LCD , it is very hard to read . I adjusted the contrast but it did not help . -LSB- ... -RSB- .
 Beware if your buy this printer or a newer version . This printer will crop your photos about 6 % without you even wanting it too , it just does it automatically . Even after adjusting it , it still crops . Usually cutting off the tops of heads , not so when you have them professionally printed .
 We bought this thinking it was the newer version of the PictureMate then the one we had . I can not believe an older version is even still available much less for the price they are asking . It does not even except a 2 gig SD card , it is slower then a snail . I would think the price would be more like 50 bucks versus 200 + bucks . We are attempting to return it and so far the seller is asking if we used it or not . I hope we can return as of course we used it otherwise I would not know about the SD card limitiation or the slowness . This is the first item I have ever had to RTN that I purchased via Amazon.Pat Hinde
 The item was suppose to be new , however it was obviously used . The box was demolished , ink cartridge was dried up , and the paper was already used -LRB- gone -RRB- . The printer was dated from 2005 and the used ink cartridge 2006 . We tried purchasing a new ink cartridge from Epson , but unfortunately not even that worked . The item was so old that it would n't recognize a modern day memory card . Nonetheless , the item has been returned .
 This Product was advertised as if it were ready to use . I set it up and tried to use it but the paper feeder refused to feed the paper . I needed the Power Cord so I consider that I paid $ 40 + just to get the power cord . VERY DISAPPOINTED
 The ink in my Epson Picturemate constantly dried up . Epson would refund me for my unused sheets , but this got old real fast . Put in in a garage sale for $ 10 and now use Walgreens . Second and last Epson .
 I received my Epson PictureMate Photo Printer as a 2004 Christmas gift . It printed the first 14 pictures very well . Then it started printing in poor colors , even though the ink level registered 75 % full . I cleaned and aligned the print heads as instructed in the manual , but still no success . My regular printer was an Epson also , before it developed mechanical problems . I have since switched to a Lexmark Z25 which prints my photos and regular print . I will not use Epson again .
 Epson claims photos printed from PictureMates are waterproof . This oft repeated claim is blatantly false . I 'm disappointed that professional reviewers have n't exposed this farce . Newly printed photos seem to have some waterproofing but that quickly disappears . Test it yourself . Simply place a drop of water on a months old photo , wait a few seconds , gently mat the paper . The result is a ruined photo . How is that waterproof?I bought this printer because of the great quality -LRB- true -RRB- and waterproof photo feature . I 'm really disappointed with the waterproof claim . They 've duped us all.Kudos to the other photo printer manufacturers for not following suit with equally false claims . It must have been tempting to do so .
 I have been using my PictureMate Dash for several months now and have finally put it in the trash . Since the beginning the print quality has been mediocre with horizontal lines and continual color shifts.These are generally resolved through head cleaning and alignment , but both of those have never fully fixed the problems . They certainly do n't prevent them from coming back.With the expensive cartridges and the inability to stop using cartridges once they have been started is very frustrating when you are trying to resolve quality problems . I have tried a new cartridge on many occasions and found out it was not a cartridge and could n't complete the use of the cartridge without wasting the newly tried one.If you want to be running diagnostics all the time and have 50 cent pictures , the PictureMate is for you .
 First and foremost , be it known that I am a longtine , loyal supporter of Epson technology . I believe them to be at the forefront of Digital scanning and printing on both the consumer and professional level . I have utilized their products for over 20 years for one simple reason . Inspite of the higher prices for their inks and Papers I believe that are Superior to anything on the Market . That said , I think that the Picture Mate is a piece of junk Unworthy of it Made in China icon . It is kind of like one of those Xmas toys that you do n't have to worry about . It looks good under the tree and it 's a lot of fun that afternoon , but you do n't have to bother about were to store it because it 's in the garbage the next day . I knew 3 years ago that the PM20 was a toy , an expensive toy , but I wanted to please my wife on her birtday , and since she is a computer phobe I bought it to her delight . Over the years she has produced less than 100 photographs which are superior and the envy of her freinds since hee can crop andjust her pictures while her friends do n't . She also takes very good care of her toys and usually dosent bother me about them . so everyone is a winner . til they break . I have wasted 2 afternoons with The Picture Mate Support group which appear to be Mindless talking robots taught to follow folw charts ; which is ok except the flow charts are simplistic and probably only cover situations that can be fixed over the phone . As a result the conversations get into endless loops when you reach the bottom of the chart there is no resolution , so we start again from the top with questions Like ` What is your home phone number ? or what operating system are using -LRB- we 're not using a computer -RRB- . The only way out of the loops is to ask for a supervisor -- who is n't there . They then ask for your Home Telephone Number , give you mis-quoted incident number , and tell you they 'll be back in less than 48 hours . Finally after 3 Rounds and at the Highest of Epson 's corporate level I was informed that the unit was probably broken and probably out of warranty , and was referred to the Epson loyalty Website -LRB- where Picture Mates go for Premium Prices -RRB- or a local service center . The local service center wants $ 150 to look at it . To touch it would cost more . I could be fined for throwing the PM20 in the garbage and there is a $ 50 charge for processing it at the Reclomation center . So it sets on my mantle as a reminder to never go there again .
 I was ripped off . This printer was listed as NEW but arrived USED AND BROKEN , I did what AMOZON told me too do . I sent item back and Never got my money .
 This photo printer will crop your photographs regardless whether you cropped or not . The person that you photographed will have their head cut off ! if their head is close to the edge . Make sure you have plenty of empty space between your subject and the edge of your photo before you send it to print . In other words , do n't have your subject fill the whole photograph . Have your subject centered with plenty of room because it will crop top to bottom and left to right - all sides . Like said before , this printer will do this regardless whether you choose to crop or not .
 After about 3 cartridges , it started to print in dark blues and greens only . After a cleaning , it printed one picture correctly ; the next was also dark . We cleaned it again ; it did one good one and then started to print dark again . I threw the printer away . Due to the high cost of the cartridges , $ 35 per picture is too much . The printer was kept and used in a clean environment .
 This printer has been a piece of garbage since the day I bought it . I do n't know why I kept trying , as the purchase was made about a year ago . It should have been thrown it in the trash long ago and I would have cut my losses -LRB- instead I did buy one more package of paper and ink . Mistake . -RRB- I have never gotten more than one picture in a row without an error message , turning the printer off , turning it back on , doing that several times , and finally maybe getting it to print two pictures in the same day.Now it says the cartridge should be replaced , when about 20 minutes earlier it told me there were approximately 56 pictures left in the cartridge -LRB- and I have not printed anywhere near 44 pictures , which would add up to the claim of 100 per cartridge . I have printed about 6 . -RRB- The ironic thing is , the handful of pictures that have printed correctly have been beautiful . The one that I printed today was perfect . But several tries to print one more picture were a waste of about two hours . This is the last time I try to use the printer , it is finally going in the trash .
 When I started to look at the new photo printers that were coming to market I would have to say that I was extremely interested to see what Epson would bring to the photo 4 by 6 printing market . My first impressions was that it was huge compared to HP 's 375 printer . However , I was interested to know that your prints should cost around 30 cents per print that is exciting news , HOWEVER , when I tried to print my prints I was very disappointed that you have to print out a thumb nail print to see what numbers the prints are , so the COST OF A PRINT THAT EPSON ADVERTISES IS DECIEVING . I also found that compared to the HP 375 which has an amazing color LCD screen that the Epson was much more difficult to use , especially if you wanted to zoom in and crop out a portion of the print . On the Epson you only have a few choices of what area you want to crop , however , on the HP you can crop and zoom any ware and you can see the image as you are doing it you CAN NOT DO THIS ON THE EPSON . My final disappointment with Epson 's 4 X 6 printer is that you have to buy the paper with the ink , what happens if you want a matte finish or a satin finish or a high gloss finish , with Epson you simply do n't have a choice . With the other 4 x 6 printers on the market -LRB- HP -RRB- you can buy your ink and your paper separately and you can choose you paper type . And the cost is no different HP has a package with ink and paper together that gives you the cost of 29 cents per print without having to print out a thumb nail page first , because you have the screen . One other really neat thing about the HP 375 is that you can get a battery for it that plugs into the bottom -LRB- does not add any size -RRB- and you can truly have a portable printer . I was so excited to see something from Epson , but they have a long way to go before they catch HP in 4 by 6 printers .
 I was so excited to get this printer for Christmas but then ... First of all , it wo n't print the entire picture - it always crops around the edges . Secondly , you can buy brand new ink but you only get about 10 good picture out of a cartridge and then it throws you error messages and tells you to buy a new cartridge . Thirdly , if you do n't use it everyday , the ink nozzel has to be cleaned about 10 times before it will print your picture with true colors . The was such a waste of $ 200.00 dollars . I should have just bought a better printer for my computer . Epson really made a poor product with this picturemate printer . Beware - if you buy you will only be disappointed . Best Buy wo n't even sell them anymore .
 This picturemate has been a total disaster . After printing just a few pictures the color on the photo turns to pink and yellow . Put in a new cartridge and it will work for a few photos and then the color turns funny again . Not only does it not print many photos with a true color image , but it is slow and the cartridge runs out of ink after a couple dozen photos . DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT !
 This printer does an absolutely beautiful job about 2 out of every 10 print tries . I 've printed less than 200 total copies . I 'm tired of seeing the `` general error '' message . Epson is of no help . Reinstalling the software gets me two great initial prints then the error message . The local repair facility wants $ 48 just to diagnose the problem . I can buy a new one for $ 79 , but I will not . I 'm stuck with three brand new ink/paper packages ... off to eBay they go .
 This printer does not interface properly with iPhoto . Wo n't print borderless photos . Printer also resizes photos so the picture you print is n't the one you see on screen . Also , getting nowhere near 100 photos per ink cartridge . VERY poor customer service . They blame the computer , the software , the camera , even the person who took the pictures but they refuse to acknowledge that their product may be flawed . Very disappointed .
 I tried my Picturemate for the first time last night and it malfunctioned almost immediately . It claims that it has a paper jam , but it does n't . I 've tried pushing `` OK '' to clear it as suggested , but this does nothing . It still insists it 's jammmed and refuses to operate . I 've tried the suggested `` troubleshooting '' to no avail , so I 'm now on hold for an estimated sixteen minutes with the Epson support center . All of this hassle for a brand new fussy appliance makes me wish I 'd gone with another brand . The few pictures I got out of it looked very good , but the macine took a few minutes to print each one , so even when it 's working , the machine is still flawed . I would strongly suggest another brand .
 It 's a neat little printer . It did print out several packs of pictures before developing a problem with printing at all . No longer `` recognized '' by my laptop , and this after uninstalling , downloading their latest drivers , reinstalling -LRB- 3x so far -RRB- and still no luck . Called their nice tech support who sent out a `` new '' -LRB- refurbished -RRB- machine and it , too , is not ` recognized ' and can not print from either my desktop or laptop . I 'm ` calling it a day ' with this frustrating little gem . I 'm looking for a good replacement .
 Ok I bought this for the supposedly long life of the ink . Then my dream were shattered by all the disclaimers . I have to live in a glass bubble to get those results.Then I noticed that the black when first printed looks absulotely great compared to my Canon 5000 but after 48 hours the black faded ? I 'm using Epson ink ? Whats up Epson you optimize your ink for store sales?Now I know why there are so many lawsuits to you over yoru claims.Very Disatisfied !
 Now , the SR705 is a beautiful receiver . I got one about a year ago and it was silent and clean running -LRB- warm ` though -RRB- . But about 2 months ago a HUM appeared and remained no matter what I did , including disconnecting EVERYTHING except one speaker and trying every other outlet in the house and turning off everything else in the house . Everything . I sent the unit back for repair and four weeks later it came back from the factory . The HUM was still there , as loud as ever , maybe louder . I 'm going to have to take it back again and probably exchange it for something else . It 's unusable as is . I 've researched the blogs -LSB- ... -RSB- and apparently -LRB- although I did n't know it before I bought the SR705 -RRB- this HUM problem has shown up on units more than a few months old . What 's wierd is , the factory ` fix ' did n't fix it at all .
 We bought an Onkyo receiver 705 from Amazon about a year ago . One month later the master volume control refused to work . And the shabby one totally denied to work about two and an half months ago . We were surprised to see its short life time . Fortunately it is still under warranty so we sent it back to DTR technologies which is the authorized customer service of Onkyo to get a fix . But we never knew it started a nightmare ever since . DTR technologies first called us to say our receiver got damaged on the shipping . The estimation of the damage is $ 200 . We agreed to cover that . Then one more month later , we were told that we need to pay another $ 208 more and Onkyo will not cover that . We denied to do it and chose to discard the unit . The whole repair process took us two and an half months , and it is very unpleasant and inefficient . Onkyo never considers its customers . As a summary , the product quality is not reliable and the customer service from Onkyo is definitely the worst one I ever met .
 I bought the TX-SR705 thinking it would convert my regular definition video from my DVD player and the low def channels from my cable to high definition . After trying to get it to work correctly for two weeks , I finally gave up and wrote to Onkyo tech support . What they said was that if I wanted to get the high definition feature , I needed to buy the SR875 or the next one above that -LRB- for $ $ $ -RRB- . I also had several issues with the lip sync changing from one day to the next . This was probably the biggest reason for returning the unit . I do n't mind setting the lip sync once but having to change it every day is a pain.On the plus side , the auto speaker setup was great and the surround sound -LRB- I have a 6.1 speaker setup -RRB- was great . Hopefully the Sony that I 'm replacing the Onkyo with will be equally as good.Bottom line
 Very prone to hum due to HDMI connections . With my old house wiring I did n't want to have all my equipment and the TV plugged into the same outlet but with this receiver such a setup can cause HDMI loops and will introduce ground loop hum . Supposedly the 805 does n't have that problem but I would stay away from Onkyo products due to this problem .
 I purchased this receiver 4 months ago . Started having some issues after a storm , mainly related to the remote control . After calling their customer service , I was told that I would have to ship the unit , and of course pay for it to a location in Corpus Christie , TX . -LRB- I live in Dallas -RRB- They were not helpful at all to me in solving the problem which was under warranty.Please think about it . Why would Onkyo choose a warranty repair facility in the farthest away location in Texas with a very small population when they could have chosen one with a much greater population concentration such as Dallas , Houston , etc. . I think they want you to not want to ship it , so basically NO WARRANTY!Onkyo 705 may be a good enough product , but if you need their warranty , you are out of luck .
 i bought this receiver a yr ago & it has already quit working -LRB- at the most inconvenient time ** , i might ad -RRB- it has to be shipped off to houston to be repaired , a real headache . i 've replaced it with a pioneer 7.1 receiver.i 'm 55 yrs old & i bought a pioneer receiver in 1974 , a sony receiver in 1984 , & a technics 5.1 receiver in 1998 , & they all still work & are being used today . Thanks `` onkyo '' for bringing 38 years * of uninterrupted listening to a halt , & i 'm sure pioneer thanks you for the sale also . * owned a sansui in 1970 ** football party , its pretty hummililating watching a football game on a 1080 hdtv with the tv sound
 I 've loved this Reciever , till about a month ago a low 60hz HUM appeared . It 's constant on all inputs -LRB- when signal is availble on digitals -RRB- and is the same level regardless of volume . I eliminated the ground loop possibility . It 's just under 2 yrs . old . I 've replaced it with a Denon . I 've yet to hear back from Onkyo on support , but will probably cost me shipping and take many weeks for repair . Anyone interested in a refubished unit about 2 months from now?I expected better .
 Price was right , lots of nice features but after a month it stopped passing 1080p video to the tv . Had to send it in to onkyo and it is going to take another month to fix it . Sounds like they 're backlogged fixing their junk ! I wish I 'd bought the Denon !
 The HDMI assembly board failed in a little over 3 years . Not worth fixing . Will buy another unit but not a Onkyo .
 I bought this receiver because the new technology was there , the price was right , and the reputation of the brand was solid . I did however read the warnings quite a few people were writing about this receiver
 SENT IT BACK . ALL THE ISSUES THAT YOU READ ABOUT WITH ONKYO CAME TRUE AFTER 3 WEEKS . GO WITH A YAMAHA . ONKYO MAY INCLUDE A LOT OF BELLS AND WHISTLES BUT THEY OBVIOUSLY CUT A LOT OF CORNERS . IS THERE A `` ZERO '' STAR ?
 I have purchased quite a few Onkyo receivers over the years , and have always been happy.I am now having issues with a friends , as well as mine.My friends has an intermittent issue with the Analog signal not passingout the HDMI cable . We 've taken it in twice , and ABL -LRB- Authorized Repairfacility in Michigan -RRB- ca n't get it to act up . I get it back home , and I can get it to fail . I called Onkyo , and basically there is NOTHING they will do . It 's under warranty ! They have an exchange policy if it 's Out of Warranty they told me . That 's frickin ' NUTS.I took my receiver in for a firmware update to fix the Custom naming bugwith the Game/TV input . With that input , earlier receivers had a delay before it showed your custom name . Now after I got it back , it shows the Custom Name for a second , then goes away . This now happens for ALL inputs . What the heck happened?I have pretty much lost faith in our local repair abilities . And since Onkyo will basically do nothing , if you have problems that ca n't be fixed , the warranty is pretty much useless .
 I bought this unit in 2007 , and it worked well for four years . That 's why it gets the second star.Then I started having problems with the HDMI inputs , and I put up with it for a year before shipping the box to Adam 's Electronics in Huntingdon Beach , the authorized West Coast dealer.At the time I shipped the unit out , HDMI input 1 was completely non-functional , and Input 2 would pass video but no audio . Input 3 was OK.My setup includes a Sony BRD , A new -LRB- 2012 -RRB- Apple TV , an Oppo DVD , and a Dish 622 DVR . I tried swapping different units to the multiple inputs , and I tried two different TV at the output , with the same results.Adams charges $ 80 minimum to take the box in . After a couple of days they called me to say that there was no problem found , and that all the units worked with their test setup.After I received the box back I found that the symptoms were now different
 My Onkyo 705 arrived quickly , but two of the three hdmi inputs would not work -LRB- all of my components worked fine when I switched them to the working input -RRB- . Considering the online polls at A/V Forum , which indicate almost 30 % of purchasers have had some problem with one of the new models -LRB- 605 , 705 , or 805 -RRB- , such as bad inputs , clicking , humming , and/or overheating , I would think twice about ordering these . By the way , the other 70 % of purchasers seem quite happy , so take your shot if you feel lucky .
 When comparing to a pioneer vx27thx it does not have the sound quality you I would have expected for hdmi connections and 7.1 sound.The clarity was just not there even with a blue ray player.It did not have the crispness or bass for quality sound reproduction even with all klipsch speakers it was not good.The only good thing was the microphone that eases the speaker calibration.Thank God that amazons return policy is THE BEST !!!!!
 I have a TX-SR705 with the terrible HUMMM problem . The noise started 2 weeks ago , about a year after I bought it . I hear a low level hum in all speakers on all channels -LRB- DVD , CBL , AUX , GAME , etc. -RRB- . Seens to be a huge sistemic problem with + / - 1 year of operation in a lot of units .
 I got this receiver in Sept 07 and here it is July 4 and I have problems . Two of the three HDMI input ports do not function . The third ports sometimes works . I have reset and reprogrammed this thing repeatedly . I installed a DSP firmware upgrade with no benefit . I emailed Onkyo who sent me to warranty repair . I do have a local repair center but the delay for repair is four weeks , maybe six weeks maybe longer . The repair shop said there are lots of units in for repair . I again contacted Onkyo but got no reply to my complaint of a long wait . I found scattered similar complaints on Google.Until it failed on me , I had enjoyed this unit . I liked the computerized sound field setup . I like others found it a little weak in loudness.I can not recommend this unit.Onkyo TX-SR705 7.1 Channel Home Theater Receiver -LRB- Black -RRB- I have owned many stereo receivers and this is the first one to fail like this .
 Tried and tried and tried uploading from a Mac . While I had no problem uploading , none of the photos appeared on the frame . Called tech support -LRB- which , incidentally , is in the Philippines -RRB- and , despite the fact that the manual clearly mentions Mac support , was told that Mac is not supported . He referred me to a FAQ , which does not mention the issue at all -LRB- their on-line support says to call Customer Support ! -RRB- I asked to speak to a supervisor who said that it can be used with a Mac and she talked me through it -LRB- the same way I had done it -RRB- but still no photos showed . Fortunately -LRB- ? -RRB- I have a PC and , using the Photo Manager software -LRB- PC only -RRB- I had no problem . So , if you only have a Mac , forget it .
 Good : - Great picture quality . - Just plug in a SD from your camera and it displays the pictures fine , no need to configure anything or resize pictures . - The embedded software offers great features , especially the photo transitions.Bad : - The flash based autorun software on the CD does not launch the installer or documentation links on Vista . Exiting the software Vista tells you that next time it will run the software in compatibility mode . - The photo manager software is very poor . Slow to respond , difficult to use , ca n't delete pictures or albums , returning a cryptic error in poor English that there is not enough space . Avoid the photo manager software and just copy pictures directly to the SD card . - 2GB Kingston SD card was not accessible from Vista , but the frame displayed the pictures on the card fine . A 1GB SD card worked fine . - 4GB Kingston SD card hanged the frame software . A 1GB SD card worked fine.Conclusion : The image quality is excellent , but the photo manager software can be SD card incompatibility is disappointing .
 I read every review that I could and finally picked the Phillips 8 '' even though it was more expensive due to the poor write ups the other digital picture frames were receiving . I agree totally with everyone that the transfer software from the PC is a piece of junk . Very poor for such a well known company . Even with all that , I was ready to keep the frame but within two days the leg which swivals to allow a landscape or portrait view , failed and the frame would not even stand up . I am in the process of returning the frame to Amazon now . To their credit , since I bought this as a gift for my wife , they have extended the return period to Jan 31 , 2007 .
 I ordered this frame to give it for xmas to my parents . Once i 've received it , i was surprised by the impressive size of the box -LRB- i thought amazon had shipped a slow cooker instead - slightly exaggerating -RRB- which was a nightmare to bring with me to Europe . Anyway , the design of the box is nice and pretty ` design ' , so i forced myself not to complain too much.Comes Christmas day . My parents open the box and love it . They were always complaining that they never really had a chance to browse their thousands of digital pictures . Here was the perfect tool for this.I demo it by taking the SD card from their digital camera and instantly watch the pictures on the frame . Even I was amazed by the simplicity of the process -LRB- open the camera , take the SD card off , shove it in the frame and switch on > instant slideshow -RRB- Once all the presents open , we decide to transfer the pictures from the PC on to the Frame -LRB- actually , on a Sandisk 128 SD card i had stuck in the slot -RRB- . So we install the software that comes with the frame on a CD -LRB- PC only -RRB- . I have to say that the Flash User Guide is pretty neat . But the Philips Frame Software to transfer the pics is the WORST PIECE OF SOFTWARE EVER.i 'm pretty good at computers , but this was beyond human understanding . You would expect a simple dual-panel interface , one to visualize the images on your PC and the other one to check the ones that are transfered on the frame . Or just thumbnails of the photos on your PC with a checkbox besides each one to choose the ones you want to transfer , with a graphic showing the space available on the SD card . Has anyone checked iPhoto , Aperture , LightRoom , Adobe Bridge , Picasa , Flickr , Moo ... the good examples of great photo management softwares are everywhere . The one provided by Philips feels like it is 1995 again -LRB- no exaggeration here -RRB- . It was just impossible for us to select the images to transfer , using the Philips software . And i work in design and i 'm pretty proficient with computers , so i ca n't imagine a lambda user.So I found a workaround . Selecting the pictures in the regular File Explorer in Widows and copy them in a Folder on the Desktop , then transfer this folder -LRB- good luck to find the desktop in the Philips Software -RRB- via the Philips Software . IT NEVER WORKED ! The application kept crashing after 10 pictures , or 12 , or 17 . Never ever we could transfer more than 10 % of the selected pics.After -LRB- honestly -RRB- 4 hours , i decided to burn a CD with the pics , shove it in my Mac -LRB- Powerbook -RRB- and connect the frame to my Mac . Using a simple drag and drop , i managed to copy the first 10 images and then the copy froze , and after a couple of minutes , the frame was squeaking like a mouse stuck on a glue-trap . That was so so scary . I disconnected the frame but it kept making the spooky noise . My only option was to reset the frame , using a pen to press the small Reset button.I tried over and over and over , it kept doing the same
 I did much reasearch prior to purchasing this product . I trusted Phillips to provide a `` quality product . '' I was disappointed to find that features did not work -LRB- alarm , auto on/off , amoung others . -RRB- I also had very poor service when I called Phillips customer service help line . After several hours of explaination and working with tech support they finally told me to return it . I had to pay the postage to send the product back to Phillips . To top it all off I was sent a replacement frame that had a `` white '' frame '' not the original `` wood '' frame that I ordered . When I called to report this issue I was told that it was Phillips policy to replace products with similiar ones and I was going to have to accept the fame that was sent to me.So much for keeping the customer happy !

 you gave the wrong bag to me , it donot fit in the camera.i am very disappointed.Please do not repeat this with any other customer atleast.thanks
 Info was even wrong on Canon website . Too small for my A620
 The Canon PSC-65 Deluxe Soft Case is listed as being 4.7 x 3.0 x 1.9 However the actual measured dimesnions are 4.0 x 3.0 x 1.6 While it will probably fit the following cameras which all use 2 AA cellsA550 3.6 x 2.5 x 1.7 inA560 3.6 x 2.5 x 1.7 inA570IS 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.7 inA700 3.7 x 2.6 x 1.7 inA710IS 3.8 x 2.6 x 1.6 inIt will absolutly not fit the following which use 4 AA cellsA630 4.3 x 2.6 x 1.9 inA640 4.3 x 2.6 x 1.9 inWith the A630 in the case the velcro on the flap will only engage 0.2 inches of the mating velcro on the mesh pocket and then only if thereis nothing in the pocket . If even one AA battery is in the mesh pocketthe velcro will not engage at all.If the case would have fit , I could have given it a 4 or 5 .
 So simply , this case does not fit well to the Canon powershot A630 and all similar models . Its good and cheap but very uncomfortable to carry such a wide camera .
 You can put only your digital cam , not enough space for your reserve batteries . . After 2 months the writing `` cannon powershot '' in front of the case will be ereased . .
 If you have a Canon A630 as I do , it not a desirable case . It like a woman who like to wear tight blue jeans . You can just barely button it up . Forget about carrying extra batteries or extra SD memory cards .
 The case is advertised for a Canon A630 , but it does n't fit well .
 it is small for a 630 camera . and it does nt have a belt for the neck . it is hard to carry unless you carry at your belt
 This is a dissapointment for me the Case is too small for the camera it is intended for , once the camera is forced in there is no room for anything else and I mean NO room
 The case is nice but will only fit the camera . I have a Canon A630 and the camera fits nicely in the case but ca n't fit any extra 's . Like batteries .
 There 's very little room here for anything other than your camera , so if you need to carry anything else , go for something better -LRB- Samsonite makes some decent , inexpensive cases with multiple zip pockets -RRB- . The extra pouch on this thing does n't have any closing mechanism -LRB- zipper or velcro -RRB- , so when you take out the camera , anything else you 're carrying -LRB- batteries , etc. -RRB- will rattle around loose and fall out if you 're not careful . Ca n't tell you how many times I 've dropped my extra batteries.Also , there 's no carry strap , which most other camera cases -LRB- even small ones in this price range -RRB- come with .
 I got this case along with A630 since the product description mentioned that it is compatible with the A630 . However , this case is just too small and the camera does not fit into the case . This product is not compatible with the A630 .
 The camera case is just large enough to hold the camera . But you will probably want room for your SD card , spare batteries , the data transfer cord , and possibly other things . This case will pretty much only hold the camera . I suggest taking your new camera to a few retailers and inspecting the goods in person . You may also find the prices more to your liking than buying Canon-branded accessories .
 There is very little of ` Deluxe ' about this case . It is somewhat ordinary and cheap-looking , and functionally poor . It is rather small for the size of the camera it is supposed to house . Recommendation
 I have the camera canon A630 and really it does not fit . I feel defrauded for amazon because he recommends her for this model of camera .
 Wish I 'd read the reviews before I added this to my cart . Without a strap , it 's just another thing to hold , so I 'm using my older generic case which I can sling over my shoulder . The belt loop does n't help if I 'm wearing a dress!Shipping it back would cost almost as much as the case itself , so I 'll just let it sit here on the junk pile . Blech .
 I recently purchased a Canon A710 . I looked at several generic digital camera cases first , but I decided to buy one that was made for the camera.This case is compact - so compact that part of the camera is exposed when the cover is tightly closed.There is only one pocket , with room for a memory card , but not the extra AA batteries that you will need .
 This case is way too small for the A630 . You can barely get the velcro clasp to close and the hole for the wrist strap is in the wrong place . I have another Canon camera , a 610 I think , and it fits fine , but this is the wrong case for the 630 .
 We bought this camera case as part of a package for our camera -LRB- Canon PowerShot A540 . -RRB- We were very disappointed in the quality . It is rather cheap in appearance , and has poor utility in that when you open the case to take the camera out , whatever is in the accessory pocket -LRB- spare batteries , memory cards -RRB- is not secured and falls out . -LRB- We ended up going to Best Buy and purchased a Lowepro case that has a zippered compartment for the camera , a separate pocket with velcro flap for accessories and a smaller zippered pocket on the flap for memory cards , money , etc. . Cost of the Lowepro was about $ 11.00 . -RRB- We do n't recommend that you include the Canon PSC-65 Deluxe Softcase in your camera purchase . It 's a waste of your money .
 This softcase sucks as cases go . One big compartment to put everything in . Not soft on inside . No place for spare batteries or memory cards . Xippers do go all the way up to totally close case . I went back to using and old case until I find a better one .
 I was disappointed as I read this to be a water proof camera bag . The sides of this bag do not cover the camera nevertheless the camera would not be protected from water , sand or anything else .
 The camera was Dead out of Box Canon A 640 . So returned the case .
 This case does not fit the A630 . I 'm sure it 's great -LRB- that 's why I gave it two stars -RRB- , but only when you buy it for a smaller camera . I had heartache when I ordered it , because it simply did n't fit ! I hope no one makes the same mistake I did .
 Only 6 months after I bought it , the belt loop came off the case . No warning either , the camera just dropped to the ground and all the threads were out .
 I bought an A630 camera and this case to go with it but when I got the items it turns out the camera barely fits in the case . You have to stretch the material to secure the velcro . They need to make it a little bit bigger for that model . Other than that , I got what I paid for ...
 is too small for canon a620 , about 1 cm of the body of the camera stays outside of the case . So , save your money , buy another a little bigger.Nice quality , useless .
 Do n't buy this case . It 's too small to store anything other than the camera . No room for spare batteries or SD card !
 This case was recommended for use with my Canon Powershot A630 . It barely closed over the camera and would n't hold spare batteries . Do n't waste your time or money .
 This is wasted money to buy . It is a very tight fit and no extra room for batteries or SD cards . Why bother ? Go to Walmart and you can buy something much better and cheaper !
 The case is too small for the camera it was purchased for . It would probably work great for a smaller more compact camera .
 I must agree with Mary and the others . This is not a good fit for the A630 . It barely allows the velcro to meet , and forget carrying extra batteries or even a memory card . Amazon should edit the models this case is suited for . I 'll use it until I can find a better one locally .
 Even though the product description states that the case is compatible with A630 's ... it IS N'T ! You can barely fit the A630 in . I think this case is better designed for A510/520s . So owners of A630s BEWARE !
 Bought this for a Canon A620 . Too small for this camera . Ca n't fit camera much less anything else .
 You can just fit the camera . Its very hard to fit even 2 batteries with it .
 Even though Amazon 's computer will throw this case out there as a suitable option for the A710IS , DO N'T BUY IT ! It is too small . I 've thrown away my packaging , so I ca n't return it .
 The case is too small for my A630 and it does n't look like the one shown in the picture . The lid can barely be closed and no room for anything else . I am very disappointed at this product .
 The A630 barely fits into this bag . Please do not buy this if you are buying A630 or a similar sized camera .
 This case was advertised as a case for A640 , but it will not let you to close a flap with camera in . It may fit other models but it definitely will NOT fit A640 .
 The introduction to this case says it suits A630 . But it does not . Even if I do not put extra battery , A630 is hard to be put into the case .
 This product lists the A640 as one it works with . It does n't . Not even a tight fit . Just flat out does n't fit.But , since it costs more to return it than throw it away , I 'm stuck with it now .
 looks good , but has only 2Watt power . Way less then build in laptop speakers . . complete waste of money and technology , but looks good though .
 The speakers have a nice design and are easy to handle . Practical , quick set up , nice travel case . However they sound tinny , if one turns the volume up the membrane starts to distort , the sound is thin and has no body . I would n't recommend this product .
 I am not particularly happy with the product . The sound is really tinny and cracks up midway up the volume range . The audio performance should have been better with a speaker priced close to $ 80 . The only benefit is that it runs on USB as well , but then the sound output drops to half . Overall , will not recommend to others .
 While Altec Lansing makes great speakers , I was a bit disappointed with these as they lacked `` power '' and volume . Now it could be the sound card of the laptop I hooked them up to itself but I know when I plug in my Bose noise canceling headphones , I get tons of volume and rich sound.I 've held on to the speakers but to be honest , after using them once or twice , I 've tucked them away in a closet and have n't used them yet .
 I purchased these speakers to be used with PowerPoint video presentations to a limited number of attendees , so I was not looking for super-powerful speakers , which not surprisingly , these certainly are not.The setup was puzzling , as the new Lenovo Windows 7 did not recognize the USB audio output , necessitating 20 minutes of Control Panel > Sound setup -LRB- I am not quite sure how I got them to finally work - scary -RRB- . The troubling issue is the cost ! at $ 175 , I was expecting higher-output , higher quality speakers . My old Dell desktop give-away speakers seem to be as good as these , you know , the ones that seem to stack up with all the old computers one seems to have over the years . But , I love the tiny carrying case , and ease of traveling with these , so i will keep them . Seems like they would be worth maybe $ 30 tops , certainly not $ 175 .
 In terms of portability , these speakers are excellent . They plug into a USB port -LRB- PC or Mac -RRB- , from which they are supplied with both power and the audio signal . This means that no power cord or audio cable is needed . The right speaker has the USB cable and the left speaker plugs into the right speaker with a retractable 3 foot cord . So overall they are very portable and quick to set up.In terms of sound quality , they are good in most ways , but extremely poor in one key area . They have crisp treble , proper mid , and bass down to about 80Hz . Also , they are plenty loud for a portable speaker system . Their sound quality problem is that the bass is extremely over-boosted in upper bass frequencies , which are bass frequencies that NO-ONE likes to hear boosted . Also , the bass easily distorts in bassy songs . These bass problems make for very poor overall sound quality that is annoying to listen to.This speaker system has some really useful features that many other portable speaker systems do n't . They can be plugged in with a supplied power adapter so that your computer does n't have to supply the power -LRB- useful for laptops -RRB- , they have an aux input so that any audio device can be connected to them -LRB- and the speakers come with the correct cable for connecting devices to the aux input -RRB- , and they have a subwoofer output for a subwoofer sold by Altec Lansing . They also have bass and treble adjustments , but the adjustments are barely perceivable . Also , the speaker system comes with a carry case in which all the components fit.This speaker system has some great features that many other portable speakers do n't have , and with the exception of the bass problems , the sound quality is great . But , due to the over-boosted and distorting bass , I would not recommend this system .
 Sometimes you 'd like some music for a group where you do n't have a formal music set-up . These laptop speakers do a nice job . On a vacation in Italy , all the laptop music , even from the internet , was ringing out . Good volume and tone.Update
 Definitely too expensive to be such a disappointing product . If you 're looking for loud , keep looking . I wanted more volume from my Dell Vostro 1500 for watching movies . This was $ 50 down the drain .
 These monolights -LRB- 300i -RRB- are just about equal with any other self-contained monolight on the market -LRB- i.e. alien bees , photogenics , etc. -RRB- . They provide accurate , consistant lighting and have a pretty good build quality . But their quality is overshadowed by little flaws that equal big problems . Number one problem is the built-in slave needs LOTS of light to trigger the unit . In fact , if you are shooting anywhere with celings higher than 10 feet or without any sort of bright walls around your primary flash , you will need some sort of EXTRA triggering mechanism . Second problem is standard items such as umbrellas can not be used while the reflectors are attached . This is a drawback because there is no protection for the flash tube besides the 3 inch buffer the reflectors provide between the flash tube and anything that might touch it . Be prepared to purchase many replacement tubes if you do location shoots . Lastly , be prepared to purchase new light stands if you need to elevate your units more than half the height of the stands provided . The weight of the unit creates an unsteady setup at any height above say 5 feet . And that 's WITHOUT accessories like softboxes and such . In short , the units are good for in-studio shoots , but be prepared to `` accessorize '' if you want a traveling light set .
 I bought two of these cartridges and they worked ok for what I used them for -LRB- printing shipping labels -RRB- so I went ahead and bought six more . What a mistake . Three only worked for one printing and when I would try to use the next day it was like they were out of ink . The other three would have to go throught a clean nozzell step each time I used them until I finally got fed up and whet out and bought the Lexmark for twice the price but no aggravation.It seems like a waste of time to rate an ink cartridge but I was once told by my Grandpap that `` you get what you pay for '' and believe me he was a man that knew what he was talking about only I was a person that did n't listen . I 'm here to tell you to buy the cartridge suggested by the manufacturer.Thanks for your time . Country Joe from PA
 While this printer functions satisfactorily and the network printing feature is nice , it 's ink use makes it an unacceptable long-term solution.As far as functionality goes , all of this machine 's functionality is satisfactory and solid , though a bit slow . Getting it set up was straightforward and at first , I thought this printer was great . There were no stellar performances for any functionality and the build quality is not great , but for the price I was quite satisfied.The horrible part is the ink usage . Even while off and not in use , the printer seems to clean itself obsessively . This cleaning uses ink , so after a couple of months of no printing , you are out of ink ! When any ink cartridge runs out you can not do anything except receive faxes to memory . -LRB- There is a workaround to the no functionality problem involving placing black electrical tape over the ink reflection matrix on the ink cartridge , but this does not solve the ink-use problem . -RRB- The worst part is that even with the excessive self-cleaning , just 18 months after I purchased the printer I can no longer print black . It seems that the print head is clogged , as numerous cleanings do nothing . The troubleshooting guide says to call Brother , and I can only guess this means spending nearly what I paid for the machine in the first place to get it cleaned . Horrible design , Brother . I could stand for purchasing ink more often than I might like , but to have the thing clog despite the constant cleaning is not acceptable.In summary , the functionality is good for the price , but the unbelievably bad ink usage forces me to say do NOT buy this printer .
 The MFC 5440CN purported to have all of the features I could want
 Do not buy it if you do n't like going to get ink once a month . And guess what if you do not have ink you ca n't fax or scan either .
 The printer does n't work when one of the inks is empty . This is ridiculous considering that for an average user this situation could happen every month . The product is practically unusable . Do not recommend for home or small office use .
 I own a Brother MFC-3820CN , which I believe is the predecessor to the model presented on this page . I just wanted to alert potential buyers to a problem that I encountered and which many reviewers here may not have had a chance to experience.First of all , I am a very light user and chose the Brother because of the network-able feature and because of the price . I really never used it very much and had problems with the ink from the beginning . Most recently , I replaced the ink because it was showing the empty ink message . Even after replacing the ink cartridges , the error message still shows . The problem is that the machine does n't work at all with the error message showing . I could not even send a fax even though doing so requires no ink . The machine will not revert to black and white if one cartridge is empty -- it just wo n't work . I really am not going to spend the money -LRB- about half the cost of the machine -RRB- required to replace the cartridges again . I called the help line and the response I got was that the representative was sorry and could refer me to a service center . As most of you are aware , the price of a new one really makes having one serviced a non-starter so I was left somewhat dissatisfied by the whole experience .
 After purchasing this useless doorstop to use with my G3 imac w / OSX 10.2.8 , it took forever to figure out a work-around to get the printer installed when the setup instructions gave no guidance about Brother 's ` Device Selector ' program , which pops up every time you restart , asking for an ip address . Wasted over an hour on the phone with tech support , only to be told that d.s. was only a useless annoyance that served no purpose , but since the tech had no knowledge of how to determine the ip address of the ` printer ' , I would just have to live with the annoyance . Printed nice quality on plain paper , except that it printed everything IN MIRROR IMAGE . Driver update to correct that , once installed , rendered the printer invisible to the system . Tech could n't figure that out either , then advised that he would have to have the mac ` expert ' call me back . THE NEXT DAY . The best part was when the tech suggested I should just forego network printing , and just stick to USB if I wanted the printer to actually work . Promises , promises-was looking forward to using what appeared to be a full featured multi-function printer , ended up shipping it back . Do n't waste your time with this clunker !
 I had the twin of this model , the 420CN . The only difference between the 2 is the 420CN has a photo center which at the time I thought was a great deal so I would n't have to kneel down and plug my digital camera into the back of my computer . Now I 've found out that there are devices you can purchase that will do this . The 5440CN has a better resolution scanner , larger capacity document feed and a faster fax modem . These are the biggest differences . I had bought the 420CN . It gave me error messages after installing the ink cartridges . I called Brother tech support in case I was doing something wrong . They walked me throught the process again and confirmed the unit was defective . They offered to send me out another one immediately and I could return the defective unit via Fedex . The replacement model looked refurbished . It came in a plain cardboard box with no advertising stickers on the unit like a new one has . So did I pay full retail price for a refurbished unit ? But this is the BIG PROBLEM !!!!!! I 'm not happy with the quality of the scanner after using it . The retailer will not return the unit because it is not in ORIGINAL PACKAGING !!! I informed Brother of this situation and told them I would like to get one of THEIR units , the 5440CN instead of the 420CN which is the same price . They would not swap it !!! They said they only swap out defective models for the same model number !! Their actions , however , sending me a refurbished unit as a replacement unit for a brand new one is an OUTRAGE !!! Because of this I can not return this unit which is less than a week old back to the retailer !! I 'm considering Small claims court against a corporation . Think twice no three times at least before buying from Brother on second thought do n't buy at all from them . If they treat a brand new customer like this how do you think they are going to treat you down the line ???
 Check out the reviews of older Brother MFC units . They have a serious problem with ink consumption that is intentionally designed to force customers to buy unnecessary ink cartridges . I suspect that this problem remains in the newer models . Due to a self-cleaning function , the Brother machines constantly use up ink by sqirting small amounts through the inkhead . So , even if you NEVER print in color , the color ink cartridges will run dry in a few months . You are then forced to but new cartridges because the machine will not print at all if any one of the four cartridges is `` empty . '' The self-cleaning function can not be disabled.Most people use black ink most of the time . They will be surprised , therefore , to find that they actually have to buy color cartridges just to keep printing in black . Another problem is that the machines often sense that a cartridge is empty when it is still half full . No matter , it shuts down the machine . You have to replace the cartrige.Some people claim to have gotten around this problem by using black electrical tape to cover the area of the cartridge that is viewed by the ink-sensing LED light.Beware of Brother ! Do n't buy unless you confirm that this problem has been corrected by Brother .
 I was really tickled to find an all-in-one with so many capabilities at such a great price . I am easy on equipment , so the cheap feel did n't bother me . I had a bunch of stuff to fax and it even faxed legal documents with ease . Copying was great and printing was okay , but not as crisp and clean as the HP it replaced . It began to take longer and longer for it to start printing and when it turned into days , I deleted the printer setup and added a new printer . Worked at first then took longer and longer again . Called tech support when an interium document failed to print and they told me to delete the setup -LRB- with the document -RRB- and add a printer . Second call I was told there was a problem with my laptop although this was the only problem peripheral including several other printers . The end of the line was trying to print 30 standard business envelopes - the first 5 -LRB- acceptable looking , but not good -RRB- took 3 hours with 15 trashed even feeding them 1 at a time . In the next 3 hours , I returned the MFC-5440CN and bought a networkable HP at about twice the price -LRB- but what is the cost of fighting with the printer and tech support -RRB- .
 The product works okay in fax , print and copy modes . The scanner will not function . I called Brother support , went thru the drill and was told that this was being escalated to the next level and I would receive a call back the next day . After waiting at home for 2 days , I called Brother again . This time they were able to contact the next level , I went back thru the drill , added a number of new steps and was told that it would need to be escalated to level 7 -LRB- ? -RRB- and I would be called back in the next 2 days . Again I waited at home for 2 days with no call back . I emailed them , received an email back promising that I would be called in the next 2 days . Again waited and no call . Another email , promised same day . No call . I sent a final email stating that I would be writing this review if I received no call back . NO email or call . If you get a working product , it may be a good deal , but if you have any problems , you will receive nothing but empty promises and have a non working machine . Scanning is the function I use most often on this computer , so I have to buy another product , which will not be another Brother .
 My Brother MFC has been sitting in attic for over a year now . As other reviewers have mentioned the printer wo n't even print black ink document if printer is out of any other color ink . Other than this another big problem is the printhead . If you ever need to change printhead which you will over time -LRB- in many cases less than a year -RRB- , it may cost you twice the price of new printer and then labor extra as its a dealer only item . I have been through all this.After lots of research I bought a LEXMARK X1185 , I am very satisfied with it . I can print a black ink document even without inserting a color ink cartiage . The other big + is that in Lexmark printers the printhead is part of ink cartiage . For over a year I have been refilling the same black ink cartiage that came with the machine , and so far it has been working perfectly , the day this printhead gets clogged I 'll buy another ink cartiage and it will have printhead on it . And my printer will be kind of new all over again.Update . . April 2010 ... For over a year now I have bought and been using SAMSUNG ML-2510 MONO LASER PRINTER . For under 50 bucks I find it to be a A + laser printer . Toner ink for the same is very cheap and can be bought from eBay .
 The printing is fine . The ink usage is as other people have stated , it is completely absurd . Brother has outdone themselves with this piece of garbage ... I print with color so infrequently , maybe 10 pages total in the time that I 've owned this printer -LRB- about a year -RRB- have been color and I 've had to replace the color cartridges on numerous occasions . Also , it should be noted that the printer identifies the cartridge as being out of ink when the cartridge gets to approximately half empty . Another issue is that when any of the cartridges is `` empty , '' NONE of the printer 's functions work until you replace that cartridge -LRB- including faxing and scanning -RRB- forcing you to spend more money on Brother products or never use your printer again . I will never , EVER buy another Brother printer . This is the second one I have owned and the other one was a piece of garbage , too .
 My wife purchased this device for our business office in Feb of 2005 . My first thoughts were very good , as we have had Brother printing / faxing devices all along and had years of reliable affordable service from them . This model did it all , it faxed , it scanned , it copied , it printed , there is a phone and it even hooked up to our network ! Delight soon turned to dread as the MFC 5440cn did none of these things well -LRB- maybe this is not completely fair as I do n't believe we ever scanned anything -RRB- . This unit has the most flimsy paper tray I 've ever seen , highly proned to paper jams , the ink is expensive , very slow printing , always beeping because of an often un-determined problem and I 've had more problems faxing and recieving a fax than ever . It does look nice , but my in business it must be dependable . Maybe this multi functional unit is better off in home use . I 've relieved this unit of it 's duties and TRASHED IT . Now the miserty of `` will it work '' is over . I do n't know what we 'll buy next but it wo n't be another MFC 5440cn .
 Networking breaks constantly , requiring a complete reinstall of the bloated software on each computer . On CNET somebody said the programmer should be placed on trial for war crimes . After many years of suffering , into the trash it goes -LRB- would n't be fair to sell it on Craigslist -RRB- . Otherwise , I liked it . The ink cartridges are reasonably priced and easy to refill .
 The black ink works after just 18 months , cleaning many times , try ahcohol to clean it , still not working , had to throw whole set away , very bad product , I will never buy any Brother product again.The design is that when any ink run out , you can not do anyting , and even you do not use , the ink dry itself , -LRB- it cleaning every few days by itself , using your inks -RRB- .
 I bought this printer last year and was excited in the begining because of the network feature . My excitement faded away when I started using this printer . Printer quality is ok even if you use the best quality option .
 The unit lasted about a year of VERY LIGHT usage . The blank ink just stopped printing .
 This printer was very frustrating ... until I figured out how to `` beat the system '' . When I could not figure out why the color cartridges kept running out , -LRB- when we do n't EVER print anything in color -RRB- I called Brother technical support to no avail . They pretty much told me that the color cartridges were -LRB- somehow -RRB- used in the spooling process , so they had to be full in order for any of the features to work properly . Then I had an idea . I did n't know if it would work , but I had nothing to loose . This is what I did
 Scans fine , prints ok . Have n't really noticed the obsessive self cleaning or abnormally high ink usage but I HAVE only successfully printed about 20 % of the envelopes I have tried to print -LRB- about 20 out of 100 !! -RRB- -- I even went for the more expensive `` for inkjet use '' envelopes thinking it was the cheap ones I was using that was jamming it . 1 prints fine -LRB- although not necessarily first -RRB- , 2 come out , but they are smeared and printed on a slant , and then 2 just jam up completely . It is about to go out the window ... I could live w / the cumbersome loading of envelopes -LRB- and 1 at a time -RRB- , but then for it to either ruin or eat them is infuriating .
 Incredibly poor user 's Manual . Nothing on how to use the scanner function -LRB- refers you the CD -- most multi-use machines have a very easy to use scanning function -- NOT this one!Paper jams easily.Response time is slow.Printing quality has been the least satisfactory of any I 've evwer used . I 'm planning to use the rest of the ink supply , toss this machine , and return to a more dependable multi-purpose device brand .
 I purchased this machine for use in a small business , and though less than a year has passed since purchasing it , we have been forced to requst replacement units twice already.It suffers from constant paper jams , apparently both because of proximity of the paper feed to the output tray , and -LRB- more frequently -RRB- in the feed mechanism at the back . Even after the paper is removed , the printer generally dos not recognize the jam is cleared and must be power cycled to reset it -LRB- and before cycling , to wait several minutes for the print head to reset itself into idle mode -RRB- . The print head also jammed several times , these jams necesitating the replacement of the unit . Customer service at Brother replaced our unit both times , but only after a process considerably more laborious than my experiences with other printer manufacturers -LRB- ie Epson and HP -RRB- . When working , the printer was a great buy for the price , with easy-to-use controls and out-of-the-box functionality . However , its various problems disabled it such a large amount of the time that these benefits were overshadowed.If you 're looking for a low-end all-in-one machine that you 'll be using fairly heavily , look elsewhere . We 've had better luck with sheet-fed HPs , which seem to jam considerably less .
 The print quality is good , but it uses all colors when printing -LRB- even though we only print in ` black ' -RRB- . Then when one of the colors gets low -LRB- about once a month or so -RRB- it wo n't print incoming faxes anymore - even though you have plenty of black ink !!! I absolutely dislike this machine and will never purchase another brother product like this one ... unless I hit the lottery and feel like blowing all my cash on colored ink that I never see .
 BIG Mistake . Poor color quality printing -LRB- not at all similar to the original paper -RRB- . Drinks ink non-stop . will not function at all if any of the ink is empty . Keeps giving `` NO INK '' messages , after I just replaced all inks . Not a good machine even for the money .
 This is a nice printer - with one deal-breaker
 A money pit is right ! This printer just is n't worth it . There were at least 3 times where I bought ink and even though I only used the printer 3 or 4 times over the course of 4 or 5 months , the ink was gone and I 'd have to buy refills again ! It appears the ink must be allowed to evaporate somehow , and furthermore if you run out of one color the whole printer is useless until you refil it ! Regardless of whether you 're printing in B&W ; ! Do n't waste your money on this ; there are much better printers out there .
 I 'm not exactly sure why the `` Spotlight '' reviews for this printer are so positive . Take everyone else 's word for it - This printer sucks . I made the mistake of buying 5440 and the 5840 for my business . I can deal with all the paper jams just fine . But the one thing that makes these printers terrible is how alarmingly often you will have to buy printer cartridges for this machine . Make no mistake - this is a money pit.Don ' t fall for that nonsense about `` saving money because you can buy each color individually . '' This printer uses the color cartridges even when you 're printing in B&W ; ! AND all the cartridges slowly deplete over time even when you have n't printed anything at all -LRB- they call it `` self-cleaning '' -RRB- . And how does Brother add insult to injury ? If ANY of the cartridges runs out of ink , it is absolutely impossible to perform any functions until you have purchased a new cartridge and replaced it . Want to send a fax ? Too bad , because you 're out of Yellow ink ! Want to print a single sheet in B&W ; ? Do n't even try it until you 've bought another Magenta!My 5840 died on me after about 5 months . The paper feeder just stopped working , and despite the fact that it was well within the warranty period , I did n't even bother getting it fixed . I did n't WANT it to be working . It was costing me that much money . Do not buy this printer .
 This would probably be adequate for very low-volume usage . The paper tray does n't hold very much at a time . The construction is a little flimsy . The machine itself has performed well , but BEWARE ... if you have any kind of significant volume , you will pay through the nose on the cartridges because you have to replace the color cartridges whether you use them or not . We are a high-volume department which receives faxes throughout the day . We use this as a black-and-white fax machine only , we do NOT use the color function at all , yet every single time we replace the black cartridge , within the next 3-5 days we have to replace the magenta and cyan !! -LRB- We have not yet had to replace the yellow . -RRB- In the three months we have had this machine , we have had to replace 10 black , 8 cyan , and 7 magenta cartridges -- almost $ 400 worth in all -- despite NEVER using the color feature at all . So where 's the cyan and magenta ink going ??! Apparently , Brother has worked out a way to make it use magenta and cyan along with the black , even if you 're not using the color feature.That 's the big caveat of this machine . And you must replace the empty magenta and cyan cartridges when prompted , or else the machine will not work . Based on these figures we will spend $ 1600 this year on cartridges for this machine . That 's not a bargain and I would much rather have our old fax-film fax machine back or a plain b/w one that uses toner .
 This printer wastes ink and shuts down when ink runs low . You ca n't even send a fax if you run out of one of the inks . Also , mine shows that the ink is empty when there is actually ink left.I recommend a printer from a vendor that is working to help you and your business , noe one that * seems * to be focused on getting you to buy un-needed ink.You can , however , put black electrical tape over part of the cartridge to continue printing and faxing when it claims ink cartridges are empty .
 This printer seems great at first , but will annoy you to death in the long term . The main issues are :1 -RRB- - NOTHING - on the printer works once the printer is out of ink . You ca n't send faxes , scan , or print B+W if any one of the ink colors is out .2 -RRB- The printer believes ink cartridges are empty long before they are . I have just removed a yellow cartridge with at least 1/3 of the ink left which the printer refuses to use .3 -RRB- The printer uses LOTS of ink to clean itself several times a day .4 -RRB- Print quality degrades over time - look for choppy/streaky blacks in the first 6 months .5 -RRB- Network support is completely undocumented and poorly supported .6 -RRB- Technical support , even web-based , is horrible and useless.Do not buy this printer .
 In case you do n't believe the rest of the reviewers , this printer is HORRENDOUS !!!! Brother has done a great job at creating a scam with their ink cartridges . Hopefully , people have caught on and have decided to ditch this piece of JUNK ! My ink cartridges were still semi full when the printer prompted me to change cartridges ... like an idiot and because I needed to print , I went to the store and bought cartridges for $ 50 ! Way overpriced for the print quality you get from Brother . Shame on Brother for scamming consumers and making such a lousy printer . They may have scammed us once but Brother has shot themselves in the foot by losing many customers . I will never buy any other Brother brand product . Brother has no idea what relationship marketing is , it seems obvious they are just after making the one transaction and not about keeping their customers happy . I bought this because it had a pretty good rebate ... a year ago I only paid about $ 80 , still way too much money for this piece of CRAP ! So to all looking to purchasing a printer , stick to HP , at least they do n't scam you as much with their ink cartridges !
 I 'm sorry to have to write a negative comment , but the Brother co. deserves it . Most of the bad reviews above are true . I will add one more
 Purchased this machine about 6 months ago . It worked great until about 2 weeks ago . The red ink stopped printing . The Brother repair shop thinks it 's either a bad print head or a faulty circuit board - he 's unsure as to which ... Yes , it 's covered under warranty , but I 'm reluctant to keep it after repairs . I probably printed less than 2 reams of paper before the problem started . Fax works very good ; Scanner works OK but the paper port software is mickey mouse . B&W copy speed on best quality is slow , on normal quality it 's slightly better . I will probably sell on Ebay at a loss , count my blessings and buy the Canon Pixma that I debated on before the Brother purchase .
 I bought this printer less than a month ago and its already not working right . The paper keeps jamming.The paper tray is jammed and wo n't come out of the printer . I tried using the other paper feed and I get the same response that the paper is jammed . I wish I had paid attention to the amazon reviewer who mentioned the paper jam problem . This is my first and last time buying Brother .
 I 've had problems with my MFC printer since the day I purchased it . First , I had problems connecting to the printer over my network . The IP address constantly resets and my laptop fails to recognize the printer 4 out of 5 times . This requires me to re-start the printer , reset the printer 's network configuration and then re-start my laptop.The copy resolution is terrible . They all turn out blurry and fuzzy - even after numerous attempts to correct the resolution through the printer head alignment feature . This problem has never gone away , thus rendering the copying feature worthless.The ink runs out very quickly and the printer does a poor job of sensing when the ink is running low . Often , the printer thought the ink was about to run out when in actuality there 's sufficient ink left . The problem is that once the printer thinks the ink is low , you ca n't do anything until the ink is replaced . Therefore , I rarely use the machine as a printer.To top it all off , about 1 1/2 years after purchasing this machine , I received a `` Failed to Init . '' message which means that the printer has a mechanical issue that needs fixing . The printer is completely unusable until this problem is fixed - costing more than the cost of a new one.I decided to purchase a Canon MX-700 -LRB- for ~ $ 100 -RRB- and love it . This Canon machine is everything I was hoping for in an all-in-one printer . I will never purchase another Brother product again .
 Do n't know why but it would n't accept commands from my Lanc controller to do slow Zooms . Full speed or nothing . Strange .
 i would thoroughly enjoy having replaced this cable from the one my cats chewed to a slow death if it would ever show the eff up . USPS sucks .
 The product description implied that it would prevent your lap from heating up when using a laptop . HOwever , it does not do this . It needs some modification , like maybe a layer of foam to keep the surface cool .
 I 'm so disappointed . I used to have this exact model about 4 years ago , but they stopped making it , instead making the model that 's most commonly available today . I was thrilled when I saw this model and snatched it up ; well , something changed because it 's flimsier than I remember . After only two uses , the plastic hole that holds the metal piece which props the whole thing open snapped , rendering the product useless for anything but flat-surface use . Sent it back . Guess I 'm going to have to be content with the newer version which is clunkier and has pads that do n't really grip the laptop . Damn .
 My company pruchased this unit 2 months ago . During a Board presentation the projector went down . We determined that it was a bad bulb and that I would get a new one . At first i thought Infocus had great customer service until i was told continuously that I would have a bulb shipped `` next week '' . I heard this for two months , calling twice a week . Finally , i asked to talk to the manager when they told me the bulbs were still not in . Miraciously they came up with one . What are the odds of that ????? I was getting the run-around . Very suprised by this . I thought they were a reputable company .
 For a case with a Nikon logo on it , it does n't fit particularly well . Its on the small side , and does n't have a shoulder strap . With this camera , you 've got ta carry an extra batter , and the bag fits way too tight once you 've stuck an extra batter in the front zipper compartment . I 'd recommend getter a bigger , better aftermarket bag , like a Tamrac .
 This case looks good , but that 's it the 4300 will not fit as it should . the fit is so tight the camara must be squesed in the case , then try to take it out , it 's like trying to take off a too tight boot , by the time you get it out the shot is gone.and also moves your settings , turns on or off your camara , toss in an extra battery and your stuck . The zipper will not close . But do n't worry the seams start to unravel and split.What a waste of money . Nikon stands for quality , but not here .
 The quality of the camera case is adequate . However , it is simply too small to fit the Nikon CoolPix 4300 . I must actually force the camera into the case . I think instead of making a case to fit this camera , Nikon simply adopted the case used for the CoolPix 2000 . Too bad the case is n't in the same league as the camera - which is fantastic . I 'm now shopping for a slightly larger case to protect my investment .

 I 'm not disparaging Nikon here ; they make terrific product , but I also think this case is just too small for my Coolpix 4300 . It 's terrific quality and extremely rugged -LRB- love the extra compartmnent for memory cards , too -RRB- , but the setting and power dials consistently shift when sliding the camera in/out of the case . Rather annoying when trying to take a quick picture as I always have to check my settings first . I returned for a replacement , thinking that perhaps the case was defective , but the others were small as well .

 The case is too small for my Nickon CoolPix 4300 . I have to apply force / squeeze it in and out , which I do n't want to do . First time when I try to take the camera out , the camera lens cover got stuck inside the case . I do n't want to break my camera and hence I returned the case and purchased a bigger one .
 love the 4300 camera ; hate the pricey bag/case ... the plastic hook broke the first day ... cheap ... still usable to protect camera , though I keep mine double protected , in this and a larger Nikon bag/case .
 Nice case until the clip broke after a few months . I still used it with half the clip intact until the other half broke a year later . Remember when things used to last for decades rather than months ?
 Items bought through Amazon.com can not be evaluated . This item cost double because of shipping , and I thought i was getting a package of five . I got one . Check out the single with a $ 25 shipping fee ! The Russian scammer in my neighborhood sells them for $ 5.00 and NYC tax . Another consumer rip-off . Do not even try Worst-Buy !
 BEWARE WHEN U ORDER . WHEN I PURCHASED , IT WAS PRESSED AS PAIR ON THE AID . BY THE TIME I RECIEVED JUST ONLY ONE PIECE . CA N'T TRUST .
 When one selects the `` MB '' or `` Groove '' options on this piece of garbage , the sound distorts . After two weeks , sound stopped coming from the left earphone . One week after that , the `` sound '' button that allows you to select `` MB '' or `` Groove '' stopped working , so at that point , you ca n't even distort the sound if you wanted to !!! I never dropped or mishandled this piece of junk . Even if I did , when brand new , the sound quality still stunk and the anti-skip leaves much to be desired . Stay away !!!
 This CD player is so cheap . It skips for no reason . and the batteries last about 5 minutes
 i got this disc man for christmas and i was very dissapointed ... at first i was happy , it looks good , its thin , light and its a cool overall looking discman , the reason i gave it 2 stars was because of the esp2 , already having the reg esp , i thought this would be much better , but it turns out that this esp2 works worse then the reg esp ! the discman will even skip for no reason when i have it sitting on a table , i wwas very dissapointed with the product ... sometimes SOMETIMES it 'll even work better when the esp is off!i only gave it 2 stars cause the battery life is very good , but not woth buying cause that 's more time with the annoying esp2
 I took this on my Mexico vacation and for the first day -LRB- 2 dives -RRB- and it worked fantastic . The pictures turned out far better than I could have imagined . But , on the first dive the second day it started to leak at 45 feet and destroyed the camera . Fortunately most of the pics were rescued . I have no idea why it failed as I followed all the instructions to the letter . I sent my camera and case back to Canon and they said they would repair both at no cost . We 'll see what happens .
 Small , easy to use and excellent picture quality when it worked . I have owned an Olympus Stylus Zoom for two years . Around the the end of the first year , it began having spurious light leaks . Just recently , a problem with rewinding made it necessary to open the camera and lose half of my pictures . Since then , the LCD readout has stopped working , so the exposure number and flash control are blanked out . I have to replace the camera , and am looking at other manufacturers .
 This is less than a `` budget '' speaker , this is junk . Do not waste your money on this , or the JBL that Amazon.com calls `` mid-priced . '' It is also junk . The starting point in your search for speakers should be the NHT that is listed `` best . '' This is a very good speaker , one that will give you hours of enjoyment . I guarantee that if you buy this KLH speaker , you will tire of it quickly , but think that you are merely bored with `` stereo . '' You are really the victim of bad , bad stereo equipment .
 I ca n't attest to the sound of these speakers because I never got to use them . The orignial pair I ordered arrived damaged , as did the replacement pair . The factory packing is so poor that the probability of them withstanding shipment of any distance without damage seems remote . Amazon was very good about refunding my money , but this was a major hassle . Check with Amazon about packing before ordering .
 this would have been useful , perhaps , if it were ever delivered .
 This is my second review on this seller and his products . The first one had to do with a Lexmark printer that I purchased -LRB- see Review -RRB- and now the good deal on the 16/26 dual pack cartridges . I was looking for inkjets and wanted the 16/26 , because you get a lot more printed pages per cartridge . So , when I saw the price at targetpc , I thought , what a deal , The problem , I was n't sent the 16/26 cartridges , I received the 17/27 . These are the cartridges that are included with the printer you purchase , except when I purchased my printer from this same seller the 17/27 cartridges had been removed . So when this purchase arrived and they were not what I thought I had ordered , I went back to the site of the dual pack 16/26 and there it is the compatible 17/27 . They are compatible with the Lexmark printer , but they are not comparable with the 16/26 . The page printing count is about 1/3 of the 16/26 . So , I have finally learned my lesson and I am here to say that I have put this seller on my permanent -LRB- do not buy from this seller list -RRB- . It is my fault for not noticing it was the same seller I had purchased my printer from and also for not reading all the lines of text , but if you are looking for a pair of pink sandals , size 8 and up pops a site with the size , color and style you are looking for and a seller is there on that site saying yes we have them at a great price and they are compatible to the size 8 , BUT they are size 5 . This seller has no business popping up on a site for a size 8 if they do n't have a size 8 . And I am sorry , but they are not compatible . I have learned no matter what the picture shows or what the reveiwers write , read what the seller is actually selling , because your size 8 feet wo n't fit in the size 5 pink sandals . I do admit that things can be missed . I said it was possible that I had missed the detail of the inkjets being removed in my review of the printer . The seller and I went back and forth on that , but I think the bottom line is a feeling of being fooled . I have purchased a lot of things on Amazon and I have written reveiws on several of them , but this is the only seller , that has made me feel foolish . Frustrated but I finally get it.-Catherine
 I would never recomment that anyone purchase any replacement cartridges other than ORIGINAL LEXMARK CARTRIDGES . These cartridges did n't even last a month , and the print quality was horrible .
 I orered both catridges and the color cartridge was not recognised and the black smeared as it printed . They sent me two new ones and the black cartridge ran out of ink after just a few pages . Dont watse your money
 If the description here is correct , this set is completely crippled compared to other Panazonic models . It is said it will only read DVD - R written on other Panasonic recorders -LRB- !!! -RRB- and that it can only write to and read DVD - R. Panasonic used to make recorders limited to writing DVD - R , but since then has produced sets that can write to DVD - R DVD + R and DVD - RW . Why the jump backwards ? I 've never heard of any model that can only read DVD - R produced by recorders only of the same brand . This is absurd!The price listed is also about double wha it should be.Add all this to the other complaints and it 's avoid at all costs.I incidentally own a Panasonic with a 80 GB hard disk and have recorded many hundreds of hours to the HD and made hundreds of DVDs without a problem.Anyway , I would n't buy ANY DVD recorder now unless it has an ATSC tuner included . Otherwise it becomes obsolete in two years when analogue TV is supposed to disappear.Manufacturers , including Panasonic , are making sets with the digital tuners for the European market . Why not in the USA ?
 I have an older version , DMR-E80H , 80gig , with the old navigator -LRB- pre-TV guide -RRB- , which I love.I bought the DMR-E95H , 160 gig , tvguide navigator , mainly because I wanted more disk space . I was going to sell my older one . Unfortunately , this is so unreliable that I have kept my old one to use , and I 'm stuck with this very expensive lemon . I would n't feel right trying to sell this to someone else.There is a lot of good ideas and potential here , but most of it does n't work reliably , and what does is poorly done . Many nice features in the original navigator are gone.What do I miss about the original navigator ? I works like a VCR with some cool features . You program in a show -LRB- date , time , speed , repeat , etc -RRB- , you can also add a title so you always know what you recorded . You can also set it for ` renew ' which means it records over the old space each day , good for things like the news , it wo n't fill up the disk and you do n't have delete things to make space . You can go in and edit any of this , say a show is on a different time one week , just go change the time , and then change it back . And if one show overlapped another , you could select the one with priority , but the other would record the rest of the alotted time.On the new navigator , you can manually set it to record instead of using the tv guide functionality , but you ca n't edit after the fact . If you make a mistake , you have to start over , if the time changes , you have to delete it , set a new record program with all the info , and then do it again to put it back to the normal time after . If you just want to change the record speed , you have to redo everything . If you want it start late , because the ABC shows are all running late these days , you ca n't edit it , you have to start over.There is no longer a renew feature . And if the first show overlapps with the second , you only get the first and nothing of the second.Why do I use the timer record instead of tvguide , because it 's a good idea but a useless unreliable piece of junk . The booklet tells you that you ca n't start a show the same time another show is ending , ie if a show ends at 9Pm and another starts at 9PM , the second wo n't record . On occasion it does , usually it does n't , no rhyme or reason . So I set everything to end one minute early , requiring the timer setting.Now , if you forget to turn the recorder off at night , or you 're up late watching it , it does n't pull down the programing and when you record something you get no title . But you ca n't just set the title you want when you set up the recording like on the old navigator . But the tvguide system does n't even have all the main channels ... it 's missing some of the HBOs , SHOtimes , Starz , etc.The tvguide interface is crap . I have hundreds of channels , and if I were to use that to see what was on it would take all day . You ca n't page through the channels , you ca n't hold the down button and just cruise through the channels . No ! You have to repeatedly hit the down or up button to go through the guide . Talk about carpal tunnel syndrome . And to make matters worse , each time you go to a new channel it changes the station being viewed and freezes up while doing so , making the whole process take longer and making it impossible to view one show while looking to see what else is on . Sometimes if you hit the buttons real fast you can go over 4-5 channels before it happens , but it still happens . They should talk to Comcast about how to do an online shedule viewer . Even their worst versions where better than this . There is no search function . You can go to the alphabetical sort screen , but if you want something at the end of the Ms , you have to go through it one item at a time , over and over and over.All that would be bearable if the system was reliable , it is not . My old system has only crashed a couple of times in 2 years , and went into `` self check '' as soon as it came on . This new system -LRB- less than a year old -RRB- crashes at least once a week , and I have to force it into `` self check '' to repair itself , usually twice , and then turn it off and on again , in order to get it to work right for awhile . It freezes for no apparent reason , not recording but on . You ca n't change the channel , cause it thinks it 's recording , but it 's not , and it 's on the wrong channel anyways . They only way out is to go through the process of holding the on -LRB- on the recorder -RRB- down for at least 20 seconds so it shuts off . Then turn it on so it starts system check fixing what ever is wrong , again . I went away for a week , and came back to find it had frozen on the second show it was to record and had done nothing after that.I bought this for more disk space , and I 've discovered it acts the most unrealiable if I use more than 100gig , which is a little more than half the disk . It also acts up more if I record and watch and delete a lot of shows , the reason you 'd have it to begin with . It also tends to crash/freeze more often if I leave a disk in the dvd tray . For a couple of months I could reliably make it crash by putting a ram disk in the system , and then it did it only every other time , but it looks like it 's moving into every time again.I wrote to Panasonic , who said to take it to an authorized repair dealer , but there are none around here . I bought it through Amazon , but through one of their third parties who does n't take returns . So it looks like I 'm stuck with this crap.I regret having recommended Panasonics to so many people I know , but that was the old style of course . To say I 'm dissapointed in the system is to say the least . To say I 'm disgusted that panasonic wo n't replace it or refund , is really disgusting .
 Based on other reviews here , we decided to hook up the machine directly to cable and skip the cable box , sacrificing our digital channel lineup for now since we hardly watch any of those channels.On our first attempt to download listings by hooking up the machine and leaving it off overnight , we received 7 sets of listings from our zip code , when in fact there are 9 sets if one consults www.tvguide.com . Naturally , our lineup is one of the missing two . Panasonic 's tech support says they would put in a `` template request '' for our lineup with TV Guide and get back to us within 2 business days . Still waiting , 4 days later . Called today and got a very rude support person who said `` keep waiting . `` Even worse , when I performed the laborious process of setting up all the channels myself , the next time we left the machine off to download new information , it WIPED OUT all the work I had done and put it back to the `` select one of these 7 lineups or no match page . '' The first tech support person I talked to said , `` Yes , we 've heard reports that this happens sometimes . '' There 's no solution for the bug and no firmware fix . This may be a problem ONLY WHEN you can not select a channel lineup and have to pick `` No match . '' I do n't know.I also found online a suggestion to reset the TV Guide settings and try again `` from scratch '' by holding down the up and down channel keys on the front of the machine -LRB- not the remote -RRB- to wipe out the TV Guide information . DO N'T DO THIS !!! Now , when I turn the machine on each morning , instead of giving me even the 7 channel lineups I saw before , it says something like , `` Attempt to download listings failed . Please make sure you have the cables connected properly . '' This , despite the fact that nothing has changed about how the machine is hooked up . Today 's tech support person said , `` Maybe this is a TV Guide problem too '' and would not offer any further assistance . I think there is something wrong with the machine in this regard.One other solution offered was to `` try another zip code '' -- wo n't work for us because we live way out in the country and our cable provider is local ; no other provider in a neighboring community is going to have this same lineup . And the last solution , which we will try this weekend , is to hook up the machine WITH the cable box . The tech said that sometimes the machine can find the listings on the cable box itself instead of downloading them directly from TV Guide . This sounds iffy to me because of all the people who have said the machine tries to download even with a cable box in the mix , but we 'll give it a shot.Recording works great , quality is great , and transferring taped content onto the hard drive and editing same is very easy . My overall review
 I bought this recorder from Buy.com and it worked for about 60 days . Then the U99 code started and the unit became worthless . I wanted it replaced not repaired . Now it is in the repair shop for a couple of months . I will never buy Panasonic again . What a piece of junk !
 As I am writing this , my DMR-E95H is in continual reboot mode after I tried to burn a DVD and it apparently does not like the media . Panasonic 's customer support is non-existent . They ignore emails and the toll free support number is always busy . After reading several different forums I find that I am not the only one extremely disappointed with Panasonic . Several others have unpacked their brand new unit only to find it DOA . Those who have tried to take their unit to a service center have horror stories of waiting weeks for a fix only to get it home and find that it still has problems.When the unit is working it is slow , the menus are badly organized , the functions are awful . Sometimes one must press ` return ' to leave a function , other times ` stop ' is required . The program menu is a complete disaster and makes the user develop blisters to press enough keys to page through selections . This unit is simply the most horrendous piece of consumer electronics I have ever purchased.Actually , considering all the problems and lack of support , I am considering reporting Panasonic to the Texas Attorney General and Better Business Bereau . Maybe TechTV . Heck , anyone ! This is the most ripped-off I have felt in years . I paid enough for a top of the line product and am stuck with a total lemon .
 Before you even think one second about buying a Panasonic DVD Recorder , just type `` Panasonic U99 error '' into your favorite search engine and you will find hundreds of complaints about software errors with Panasonic DVD Recorders . They tried to send a firmware `` upgrade '' through the cable signal and it ended up locking up machines and making them inoperable . When you call Panasonic and sit on hold for two hours , the person who finally answers acts as if they 've never heard of the problem and they give you totally useless information . I can only hope my credit card company will honor an extended warranty , otherwise I have a $ 500 paperweight . AWFUL !!!!!
 This is the first review of a product I have ever written but felt I needed to warn others . DO N'T BUY THESE THINGS ... THEY ARE JUNK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My unit has to be unplugged at least once a week for a reset due to a lockup . It wo n't even eject the disk at times because it is locked up -LRB- especially since the automatic firmware upgrade was made -RRB- . I have spoken to Panasonic about the issue and as others have stated , they know nothing about these problems . They suggested I hold down the channel up and down buttons simultaneously to perform resets . That does n't work and why should I have to perform `` resets '' in the first place . I literally have to unplug this piece of junk and let it reset . If anyone out there is a lawyer who deals with class actions , I would be willing to sign up . Anyone else ?????????? If you want to buy a quality DVD recorder look to Pionner and not Panasonic .
 I bought this DVR with the full knowledge of all the problems people have had with it . Just do a google search on Panasonic U99 -LRB- there are websites dedicated to the E85 and E95 problems -RRB- . But I thought enough time had passed and Panasonic had fixed all those problems , so it could n't still be an issue . WRONG.I 've had the box 6 weeks . In 6 weeks I 've only had one successful programmed recording . I 've had to reformat the hard drive about every week -LRB- not on purpose -RRB- . I 've upgraded the firmware -LRB- they do have good instructions on how to do this on Panasonic 's website -RRB- , done hard resets -LRB- hold down the Channel Up and Down keys simultaneouly till it shuts down -RRB- , unplugged it , etc. . BTW , the production date is 05/26/2004 , so they may have fixed the problem with newer models . One of the many websites I mentioned will tell you how to view your production date and firmware version.Of course , the 3rd party seller -LRB- through Amazon -RRB- has a 30-day return policy , and it 's too late to return it . I called Panasonic , and they do have a 1 year warranty . They have referred me to one of their service providers to fix it . But we 'll see how long it takes me to get a new or different model.I want to love this DVR . The TV Guide feature works perfectly -LRB- although it is a little bit of a pain to change the channel sorting -RRB- . The recording and playback functions are easy to use , and overall I would be extremely happy with the product . Except for the morning after , when I 'm ready to watch my recorded shows , and it says `` An error has occurred '' . Then when you hit enter , it shuts down and when you turn it back on it wants to Format your drive.UPDATE
 I bought this based on the glowing review in `` Sound and Vision . `` The machine is supposed to work with your cable converter box . I have never been able to get it to work with my Scientific Atlanta converter box . Technical support has given me contradictory explanations , with some telling me that it does not work with my box , and another telling me that it is supposed to.The machine is supposed to set its clock by a PBS station . Because I can not set it up to work with the converter box , this does not work . Unfortunately the clock runs slow , and loses a minute a week . You must re-set the clock manually.If you attempt to record anything on the hard drive onto a defective DVD , the entire unit shuts down , and you have to go through set up again . According to their technical support , there are a lot of bad disks out there . They say not to purchase those on spindles . They have no explanation for why a bad disk causes the machine to shut down and require going through the set up procedure.I have made numerous calls to technical support . Everytime I have called I get a recording that they are experiencing unusually heavy call volume , and a recommendation to call back at a later time . Wait times of about an hour are typical.In frustration , I sent them an email , asking them to call me at work and explain why I should not post my poor experiences with the product on Amazon . They sent me a reply telling me that I had to call them.Given the large number of people on this site with similar experiences , I understand why they were not worried .
 This thing sucks . there is little else to say other than there is a class action lawsuit somewhere here . PANASONIC this is FRAUD !!!!! Or outright robbery . No support . Does NOT work . I say anyone who has had success with this unit is probably lying or a plant from panasonic . Errors all the time and never loads the TV Guide BS . Just a giant waste of money !!! If there were an option for no stars I would have used that . Amazon should not even be selling this . It is not fair to loyal customers .
 I purchased one of the first panasonic dvr with the lifetime membership . When the HD went out and replaced , it was a expensive repair . The second one quit . My son replaced the HD and opening the unit found the HD encased with foam . Overheating ????? yes ! Programing soon became a problem . Panasonic support is terrible . I would never buy a panasonic product again.Had a comcast dvr , not a good product . Called Comcast regarding using TiVo with the cards that need to be installed and they said I had to upgrade my services . Called TIVO , you do not need to upgrade and they will do a 3way call with comcast when you set up your unit for the cards . MJS
 Yes , this is a big problem with these units . -LRB- ... -RRB- I hope that somewhere they are able to fix this , otherwise , this machine really is junk . I get U99 twice a day approximately when TV Guide downloads the programming . I bought this from Buy.Com about 60 days ago . It worked great until the last couple of weeks .
 The panasonic dmr-e95h is useless.So is the tech support from Panasonic.I will NEVER buy ANY panasonic product again.Tech can not supply answers.To any questions.At all.They are at best barely fuctioning dopes without the slightest interest in helping.This is after waiting 45 minutes.The firmware updates do not work.The item does not work as described.It has more bugs than a swamp in Floridia.It is more sensitive than a movie stars ego.There should be a website devoted to how useless all of these panasonic dvd recorders.What a waste of money WATCH OUT !!!!!
 I purchased my DMR-E95HS online and received a defective unit -LRB- apparently a very common hard drive problem -RRB- . My first mistake was not returning the unit and , as requested by Panasonic , delivering it to one of their authorized service retailers . It 's been several weeks and the service center is still showing the parts as on backorder . Panasonic 's customer support center has not been helpful in the slightest . If you have an issue make sure you call customer support early in their workday , because I had two instances where they had stopped answering their phones before their listed closing hours . Now I 'm stuck waiting for a unit that will take who-knows-how-long to get the parts , and , given the experiences of others I am unlikely to get a unit that works properly.I highly recommend avoiding this unit and the Panasonic brand .
 I have owned this model since March 2005 . Almost all of the time the TV Guide has n't worked -LRB- I have heard this might be a ploy by my cable company to push people to their DVDRs -RRB- . At any rate I gave up on this feature.For the first year the unit had a tendency to go to `` SELF TEST '' whenever I changed disks , either DVD-R or DVD-RAM . After `` SELF TEST '' it almost always burned a good disk . This would have been OK excepte for wasting 15-30 minutes every time this happened . I stuck to major brand disks . Panasonic will tell you to use their disks but they are not easy to find in stores and do n't come in large muffins so they tend to be expensive.Surprisingly , at the 1-year point the unit started working perfectly . I went from March 2006 to August without a `` SELF TEST '' . Today it refused to recognise the same disks it had been burning for weeks . So I will have to take it in on the extended warranty.Panasonic customer service is terrible . Do n't waste your time phoning . You will be on hold forever . About a year ago I wrote Panasonic and received a call eventually -LRB- still in the warranty period -RRB- . They wo n't acknowledge that there is a systematic problem with this unit . They try to blame it on the disks . They also would not make any adjustment other than offer to sell me another unit at a discount.I like most things about the user interface . It allows very precise editing . When it works it produces great disks . The hard disk holds a lot.Forget about the lousy TV Guide feature !
 I 've had my unit since february , and have recorded a lot of tv with it . In the last month I have been getting the U99 errors very frequently . This happens when the unit is downloading tvguide information , and the error is very stupid - it prevents the unit from doing anything -LRB- recording a scheduled program -RRB- , so when this error occurs , e95 becomes a $ 750 paper weight.This occurs with ALL panasonic units with TVGUIDE . AVOID PANASONIC DVRS !!!!!!!
 I had the unit for one month . All of a sudden , it would not play or record any disks . I had to take it to the only repair shop Panasonic authorized `` in my area '' 35 miles away . They had it for 3 1/2 months . I spent numerous hours calling Panasonic also , most of which was spent on `` HOLD '' -LRB- your current wait time is 90 minutes ... -RRB- . They will tell you it can only play Panasonic brand disks . Now that I have had it just over a year -LRB- and just past warranty -RRB- it will not play most of my home-recorded disks , even the panasonic brand ones , and it will not record from a disk to the hard drive . The programming function is tedious and time consuming . Instructions on how to set up with extensive other media are non-existent . In this day and age , everyone has VCR , DVD , TV , cable/satellite box , etc. and no one wants to tell you how to hook them all together ! On the phone I was told `` you just ca n't do that '' . I am very disappointed in the product , their phone `` help '' line , and their repair service . I will never buy another Panasonic product .
 I love the concept of this product but the Panasonic implemetation is WEAK ! I originally purchased a DMR-E80 and it worked very well long enough to get past the one year warrenty then failed . I was told that the logic card needed to be replaced for $ 300 parts plus labor . A little shopping around on the net abnd I found the DME-E95H -LRB- twice the disk space -RRB- could be had for $ 360 from Beach Camera.The E95 did n't make it out of warrenty before failing . The unit was mailed to a service center and it was repaired . I have had the unit for about two months since the repair and it has started to exhibit the same symptoms as before.Symptom
 I 've had my DMR-E95H since March and it continues to have problems . I have spent hours on the phone with Panasonics tech support -LRB- what a waste of time that is -RRB- , and even had to send the unit in for repair . I was getting the dreaded U99 error . Well , I got the unit back about two weeks ago and now I get absolutely no TV guide listings and every hour or so while I am watching something , the unit just shuts itself off . Panasonic really needs to rethink it 's engineering of this product and should apologize to all the folks that already wasted good money on this piece of crap . Do n't buy this one , look at the other manufacturers .
 I ordered these two RAM memory chips to upgrade speed for a computer we use in our church sanctuary to generate visual images as well as some audio during our Sunday morning worship . After one week of good performance -LRB- approximately one hour ! -RRB- The computer crashed and I was unable to re-boot . Taking the CPU to a computer service shop , I learned -LRB- after paying for their diagnosis -RRB- that these were burned ... no good ... cause of my problem ! Asked what I should do , I was advised to replace the CPU ! Highly unsatisfactory !!! EDGE - Memory - 128 MB - DIMM 168-pin - SDRAM - 133 MHz / PC133 - 3.3 V - unbuffered - non-ECC
 It 's funny I 'm writing this review even though I bought this camera maybe 8 years ago.At the time is was good . 1.2 MP ! Ca n't beat a 1.2 MP camera these days ! ... oh wait ... nevermind.Buy a newer one .
 Amazon seems to have found its waterloo . The complaints about the 5pack price with the one pack delivery are out there . I ordered the 5 pack thinking that by now things would have been straightened up . Well , they have NOT . I ordered the 5 pack . I received the one keyboard and was charged for the 5 pack . When i contacted customer service they cheerily said send it back . Well i did n't want to return it I wanted the 5 PACK just like it is offered . I run a busy office and this should have been a good deal for a great keyboard . Instead , it turned out to be several worthless emails and one very unsatisfying telephone call . Sorry Amazon ... I usually love you but you FLUNKED this one .
 I love this keyboard and have been only using this keyboard since at least 2001 . It is sturdy and does n't have extra features , it is n't wireless , and it is a bit of a quirky key layout that bothers some people -LRB- the arrow keys are smaller than on many keyboards -RRB- - but I love it.The reason for my low rating on this product is not on the keyboard , but on this actual sales page.It says that this is a 5 pack of keyboards , and when I ordered it , a single keyboard came . I sent it back to Amazon , they apologized and said they would send the proper 5 pack . They then sent me another single keyboard . I sent it back , they refunded my money , and I bought the 5 pack elsewhere.Hopefully that is all resolved now , but after talking to other people who have had similar issues with Amazon when buying multi-packs and only getting a single unit - be wary.I love Amazon and buy a ton of stuff from them , and will continue to do so , but I will not be buying multi-packs from them .
 I tried twice to order this item . Apparently there 's a problem on the warehouse end -- both times only one keyboard arrived . If this item is actually a five-pack , then the DC needs to correct which item is delivered when this item is ordered . If it 's * not * a five-pack , somebody needs to correct the description -LRB- and the price ! -RRB- in the database , or delete the entry entirely.Oh , and the topper was when my * second * complaint email received this gem in reply
 Idk what the problem is and why they can not get this together . I received only one keyboard and paid over 100.00 for a 5 pack . What is the problem ??
 I bought exactly the same keyboard at a local computer store for about $ 15 dollars . Who is paying > $ 100 for this keyboard ? This is an unbelievable rip-off .
 It has been 11 days since I ordered the camera . I have not seen it yet . I can not find a phone number to contact the store or obtain any customer service . It is not a good deal or a good product when you do not receive any service or the product .
 The picture quality is great but if you 're interested in the zoom feature , look somewhere else . The camera does not even zoom to what you can see with your naked eye .
 I have purchased this camera in 1999 . I have used it for a few times . The pictures came out great . However , it did not work like 13 months later . When I moved the shell to turn the camera on , it did not turn on at all . I can hear the motor is running . But it was not working at all . Since it is already over one year old , I have to pay to get fixed . It will cost me like almost a hundred dollars . I just bought another camera then . I was disappointed that it did not last as long I want it to .
 We bought this camera 1 year ago and it does take great pictures , but it has 1 major flaw . The lens cover which slides over the lens has a bearing and a spring under it which serve as the mechanism which holds the lens open or closed and tells the camera whether to retract the lens to off position or leave it out for a photo . The mechanism gave out on our camera and upon taking it to a store for repair the service rep. says he sees the same problem a few times a week and that it is so common that he is having a hard time getting replacement parts . This causes the lens to suddenly retract as you are about to take a pictue at random intervals . I know two other people that have the same camera and the same problem . It appears to be a design flaw in the whole Epic line of cameras . It is around 70-80 dollars to fix and for that you might as well buy a new camera .
 Great camera as long as it works . The lense cover slide broke after about a year . I got it fixed and it broke again after 6 months
 We have had two of these cameras now , and they both failed in the same area . They both worked for about a year , then they would not load the film any longer . When you close the film door , the motor will spin , but the drum that is supposed to advance the film does not turn . We liked the size and style of the camera so much that when the first one failed , we bought another one thinking it was just bad luck . We will be replacing it with a different brand .
 I bought this camera for my wife . She wanted a tiny but reliable camera so I read all reviews here and got it . But when I picked up the first printed pictures , I was really disappointed . Was it a problem of mine ? I think the picture quality is the most important feature . It is not sharp at all . My wife used to have cheaper -LRB- no zoom -RRB- Canon but she lost it . I think that made much better picture . If it did n't , I would n't have purchased autofocus camera again . I suspected Zoom function . The moving of lens part looks unstable . But I am not sure whether it is the problem of particulary my camera or whole products . I just think I did n't need a small camera with zoom function at all .
 Did n't even make it through a single roll of film before the lens snapped off
 I was so excited about purchasing my first zoom camera . In the past I have only used cameras with the max purchase price of -LSB- amt -RSB- . Needless to say , it only made it through about 3 rolls of film . This only took about 7 months , it certainly was n't overworked . I am so disappointed , they are more expensive to fix than they are worth . You are better off with a disposable .
 DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA . It is defective . I bought 3 of these cameras Dec 2001 . Within a year they broke . The lens jams and will not extend on the camera ... it happened to all 3 of my Olympus 80 cameras . This is a design flaw common to this series of Olympus cameras . If you buy this camera you will be sorry ... if you already bought this camera ... you are sorry now .
 Camera arrived without the batteries we needed . Once the camera was loaded withbatteries and film , it would not opperate . . at all . The manual that was included was not helpful . We will have to send this refurbished camera back . A dissatisfying christrmas gift .
 i really wanted to buy this one but the problem is i am curious on where this camera is made . it is not written in the product specs & in the ` see it in action ' part , it can not be tilted downward so that i can see whether its made in u.s. or japan etc. i dont want to end up buying something that is made in china .
 I loved this camera , for the total of two months I had it , before it broke on me on Halloween . I returned it and they replaced it with another , only to have it break on Thanksgiving ! It was great , but unless you want to have your precious memories ruined by a broken camera , DO N'T BUY IT !!!
 At first I really loved this camera ; it took great quality photos and the best part was that it was cute and compact ... I really loved the design . But after 2 years of use , it 's rewind mechanism suddenly stopped working , and I do n't think it was dropped or mishandled in any way . It usually has automatic rewind feature , but one day , it made a funny whirring noise as it `` rewinded '' when in actuality it did n't rewind at all.Needless to say , I opened the cover to take out the film and the roll was ruined from the light exposure . I was very disappointed not only because the camera broke , but because I lost some great photos . The repair shop told me it would cost -LSB- $ $ $ -RSB- to repair , I did n't think it was worth it so I 'm now searching for a more reliable camera . I do n't think I will buy another Olympus camera for a long time to come .
 I have always owned olympus cameras , and they have never caused me trouble . So I was extremely excited to try out the Epic Zoom 80 . I am sorry to say it left me EXTREMELY disappointed . The lens cover mechanism broke off of my camera , like has happened to many owners , according to other reviews . The case was n't opened too quickly or too hard - I have always used Olympus Stylus , so I am very familiar with opening the clamshell case . It is simply poorly constructed.Since then , it has been extremely difficult to take a photo without having the lens retract accidently while pressing down on the shutter . Because of that , pictures need to be attempted 3-4 times before actually getting taken , making any sort of spontaneous shot impossible to take.While the photos I have taken have turned out nicely , I have since given up on taking pictures with the Stylus Epic 80 - it was just too frustrating . I just bought the non-zoom Stylus as a welcomed replacement.If you want a dependable camera that takes excellent pictures , stick with the standard Olympus Stylus Epic .
 I bought this camera as a gift for my beautiful and very pregnant wife . She wanted a camera with a nice zoom to take pictures of our baby who is expected to arrive any day now . I 've had Olympus cameras in the past that worked great and was excited to get this one for her . Sadly , this camera ruined 5 rolls of film . It does n't load or advance film correctly . We sent it back and the baby will probably be here before we get a replacement camera !
 this camera worked fine for a while but then slide piece came off and the camera stopped working ... cost too much to fix ... do n't buy ... too much for a throw away . .
 I purchased the Zoom 80 upon the birth of my now 2-yr old daughter . We immediately had problems with the film not loading . The store convinced me that I was not feeding it in properly . Needless to say it often took me 2 or more times to do this simple task . I then had problems with the camera not turning on all the time , requiring that I open & close the cover several times until it did turn on . Of course , when I took it back to the store it worked . This was a recurring problem during its short life.On the positive side , the pictures were generally sharp . The best features of the camera were its compactness & clamshell cover.However , do n't let the `` armored '' case fool you . I just took the camera in to a repair shop where it was declared dead . The camera circuit board was damaged and would be too costly to replace . The repairman said that his guess was that it was knocked around too much . Granted , it may have been handled roughly at times but it was never dropped .
 After reading all the wonderful reviews , I could n't wait to go out and buy this camera . I was VERY disappointed in the quality of the pictures - not sharp or clear at all !! The photo quality is that of a disposable camera . In fact , while on vacation , we bought our daughter a disposable camera to take her own pictures , and when I had it developed along with the film from the Olympus Zoom 80 ... I could n't tell which pictures came from which camera . Bottom line , DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY .
 Camera is compact and takes good pictures . But the lesne mechanism is very delicate and complicated . You need to slide the lense barrier for the lense and the flash to extend . Within 1.5 years , our camera 's lense mechnaism broke down . Now the lense does not extend out and camera does not take pictures .
 I have had problems w / this camera since the day it was purchased . For some reason when you press down the button to take a picture , nothing happens . I 've had about a 50/50 chance of ever getting it to snap a picture . I always keep a spare camera on hand , because you can not rely on this camera to take a picture . Do not use this camera if you want to take pics of anything important , because you may not get any !
 No complaints about the quality of the lens nor reliability of the camera . The problem is with the final product , few crisp clear pictures.I 've had a Rollei compact for years . It produced great pictures but was bulkier than the Stylus Epic . After switching , I noticed that more of my pictures were blurry . I suspect it is due to the small size relative to the shutter release button . Seems like I need to use a tripod which makes the camera less portable . : O
 I am very disappointed in this camera . I see absolutely no difference in it from the disposables you pick up at the grocery store , except maybe the color of the unit . Everybody who sees it thinks it 's a new gadget with all kinds of features and I always have to say , `` Nope ... just a plain old plain old camera ... '' I hope I get a digital camera for Christmas .
 Amazon said that I needed this adapter when I ordered the macro lens and tele lens for my Canon 510 but those came with an adapter , so this was a waste of money .
 i bought this camera on vacation , after realizing i left my medium format on the plane . i always wanted a point & shoot and spent a while trying different ones out . the things i liked about this model were
 the AA batteries go out with one roll on average . . this is such a disadvantage ... i also have an Olympus Stylus 70 mm and it takes much better pictures ... it is clearear by a longshot ... do n't invest in this camera ... pay up a little for picutres you 'll treasure for a lifetime . .
 The VGA part of the splitter deos pass the VGA signal through . However , there is no signal coming out of the DVI part . I tested it on two computer with the same results . The item DOES NOT WORK.I sent a RMA request to the company which sold the item through Amazon but I never received a response .
 This adapter is advertised as a 5.25 , 6 , 6.5 to 6x8 but comes as a 5.25 to 6x8 . To make a 6.5 speaker fit you need to cut the plastic . This would not be too bad if the adapter was made like a stereo install kit , where the pieces are made to break off to fit a variety of sizes . But this adapter is one solid piece with no perforations or guiding lines or marks to make the resizing in any way easy . As another poster has said , if I wanted to do this much work to make an adapter fit I would have saved my money and made one myself . To sum up , do n't buy this if you are expecting a 6 or 6.5 speaker to fit , it wo n't , it will work fine for a 5.25 , and therefore gets 2 and not 1 star .
 These are advertised as `` 5.25 ; 6 ; 6.5 `` I bought these thinking they were pre cut ; and to switch to 6.5 '' you would just need to snap out the inner part.Anyway ; I was wrong . Completely FALSE description ... These are for 5.25 '' ONLY ; unless you feel like cutting and drilling them yourself.If that was the case ; I could have bought a plastic sheet and did it myself.Definitely not worth the time wasted here ...
 Our Dell PC would n't boot up with this DIMM installed . I 'm going to try another brand of memory .
 I can not review it , because it did not worked .
 I tried two of these babies ; when the first one did n't work , I returned it -LRB- believing it to be defective -RRB- and asked for a replacement . When that one did n't work either , I then knew there had to be some basic compatibility problem with my Dell Inspiron 5000e , DESPITE the manufacturer 's identification of this particular memory module as being the correct one for this computer . Needless to say , I 'll NEVER buy any Edge Memory product again . I 'll be trying a Viking 256MB SODIMM next . Wish me luck . By the way , Amazon was fantastic about handling all this ; easy return , no hassle , very quick and efficient . Just the way I wish my new memory module -LRB- s -RRB- had worked !
 I added this card and every time I boot I get a new error message . I tried removing the existing 128 and just added the new one but the laptop did n't even start . Finally I returned it . I do n't know whether it was a deffective piece or these just do n't work with dell .
 I ordered this product for my dell inspiron laptop . Turns out it was incompatible with my system and all I got was error messages . Afterwards , I researched the product number on edgememory.com and this chip is configured to be run on the Apple iMac .
 I 'm in the same boat as many of the other reviewers . Bought it , put it in & the laptop would n't boot up . Printed the FREE return label & got charged $ 5 for shipping it back . Very disappointing .
 I was directed to this site when I entered query for my HP Pavilion N 5350 Notebook . I replaced one 128MB chip with two 256MB chips . My computer just beeped intermittently when I turned it on . I 'm back to the drawing board . I must pay return shipping because the `` reason for return was not the fault of the vendor . '' The memory should be guaranteed !
 I ordered this memory because it said that I could use it in my IBM T22 ThinkPad . When it arrived it failed to work . I contacted the Vendor and requested a RMA so that I could return it . I received a notice that a RMA was issed to me , I never saw it.I recontacted the Vendor before the 30 day limit -LRB- I though 30days -RRB- They informed me that they tried to contact me , I never saw a thing , by both phone numbers are always in my emails . They never tried to call me.Then they informed me I had 15 days to return the product and that I now have to contact the Manufacture for a refund.I purchased 3 SODIMM memories from this vendor now I 'm out the moneyThanks
 I received the memory cards five days after placing my order . These cards are for my laptop which is running Windows XP Pro , although very slowly . I bought them with the hope of making it run faster . When I inserted the memory cards , the computer was not able to detect them at first . When it finally recognized them , Windows XP is no longer loadable . Thinking that it was my own computer 's error I scouted for other OS installation discs - Ubuntu , Windows XP SP2 . All of them to no avail . So I gave up and placed back my old memory card and my laptop is running as it used to do . I asked for replacement but was refused since it 's more than 15 days after the order date .
 This memory does NOT WORK in a Dell Latitude CPx 650GT and there was no indication of this matter and now I have no means of returning the product for a refund .
 At the time of this writing , there are 22 1-star reviews of this product . Only 5 favorable reviews -LRB- 3 + stars -RRB- . This memory appears to be compatible based on the specs , but it does not run in a number of computers with the right specs , based on the reviews . You can now add IBM T22 to the list . I have received two of these so far.I retuned the first one because I thought I just got a bad one . Second one does n't work either.Product is simply not comatible even though the specs match my computer 's requirements .
 Amazon continues to advertise this as `` IN STOCK '' at Ritz Camera . Ritz cancelled my order stating the manufacturer discontinued this item . Amazon was notified but over a month later they still have it listed as in stock at Ritz .
 *** ATTENTION *** Please be aware . I received this product in non-working condition . I did read a review previously on this , but did not take it to heart . Hindsight being 20/20 , maybe I should have . I would not recommend this product . Spend the extra $ 15.00 per stick for a nationally branded product . I have returned this to the seller . I am waiting on my refund as of 3/29/09 . Hopefully this information is useful to someone out there . Best of luck .
 Every review I read said this did n't work in Dell laptops , well you can add Toshiba laptops to the list as well . Even though the specs are identical , PC100 , 144 pin , SODIMM , unbuffered , non ECC , etc. . I snapped it in and booted and Windows wouldnt boot . Pulled it out and the laptop ran fine . Was trying to save the customer some money but do n't bother , just get the OEM for your machine .
 According to the specifications this memory should have worked with my Dell Inspiron . It was either bad ram or improperly marked . I tried it in two different computers and it would not work at all and actually caused the computer to crash in both instances . I would not buy from them again .
 Item received in a plastic container with the seal cut . DIMM did not work .
 I was sent the wrong memory twice and wasted two months and hours on the phone with customer service tech support who told me I was wrong .
 I bought 2 of these.I can not even boot my computer Dell 7500 with these . Hope I can get a refund .
 I purchased this item . It came quickly , and well packed . Unfortunately if was not the proper memory for the computer . It was not a fault of Amazon , it was a error on my part .
 I installed the two 256 mb memory cards , but my compuiter would not boot up - I assume the memory is no good . My computer works fine with the old 128MB memory re-installed .
 Look elsewhere . Specs looked correct for my laptop . bought 2 . Laptop would not turn on with one of them and the other brought me to a `` please remove incompatible memory '' screen . I should have listened to the other reviews . Amazon . Why are you still letting this seller sell this ? Is it the restocking fee you get ?
 The ram did not work in my computer . It is reported to be the right memory for a PC100 with SDRAM and the card fit in the memory expansion slot , but the system would not recognize it . It was a big waste of my money !
 I purchased two of these memory sticks for use in an old Dell Inspiron 5000 laptop computer -LRB- Pentium III -RRB- . The blurb suggested that they should be compatible with that machine . They were not ! It would not even boot with them installed . I bought alternative units from another supplier , a bit more expensive and guaranteed to work in the Dell machine . They did ! I suspect that there is nothing wrong with the Edge memory , the Dell is just picky - demanding a specific configuration or type of memory chips . I returned the Edge units to Amazon and they cheerfully returned my money . Thank you !
 A lot of hassle that could have been avoided if the shipper had done their homework . Couple of emails to Edgetek support cleared the matter up . And then RestockIt did n't want to take it back even though it was obvious that the information posted about the item was incomplete and misleading . RAM sellers need to be more exacting in their descriptions .
 Sorry , But it did not work in my SONY PCR-R505ES . I have not emailed the shipper yet and I am sure they can HELP me with my purchase . I should have called or emailed the seller before I ordered this part .
 Although it says this DIMM is `` for notebooks '' , it did n't work on mine . I have a Dell Latitude CPx J and even when the sistem recognized the new memory , Windows did n't start . So I had to take it off and still working with the old DIMM .
 For most applications , the fact that this card is really 512 MB rather than 128 MB would be a nice bonus.But , if you are buying such a small card for a device that can not handle larger cards , then it is bad . If I wanted 512 MB , I could easily buy a card labeled 512 MB , not one labeled 128 MB . For my application , the fact that it does not match its label is a fail .
 Bought the IPOD for xmas . Opened it up after letting it sit for a couple of weeks to try to convince myself it was worth the price . Not crazy about the way the downloads take place , but after you work out the nuances , downloads work pretty well . I 've read the reviews about how reliable the player is , that it does n't freeze up like windows computers do . Guess mine is the exception that makes the rule . I have the IPOD for Windows and it freezes up all the time . When I use it for long walks at a brisk pace , I 'm constantly having to reset . On today 's 1 1/2 walk , it froze up on me 4 times . I love being able to carry all that music , but if this is a persistent problem , I 'm going back to the mini-disk .
 Yes , this little mp3 player is sleek and elegant . But it also has given me nothing but problems since I bought it . I am now on my third trade-in because the battery life is n't lasting much more than 2 hours . Apple will not do anything but send me a new one everytime this happens , which was fine the first and second time . But after the third , I requested a completely new one or my money back , and they could not help me . When I went to the Apple store in NYC to request help , they told me they felt `` very bad for me . '' -LRB- That honestly happened . -RRB- So I 'm now talking to the Apple support center about setting up a trade-in , and I gather this Sisyphusian process will be something else to add to my calendar . And , no , I 'm not a PC person - I 've had Macs all my life and currently love my iBook . But I would never buy an iPod again , especially with so many other mp3 players on the market . Beware .
 Yes , this is an incredibly great LOOKING machine . It is too bad that it is only that , though . When this machine wants to behave , to be fair , it plays very well . However , you will spend umpteen hours charging and recharging , charging and recharging , charging and recharging -LRB- etc. -RRB- what was and is touted to be this miracle battery it has within . If you dare to get about 1 hour of play time you are doing very well . This coming from someone that has sent the player back to Apple only to recieve a brand new one 3 times -LRB- yes , 3 times -RRB- and still it has the same problems . Look on Apple 's website under support and then in discussions on the iPod and you will see that an incredible amount of people are having the same problems with theirs . Certainly enough for Apple to do something more than continue to advertise this product the way they do . If the ads had said '' You will only get about one hour of battery time with it '' , then I would be fine with that . At least I would have known what I was getting for such a large sum of money , instead of the frustrations I have now .
 I usually roll my eyes at `` you get what you pay for '' , cause sometimes cheap stuff is just fine . Not this , so far , half the discs I 've tried to burn have had errors and had to be thrown away .
 I tried to burn a couple of DVD images using 5 of these DVD-Rs - every single one of them failed with `` disk write error '' . I tried to use some other DVD-Rs I had in stock - all successful . Do n't know if this was a bad batch or incompatibility with MacBook , but buyer beware .
 I was not satisfied at all . I was looking for Light scribe DVD 's & this was listed under that category . When the order came in I contacted Media Supply in order to return the product . Still to this date nobody has responded to my email .
 No more Verbatim -- Seven coasters in spindle , on my G4 Mac .
 First time we tried them there was this constant hum , even standing right next to the tv . Returned them the next day.Sony MDRRF925RK Wireless Headphone
 I ca n't seem to make these work & am frustrated . I suspect it 's something I 'm doing or not doing & will figure it out on a day when I 'm more patient .
 The first unit I received I had to return because it kept cutting out . When the sound was good it was very good , but the cutting out was a big probem . I was sent a replacement with the same problem . Finally returned the unit for a refund .
 I bought this product because all the goods reviews and I am disappointed . Sound quality is fair but not good , popping sounds -LRB- a lot of it -RRB- and randomly stop playing for seconds . I 'm about to give it away for in free in Craiglist .
 Too much popping sound quite often , I went to RAdio Shack and bought one , not sony , it works fine .
 I bought this because my significant other goes to bed earlier than I do , and the TV keeps them awake . At first it was a great idea , but once I got the product it was not what was expected - the only real problem that I have with this product is that when using almost all the time I get popping and hissing while watching TV . The auto on/off was a great idea , they were fairly comfortable , and had no issues with charging -LRB- though I have only had for a few days -RRB- , they will be going back sometime this week due to sound quality.My advice - if popping and hissing will bug you - DO N'T BUY , if that wont bother you , go for it .
 Green power indicator flickered briefly when plugging in power adapter connector , but would not stay on.Removed cover and immediately saw that all the hand soldered joints for the connectors and channel selector switch were defective . They were dull gray with a globular pear-shaped appearance . A properly soldered joint will be bright and shiny conforming to the shape of the elements soldered with concave fillets . To acheive a satisfactory solder connection all elements of a solder joint must reach the melting point of solder , not just have a droplet of solder applied.This was an easy fix for me having thirty plus years experience in manufacturing electronics . BUT - a new item requiring repair is completely unsatisfactory.SONY CLEARLY HAS WORKMANSHIP , TRAINING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE PROBLEMS .
 I purchased two of these because my wife and I have a newborn and we want to watch movies in the same room as our baby girl without disturbing her.When I got the package I set them to charge overnight . I tested them after charging about 14 hours . When I listened the sound coming out was good except for one seemingly minor problem . I heard a repetitive ticking noise every 2 or 3 seconds . It sounded as if there was a slow -LRB- and extremely loud -RRB- clock inside the headset . Both headsets had this problem . I unhooked it from the sound to see if it was the input and the ticking noise continued even when unhooked . I tried all three channels and the ticking noise continued . I moved rooms to one without electronics and the tick persisted . I turned off my wireless router and it persisted . In fact there were only 3 ways to remove the ticking noise ... have the channel on the headset not match the channel on the base -LRB- which means you do n't get any sound -RRB- ... turn the volume to silent -LRB- which means you do n't get any sound -RRB- ... or to remove power from the base -LRB- which means you do n't get any sound -RRB- . So basically I only had the option to hear a persistant and annoying tick or to return the headset . I opted to return . I am highly disappointed with Sony because this was the first low-quality yet somewhat pricy item I 've purchased from them.Also , another problem with this headset is its power-saving feature . What looks like an adjustable strap is not . It is in fact the on/off switch . You see , when you put the headphones on it turns them on ... when you take them off it turns them off . This seems like a good feature , unless you do n't have an overly large head . I always thought I had a large head and have been commented on by others saying such a thing . When I put the headset on I barely activated the on switch and if I moved too much they would turn off . My wife could n't even activate the on switch because her head is too small ... so this product , even without the tick , would not have worked for her.If you want a simple headset that works properly ... do n't get this headset . If you do n't mind a loud clock ticking in your ear at precise intervals around 2-3 seconds , and you do n't mind getting a twist-tie to keep the head-switch pulled all the way up -LRB- on -RRB- ... then maybe this is for you .
 I 'm a huge Sony fan , and always buy Sony when possible . But these headphones are just horrible . The ear part is so big it comes down to my jaw bones , pressing painfully . If I happen to eat while watching TV with them on , they rub with every chew . There is no adjustment so they fit loose -LRB- I 'm an average-sized woman -RRB- , and I have to yank them down each time just to turn them on . The sound is n't at all what I 'd expect from Sony - just kind of tinny and distant . No matter where I place the receiver , there is a constant hiss in the background , which I do n't hear if I play loud music , but if I 'm listening to a podcast or any spoken word , it 's very noticeable . And if I walk around with them , the sound cuts out every 10 seconds or so , with frequent static . I 'm very lucky that the store I purchased them from is going to do an exchange , because normally they do n't take any returns or replacements on headphones . These were the worst headphones I 've ever worn , but I 'm going to try another Sony product as a replacement , and cross my fingers .
 The fit was very comfortable . I could n't stand the static and the sound was very low on this set . Also did n't like the automatic on off . Sent them back after a week of trying everything to get better sound and no Static .
 I have owned two pairs of these headphones . I like SONY electronics . About 50 % of my computer and A/V equipment is SONY , so I expected these to be well-designed , functional , and reliable . I bought the first pair from Radio Shack about 2 years ago . I did n't like them , though , and back they went for a refund . Fast forward to today . At a yard sale , someone offered me the same phones for $ 10 . `` I dunno '' I told him . `` I had a pair of those a while back , did n't like them and returned them . I ca n't remember why I did n't like 'em though . '' My A/V setup had changed , and I needed another pair . `` Heck , for $ 10 - what could be so bad ... '' So I bought them , and hooked them up , let them charge . 10 hours later ... I 'll tell you what 's so BAD about these headphones . First , they do n't fit your head very well . Each earpice has a kind of soft flexible ring around it that cups your ear . The two-piece bridge that connects the two earphones across the top of your head has a not-very-elastic band that 's supposed to provide tension , so that theoretically , one size fits all . There 's no way for you to tighten them , however , and in practice , they just kind of balance on top of your head without gripping your ears . Bend over , move quickly , and they start to fall off . Do n't even expect to wear them while working.But that 's not the worst part . I hooked these up to my `` music '' system , which I have spent considerable time , money , and effort get to sound just right . I did n't expect these headphones to be studio quality , not for $ 65 retail , but the truth is they are absolutely unlistenable with music , BECAUSE NO MATTER HOW YOU ADJUST THEM , NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE IN RELATION TO THE BASE UNIT , OR THE BASE UNIT IS TO ANY OTHER EQUIPMENT , EVERY 30 SECONDS OR SO , THEY GO
 The ergonomics are great , the way it recharges is very advanced , BUT it just did n't work . There was a card on the unit advising to turn up the volume so it did n't auto turn off but it had in my opinion a defect that let it pop in the middle of listening . The duration was about .5 seconds which is a long time .
 I did not like this set of wireless headphones . I wanted a pair because I sometimes watch TV in bed while my wife is sleeping . However , with these headphones , there was too much static . My head was less than 15 feet away from the receiver . Actually , even when I stood right next to the receiver , the sound was n't much better . These headphones have three switchable channels , supposedly in case there is interference on one channel , then you can change the channel to find a clearer one . However , in my case , all the channels were bad . One was slightly better than the other two , but still not acceptable.In order to recharge the batteries , you are supposed to simply set the headphones on the charger and line up the arrows . Very simple design , and easier to use than other wireless headphones that I have owned in the past . However , the unit I received would not charge the batteries . I replaced the batteries with a different set of rechargable batteries , and it still did not recharge . I guess I got a defective unit.I have returned these headphones to Amazon . Even if the charging system worked correctly , I would have returned it due to the static .
 I own many Sony products , -LRB- HDTV , Audio Receiver , CD Carosels , Digital Cameras -RRB- I was very disappointed with this product . The first unit was defective out of the box . The replacement unit was also defective . I returned both units for credit and would never buy another Sony headset again .
 We ca n't get them to work . Static only . Instructions say to press the tune button but there is NO button . We have had several friends look at them and no one can figure it out . They look nice sitting next to the TV though .
 Finally got the heavy duty static worked out . For those of you still struggling with this , turn the volume on the device you 're connecting to up to full blast and then play the headphones at a low volume . The loud popping has to do with the auto on/off feature . I got around the auto on/off feature by twist-tying the adjustable headband to the upper band . Put the twist tie on for on , and remove it for off . Of course that made the headphones only able to fit the Incredible Hulk . The headphones were big to begin with , which is why the auto on/off feature was activated every time you moved your head , frequently cutting out and making listening in any position but stock still an impossibility . If you have a very large head and a full head of hair , and twist ties at the ready , these might work out for you . If you 're a normal person who does n't want to re-engineer a product to make it usable , pass on these . A total waste of money .
 We purchased the Sony wireless headphones model MDR-RF925RK 6 months ago . Suddenly , they started to make a very loud pop sound -LRB- that 'll make you jump -RRB- and they then quit working . You have to unplug the unit , plug it back in , and it 'll work again . . but for how long . . it 's anybody 's guess . . anywhere from 1 min to 40 min 's and then it 'll do it again.I called Sony at 239-768-7547 , and spoke with a woman who was hard to understand -LRB- did n't sound US born -RRB- who said they only have a 90 day manufacturers warranty . She offered to send me an email with instructions on how to send my headphones in to get a refurbished pair . I asked at what cost , which she could not tell me , as her `` system was down '' . I asked if Sony could repair my headphones , and told her I saw a lot of people complain about the same problem , and she said Sony knows of no such problem . I then asked her for the repair department phone number . The gentleman I spoke with said there would be no repair , and that he could offer me an `` exchange program '' which would entail me mailing them my headphone and them mailing me a refurbished pair , again , at an expense he could not tell me . He said he could email it to me . . I told him the lady before already sent the email , but verified my email address anyway . The email addy typed in by the previous lady was wrong , and it took me SIX times of spelling it for the gentleman -LRB- did n't sound US born -RRB- to get it right . He then told me it may take a half of a day to get the email.Very frustrating !!!!!!
 It would have been great had it not popped / buzzed even with the TV turned off . It definitely blocked out all outside noises , but the inside noises were distracting and never quit no matter what I did to try and get them to stop .
 lots of positive reviews on these is what triggered my decision to buy them . i tested several different positions , all channels , power sources , audio cables to no avail . i decided to give the sennheiser RS120 's a try and have had a much better experience with them . they sit more comfortably on my ears as well , charging is easier -LRB- you just drape them over the metal bar . . no need for positioning -RRB- . . highly recommended . one thing i do like about the sony 's is that they power off when there is no signal .
 they look good and feel nice but when you actually play them , there is way too much hiss sound . also when you walk around with these headphones the music or whatever youre listening to will pause with every step you take . the product shipped fast but the actual product i did not enjoy at all
 They have already quit working . I had them resting on my knee and they fell to the floor less than two feet . They have not worked since . I could understand if they had been dropped repeatedly , but I would have expected more from Sony .
 This is the second set of headphones I 've tried in the Sony MDR line , as I previously tried their 970RK model and sent them back for a refund due to distorted audio . Thinking I just got a bad pair , I tried another set , the 925RK . Same result . The audio is distorted across the entire frequency spectrum and has a ` hallow ' sound -LRB- that I might be able to live with without the distortion -RRB- . I doubt I got a second defective set , though it is possible . I think it more likely Sony blew it with their MDR line . How these headphones got so many positive reviews I can only attribute to my experience with high-end audio equipment and having a more critical ear . However , they are distorted so bad that even the average user should notice .
 This is the first Sony product that i just absolutely hated . I 'll start out by saying I 'm far from a audiophile but i know what quality speakers sound like and its not this . Granted its a $ 50 dollar set of Wireless headphones so I 'm not expecting the world but man are these terrible . First off if you have the headset on without having something playing it sounds like your old school cable crapped out and you are getting blasted by white noise from your tv . Second the volume gets loud and soft quite often and its not because of a low battery -LRB- first charge was for close to 36 hours -RRB- and not because of the range -LRB- I am no more then 10 feet away -RRB- . Third thing is that they feel very cheap and by cheap i mean very flimsy and plastic -LRB- feels like a cheap toy your kid would brake in 2 second -RRB- . God forbid you fall asleep with these on or drop them from your bed or sofa . AND Last and more importantly the sound was terrible . At about medium headset volume the bass and highs sound like they were playing from the blown speaker in my 98 corolla.Thought i would roll the dice since the reviews were some where around 50/50 but i hope future buyers read this and save the time it takes for amazon to ship you this and for you to ship it back for a refund.Would give no stars if that was an option . I was use to a certain quality from Sony and this is not it.Maybe i just got a dud , but from most of the other reviews i may not be the only one .
 1 -RRB- Nearby Computers or perhaps other electronics make it click , buzz , etc2 -RRB- It 's supposed to automatically activate when there 's audio signal . If I put it on when a video was playing that certainly had sound , but not continuously , it would n't active so I would have to start some music just to `` wake it up `` 3 -RRB- Though I had n't used it all that much , I think it had some kind of charge issue . The operative word here is `` think '' because I could n't tell . It simply would n't work and then I would put it on its charger/base and then maybe later it would n't work . There 's no feedback on the headphone itself to give a diagnostic.I got so fed up with it I threw it away .
 Purchased for a friend , she said the headphones appear to charge but one she puts them on all she hears is static !
 Did not work . Did not have the correct cables for connecting to my new TV . After buying the correct cables , it still did n't work .
 Noise , pops , crackles , hiss , sound levels vary based on input levels , in other words the sound is not constant , volume goes up and down -LRB- especially with musical inputs i.e. drums or guitars when practicing -RRB- ... I guess one can not expect much more for 50 bucks and wireless ... ? stick with wired headphones , I went back .
 I purchased these to replace my old Advent wireless headphones , but these had poor quality sound , lots of hiss that could not be tuned out , and the signal reception was very bad , even within the same room . They were returned .
 Its not simple and couldnt get the sound only noise tried every posiible channel and always noise never sound .
 Pros : First I will say the sound on these headphones was quite good and set up was easy.Cons : I never before thought I had a small head but that is the only thing that I can figure out because these headphones felt huge on me . The ear cups covered so much of my ear that they rested on the pulse point just below my ear . Throw in that they are a bit heavy and it made me feel like I had high blood pressure because of the pressure the headphone put on that pulse point.Now I know this second point is really superficial but here it is . Because of the second outer headband I look like I 'm trying to launch the space shuttle when I wear these headphones . I guess because I have a small head the inner band is low around my head and so there is a large amount of space between it and the outer headband . It makes me feel like I have radar antennae on when I 'm walking around.Anyways , these were not for me and I ended up returning them and ordering theSennheiser RS120 Over-Ear 900MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradlewhich have been great .
 Even though I read some of the bad reviews , I thought that it will not happen to me so I went ahead and ordered it.There are so many bad things with it that I do n't know where to begin . First of all , there is no way to adjust theheadphones so it will fit a little tighter on my head . I have to be careful and move slowly to prevent them fromfalling off . Also when I was sitting on my sofa watching TV , the sound went away if I turn my head to the left orto the right . In addition , there was a lot of static . I returned them after 1 week and I bought the IR Sonyheadphones instead . Those at least lasted for 1 year before they died , but at least I got good sound and reliabilityfor as long as they lasted . It may be a problem with RF against IR , but for me so far I stay with IR .
 I originally bought this product for $ 90 and just found a replacement for $ 30 , refurbished . I have used my first one daily as I live in an apartment with lots of noise from people on the nearby walkway . It blots it out and I can play a large variety of things from radio stations with archives , or play relaxation white noise type sounds -LRB- rain with thunder masks noise well -RRB- . I had to pad the headphones with 1/2 '' foam under the band . They drooped and hung on my ears because of their too-big fit . I do n't have a big head , but these seem to be for someone with a head larger than human , or with thick stocking cap on.These may have one of the first models to come out . I was thankful to discover them at Radio Shack , originally , as the only wireless headphones they carried . I have used them almost daily for the last year , often for 2 or 3 hours and more if I am home . I do n't know what I would do without them , but bought another pair which I have not opened when the battery seemed not to be holding the charge like it had . It was needing charging more frequently at first , so I would put it back in its cradle more often if I forgot and left it by the bed or on a desk . At the same time , I think a splitter has gone bad in my wiring to the computer , and I blamed it on the headphones when the stereo seemed to go out , leaving me with sound in only one earphone . I could not find the `` special battery '' replacement on the internet , and Radio Shack told me a replacement would cost $ 35 . I felt this was too much for a couple of AA rechargeable batteries that would work with the headphone 's cradle where it is recharged . I had to buy a whole new refurbished product which cost $ 40 . I tried to get one through Sony 's e-support center . When I typed in the model # it showed me a different set of headphones . My model is MDR-925R . It looks just like the MDR-925RK pictured here.Also , the cover for the battery kept falling off . It is that silver , round part on the headphone . It has a very weak clip and wo n't stay on dependably . I was able to tape it on with masking tape . I taped down a part that moves on the headphone , but it did not need to move seeing the phones were so large . The tape kept it closed for a year and a half , until the set started losing its charge faster . I had to untape it . I forgot to tape it right back up , and immediately it fell off . A friend found it a week later out by my car . The set works the same without it on . The sony battery is exposed , but it is in there firmly . I now have two of these headsets . I only really need one . This one has been through a lot of wear and tear . With the battery compartment taped closed , it has been very , very rugged . Its been dropped , tossed around , etc. and still works , except the battery does not last forever . I saved the instructions and they had no parts or battery replacement help . Also , they tell you to use 2 regular AA batteries and replace them when they expire , which for me would be about twice a week . It is maddening in an age when things are supposed to be reused , not sent to landfill . The battery they supply is actually 2 AA batteries with plastic holding them together.Also , the cradle recharging is extremely convenient . I put some sticky stuff under the cradle and stuck it to my computer top . There is a place for the headphones to go when not in use and they go on automatically when you put them on . They turn off when you take them off .
 Ca n't recommend this product because they have an annoying &#34; momentary click &#34; and loss of audio . It happens at least once every couple of minutes and lasts for a second or two . They are attached to my Sony TV . I 've tried ALL the bands and relocated the transmitter without success .
 Intermittent popping noise is very annoying . Not sure if the problem exists with all the other headphones . Some reviews mentioned this noise but I purchased it as the overall rating was good .
 I received this Sony headphone wireless headphone system for Christmas . Tried for two days to get it to operate on any system - t.v. , computer , stereo . Could n't get it to operate at all . After reading the other reviews on this page I decided that it was n't likely worth the effort to keep trying to get it to work and returned it .
 I bought this item for private wireless TV listening and stero listening . Results are
 These things are much bigger than the pictures would have you believe . Even with the inside strap they are too big for someone as microcephalic as I am . They are very heavy so they slide down if the cross piece is not sitting on your head . In addition to that , there is a fair amount of static . I will try to return them and go for a smaller pair .
 The first set I ordered and received worked fine for 2 days , then the volume control broke . Amazon gave me a return label and sent a replacement set within a week . The second set had no sound in the right ear . I called Amazon and was told that perhaps there was a problem with the manufacturer and to return both items for credit . Friends have this same headset , ordered 2 years ago , and it still works fine , so perhaps Sony has changed manufacturers . Do n't waste your time or money .
 Purchased this item , received it and it did not work . Returned it , got replacement and it did not work either . Using either the rechargeable that came with it or fresh batteries , unit would not send signal to headset . Have received credit for both units and have bought another brand that works just fine .
 I 've bought several of these wireless headphones because I enjoy walking around and/or lying in bed while listening to TV . Compared to other headphones , the sound quality is fine . But the reason I keep buying them is because they break too easily . I call it my quarterly tax for listening in comfort .
 I read the good & mixed reviews , and my past experiences have taught me that noises & pops can often be solved with proper positioning . However , after many many attempts to configure these headphones for proper sound quality , they still pop & hiss . And they hurt.Pros : My previous wireless ` phones were infrared , so the RF-ability of these to receive sound when I walk away from the TV/stereo , out of line-of-sight was very enjoyable . The sound for these were impressive
 I was really disappointed with this purchase as the unit does not amplify the signal enough and has to much static and with the volume turned up the battery drains much to quickly . I do not recommend this product for its cost .
 First problem , the RCA adapter was missing that was supposed to be included . Second I was very dissapointed to hear a background hissing on all three channels . Whether I was one foot or several feet away the background noise was always there . I expected better from Sony .
 I purchased two sets of the SONY 925RK headphones less than a year ago . I only used one base station with the two headphones . All was well for about six months when one headphone stopped charging the battery . A month or two later , the base station stopped charging so I put the second base into operation . Recently , I lost the red light indication that this combination was charging the battery . I do n't know if it is just a faulty indicator light yet . I had already purchased two new batteries , and charged them , which may keep me going for a short time.I had a chat with a Sony tech and after some discussion , she advised me that both sets needed to be returned for repairs , at my expense , since the wonderful 90 day warranty had expired.I would be happy to use a stand alone battery charger , but have been unable to find one . Any help in this area would be appreciated . Thank you .
 I 'm sorry I bought this product . The sound is not that good and I keep hearing a cracking sound from time to time . I guess I 'll have to live with it .
 The headphones has a constant hiss . I tried them at different locations and on different channels . I had bought three and tested them all.A constant hiss can be heard at all times . I thought they would work like cellphones in a way where when there is no music , it should be quiet . But that is not the case.Not sure if the signal is just too weak from the transmitters . The hiss is annoying and unbearable .
 Got this product based on the previous reviews . I have received model MDR-RF925RK which the product do function and comfortable but it has terrible loud hissing noise in the background once its connected to any 1 of the 3 available channels . I will not recommend this product to anyone at all .
 After 2 days of use , the product is being returned . As others have pointed out , the quality of the automatic on/off switch is poorly made . The left side of the headband is more sensitive than the right causing a popping sound when it turns itself off and then on again , if you move your head or move to another room while wearing them . The range is limited . The headphones come with a pathetic 90-day warranty . Such a poor warranty demonstrates that Sony does n't have much faith in its own product .
 My Background
 This was my second shot at Sony wireless headphones . I have considerable hearing loss and I use them watching while TV so I do n't have to have the TV sound up too loud for other people around me.The first set was one of the earlier models that were replaced once under warranty when they failed completely . The replacement for the first ones stopped working shortly after the warranty expired . In spite of that , I figured I would give Sony another try with the MDR-RF925RK . They were no better than the previous model that I had -- in fact they were worse . They came up with a scheme of recharging by induction rather that by direct contacts -- and guess what ? I does n't work . The headphones never reached a full charge condition in the week that I had them.They also suffered from the same problem as the original set I had . The were noisy and made popping and hissing sounds when you moved your head . In short they were completely useless unless you are willing to put up with a LOT of noise . I even went so far as to put an extension on the line feeding them so they were just a few feet away from me -- they were still noisy.I sent them back and purchased the Sennheiser RS120 to take their place . Although I liked the fit and auto ON/OFF features of the Sonys , the Sennheiser RS120s are much better because of the lack of the extraneous noises that I got with the Sonys.Sorry Sony - but you blew it on these headphones .
 I bought these headphones about two weeks ago . They go back tomorrow.Pros
 These drop the audio occasionally and create popping sounds even 5 ' away with open air line of site to the transmitter . At 10 ' they 're outright annoying as heck . Lousy for walking around the living room and kitchen . Very comfortable though . Built-in charger is real nice . BTW , I was using a Mackie headphone amp to adjust the audio level just right .
 After looking around a few weeks I decided to buy this wireless headphone.They spent two days at home and send them back to amazon . What a bad quality of sound !!! I could not even watch a film , listen to music or play any PS3 game because of the noise and interferences.Now I still want to buy a pair of headphones but I think I will stay away from wireless.PS . I am very satisfied with Amazon service , as they gave me a refund with no problems .
 I bought these to use when playing my electric guitars . Headphone cords tend to get in the way . This is the worst product I have ever bought from Sony . I have always liked Sony products . With this I am very disappointed . Very low volume , spits and hisses like crazy on all three channels . I tried them with different amplifiers , guitars , stereo and computer . All the same lousy sound , lots of interference and you ca n't turn them up very loud . Keep looking do not buy this product .
 I have several pairs of wireless head phones . This pair was not good . I tried them one time and then put them back in the box . I have two pairs of the Sennheiser RS 110 . The reception is much better . The static on the Sony was so bad that it hurt to wear them . I would go with a good pair of Sennheiser headphones .
 Stay away from these headphones . It uses very specific rechargeable batteries which do wear out and are extremely difficult to replace . Sony does not even stock them on its own website .
 No idea how this product gets good reviews . All the secondary attributes are great
 To put it simple
 I bought a pair of these headphones . The base unit is faulty and turns itself off sometimes . The only way to get it to work is to unplug and replug it in every time I want to use it . The battery charger does not work well .
 Even I exchange one time , but both have noise.Maybe there is noise electric from our neighbor , Water Company ?
 I have owned several of these as I have a hearing problem . This is the last time i will buy this model . Alot of clicking noises and has a short in it . Sound will go off for a minute then come back on and go back off again and again .
 Very poor quality . A lot of irritating popping noises . The box had been opened and the operating instructions were missing . Ok I downloaded the op instructions , but it made me wonder if I had recieved a new unit or one that had been returned . I would n't think SONY would put out a product like this .
 I have some old Sony wired headphones that were expensive , but very nice . I wanted the advantages of wireless , so bought these and have been very disappointed with the quality . As other reviewers mentioned , the general static and popping noises are unacceptable . The white noise static sound increases quite a bit as you turn up the volume and the popping is a regular ` click-click ' every 3 seconds or so , that also increases with volume . Certain locations/positions will make the popping better or worse . Also , any movement sometimes causes a swishing sound . Music is not as bad to listen to since it tends to mask these problems , but listening to something like a podcast is terrible.The other complaint I have with them is that the charging is based on time -LRB- that starts when the headphones are placed in the cradle , I believe -RRB- not battery life . Does this mean if I charge them fully , then listen to them for just 5 minutes , I should not put them back ? Will it do another full charge ? This may be normal for wireless headphones , but the manual was confusing , stating `` Charging is controlled by the timer and always continues for approximately 16 hours , regardless of the remaining battery power , but this is not a malfunction . ''
 They look great . Nice design , nice cradle . They sound ... not so good . You will hear hissing and other interference along with the intended signal . I 'm not sure why they sell these -- I could n't be for listening to anything . I was looking forward to getting them , and assumed that along with being wireless , that being a Sony product , they would also have decent sound quality . Unfortunately , they work better as earmuffs . I think the problem is the RF signal is not a very good way to connect . I 'm not sure if bluetooth or infrared is better , but I 'd check them out before buying this one . I 'd recommend you go to a store and listen to them to see what I mean . I know I will think twice about the Sony brand next time .
 Received the headphones -LRB- HP -RRB- and put them on charge overnight . I then connected them to the TV in the `` audio out '' position and nothing happened ; the TV was on , of course . So they now just sit there !!
 We are very disappointed with the sound quality of these Sony headphones . There is a constant static `` buzz '' when using these headphones . I now wish I had spent the extra money and purchased the TV Ears brand , as my friend did and is quite happy with them .
 Was anxious to get this for an aging parent who was visiting and is hard of hearing . Imagine my disappointment when these wireless headphones arrived with the cords and was useless to me . I wish I could give this review a zero .
 I bought these headphones less than a year ... and they have malfunctioned . First , only one cuff will produce sound , then after another month past the other cuff went dead . The problem with the product is that it does n't respond to channel signals and tuning signals . Both cuffs wo n't emit a sound . It 's a weak product . Sony 's warranty only covers after 90 days . So , if your problem was bought 120 days or more , you will have to get it Serviced by Sony or a replacement BUT the cost to replace is very similar to the original price of the item . I bought these for $ 99 and now , telling me that the Sony replacement will cost $ 43.00 -LRB- almost half the the original cost -RRB- . Plus , they have to troubleshoot the product before they initiate a service agreement . This is alot of CROCK !! This is burdensome for the consumer . If you are thinking about SONY -- think about so other brand , but not this one . I do not recommend !!
 I purchased these headphones about two months ago and have used them extensively . They are nice in that I can now watch TV with my wife when before it was too frustrating an experience -LRB- she would continually turn the volume down to a point where I could n't hear it -RRB- . However , I am ready for something better . These headphones screw up way too much in response to certain sounds - particularly the spoken letter 's ' . Any quiet moment in a movie that is broken by an 's ' - someone saying the word `` sister '' , for example , instead comes out of these headphones as a very loud , obnoxious POP . I ca n't take it anymore.I 'll be giving these away free on craigslist as soon as I can find a better replacement that does n't cost $ 300 .
 These were completely unusable . They produced so much hiss , crackle and pop I do n't know how anyone could use these unless I just got a bad set . I tried all 3 stations and various placement but could not get them to work without all the annoying sounds .
 save your money , I bought this at rat shack . nothing but noise , especially with movies , with music you can hear static in the background and a couple blips that get louder . I thought it would get better once the battery got fully charged , but it didnt matter . I had bought the radio shack version of wireless -LRB- infrared -RRB- headphones and they were alot better . the only problem with those were , that you couldnt leave the room and if someone walked if front of your transmitter you would get static ... . also if the dvd player is going you get feedback from the motor.maybe I 'll just stick with the 15ft . cord
 I tried this product knowing that 900mhz can be problematic . I picked up static interference regardless of how close to the transmitter and what channel I was using . If you choose to purchase these wireless headsets , keep all the packaging , test it with fully charged battery and be ready to immediately return it . The headsets looked and felt like a very nice product . However , the interference and static was not tolerable .
 The Sony Wireless Headphone -LRB- MDRRF925RK -RRB- did not live up to my expectations . The headphone was not very comfortable and that has bothered me each time I have used it . The volume control was recessed too much for my taste , as it was not easy to use , while wearing the headphone . Also , there is the issue of popping and static that happened way too often.I do have several Sony products that I like a lot , but I would not recommend this set to a friend .
 I purchased this and paid over 80 dollars and was very hopeful with a Sony product . When it arrived even though the headset is a bit heavier than I wanted they are very comfortable . I found that there is a constant popping and crackling sound whenever the headset is used . The popping and crackling sound happened no matter if you are close to or far from the aerial . I also found that if you are more than 20 feet from the aerial the hissing sound is so horrid I would never use it for music . I tried the aerial in many locations near I even extended the aerial cord far from any electronics but this did not help the problem . I am very disappointed in this Sony product and would never recommend any one buy it if they are looking for high quality sound .
 I purchased this headset thinking I would get crystal clear sound since it 's a Sony brand . However , after using this product for almost 6 months I am highly dissatisfied . I purchased a pair of wireless headsets from Radio Shack back in 2004 and they lasted 6 years with perfect crystal clear sound . This headset does not compare to the Radio Shack quality . Three channels of pure distortion . Do not buy
 Has a cracking sound whenever you move your head , does n't hold charge very long , I do not recomemd you buy these headphones .
 Lots of noise and the popping is really distracting . I tried some of the fixes in other posts to no avail . Very heavy item and somewhat uncomfortable .
 Just bought these yesterday and disappointed to hear popping noise every 30 sec . Headphones are good quality , but will be returning back for refund due to popping noise.Sony should have better qualification of their products -LRB- otherwise , what is the point of SONY brand ? -RRB-
 While using these headphones , I was plagued by frequent , brief popping sounds . Switching between the 3 channels had no effect . Otherwise sound was clear and static free . They were returned to Amazon who was extremely prompt in crediting my account . If looking for wireless headphones , check the Sennheiser RS-110 model which I have owned for a year and have been trouble free .
 I purchased these on June 27th and , unfortunately I did not open the box and start using them until late July . Within 1/2 days , the left side went out , and just the right side works . When I went online to see about returning them , it was out of the time frame and according to the warranty -LRB- which I admit to not reading before purchasing -RRB- , even if I was in the allotted time slot , would only be eligible for 50 % of my money back . Sigh . Word to the wise , open electronics immediately !!!
 worthless junk - both before and after ` fully charging ' -LSB- 16 hours ! -RSB- sound quality is terrible - overriding hiss and static on all 3 channels - plus controls are ridiculous - too tiny and flimsy to do anything while wearing them
 The popping and clicking noise is unbearable . I 'm very disappointed at this Sony product.So why do some people give five-star rating ? They do n't have this problem ??? Or just ca n't trust some of the online reviews .
 The headphone came with the wrong power supply , so I can not use it . I was so excited when i bought it to my husband , and now i am very upset .
 HeadphonesI bought this item somehow , fortunately , before the price skyrocketed 20 bucks . I got it for 57.09 . Do n't know how or why sony or amazing jacked the price , but stoked I got this before it went up . Weird how that worked out . So THAT in itself earns a star for this item.Design
 First of all , the charging light never went off after approximately 18 hours initially on the charger so I went ahead and tried them . I had trouble so I called Sony for tech support with a LONG time on hold . The TS lady suggested that I try using regular batteries instead of the rechargeable ones that were included in case they were old and no good , but guess what , regular batteries do not fit in the battery compartment ! - even though the literature says you can use regular batteries or the rechargeable ones . It was also annoying to go through trying 3 different channels to attempt transmission . The tech lady decided I needed to send the headphones to their repair center with ME PAYING the postage ! I protested & they agreed to pay . She also said I only have 90 days warranty , the literature said one year.I decided to return them to the vendor & get my money back . I went to Radio Shack and got some R.S. brand headphones there & they work fine.In hindsight , the tech support lady was not asking me the right questions . I may have gotten them to work , but after the aggravation that Sony put me through I decided I did n't want to deal with them anymore . Plus the design of the battery compartment & having to try the different transmission channels . I decided I did n't like the design set up . The head band turns them off and on & can be a little tricky since it 's supposed to fit all heads . My R.S. have an on/off switch that I prefer . I will say that the Sony headphones were comfortable to wear , but I ca n't say how they sound since I never got that far .
 I bought this for a Christmas present for my spouse , so she could lay in bed and watch her late nite movies while I sleep ... I had the right idea just the wrong product . Do n't waste your time or money . . I sent this back and they did refund my money . The headphones charged once but never properly worked ... SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY , , STAY AWAY FROM THIS .
 I bought these Sony wireless headphones to use with my TV . After reading the reviews , I chose this one over others . However , when I opened the package and then tried to open the compartment for the batteries , NOTHING would allow me to open it . Cheap plastic junk ! After two days of trying to find a way into it , I mailed them back wasting money on the postage .
 Do n't waste your time buying and trying for this product to work . It does not ! I used to buy only SONY brand products . I guess now , that everything is made in China , you ca n't trust a well known brand any more .
 These Sony headphones make a loud popping sound every few minutes . It is enough to make you jump out of your seat . I had though about trying the more expensive Sony headset and they also have the same problem of loud popping noises . I read the reviews on Cables To Go SPK-9100 and they seem like a quality headset that is less expensive , comfortable , problem free and come with a 1 year warranty , so I am going to give them a try.I really have come to like Sony products but the Sony headphones have unfortunately been a big disappointment .
 Why are ear pieces round ? I do n't know about other people , but my ears are not round . I find round earphones to be pretty uncomfortable . I spend a lot of time on our tractor , bush hogging or mowing hay , or whatever and I always end up wearing my old but reliable and COMFORTABLE -LRB- because they have nice roomy , oval well padded ear pieces -RRB- noise reducing Koss Headphones . I guess they do n't make them like they used to , or maybe people have evolved TINY ROUND ears ! Really ?? Anyway I just wanted to see how many people have evolved tiny round ears . I must have noise reducing headphones so if any one has any suggestions on brands besides $ 300.00 and up Bose , please let me know . Also I absolutely hate that thin not leather stuff they cover earphones with . When you wear it it makes you sweat and then you end the working day covered with bugs , weeds , and funky black ears . So if anyone has any ideas , let me know .
 This came and I plugged it it . They never had good sound and they had lots of static . Look for something else .
 These have a buzzing sound unless you hold your head in exactly the right spot , which for me ended up being with my head turned to the right , kind of hard to watch tv that way . I tried to eliminate any kind of interference and nothing helped . Once you find the right spot to hold your head , you ca n't move it right or left or it will buzz.i did change the volume between the tv and headphones and that did help some but not enough to make these wearable .
 Having the Sony name and considering that it is still not a free-bee product , I assumed that I could expect some quality , at least relative to the radio transmission . Well , it mostly works , but it has two annoying flaws that I ca n't accept in a supposed quality product.I place the base in line of sight , about 15 feet from where I wear the headsets . I also tried multiple positions for the base , including upside down and out of sight with the same results . I sit on a lazy boy rocking chair , and whenever I rock and there is no sound playing on the TV , I hear this on-and-off hissing noise as the chair move me back and forth . I hear the same on-and-off noise as I walk about . I figure that the noise is also there when sound is playing on the TV , but it is drowned out . This noise is really annoying because even while you watch a movie , there are silent time when that hissing noise make itself heard.Secondly , this headphone which is supposedly `` self-adjust '' actually turns on when the middle false/leather band is pressed against your head . That gets very sweaty after a while , specially for those who have as little hair on top of their head as I do.As for the earphones , they are really thick . So much so that when you wear them , you can not turn your head much . Since my TV is at a slight angle to the chair I use -LRB- and not directly in front -RRB- , I have to turn my head a bit . But I ca n't do that with these headphones . I have to turn the chair so it is `` facing '' the TV.The only good thing is that it is rechargeable , but replacement rechargeable batteries can only be bought from the manufacturer . -LRB- Or specialized retailer as they are not standard . -RRB- So far , the charge has been OK and I did not have them run out but I only watch for a few hours during the evening , rarely more than 6 hours ever.One of these days , once the batteries go bad , I think I will look for another model , or just stick to a 15 feet extension cable and cheap $ 2 earplugs .
 It has too much noise . Even I purchase noise filter and attached , it still has noise . There is 3 channel on it . All 3 channel has noise .
 I got this memory stick and it 's the EXACT one that 's in my pc right now and NOTGHING . PC wont recognize it-dead . sent it back and got a second memory stick and now the PC wo n't even boot up with this memory stick in place ... tried it in both slots and verified it by moving the existing ram around and checking in BIOS what was where and seen in what slot ... do n't know if I just ran into a bad batch but at least I have to give Amazon credit for sending the second one right away even though it was bad too . They also are very good about paying for shipping on defective items . I say it 's buyer beware with this memory ... go for the more expensive stuff and save the headache . Which is what I had to do and now got the old beast up to 2gb of ram .
 Not a good iPod alternative -LRB- though not advertised as one . -RRB- Got this for my teenage daughter instead of a larger , more functional MP3 player . Wish I had saved the money towards a bigger and better MP3 player .
 Fortunately , I tested my Otter Box before using it on my Ipod for swimming , which was why I purchased it in the first place . After following the instructions , I put some tissue paper in the Otter Box , closed it per the instructions , and then placed in a small pot of water . After an hour or so , I removed the Otter Box to check the contents , careful to dry the exterior thoroughly . The tissue inside was damp!Unfortunately , I was out of the country when I discovered this problem and could not return the Otter Box during the time required to comply with Amazon 's return policy.My recommendation = try another product if you want to make sure you 're iPod is safe for wet use like swimming .
 After 2 applications on my apple laptop . . still smear !! Used their towel that was included . Do I try a third application ? Just do n't agree with the other reviewers with my experience . I was really looking for some magical stuff after reading all of the positives . But was disappointed to say the least . i would n't give water 1 star !!
 Did not work well on my Samsung led screen . Could not completely remove smudges . I feel that I wasted money by buying the expensive stuff .
 There 's a lot of product for the price and the cleaning cloth is really soft and strong . The cleaner gets off finger prints and the other little specs that get on the screen . The downside is that it actually does streak . The streaks are n't too `` heavy '' but there is a lot of them . I 've tried it on both of my screens -LRB- Acer and Asus -RRB- several several times . You can get a little bit of the streaks off if you use a dry part of the cloth and wipe the screen over and over and OVER . Really disappointed after reading the reviews . I may return this product .
 For some reason , these DVDs will not work with my DVD burner . I have tried both DVD-R and DVD+R and neither work . It burns DVD + - RWs and DVD+R DL perfectly . I 'm using Nero as my burning program . Checked all the filters and options and they just do n't work .
 Great radio , but my antenna broke after the 1 year warranty expired and they charged $ 50 to fix , Wen you spend $ 200 on a radio , you expect better support . I would n't recommend this product .
 I had had my PAL -LRB- not iPAL , but there is really no difference other than the `` I '' -RRB- . About a year in the volume knob started to get scratchy . A shot of Caig de-Oxit helped , but did n't completely fix things.About one year later the rubberized coating began to peel -LRB- a well-documented problem -RRB- I contacted Tivoli and they offered to replace the unit . I was ecstatic ! I waited about 6 weeks to send the unit in -LRB- making a cross-country move -RRB- . When I emailed for shipping instructions , they reneged on the offer!I was furious with them . It 's one thing to have issues with it ; even great product can fail . The customer service issue is what irks me . Their reasoning was that the person who originally offered me a replacement no longer worked for them . It should n't matter , I had an email from Tivoli telling me they would replace it . Instead I was told I could send it in and pay parts and a service charge to have the case replaced.This is just horrible service for a -LRB- now -RRB- $ 220 table radio!Here is the original letter : Dear Jason , Thank you for taking the time to email us .

 It seems this company has jacked up the prices on all their products . The iPal used to cost $ 130 but now it 's $ 199 ? That 's insane . If you look at their other stuff everything is $ 50 - $ 100 more than they were last year . How do they justify these huge price hikes ? I bought the Tivoli Model Two radio from Amazon last year for $ 160 and now it 's $ 300 . Shame on you Tivoli .
 I was pleased with the sound quality and FM reception of my iPal , but the antenna broke off the first week I had it and now , 2 months later , it has begun shutting itself off -LRB- losing power -RRB- a few minutes after being turned on . As well designed as it might be , it 's still made in China !
 For those of you slightly mechanically inclined , the PAL is quite easy to disassemble . I dove in recently -LRB- since my review -RRB- , removing the various components to access and disassemble the volume and function pots . Gave them a good spray with no residue contact cleaner and worked the little plastic inner part back and forth . There 's essentially no identifiable electrical contacts in pots , but I gave it a shot anyway . Reassembled and was surprised to hear clear and consistent volume . I 've listened for over 8 hours now and can declare it fixed.Just read Jason 's recent review - bummer on the reneged offer ! I 'm knocking my review down to a 2 due to my labor for repairs and his customer service experience .
 I like this radio a lot for all the reasons cited by other reviewers . Its Achilles Heel and fatal flaw is a cheesy switch for the On/Off/Freq selection which fails prematurely . I found only one other review which cited this problem . I have had two of these radios -LRB- one an out of warranty replacement for a $ 75 fee -RRB- and this switch failed gradually after about a year on both.By the way , my local strip mall battery shop put together rechargeable battery packs for me for this radio which I think were cheaper and certainly more convenient than ordering from Tivoli .
 We got one of these some years ago for about $ 130 , and though that seemed a bit steep , this has been a swell little radio
 i just suffered through Hurricane Irene . I pulled out my 15 year old boombox and some Duracells and - presto - I have radio without AC power.Good thing I did n't have a `` PAL , '' since that requires a special battery that likely would have been dead and nobody carries.What a stupid oversight on Tivoli 's part.There 's nothing wrong with a fancy , high energy density battery for routine use , but this should have been designed to run on standard batteries -LRB- e.g. 6 double A -RRB- for emergency use .
 Nice little package with deep sound for such a small unit . A little heavy on the bass . But the FM reception is so bad that this radio is worthy of only 2 stars .
 I returned my Tivoli PAL for the following reasons :1 -RRB- I was n't blown away by the sound . I recently bought a Boston Acoustics Receptor Radio and was much more impressed with the boomy presence of that small radio . The PAL sounded much thinner . I 've read criticims of `` too much bass '' from the BA radio , so obviously it 's a matter of opinion .2 -RRB- Lack of features . No HD radio . Mono -LRB- not a huge issue for me , actually -RRB- . No alarm , digital readout , memory presets -LRB- obviously -RRB- . No switch to aux so I 'd have to plug/unplug the line everytime I was n't to make the switch to/from my iPod .3 -RRB- I did n't plan to take advantage of its portability . I planned to leave this in my office , so one of the main advantages of this radio would be wasted.Returning this radio was not an easy decision because it is very cute and gets very good reception . I knew it lacked many features when I bought it . The main reason I returned it was because it lacked the rich , deep , room-filling sound I had hoped for . In the end , I just did n't think it was worth the $ 149 I paid for it . Now it 's $ 199 ??? I think they used to be $ 99 . Is n't technology supposed to get cheaper over time?There are a lot of 5 star reviews , so I 'm in the minority here . I 'd suggest listening to it before purchase if possible .
 Just a year ago this product was 100-130 $ . Good for the price but when I went to purchase a second one and saw a price hike on old technology in no way will I buy a second one . This is way overpriced for what it is .
 I have now had two of these in three years . After a year or so , you ahve to replace the expensive battery pack . I am very disappointed .
 1 . Tuning Problems : Beware of this product . My $ 25 Grundig pocket radio outperformsit ! I live in Boston which admittedly is full of radio signal overlap.So okay its a little harder to tune a radio station here . This productdoes as bad a job of tuning as any I have ever seen . The signalleakage is all over the dial . It gets about 4 stations clearly in alocation that has hundreds of stations .2 . Using it for IPod speakers : It is a very clean looking design but as far as using it for ipodplayback remember that it does n't have any remote controlfeatures or playback info so you are restricted to turning youripod on and letting it play away . You better really believethat life is random ; - -RRB-
 I had been looking Tivoli Ipal for my Ipod for awhile now and after reading all the reviews thought the product would be a good purchase . I had showed the Tivoli Ipal to my Brother -LRB- also an Ipod owner -RRB- and told him I was going to purchase it in a few weeks . Instead he had decided to beat me to the punch and purchase one for Himself . Well when his arrived and he plugged his Ipod in and played a song , My jaw dropped , It sounded horrible . I couldnt believe this was the same product as all those glorious reviews . For starters it doesnt get very loud at all and the sound is no where near good quality sound . And if turned above 3/4 volume , the bass becomes so satured it not even worth listening too . I decided to do a side-by-side comparision with a pair of powered computer speakers that came with my computer -LRB- they were nothing fancy at all -RRB- with the same song . The computer speakers blew it away in quality in sound and loudness . I felt my brother was victimized and feel sorta to blame for even showing him the Ipal . He returned the Ipal and the carring case that he ordered with it . But obliously something is terrible wrong either with these reviews or with the manufacture of the Ipal that he received . Needless to say I defiently wont be purchasing one myself or ever recommend it to anyone
 perfectly good sound but I could not get local am channel generally available on other portable radios . Battery pack is a disaster . ca n't find it anywhere and Radio Shack offered to order one for me for about $ 25 ... for a battery for a $ 100 radio ???
 when I bought this I reviewed this way
 I 've owned this radio for less than a year and in that year I have replaced the batteries twice , now the radio wo n't play unless I jump start it plugged in , after that it will work several hours unplugged but whenever I turn it off I again have to jump start it.While removing the battery one of the two fragile screws snapped off.Another problem is terrible reception , mostly static.I called Tivoli and was told they will repair it for $ 50.00 . So you can make up your own mind whether this expensive radio is really worth it or not.I registered it immediately after I recieved it and Tivoli will not fix it without a receipt , Does anyone keep a receipt that long?Total cost $ 200 for the radio , over $ 50.00 for batteries , and now another $ 50.00 for repairs plus the shipping charges.I have only taken it out of my house one time and the rest of the time it stays on my desk plugged in.I personally will never buy another Tivoli product .
 I 've had one of these for probably 5 years now -LRB- the original PAL , not the iPal -RRB- . While the device is supposed to be weather resistant , I found that after about 18 months the tuning knob became very `` dirty '' and staticy when tuning . I think this is due to moisture getting into the case . We keep the Pal on a shelf in the bathroom , and I suspect the steam from the shower did this.But the serious problem is something I 've just noticed recently . The rubbery material the case is made out of has started to deteriorate . The rubber case material has gotten almost sticky and ca n't be cleaned . And if you make the mistake of trying to clean it with Windex , the material almost melts.So you 're left with this device that 's totally absorbing all the dirt that comes in contact with it , and ca n't be cleaned . Even just a damp rag makes the rubber case sticky now , leaving marks in it and not getting the dirt off.I 've seen other rubber things break down this way - usually it 's the little rubber feet on older components , or certain cables.And while the Tivoli still works now , it 's kind of gross looking and worse is kind of strange to touch because of the permanent stickiness.This is an expensive radio , and I just think it should have lasted longer than it did.My only other operational complaint is that there is no `` AUX ' input switch on the front panel ... you have to plug and unplug the jack from the back , which makes switching from radio to Ipod a hassle .
 At this price , there is too much lacking to be able to recommend buying this . To connect to a phone/iPod , you must use a 3.5 mm jack cable plugged into the device headphone jack and then into the back of the speaker , there is no bluetooth . The battery charge does not last long , an hour or two max . So the very bulky AC transformer power cable has to be then plugged into the back of the speaker as well . -LRB- That 's now 2 wires coming out of the back of the speaker -RRB- . Further , the AM/FM radio reception is very poor . Even with the -LRB- decades old -RRB- telescoping antennae fully extended to about 2 ft , the reception is mediocre at best . The sound quality itself is very nice , however , that alone can not justify the price tag in a 2 '' speaker . If you are searching for a permanent desk speaker that you want to look expensive and impress co-workers , this may be for you . If you want something portable to take with you and listen to AM/FM as well , this speaker is n't what you 're looking for .
 I 've had my PAL for about 8 years now . I had to replace the battery pack a couple of years ago and , as mentioned by other reviewers , the tuning dial and volume dial have become quite scratchy over time . Overall , I would say that it 's an okay radio with okay sound . However , there is no justification for the price of this radio . I would not buy this radio again and would n't recommend it to anyone.One very important point , I recently traveled close to 200 miles from San Francisco but was still hoping to pick up the local SF AM broadcast of the San Francisco Giants World Series game . I brought my Tivoli PAL and it was unable to tune in the signal . But , my backup radio received it loud and clear . My backup radio in this case was the basic ten dollar AM/FM portable unit from Radio Shack . -LRB- Thank goodness I brought that with me or I would have been stuck watching the horrendous Fox coverage of the World Series . -RRB- Anyway , consumers should be aware that the most basic , cheapie radio will outperform the Tivoli PAL .
 This is probably a great product if it happens to work with your system . Do not buy this product if you have the following setup
 I bought an Apple iPod 20G -LRB- Win -RRB- for my girl-friend for Christmas . She has an IBM T30 with WinXP so I also needed to buy her a Firewire card . Since her laptop is probably one of the most standard laptops on the market , it did n't occur to me that it might not work.First , I bought a Firewire card from Tekram which I had heard was selling the best Firewire cards on the market . After wasting an awful amount of time trying to get this card to communicate with the iPod we had to return it.Then we ordered the Siig Firewire CardBus that IBM.com are selling from their ThinkPad accessories page . However , not even with this card were we able to connect her T30 to her iPod , and we had to return this card too.As a last attempt we ordered Unibrain 's FireCard400 that Apple is selling in its own online store . To make sure it would be able to communicate with the iPod we also ordered a repeater with extra power supply . The result was the same.It has not been possible to get any support or help whatsoever from Apple . Since they obviously can not guarantee that it their products readily work with a high quality laptop , I strongly recommend all Windows users to not even consider buying an iPod .
 Ok ... lets face it . This product is so sleek , we could not resist it . As a matter of fact , we bought three ! -LRB- no joke -RRB- Reasons why we do n't like this product :1 -RRB- For Windows it uses Music Match Jukebox -LRB- This product is a whole other story ... come on , Apple , you can do better -RRB- 2 -RRB- Just touch it ... your fingerprints are all over it .3 -RRB- Not very user friendly .4 -RRB- It will frustrate you to the max -LRB- we know how you get when something does n't work after the ninth time -RRB- 5 -RRB- Its white ! -LRB- What were they thinking ? -RRB- 6 -RRB- Very sensitive and scratches easily .7 -RRB- The case provided can not makes no sense . You can not opperate the unit with it ! 8 -RRB- The earphones are uncomfortableThe best optional accessory : - iSkins . -LRB- We ordered two of them and they are great . As a matter of fact , I like them more than the iPod itself . You can get them in any color from Orange to Lite Lime . Check it out if you decide to get one . We got them from AppleLinks ... -RRB-
 For extended travel , be forewarned that the iPod is not as compact as you might think.I have the Windows version . I have to take the iPod , external controls -LRB- if I want to control the volume -RRB- , Firewire cable , electrical wall plug , and earplugs or headphones . This is a lot of things that can easily get lost since they are each small . They also are all of interest to the TSA employees at airports , which is another nuisance.The supplied earplugs provide nice fidelity , but do not fit my ears . Oh , well.The iPod seems to run out of power very quickly when not in use . Recharging is common and a nuisance since it means the iPod is out of use during this period -LRB- typically about 4 hours -RRB- . It is yet another item that has to plug into a hotel electrical socket overnight . Bring along a multisocket -LRB- preferably with a surge protector -RRB- wall plug while adding all of the iPod wires and plugs to your suitcase.Reviews that talk about how small the unit is usually are meant for people who take the iPod -LRB- and possibly thier earplugs -RRB- only to work or day travel . In fact , I plug the unit into speakers at my office , so that the unit really is easy to carry in this case ...
 I love the product , I hate the product . 90 % of the world 's installed base of Wintel PCs , and about half of Apples installed base work with USB , if they have any high-speed serial connection at all . This unit will not work with USB , it requires Firewire . All the jabberwocky aside , it would have cost 25 cents more to add the capability . Speaking of quirky marketing , it took them how long to figure out to offer PC interface software ? ... . It 's not that big of a draw . It is not even worth installing Firewire on my PC , because it already has USB II . I would however , buy an iPod if you made it work with USB .
 Here some issues that I have encountered after three days of use of Windows iPOD 20Gb version :1 . Ca n't just drop MP3 files on iPOD in Windows File Explorer , have to use the buggy musicmatch software ; 2 . If you plug in the remote while the iPOD is connected to FireWire , the remote is not going to work after you disconnect FireWire ; 3 . There is no way to increase/decrease iPOD volume using the remote if nothing is playing -LRB- or if playback is paused -RRB- . You have to start playing something first ; 4 . No radio ; 5 . No cross-fading of MP3s ; 6 . The included game is -LSB- very bad -RSB- ; 7 . Shock protection is not working well for me -LRB- may be just my unit -RRB- ; 8 . The metallic back of iPOD is shiny , fingerprints make the unit look like a piece of garbage ; 9 . The clip of the remote is too small , clipping to shirt or bag strap is not secure ; 10 . Pressing buttons on the right side of the remote can `` un-clip '' the remote if it is clipped to your shirt ; 11 . Clipping the remote to things is almost not possible without touching the buttons . You have to switch the `` hold '' switch before , to disable the buttons ; 12 . There is no indication on the screen of which `` hold '' switch is engaged ; 13 . The buggy Musicmatch software is really slow and crashes frequently , but you HAVE TO use it , there is no way around ; 14 . There is no way to keep playable music files on iPOD only to release 20Gb of computer disk space .15 . There are no updates to any files on the computer and the iPod ; if you connect iPod to your computer , MusicMatch will still spend at least half hour to synchronize .16 . Does not play WMA files ; 17 . No USB connection to computer ; 18 . ... definitely overpriced .19 . etc , etc , etc. . . I want to stress that all shortcomings of the new iPod I have seen are born at Apple and its allies , nothing is related to Windows or Microsoft.Conclusion
 Go To mysimon.com and search archos studio 20 , you will find an mp3 player that costs 150 dollars and has the same storage capacity , you are paying 350 unneccesary dollars to buy this when yuo could be getting one much cheaper , comparison shop , the IPOD is FAR more expensive than most other mp3 players , try the Archos Studio 20 , I have one and it is great and I do n't wish I had payed 350 dollars more
 Where is the FM tuner ? Microphone ? Tivo like buffered FM radio ? How about a replaceable battery?For this price I 'd expect a full feature set .
 The first one 's hard drive corrupted with only a week of moderate usage -LRB- on the train in the a.m. work commute -RRB- . Replacement 's battery kept dying after only a song or two . The third one now lasts through about one song before the battery dies - despite my following all instructions on Apple 's site . Apple 's site leaves a lot to be desired too in terms of finding the right technical support . You are wasting big bucks if you purchase this product .
 My computer is a Dell , 333MHz , PII , with LOTS of memory and a 40 Gig HD . I 've installed two FireWire cards . The machine can see the iPod -- it shows up as Drive F. I can even move files onto the device with Windows Explorer and copy them back off to another location . Of course , the iPod ca n't use the information that is n't loaded using the MusicMatch interface . But that is the end of communications with the little toy . At times , the little icon in the taskbar even showes that it is connected . But it sits for hours with the `` do not unplug '' sign flashing.Two days of struggle and it is going back ...
 The Apple iPOD is a great device with a couple of severe drawbacks .1 -RRB- The iPOD device portion of the MusicMatch software is -LSB- not good -RSB- . Updating my 20g iPOD with about 9g worth of data has taken over 1hr and is necesary each time you make even the slightest change to your library . Fortuanantly I was able to sign up to Beta Test the new XPlay software that supports this unit and it works great .2 -RRB- This unit will not work well for anyone hoping to jog or bike etc. with it . My wife and I have been running with it and it basially freezes up 90 % of the time . Apple product support told me that there is no fix and confirmed that others have experienced the same issue.The bottom line is do n't get an iPOD if you need a unit to run with . ----------------------------------- I returned my unit to Apple and recieved a new one in the mail in about 3 days . Great service ... But this new unit locks up when I run as well ...
 It is a great gadget , incredibly practical to bring your music everywhere . If you want to bring it jogging , forget it . It freezes each and every time and you 'll end up just carrying it along . Get something else . At Apple , they say it was n't built to be used as an excercise companion .
 I thought I was buying the answer to all of the portable players problems and further more , a beautiful work of art . Boy was I wrong . First off , the unit has NO moving parts . So can someone explain how after having it for less than week it has crashed on me three times , when I jog with it . Not only does it freeze and it is unaccesible no matter what , but I have to let the battery be used up -LRB- 10 hours -RRB- and then fully charge it again -LRB- 4 hours -RRB- before it starts working again . The Musicmatch software reminds me of DOS software from the late eighties . There is so much great music software out there . I do n't think it would hurt the narcissistic people at MAC who developed this software to look around and see that things can be much simpler and easier . And last the device is impressively beautiful , until you touch it and you can see fingerprints all over it . Not only that but the carrying case bastardizes any grace and sleekness the device has . Ends up looking like a big bulky cassette player.Oh and I almost forgot all of this for the price of -LSB- $ $ $ -RSB- . Give me a break .
 Pros
 This is probably a great product if it happens to work with your system . Do not buy this product if you have the following setup
 I love all the features of the I-Pod except for one veryimportant one
 I loved my ipod , for however long the battery lasted , but as i began charging it and leaving it until my next use , it began depleting its own battery without any use . It has now been 3 weeks , and my iPod holds a full charge for about an hour WITH OUT TURNING IT ON ! My only choice is to return my iPod to Apple , and they want MONEY !! even though it is still in the warrenty . I Highly recommend opting for another mp3 player , as this one costs more than mosts , offers great everything but battery . If you always have a plug within 2 feet of you , you might not have this problem , but for most of us , the point of this is to take us AWAY from plugs , and computers .
 Do n't believe the Apple 10GB iPod editorial review for a moment . I have spent literally hours , approaching days since Christmas Day , trying to download mp3 's using the supplied MusicMatch v7 .1 to the iPod . The unit itself is an exquisite piece of hardware and design . However , the software interface is a total disaster ! Let me invite you to visit Apple 's iPod for Windows support page , and view the pages upon pages of problems posted on their bulletin board , just in the last several days ! Wait awhile before you buy .
 iPod has set the standard for HD-based MP3 players.It 's swank design and ease-of-use are outstanding . It 's only negatives are lack of universal interface -LRB- u need a firewire card -RRB- , inability to queue songs `` on-the-fly '' , and the pricetag -LRB- ! -RRB- Oh , and there is that one overriding design flaw . IT 'S BATTERY IS NON-REPLACEABLE . The battery is a special lithium-polymer battery tested to last 500 cycles -LRB- or charges -RRB- . So , depending on your mileage , within 1-3 years , the battery on your iPod will be unable to hold a charge
 I bought one of the Windows Ipods when they first came out and have had nothing but trouble with the software for downloading music and books -LRB- Audible -RRB- . Music and books would have gaps or be completly unplayable . I would advise looking at the user comments on Apples own web site before buying one of these .
 Although Apple advertises the iPod as ideal for strenuous athletic activity , apparently that does not include running or jogging - at least for more than 18 minutes . The touted 20 minutes of skip free play is almost exactly that . At 18-20 minutes into a run -LRB- just getting started for many runners -RRB- the iPod freezes , and can only be unfrozen by plugging it into its recharger . Amazingly , the arrogant tech at Apple recommended stopping running every 18 minutes and plugging the thing into the recharger for a few minutes ... really handy for trail runs . To be fair to Apple , the iPod uses a hard drive to store MP3 's , and this performance is not unusual ; however the inaccurate advertising is unusual , and not very Apple-like . C'mon Steve Jobs , you can do better than this !!
 Elegant device . Unfortunately it is not quite ready for prime time from my persepective.I bought the iPod specifically for the ability to store and listen to long books and shows from Audible.com . To my dismay I discovered that there is a bug in the 1.2.1 firmware for the Windows iPod that causest the bookmarks to be erased every time I connect the iPod to my PC . This renders the device useless for listening to anything from Audible longer than 30 minutes as I would have to manually write down my location in each book that I am listening too . No thanks.Then I learned today that there is another bug that causes the battery to drain completely when the iPod is just sitting unused for a few days . Not the kind performance I expect from a piece of electronics . It looks like I will be returning this one .
 For those of you retarded enough to buy this ... congrats . . but this is a first generation Ipod . . so more than 5yrs old . . or just about . . 175 dollars . . is ridiculous . . it should be about 50 bucks . . no more . .
 Apple needs to understand that their iPods ' designs are flawed . If you want to spend this much money , get a different brand altogether . ** BUGS ** The Windows version of MusicMatch Jukebox that comes with the iPod is loaded with bugs . In fact , one in particular is really irritating -- the program will actually `` chop off '' a character from the tag of the mp3 name . In short , your song by `` Madonna '' will become `` Madonn '' on the iPod . It will cut off additional characters after you synchronize again , so then it may become `` Madon '' then `` Mado '' , etc. . MANY PEOPLE have this problem -- read the postings on various online sites if you do n't believe me . PLUS , it does n't just send the new songs to the iPod when it synchronizes , but it selectively deletes songs from the iPod and RECOPIES them . What good is having an ultra-fast FireWire connection when it wants to copy 7 or 8 gigabytes to your iPod when all you have is one more song that you want to add to it ? The bugs in MusicMatch are intolerable , but MusicMatch has fixed them and posted a free upgrade to their website . BUT , Apple uses some kind of proprietary version of MusicMatch , so if you use the update to fix the bug then it WILL NOT WORK WITH YOUR iPOD , and you have to reinstall all the software that came with the iPod again ! ** POOR DISPLAY ** The iPod 's illuminated display makes the text almost impossible to see if it comes on during the day . To turn the light off , you have to go through a bunch of options on the iPod to turn it off and on each time . Plus , if it 's cold outside and you use this in your car , then the display is especially difficult to see when the light is on even at night . ** BATTERY LIFE ** Apple claims 10 hours . If you 're lucky , you 'll get 5 or 6 . And , if you do n't use the unit overnight -LRB- i.e. leave it in your car -RRB- , then it loses a lot of charge . I would typically get only 2 hours of use out of it , only because I was n't using it for 12 hours . I 've read postings that it is because of Apple 's new firmware upgrade that forces the battery to constantly drain , even when not in use . OH , and by the way , you can not change the battery , so if the battery goes dead , you 'll have to pay Apple a bunch of money to replace it . To sum it all up , the Apple iPod has many design flaws , simple as that . design flaws in their previous versions in an attempt to get people to waste their money on more of their products and hope that they do n't wise up and take them back to the store . Admittedly , it would be a great device if the battery life was better , and if Apple actually bothered to test the software before selling it to the unsuspecting consumer .
 I have recently got an Ipod and I thought is was the best Mp3 player until I did a lot of looking around . The Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra kicks the Ipod so much.Pros :1 . Eax sound feature which is creatives sound card technoligy so it sounds a lot better2 . The 30gb Nomad cost $ 300 while the 10gb Ipod cost $ 4003 . built for windows . No firewire stuff .4 . better features and custmizing5 . no need to use musicmatch or anything just install software and you can put any song on it no matter where the location .6 . big screen with blue backlight .7 . Can replace rechargeable battery8 . Up to 60gb hard driveCons :1 . A little bigger than the Ipod
 After much research - I took the plunge - and plucked down -LSB- money -RSB- for this thing . What a mistake ! Musicmatch software syncing to IPOD was awful - with dropouts - and transfers in which you had no idea whether the songs were transferring or not . There is no visble indicator of song transfer ! Then I tried Ephpod after reading some reviews - it just caused XP to freeze . Believe me , I put computers together as a hobby - and this thing was a big mistake . Do n't spend your money ! Poor software & too expensive - even with the 10GB ! I 'm returning mine - last Apple I ever own !
 This is a really slick-looking device , and the packaging is way cool . I was looking for something like this after my Handspring Visor ceased functioning -LRB- thanks , Microsoft -RRB- , so when I saw Walt Mossberg 's review in July , I ordered one the same day , and had been eagerly awaiting its arrival . Apple has a good name , Mossberg is usually accurate , the review above is good.I was sorely disappointed . It does NOT work as advertised , and the lack of documentation only compounds the problems . I had to squint to read the serial number -LRB- required by setup -RRB- . It loaded my music quickly -LRB- Firewire is amazing ! -RRB- but then kept flashing a message `` Do not disconnect '' ; after a long wait , and no help from the documentation , I finally found the eject button in the software.The thumbwheel is very jumpy , and put me in French before I could stop it . They have no useful instructions for the thumbwheel . They have no logical documentation on the features included . They advertise compatibility with Microsoft Outlook , but I could not get my Outlook contacts to transfer , even after consulting all the online documentation -LRB- and it was , again , skimpy -RRB- . The calendar was totally incomaptible.After spending the better part of an evening trying to get this thing to work , I am sending it back to Amazon . It is the first thing I have returned to Amazon , but I refuse to pay ... for a tempermental toy that does n't even have complete instructions.If you like form over substance , this is a way-cool gadget . If you want a functional MP3 player , look elsewhere .
 I bought the iPod from Amazon and it was delivered about a week ago . I also bought the Apple Care Protection plan . The product seems to work fine except I am having minor but irksom problems ` navigating ' using the buttons and wheel thing . I am using it for an Audible book which is supposed to start where you left off . Well , after 7 hours it decided to start at beginning again . I try fast forward and the thing goes to the next book . I want to just finish the last hour of the one that is being played.So , I call what they call Customer Service and find that they wo n't give me any advice whatever until I FAX in a copy of my shipping document from Amazon and another sheet with a magic number on it from within the extended service package . They say that Amazon is not an authorized reseller and that they can not check my order and date of sale from Amazon.I explain that I do not have a FAX machine , and that I will go send the stuff in a few days when I feel like walking that far using my crutches.I think that it is probably a good product , but if you are in any way handicapped and it is not convenient for you to run around to get their service , I recommend not buying it .
 If what you want is a portable device to run or jog with , simply forget it . It freezes after three or four songs -LRB- every time -RRB- and it is just the way it was built . I sent it for repair -LRB- they charged $ 29.99 for shipping -RRB- , just to have it back with the same problem and the explanation that iPod 's skip protection just lasts 20 minutes , even while Apple 's website specifically states you can run with it .
 Think iPods are god 's gift ? Apparently you have n't heard about their problems with battery life and freezing up.My iPod freezes up about every 15 - 20 minutes and has to be manually reset all the time . You can almost set your watch by it . I 've tried to have it fixed but Apple says that nothing is wrong with it ... Think my problem is rare ? Go to Apple 's website under the discussion board to find out just how `` rare '' it is . Believe me , EVERYONE is having this problem.These things also have chronic battery life problems . Expect it . This thing should be called the iPOS -LRB- think about it -RRB-
 I purchased this for my new Canon S3 IS . Worked great the first time I used it -LRB- as a bounce flash -RRB- . I put it in my camera case , months later , I tried to use it again . Would not work -LRB- piece of junk -RRB- . Amazon nor Canon will take it back .
 I was disappointed with this product and returned it to Amazon . The service from Amazon was excellent .
 I was very pleased with this flash for the year or so i had it , but now the bulb seems to have died & Canon offers ZERO remedy for the problem . No repair , no replacement
 I bought this flash from Amazon in November 2008 , used it a few times , then put it away and did not use it . I think I may have tried to use it a year ago , but do not recall . Anyway , I pulled it out in NOvember 2012 to use it and it would not work . Battery checked okay , but it is not easy to check these batteries , so I bought a set of new batteries . Same result dead as a stone . So now I am stuck with a set of useless batteries and a useless flash . If anyone has any advice I would like to know .
 Not happy with this card . Caused system crash . Messed up the configuration files . Toll free support was not good either . Reprentatives do n't understand you well and will ignore your questions at time . Spent too many hours on phone with tech support and did n't solve anything . My card is still not working . Tried card on another laptop and did n't work again . Files are not communicating and conflict with hardware and software .
 Even though the description says it does , this is a lie , if you are looking for a case for a 17 '' laptop skip this one . I had to return it .
 I am completely disappointed in this product , the finish is very bad inside as it does not even ensure the laptop , the material is very ugly .
 I bought this amplifier and realized it is not compatible with my systemwent to return it
 I was looking for a video distribution system whereby I could take two or more inputs , like satellite system inputs and program out put to what ever channels I wanted to my network in my home and shop . This product does not do this.GTNesvold
 I could not get this to work with my 5G iPod Classic no matter what settings I tried .
 Only audio works . Thats all its good for . They were suppose to send me another one . Never did .
 I will preface by saying that I am not the most technologically savvy guy . I like to keep things quick and simple , and this particular AV-Adapter is not the best . In fact - I ca n't get the cable to work at all . My LCD flatscreen has several inputs , and I 've tried every single one . I went to my Itouch video settings and made sure the settings were correct . Nothing . As my title suggests , it 's better to be safe than sorry . Pay the extra few bucks and buy a cable that connects directly to the ipod connector -LRB- and not the headphone jack -RRB- . I do n't know how the other reviewers were able to use this cable and plug into their TVs , but I had no such luck . I paid $ 4 -LRB- including shipping -RRB- , so I did n't lose a lot .
 I purchased this modem a long time ago and no longer use it . In fact , it pushed me over to get a high-speed Internet service through my local cable company.The modem is sensitive to line noise , or at least picky as to what modem it talks to at the other end . Tons of dropped connections for no apparent reason . I tried it at many houses including two I lived and at several friends.I send it in for repair with hope for a fix but it turned out to be a feature ; It is worth mentioning that support was unprofessional with their responses.Let me add that it is V.Everything except for anything after V. 90 , so no V. 92 or other improvements added to the Sportster models and others.After more than a decade of using and recommending USR modems , this last experience marked the end of my loyalty .
 This item was advertised to come with rechargeable batteries and a charger . Instead it came with a couple of copper tops . Regular batteries are good for two pictures , and then completely wiped out . Useless .
 Gimmick plain and simple.Hard to use and looks rubbish . Bad gut feeling when ordering and rightly so.Just buy some screen cleaner and a decent cloth and clean manually every month . I edit photos every day and no dirt has ever interfered .
 This thing totally freezes up for me all the time and requires a restart if I enable the Firewall/Access Control features , and noneof the firmware updates seemed to fix that . I have talked with others who own the SMC 7004VBR , and many of them have experienced the same.Another thing about this item that I found annoying is that after a restart it takes about 2 minutes to come back online.I replaced my SMC brand router with a D-Link , and I have been much happier .
 I have been a loyal SMC customer for years . I LOVE SMC gear , especially their tech free PHONE tech support , even of the accenst can be hard to understand.On 7/20/06 , I bought 3 of these SMC7004VBR . First surprise - the default logon password is not blank ! I called SMC tech support who did not have a solution -LRB- reset did n't work -RRB- and forwarded me to a pay tech support company -LRB- in India -RRB- which gave me my first call free . He did n't have th answer so I played around with the logon and SMCADMIN worked.Anyway , its a terrible business practice for a company to sell an item and 2 weeks later stop tech support.No more SMC for me .
 I tried to like this router . It has some good parental control features which let me set specific time limits for web browsing for each of my kids computers . Up to 12 rules can be set . It connects PROMPTLY with my cable modem and resets quickly . It works well with my VPN connection to work.HOWEVER , it is completely unusable . With the firewall activated -LRB- who would n't want it activated ? -RRB- and with a set of 8 timing and URL rules , this router completely slows to a crawl and locks . Routinely . Repeatedly . Several times a day . I have reset the router , installed and reinstalled the latest firmware , reset factory defaults , you name it . Tech support is polite but unhelpful . Two different units have the same problems . I suppose that those of you who have had success with this router have not turned on all the options . If you only have one computer in your house and do n't set up any parental control rules , this router may work for you . Do n't forget to turn on the firewall -LRB- off by default -RRB- and only buy it from a place with a good return policy . Better yet , buy a D-Link , like the 604 , or a Netgear , like the 614 .
 I immediately encountered the following problems
 The admin interface says Copyright 1998 on it , so this switch is ancient . Do n't bother buying any of these.After a few days of pulling out cables from our wiring closet to discover which device on our network was issuing DHCP addresses on the rare occasions that a DHCP lease from our main server was ending and the main server was failing to respond in time , I found that we had one of these devices on our network , and after looking it up , found that it was not a switch but infact a router -LRB- does not say anywhere on the device -RRB- . I promptly replaced it , stomped it to death , and hung it on my wall as a trophy . No person or device messes with my work network and gets away with it !
 We bought these to upgrade a couple of older Dell computers ... waste of money . The computers would not address the memory and caused nothing but grief !
 I bought Corsair memory for my personal desktop to increase memory from 1.5 gb to 2.0 gb . A friend , who works in the IT field , told me that all chips are produced by the same manufacturer , and thus , I should by the least expensive , which happened to be Corsair . Although my system booted after the installation , I saw little improvement in speed . However , the real problem was that my system would freeze - constantly - in any and all of my programs . Then it became an even bigger problem . My system began shutting down and restarting on its own while I was in the midst of doing work . As soon as I replaced the Corsair memory with the original , all problems ceased . I then returned the Corsair and and ordered PNY .
 I have been an amazon customer for a while and this is the first time I was unhappy with a product . This RAM caused internal problems with my PC , the repair guy said he had seen this several times with the Corsair brand RAM and recommended Kingston brand . Be careful
 a noisy little thing , you need one for every lens . cause its a help of a job to remove it from a lens to another .
 The plastic Canon conversion lens adapter does work with add on lenses but it does not work with just a filter -LRB- Canon UV filter -RRB- and have the filter screwed in snug . If I do the lens hits the filter glass and immediately retracts and shuts down . I have to back-off the filter more than one full turn so that the lens does not hit the filter . I did n't notice this until after the return date so now I have a useless plastic thing . I have contacted Lensmate and they swear theirs works perfectly so I will buy theirs .
 Dang it . I read a well written review of the Canon G9 -LRB- and the need to get a lensmate -RRB- : http://www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/cameras/G9-Japan.shtmlI went to amazon and ordered this ` lensmate ' thinking it would be anodized aluminum . -LRB- This plastic version should cost -LSB- ... -RSB- cents , not $ -LSB- ... -RSB- . -RRB- Anyhow , I found the metal one here : http://www.lensmateonline.com/newsite/G7.htmlI think I 'll try returning this thing ... never tried to return anything through amazon before . I also ordered some UV and polarizing filters -- I hope they are glass and not plastic . : -RRB-
 Wish I had read all reviews before purchase . This does NOT work with the A650 . See previous review about ` the white dot ' . I just spent $ 113 to have this removed from my camera - they had to completely take the camera apart .
 My second one just failed . -LRB- Mine is the 4GB HT203 -RRB- Each one lasted about three months as a Vista Readyboost device . I probably unplugged the thing -LRB- s -RRB- a total of ten times . I always use `` Safe Remove '' for all of my temporary storage devices , of which I have many.They go bad over time . Too little time . I have other flash drives and they all fail eventually , but this one is the worst . It is n't worth the shipping and headache to keep shipping them back for RMAs.I tried the low-level restore/reset/format program several times on both sticks . Once they go , they are gone!For regular file stuff , go with another stick.For Readyboost , I would suggest that if you have a pagefile on a 7200RPM drive -LRB- pretty much the standard -RRB- , you get next to no benefit from Readyboost and possibly even take a performance hit . My page file is on a RAID 0 between two 7200 RPM Seagates over SATA2 that are dedicated to paging and temporary files and where the pagefile is on the outer tracks of the platters . All OS , Application and storage is done on other drives . I do n't even think USB2 .0 at its highest throughput can tranfer data as fast.I got off on a tangent . There is probably no computer that comes pre-loaded with Vista that does n't have a 7200RPM disk drive and there is maybe one scenario in 100 that might give you 2 % - 5 % performance improvement from using Readyboost . Certainly not enough to warrant a dingdong sticking out of the back or side of your computer asking to be broken off.That is not to say that memory installed into the memory bus ca n't help . With Vista , I would say 2GB should be the minimum . Memory accessed through the memory bus is much faster than USB or SATA , so no Flash Drive or Disk Drive can come close . It is more expensive than Flash Drive memory , but worth it and these days it is pretty easy to install even in a notebook computer.I said too much already.Bottom line is that I am very disappointed with the MTTF of this product .
 I bought this vent mount for my garmin nuvi 350 . It 's an ok product if you do n't mind the thing jiggling aroung on your a/c vent . Appearantly it 's not desingned for every car exactly . Despite the adjustment features it has it still can not maintian a steady footing on my a/c vent . And it was not easy to remove from the vent . Overall not a good buy . I would n't waste the money .
 Did n't work for my car -LRB- landrover -RRB- , or my mom 's car -LRB- toyota corolla -RRB- , or my fiances car -LRB- yukon -RRB- . It just pointed down towards the floor with each of them . However , if it fits for your car it would be a good thing to have , so the gps is n't attached to the window . I went back to using my friction mount , which I love .
 I have owned both this FM remote and the Apple fm remote . Both had the same main issue -- the wires tended to get tangled . However , I HIGHLY recommend the apple brand over the Griffin.These were the problems I had with it : - Volume . While there is a volume button on griffin , it does n't get loud enough to listen to on the street or at the gym . The radio volume is not routed through the ipod , so it does n't matter if you have the ipod turned up all the way . - Navigation . Because the radio is not routed through the ipod , you have to navigate the stations on the griffin -LRB- not too bad , but annoying to switch around -RRB- . - Clip . This is a common complaint that I 've read . The belt clip is very flimsy and does n't attach to anything . The apple brand clip is a lot stronger -LRB- and I used it to gather the excess wires -RRB- . - Durability . This is my main complaint ... IT TOTALLY FELL APART !!! I took it out of my bag one day , and the on/off button had fallen off . I managed to get it back on , but the next day , the entire face plate had fallen off , and all the buttons had fallen out . I because all the electronic cards inside were now shifted around , I was n't able to put it back together . Neither amazon nor griffin would replace it for me -LRB- though as you can probably guess , I would n't want another one -RRB- . The only pro for this item is the price , but honestly it 's not worth it.Note
 Save your money . The construction is extremely cheap . My Griffin iFM fell apart in a couple of months ! I could n't put it back together because the controls do n't line up and the sides wo n't glue . I wish I could find another alternative but I ca n't find one.Besides that , one will have to carry two devices from now on instead of one , and this Griffin has long chords , that will twist and tangle all the time.Having to add a device like this iFM is ridiculous . It would be better to just use another device with FM rather than lugging around an Ipod just to power up this other device . Apple should really think about this ...
 In spite of the product description , this will not work as a wired remote for the ipod 3G . The radio works but you might feel a bit silly hauling around a $ 200 + ipod to serve as a battery for a radio . There has got to be a better way!Griffin iFM -LRB- Dock Connector -RRB- / FM Radio and Wired Remote Control for iPod
 I do n't know what happened with this product , I coud n't believe that I even paid for this . It did n't work at all . the cable seemed to be loose or something it was always interfered signal i coud n't hear clearly , i coud n't catch a signal , I even gave it a chance in another country hoping it would had to do with radio signal frequency or something but it just did n't work . I tried to open it to fix it , like a said it seemed to be broken or something but it just never worked not even as a remote control , the buttons where like glued , it was a nightmare .
 spoke too soon its been alil over 2 weeks and its broken already the remote shuts off by itself then cuts back on and now i can only hear through one ear theres a loose connection in the wires
 seems poorly made , & the volume does n't get as loud as your ipod usually could -LRB- without this -RRB- . it 's okay if you listen to talk FM i guess .
 On the positive side , the physical design and contruction are excellent . However , setting and changing the playback stations is so tedious and time consuming that I have to give low marks to features and ease of use . Worse , the effort does not pay off . I tried the unit in a VW Jetta , Jeep Liberty , Honda CRV and Toyota Corolla and was never able to get acceptable sound . Radio static is the main problem , but compared to FM stations , the dynamic range is very short , with clipped high and rumbling lows . Noise that the car radios do not usually pick up , like from power lines and vehicle ignitions , is amplified . The experience is like listening to a cheap AM car radio from the 1950s . My Griffin iFM dock is in the trash because I ca n't give it away .
 The first one of these I recieved fell apart the very first time I tried to use it . I requested an RMA number from the supplier , but they were nice enough to send me a new one with out any pushback or need for explaination . I would rate the company as 5 Stars but the product as 1 .
 Functionally , the iFM is great . I like to use it for workouts at the gym to watch FM transmitted TV 's . However , the construction is extremely cheap . I bought two of them and both fell apart . One fell apart the second time I used it . The construction is so cheap that I could n't put it back together because the controls do n't line up . I wish there was an alternative but I ca n't find one . I like being able to switch between iPod tunes and FM , but will have to carry two devices from now on .
 I am sooooo returning this piece of junk . Did n't even last a week of regular use . Cord is coming apart at the connectors .
 I bought this specifically to transmit iPod music to my car 's FM radio . The product description leads one to believe that this is what the product does . IT DOES NOT . It is an FM receiver , not a transmitter.Luckily the seller gave me a full refund .
 Bought this unit for my wife as she wanted to play mp3 CD that I make of her bluegrass band . The CDs I make play fine on my iRiver SlimX and my Amphion Surround Sound system DVD player . The Sony ZS-X3CP will not play only half the songs . It returns the message `` NOT MP3 '' . I 'll take the unit back to Best Buy tomorrow . Did SONY actually test drive this unit before it was released ?
 There seems to be two schools of thought on this product among these reviews
 Bought one at Best Buy , the screen kept going black and flickering , could n't tune in more than 2 FM stations , taking it back for a refund .
 I bought this unit for my daughter for Christmas after seeing it at Target - great styling , ok + sound quality and features - BUT - be aware that Sony designed this product with a HUGE AC power brick transformer rather than with an internal transformer - measures 3.25 '' x 2.25 '' x 2 '' and weighs a ton . We are returning the unit because we use the AC power much more than batteries - we ca n't imagine lugging this brick with us everywhere ! Too bad because we liked everything else about it .
 Bought this unit because it was a good price and really wanted a portable MP3 boombox . It should not be called a boombox , as it certainly is incapable of booming . I work in a fairly noisy production area , and only can hear this player by being next to it , a problem I think is due to being strictly a 9-volt system . Also , like all the other reviews , the MP3 loves to screech on the slightest hint of haze or dust , much more on an honest scratch or fingerprint . Embarassing . Wish I 'd bought another selection , but the design is nice .
 Purchased this unit a couple of weeks ago and had to send it back . First of all the sound was only so-so . I was not too surprised since the speakers are of an average quality but i have heard better from similar speakers.The unit has a 10sec buffer for antiskip which was nice except when it came to playing my mp3 CD 's it would skip the first 10sec of the track and start playng with the counter starting from zero . I tried several mp3 encoded CD 's and they all did it even though they CD 's would work fine on my Riovolt SP250 . The replacement unit did the same as well.Close but no cigar !
 Sony Boombox failed after 20 minutes . Seller tried to scam me out of a refund , saying I took the product apart . Thanks to Amazon for a guaranteed refund .
 The unit skipped -LRB- screeching sounds -RRB- with brand new mp3 's disks from day one . I had the unit serviced and the problem still remains . The problem is not the disks , but the unit since the cds work fine on my other player . Unlike every other boombox I have owned , the AC adaptor is on the plug and is enormous . The sound is only marginal . ...
 Sure it 's a cool design . Overall it even sounds ok . I tried 2 units because I really wanted it to work but the mp3 playback was horrible . Random screeching sounds were very common and note the word random -LRB- it is n't my disk -RRB- . I returned it and bought a mp3 boombox for half the price and it works great . It does n't look as cool and unfortunately it does n't get quite as loud . However , it is playing my mp3 's perfectly and that is what I really wanted . Good luck with it .
 I found a deal on this one at a local store . Compared it against many other Sony products and other brands as well . This had a horribly small tinny sound . For the price , I would expect more , although this plays mp3s . The sony cfd-s20cp sounded somewhat better and is much cheaper . The cfd-s20cp does n't look as nice , but then again this zs-x3cp looks kindof dumb to me . And it has a cheapy feel to it , which is probably partly because it is lightweight -LRB- transformer is in plug and not the actual device -RRB- . I did n't like the button layout either , but I have n't seen anyone do a very good job on this yet . It 's ironic that car stereos have one heck of an intuitive layout in about 10 square inches , and Sony can only make it worse when the real estate on top of the unit grows by 10x over the car stereo.If you are set on paying this much for a boombox , I would suggest JVC RC-BM5 or . If you want the same device for less , I would suggest sony cfd-s20cp .
 This unit claims to play MP3 discs , but it would not read the home-computer created CD-R or CD-RW MP3 discs that I have no trouble playing on either my Rio portable or Pioneer DVD players . I took some sample discs to a Circuit City store and tried them out unsuccessfully on a display model . Allowing for the possibility of a defective or broken display , I went to a second Circuit City store and got the same results there . They had a store-copy , commercially produced -LRB- by MP3.com -RRB- sample disc that worked just fine , but none of my Roxio or Adaptec burned CD-Rs or CD-RWs had any function . So , if you like creating your own MP3 compilation discs , and you 're looking for a portable box unit that will play them -- this one 's NOT for you!Also , there are no tone controls or equalizer pre-sets to choose from on this player . Except for the bass boost , one sound setting fits all .
 I have two complaints .1 . I was completely unsatisfied with MP3 playback . Long Load times and a terrible shuffle contributed to this problem . I bought the player for mp3 cds and after the first week I wasnt even using them .2 . After owning the player for six months and never putting it through a high stress environment CDs stopped working . The player would continue to play on low volumes but at normal volumes the player turned off after 15-20 seconds .
 I was surprised to find that this Sony box was not able to play a particular ordinary CD-RW with about 65 MP3s written on it . -LRB- It was able to play a different one with about 150 MP3s . -RRB- A much cheaper unit was able to play both CDs , but skipped , which was what brought me to look at this one.Loading the CD-RW with 65 MP3s caused the unit to spin up , show that it was reading an MP3 disc , count to 65 , and then suddenly shut itself off when it should have started playing . Two different units in two different stores showed this exact behavior . I was unable to figure out what the difference was between the two CD-RWs that caused this to happen.Bottom line
 I bought this unit for my daughter for Christmas after seeing it at Target - great styling , ok + sound quality and features - BUT - be aware that Sony designed this product with a HUGE AC power brick transformer rather than with an internal transformer - measures 3.25 '' x 2.25 '' x 2 '' and weighs a ton .

 This amplifier sounds good and has lots of connectors at the back - download the pdf manual from sonystyle and see for yourself.My main complaint about this product and why I returned it was that as soon one begins to listen to a digital audio signal - whether that be from your satelite box or your DVD player - this amplifier will no longer play any analog audio , it shuts off any output to the `` zone 2 '' , `` monitor '' , `` video 1 '' and video 2 '' outputs - so you ca n't send the sound out to any analog component that you may have , such as
 I have these Memorex CD-RW and Sony CD-RW . The Sony works everytime and the Memorex work once in a while . The reason I believe is the recording speed . Sony has 4X recording while these have 12X recording . The 12X recording is unplayable on my car stereo 8.5 out of 10 . Unfortunately , I ca n't adjust the recording speed with my Roxio 9 program . The CD ca n't be played or played with a lot of statistic noises . I think if I record with a lower speed , it would probably works well . Therefore , the product was advertised incorrectly when it say it is capable of being recorded up to 12X .
 Tried one by one , none of them worked . after the burning is done , I can listen to the first 2 tracks fine and then nothing . tried each single CD with the same outcome .
 It can be burnt as music CD , but ca n't be read on both computer and CD player . I bought same product form target , and the serial number seems to be very different , however it works and this wo n't .
 None of the discs work I put music on all of them before I tried playing them in my car and it gave me errors for all of them multiple times .
 All five of the discs in the pack were bad . Finally got one to work after multiple attempts .
 I just bought this 5 set at Target , enclosed in a box and cellophane . Every single one of the five CDs had pieces of the jewel case fall apart when I opened it . Makes you wonder of the quality of this product . I 've only used one CD-RW and it 's worked okay so far .
 One star for the problem with the micro HDD , causes the entire player to be a bust FOR ME.I am a long time Cowon MP3 player owner
 I bought this product in January of 2007 ... . When I first got it I started having issues with it . I sent it in to get repaired it took about 2 months before I got one back ... . The way that they work is when you send your brand new one in they send you an old repaired one back ... . When I got the 1st used repaired one , I was having issues with that one as well ... . I send that one back in and just recived the 3rd one ... well guess what ! This one does n't work either ... . I asked for a refund and they told me that it was past the refund time limit.Everytime I talked with customer service via on line chat they just say send it back , but I was told that I have up until January of 08 that they will fix them for free ... . Even though I have not gotten a working one ! This MP3 player is defective after my experience of getting 3 ... . I DO N'T recommend this one ...
 nice toy but lacks a lot of quality . Screen looks great at first than you notice the smuge in color also device is terribly slow and 1.0 host usb that takes 120 sec to load is unusable with very limited supported devices . plays great mp3s and radio . video playback is poor .
 doesnt support slave drive 's only mastersdoesnt support x64 vista promise thinks there above everyone else too cool to make drivers
 I bought this as a lower priced remedy to wiring difficult to wire ethernet jacks . But even after an hour with tech support , we could n't make it work . The tech support person told me I 'd be better off hard wiring a jack . Instead , I bought a Netgear HDXB101 kit , which worked flawlessly . Sometimes , it just makes sense to spend a little more and save the headaches.ZyXEL PL100KIT HomePlug Powerline 85 Mbps Ethernet Adapter -LRB- Starter Kit -- 2 Units -RRB- Netgear HDXB101 Powerline HD Ethernet Kit
 As the title says , if you 're surfing Amazon while having had tossed back several cold ones , turn off your one-click . No , not because you wo n't buy stupid stuff , but because you 'll pay too much . I totally KNEW I was buying an awesome stereo audio cable , and I was thrilled at what I thought was a steal of a price
 I would recommend getting the unterminated brand wires which do n't come with such accessories as divorce , welfare , and starving children like this one has .
 Let 's evaluate what you get here for your 4k : Counter-Spiral Geometry : I do n't know what this is , but it must be related to cold fusion . A quick google search reveals that the only meaningful links to ` counter-spiral geometry ' are from the manufacturer themselves .72 V Dieletric Bias-System : Again , nothing on google at all except dubious claims by the manufacturer about alleged sound improvements from this ` Dieletric ' system . Did the get that term from the Scientologists ? Will this cable balance out my theten levels?Optimized for Full-RangeThis is such a generic statement that it could apply to any cable for any purpose . Full range means it can carry the ` full range ' of information from your amp to a speaker . Uninsulated copper wire from a hardware store -LRB- or a coat hanger -RRB- can do that.Aside from looking like an anal-probe , this speaker cable from AudioQuest is unremarkable . If you love to light cigars with thousand dollar bills like Mr. Burns , it might be a novelty worth purchasing . Otherwise , get wise and steer clear of it and its ludicrous price tag .
 You might say I am a early adapter . Willing to step out and try new experiences and products before the great unwashed masses get their grimy little fingers on them.I took the plunge and purchased not one but `` FOUR '' of these cables , all on my charge card . I felt incredibly confident on the potential of these cable and the uses they could be put to . How ever my then wife did n't share the enthusiasm I was feeling when the charge card bill arrived at the next billing cycle . Matter of fact , she developed a very negative attitude for some reason and divorced me shortly there after.Well , I lost my home , my family and then my job in short order and they even repossessed my car . But for some reason they did n't want the cables back.These are extremely powerful cables as you can see from the effect they had on my life . I have attributed this set back to not wearing a grounding strap when I opened the packages these cables were shipped in . The resulting static discharge has warped my reality . If only I had purchased the warranty available at time of purchase . I could have filled a claim under the policy and edited out all negative energies and static discharge.Now I 'm living on this primitive planet with no hope of opening a worm hole so I can return to my proper time & place . Let this be a warning ! Always read the manufactures instructions before you open the package .
 Tried these before I bought Audio Quest K2 cables -LRB- see my full review there -RRB- for $ 8,000 . And yes - you do get what you pay for as the K2s are literally twice as good as the Volcanos . Anyway , tried pawning this cheap pair off on ebay , but then figured out how I could use them to make a killer electric bong with a Pepsi can and an old lava lamp . Cheers !
 Yep , you heard correct , my speakers sprouted wings and flew away into the great beyond and disappeared.Very sad experience and the worst part of it is is that I never actually heard these cables , once I plugged them in , turned receiver and stuff on they took off , gone , Vamoose , aloha , split , bye bye.The only good thing that came out of this experience is that the speakers are in a better place.still ... sad day . Dont buy these .
 I bought this dash kit as part of an install for a 2009 Cobalt . The kit looks nice and mounts fine to the radio . However , this kit does not fit under the Cobalt dash panels . It appears there was a manufacturing error or incorrect labeling of this product . The face is about 1/4 '' to wide and will not mount under the cars dash panel . It is not worth modifying since the face would have to be physically cut to fit under the dash panel . Cutting the hard plastic face would be very noticeable and cutting the car dash plate would be an unrepairable modification.I would like to give this product a `` 2 star '' rating because it does well at securing the radio in the dash and is reasonably priced . Unfortunately , the dash panels could not be replaced with this mounting kit installed . My background includes several custom car audio installations and I am very confident in my ability . This does not fit in a late model Cobalt .
 Double DIN is 100x180 mm - any radio that adheres to these specs wo n't fit in this kit . -LRB- like LCD touch screens -RRB- It fits in the vehicle but the radio does not fit in because the cutout in the dash kit is only 97x173 mm.The Scosche GM1598B fits in any kar that the METRA 95-3305 fits into -LRB- Amazon also sells that one -RRB- but has a real Double DIN OpeningI called Metra Tech support and they told me to modify the dash kit . That is kind of a joke , since you buy the kit to have a professional look and not a hack job and an unstable mount.Dont buy it unless you have a radio that is smaller than Double DIN .
 this product does not fit the Cobalt - you have to use 95-3302 There is an error in the tags and links for this part . Do not buy for the Cobalt !!
 Purchased my set from Bestbuy . Also bought the protection plan for them . I 've currently replaced these headphones 3 times.The first two times the microphone died . I think the headset has a problem with moving the boom mic up and down.Third time the speakers blew at the high range . In order to use the surround sound function of this headseat , you have put a AAA battery in them . This will allow you to activate surround sound with a switch . The power this puts to the headphones is too much for them to handle.For gaming , this is n't the set you should get .
 Longtime Amazon customer but this is the first time I have ever been driven to write a review.This product was a huge disappointment after upgrading from my old Netgear RT314.The problem ? It times out my remote connections after about 15 minutes . . So I might be SSH 'd into a remote system -LRB- work -RRB- doing some work . . Step away for a few minutes or get distracted and Bam . . Lost connection . And here I thought I had ` always on ' internet . The old Netgear would stay logged in for days.I contacted 3COM customer support -LRB- a very lengthy endeavor -RRB- and they told me it was ` designed to do that ' . A quick search will show a lot of people who have this problem.It will be many years before I buy another 3COM product .
 We bought 2 digital picture frames for Christmas gifts this year . One of the frames was the Westinghouse 7-inch . I am very disapointed and will be bringing it back and exchanging it for the Kodak EasyShare which has an excellent picture.Don ' t waste your money . The pictures are dark and grainy . Spend a little more and get the Kodak .
 The picture quality for this product was just inexcusable . I do n't even understand how this product could be sold at all . It is sooo horrible . I do n't usually return any items that I buy online because it is such a hassle and there are restocking fees but I was repulsed to have the picture frame in my house . It was terrible .
 Do not buy this digital picture frame , stay away !!!! Normally , I rarely write reviews on any product I purchase , but I had to for this one . I went cheap and got this thinking it ca n't be that bad . I was really disappointed after I received it . The picture quality is horrible . I decided to use this for myself at my office and purchase a better one as a gift for my parents . I got the HP 8 '' 800x600 digital picture frame from BestBuy . I brought my SD memory card and tested it there . HP DF800 8 '' Digital Frame Part Number
 This frame did n't last much longer than the warranty period . When I called the Westinghouse folks , their customer service advisor said to toss it out as they do n't service them , even for a charge . We paid about $ 150 at the time for it , so it was truly not worth the money . Lovely gift while it lasted , just did n't last long enough .
 I bought this frame because I could get pictures off of my computer and put them on it . I did this and that was easy . The problem with this frame is that after about 6 months it started having color issues and the pictures were turning pink and distorted . At 7 months it completely stopped working . It has a 6 month warranty and therefore , I lost $ 80.00 . I am very disappointed in the quality .
 I 've owned a couple of these for about 7 months and at first they work great . The features are good and so is the picture quality for its limited resolution . However they have some serious memory defects . Expect compatibility problems with memory cards . In addition , mine started running horribly slow ! I have to wait about 30 seconds between button presses to navigate the built-in OS ! Warranty is only 6 months , and that is about where they start giving you problems . I would NOT recommend these to my worst enemy .
 My husband purchased this frame for me for an anniversary gift . We took it out , followed the instructions , inserted our memory card , and pressed the power button . However , all of the photos load off center . So , this item was defective . In addition , it is very grainy and dark . We 're going to return it and get a kodak which are supposed to be more reliable .
 Like many others , I purchased this electronic picture frame from Best Buy as a gift . The various card options really pleased me thinking it would would be a long range keeper due to the changing technology . It was a gift to my wife as an anniversary present . I even purchased a 2 meg XD card to add more pictures.Some pictures were too dark , we knew it but did n't complain . It was so neat ! We loved it . Until ... immediately after the warranty expired and well past the Best Buy return date . It died . Power was connected . Turned unit off/on hoping to reset the unit . Called Westinghouse for assistance . I could send it in , but the service fee was so high , I could have purchased a new digital frame.I still have a bad taste about this unit and it just went into the trash since I ca n't find anyone to willing to repair it . Now , I have an XD card that wo n't fit in any other device I own . Bottom line , purchasing this unit is throwing away your money . Purchase from another manufacture .
 then I would at least have something to say ... unfortunately , they cancelled the order because they were backordered . So I received a broken frame and now ca n't get another one .
 I bought this frame from Best Buy as a Mothers Day gift for my mom . It was on sale for about $ 70 , which was a good deal . My mom 's not a very technical person so I needed the frame to be easy to set up . It was - simply insert your memory card and `` Voila '' instant picture show ! My mom was fascinated by the moving pics , but I knew I had made a mistake in the selection when she started asking `` why is that one so dark ? '' or `` I ca n't see that one so good . '' I knew that she was referring to the poor picture quality due to the frame 's low resolution and pixelation.In a nutshell , if you 're closer than 3 feet to the frame , the photos look dark and lose alot of the detail . This was a major disappointment . The fact that it has to be plugged in all the time was also a detractor , but not a deal breaker for me . I had to read the instructions the first time to access the frame 's menu options but that was no biggie.Overall - It 's just an ok product . It will give you the functionality and flexibility expected from a digital frame , but the picture quality leaves alot to be desired . I 'm shopping for a replacement at this very moment - I think my mom deserves better than just `` ok '' . I 'll probably go with the Philips or Kodak easy share as their reviews are pretty good .
 This frame does not load pictures with a USB connection . The cust . svc rep w/Westinghouse told me that they have been receiving many calls and that the product is defective . The customer service reps with Westinghouse are absolutley horrible . With that , I would never buy a Westinghouse Digital product , because after you purchase it , you are on your own if anything goes wrong .
 I got this frame as a gift , we plugged it in as the manual says and none of our computers can recognize the USB port . We tried to connect it to our digital camera and nothing!I am very very dissapointed in this digital frame . I am going to be asking for my gift receipt . I would recommend that you do n't just buy for price .
 Purchased two frames as a Christmas gifts . Could not load pictures via usb cable . Tried loading off a memory card , but the frame would only display a few pictures available to load from the card . Went out and purchased a flash drive , loaded it , attempted to load pictures from flash drive to frame . Frame did not display anything from the flash drive , as if there was nothing plugged into it .
 This is an interesting headphone design that works to keep sweat out of the headphone mechanism , but the sound quality is unbelievably bad . I thought the stock iPod earbuds were bad , but they sound worlds better than these . No bass at all .
 Dido what another reviewer said . I am a runner and have used these earphones for years . I had one pair that lasted about three years . Eventually I would ruin them with my rough handling but they fit well and had fair quality sound . When the pair I had for three years broke I could not find them in the store . I did find them on Amazon so I bought 3 pairs of them in case Sony was going to quit making them . None of the three pair lasted a month . they all broke at the hindge . Obviously Sony has out sourced these to some hack company that ca n't build quality products . I will now be suspicious of all Sony products .
 Most fragile headphones I have ever bought . Just split in half in my hands after wearing them once .
 These worked great until the left side went out , followed soon afterward by the right . I did n't expect to have to buy a new pair within a year and am disappointed .
 The thing broke the third time I took it off my head . I have a big head but it is n't that big !
 Within 2 weeks of getting these headphones , my left band snapped when removing them from my head . I 've treated them with kid gloves and still they broke ! Dont know how this got through Sony QA but they should be ashamed of this design ; after looking at these phones , unless you have a very large head where the bands are extended to full length , or extremely small head where theyre not expanded at all , you WILL BREAK THESE . Unless fully extended to distribute the little pressure , or fully closed , there is a weak point right at the top of the bands where the plastic goes from thin to thinner.The sound was okay for my needs.The comfort was pretty bad though as others have mentioned . They stay on well enough but are not at all natural feeling in and around the ears when in place.To think that these were produced with the active user in mind , with how poorly and delicately theyre engineered , keep searching for a better pair .
 Bought a pair of these and they lasted one week until they broke . I 'm a 48 year old man who uses them to listen to books on tape while commuting . Hardly a `` sports users '' . Do n't buy these unless you buy in bulk .
 I really enjoyed the sound and sweat guard , however after about a month of use one earpiece broke off when I was unfolding the headphones . I 'm clearly disappointed . Hopefully I just got a `` lemon '' .
 These headphones broke after a week of normal use . I used them for about a total 5 hours and loved them , until they suddenly broke as I was putting them on . It 's too bad , too , because they were very comfortable .
 My friend had these on and he has glasses , and he looked like a robot or something stupid . They may be good quality sound but they just look so stupid i thought i should warn you , if you have glasses , you should get better earphones , that have wires .
 These headphones may be convenient and deliver adequate sound , but I found them too uncomfortable to use . The in-ear portion is large with a sharp edge that hurt , unless I adjusted the headband until it was too loose to stay on . Foam covers would have made a big difference . Few other reviews mention discomfort , so maybe my ears are unique , but I recommend trying these on before you buy -- you 'll know quickly enough .
 I 'll echo what others have said -- even though you 'll only be able to hear my words in your right ear . Yes , after about 8 or 9 months , the left side has gone dead on my pair of these too . So annoying ! I ca n't say as how I 've treated them w / kid gloves , but I have n't been jumping up and down on 'em either . And they * are * SPORTS headphones . Oh well . Wish I could find something better ...
 I enjoyed the sound quality of these headphones , however , they are incredibly flimsy and I accidently broke off one of the ear-bud arms just by tring to take them off my head with one hand . I cannott recommend these , especially for people who are looking for something durable . Learned my lesson , guess I 'll have to buy a more expensive and better-built style .
 I know , I know ! I read the reviews and bought these headphones anyway . What can I say , I/m stupid . I just figured the other guys were way to rough . What a joke . I was sooo careful , and they sounded GREAT ! Well they sounded great until they BROKE IN HALF ! Actually , they still sound great , but it does n't matter since I can not wear them . DO N'T BE A SCHMUCK ... LIKE ME ! They lasted 2 weeks ... what a shame .
 I loved the idea of folding headphones because I store them in my gym bag daily . I consider myself a gentle user of these headphones , but my last two headsets have snapped where the folding mechanism is . I do n't know what 's going on , but it very frustrating to be out on the road for a run and all of sudden my headphones fall off . I ca n't wear the ear buds because they do n't stay in my ears , so I just purchased the sony headphones that do not fold and hoping for better luck.I do not recommed these to anyone who uses headphones regularly .
 Good sound but way to brittle at extension piece . I 've had two in two months . Each broke at the slider entension . Each time I did not apply that much force to make it break . I 've had sony sports headphones before but these are not worth buying if they break so easly . If you buy them and treat them with kit gloves then they will probably be worth the money , but who really baby 's their headphones esp . if they are sports related . I 'll try ear piece wraparounds next time .
 Well , the other reviews were right . They break entirely too easily . I bought a pair and they were great for my workouts . But one day I was extending one of the earphone legs and it snapped in half . But I liked the phones so much , and they were cheap , so I figured , `` I can afford to buy these if I can get six months or so use of them . '' So I bought two more pairs and was really careful with these.Well they lasted about six months each and I went to buy more pairs but the price went up 50 % ! So I 'm switching to something that might last longer.There are three potential break points
 These headphones are indeed a step up from the Apple ear buds if you take your iPod on a run . Initially , these headphones were just the ticket . They folded up nicely in my carry-on -LRB- I travel weekly -RRB- , and were VERY secure on my runs.Then they broke . Then I kicked myself for not taking to heart the many other reviews indicating their fragility.As noted in other reviews , it would be much better to have a metal band running through the headset rather than it being made of separate plastic components . But that 's what you get for the price .
 These headphones are the least durable sports headphones I have ever owned . They do possess a good sound and unlike other headphones , it 's tough to block any sound or music with too much sweat.BUT , BUT , BUT ... I just broken my second set . They are made of a really brittle plastic so they are not good for any kind of more intense working out .
 I wish I listened to these reviews . I bought 2 , since I am a gentle person with my stuff , and each of them snapped into pieces -LRB- as described below -RRB- in just a few days . This is a shoddy product .
 this product is pure junk.I used it with my ipod , and it broke only after 3 days.I bought it because I sweat alot.On the 3rd day at the gym , the volume in both sides would not go above a certain point . too low for me to hear.I know it was n't my ipod because when I bought a new pair of a different brand of headphones , the volume problem disapeared!I brought them back to Best Buy for my money back
 I really loved these headphones , right up until they broke 2 weeks later . I was n't rough on them a bit , I was folding them back up after a workout , and snap they went . I would suggest the Nike SHJ045 Headband Headphones . Far better quality .
 I bought three pairs of these and they all have broken within one month . They snap right near the folding joint with the slightest overstress . The sound is good , but I 'm very disappointed with the durability . I had an old Sony metal band folding sport headphone that lasted for many years that I wish they still sold . If you buy these , make sure to get some plastic glue and a pin punch so you can take them apart and repair them . You 'll need it .
 Like many others , I had these headphones for about 6 months , when one side stopped working . The replacement pair broke in half under very little pressure . When these work , they are very good for exercise , but they are not sturdy enough to recommend .
 I tried two pair of these . I loved the fit . Sound was fine . They actually stayed in my ears during speed intervals , which is more than I can say for the three other options I 've tried . But they break SO easily ! First pair broke at the hinge where they fold after I 'd only used them two times . I thought it was me and ran out to get another pair.This morning as I went to put on the second pair after NEVER using them , they broke at the top hinge . If these work for you , you have my congratulations . But I did n't feel I handled them roughly at all and felt they would n't hold up to any wear at all . Since the earbuds I 've tried do n't stay in my ears over the course of the run , I 'm still looking for the perfect set of sport headphones .
 These were nice while they lasted -- did n't fall out of my ears , did n't deplete the battery on my mp3 player too quickly . But they broke after just a couple months of normal use -LRB- by which I mean that I used them a lot , but never tried to fold them -RRB- . Keep shopping -- these are not good headphones .
 Like so many others here , I 'm on my 4th pair . All of them were great , until the left headphone went out after a few months . For the last one , it went out after 7 months : -LRB- I keep buying them because they 're great while they last .
 Okay , I had a similar style of these before when I would go running in L.A. and they lasted me for about a year , which is not great , but passable , I think.So I needed to replace the previous pair , and I bought these , because I liked the way they folded up , and I liked how they stayed in my ears and on my head during running.Well ! What a sad fate these headphones suffered -- the left side went out ! Apparently this has happened to a lot of people and I think Sony should reimburse us ! Of course , they wo n't . And it 's not serious enough for a lawsuit . But these headphones really are inordinately expensive for the level of quality they offer.If they ever fix this problem with the sound going out on one side , these would get a 4 or 5 star review . But if after two months , the sound goes out , that 's just lame man . I thought my sweat had something to do with it . I think it 's just poor engineering now . Avoid ! * until Sony recognizes the problem and comments on it publicly . yeah right !
 These are good enough for what I need in headphones for walking around , but they always break . I mean , I understand that everything will eventually break - but things are only inexpensive if they last a reasonable amount of time . If these cost $ 15 and you need to buy 4 pairs a year , compared to ones that cost $ 25 and they last two years , the latter are the less expensive pair.Being cheap , I would prefer if these would just not break so easily - and it is n't that I 'm being rough with them - I treat them well , but eventually they die -LRB- usually the sound goes out in the left ear -RRB- . I am no longer going to get these , fool me ... 4 times . Doh !
 I 've been running with headphones for more than 20 years . Sony used to make great sport headphones but not anymore . These are a total waste of money . First , the cord is way too long so I have to wrap it around my wrist . Second , the headband is n't adjustable and since it 's made for a bigger head than mine it does n't stay put . Third , the earpiece is too big and does n't stay in my ears . Sony made a great little sport headphone years ago . I do n't know why they did n't just stick with it .
 The good
 This product suppose to be a sport gadget and there for I use it only in the gym and put it with all my stuff in my bag.I do n't know why but one time , after 10 times of use when I just open them it broke in the joint with no reasonable reason.So be ready It have a good voice but It will break no matter what you do .
 I really liked these when I first purchased them , and have gone through several cheap bud-type headphones in the past ... average life span of the cheapies was 2-3 months . These lasted almost 5 months
 I loved these headphones . Good sound , good moisture/sweat resistance , stayed put in my ears way more comfortably than the ear buds that came with my 30GB iPod . I used them several times each week -- at the gym , and on long runs outside . I was careful with them , seeing as the plastic was thin , and having read the other reviewers on Amazon . And then all of a sudden , the headband broke as I was getting on the treadmill this week , not even dropping or squeezing or crushing them in any peculiar way ...
 Purchased a pair of these from best buy for around $ 20 . Sounded great and were great for the gym . Broke while I was lifting the headphones off my head at work -LRB- desk job -RRB- . The place it broke was just above the part where you adjust the length of the bottom portion of headband , just above the 6 little bumps . I also notice the plastic is turning white where it folds at the top . Shitty plastic can not stand up to normal use.Took it back to Best Buy but they refused to give me a replacement pair or refund , even though I took it back within 30 days of purchase and with original receipt . They said because the break is considered physical damage , the return policy is void . I said it broke during normal use as I was taking it off my head , the manager told me I am supposed to lift it from the part of the band with the little dots and that the packaging should have instructions to do that ; I showed her the packaging which did not mention that at all . I said the product was defective , but she corrected me that a product is only considered defective if it was broken while still in the package .
 The quality of these headphones are not up to par . I went through two sets of these within 45 days ; therefore I would n't recommend that anyone purchase these headphones . Sony should WITHDRAW this item from the market !!
 I foolishly ignored many of the reviews here stating how easily these headphones broke . I 've been a happy owner of folding Sony sport headphones for over 15 years and never had a problem , so I assumed these headphones would work just as well . For a month they worked alright -LRB- although there were notably more uncomfortable than previous models due to a slightly larger earbud that did n't fit well in my ear -RRB- . I went running yesterday wearing a sweatband and my earbud filled up with sweat -LRB- I dunno what the sweat guard was supposed to do , but it did n't work this time -RRB- . I pulled the earbud out far enough to try to get some moisture out of my ear -LRB- something I 've done with every other Sony headset I 've owned -RRB- and `` SNAP ! '' there it went . Now I only wish someone other than Sony -LRB- or some weird discount brand -RRB- made these style of headsets as well as they used to ...
 I 've been through two pair of these , and each one broke just by putting it on . Like the other reviews say , they are not worth the money .
 Mine broke after just a few weeks . Snapped at joint where headphone extends . Good sound but poorly designed .
 1 . I got these to replace my old / yellow Sony sports headphones -LRB- similar design -RRB- .2 . They sound fine , but as one of the other reviewers noted -- > these headphones are very poorly constructed ; I broke them within 2 weeks -LRB- the weak joint is the plastic part that moves in / out -RRB- . I thought , `` ok , my fault , I 'll be more careful '' -- > thus I bought another pair -- > broke those as well , while just routinely opening them up etc. . .3 . Since these are to be used by folks doing sports etc. . . I ca n't understand why Sony made such a poorly constructed headphone .
 My second one just stopped working . Each one lasted for less than a year . I was a Sony fan but now I 'll try other brands .
 I 've tried this one a few times , since I liked a previous model . These are way too fragile and the plastic near the joint has broken within a week twice . Last year 's model was more durable.The sound was good and they did keep a good sound after I had some very sweaty exercise.But I 've needed to keep the headphones together with tape , so I 'm looking for another style .
 If I had given these headphones a review two or three months ago , I definitely would have given them four or five stars -- they 've been my favorite headphones for years . Not necessarily because of the sound quality -LRB- quite passable but definitely not audiophile quality -RRB- , but for the compact convenience of them
 I noticed a number of other reviews with the same problem , so I thought I might as well chime in . Yes , I have the same problem , namely the left side of the headphones went out after only 3 or 4 uses in the gym -LRB- there was no excessive or rough treatment of the headphones at all -RRB- . My old headphones from about 8 years ago lasted for 8 years under the exact same conditions -LRB- until I accidentally snapped them -RRB-
 WOW ! I thought I was going crazy
 I 'm a big runner -LRB- 6 miles a day -RRB- and these headphones are the best for comfort . But - be warned - they do not last . I 've been using them for several years and have never gotten more than a few months out of a pair . In the past , I 've gotten a warranty and just traded them in , but they now are making the warranty process more difficult.If you 're looking for sports headphones - these are good . If you 're looking for headphones that last , I would look elsewhere .
 Excellent sound quality and good base . They are very fragile . Snapped at the hinge after one week of use .
 I think this is the first time in years I have felt compelled to write a review on Amazon.On first use , these headphones are okay . They sound relatively good , although the sounds tends to break up a bit at higher frequencies . They feel relatively good , although it took my ears a few painful days to get used to the pressure in my ears.The problem ? THEY BREAK EASILY . I went through two pairs in three weeks . Both times , the cheap plastic snapped in half . And , for the record , I was not tough on them . This was after using them only on my daily commute.Bottom line , these headphones are junk . It 's too bad . Look at another model , and beware -- because , if you buy them , these will break on you , too .
 I 've had this model headphones for like 4 years now . Each year I have had to replace them cause one of the earphones would die ... but that didnt bother me that much with how much I was using them . The last 2 I bought in the last 3 months have been horrible . The quality of the plastic has drastically decreased . Both have snapped at the hindge point hear the ear buds . Both times they occured while they were in my gym bag . Until they correct this , I can not recommend this product .
 hope you got a good price , because these will break quickly due to the cheap plastic and lack of quality .
 I was very happy with these headphones at first ... and that lasted for about a week . If you would like to purchase a new pair of headphones every week , then be my guest and buy these now . The sound was very good . They were pretty comfortable . Unfortunately , I did not have time to try out the `` sweat guard mechanism '' before they broke , so I am unable to comment on that.I assume if you have a very small head , then you might not have the issue that I did . I do n't have an unusually large head or anything ... pretty much average size ... maybe these things were meant for kids ? But if you have to increase the size of these things at all , you will see that the piece of plastic inside that holds them together is literally about the width/strength of about 3 toothpicks !! When you extend the length of the sides of these headphones at all , that thin piece of plastic is the only thing standing between your nice new headphones and a worthless tangle of broken plastic and wire that is now sitting on the floor right beside me.Why not try fixing them ? Would n't a little krazy glue put these things back together so the money spent would not be a COMPLETE waste ? Yes ... krazy glue DOES work to put the pieces back together . And then about 10 minutes after I had put them back on my head , they snapped again !! The glue held -LRB- I definitely recommend purchasing Krazy Glue for all of your gluing needs ! -RRB- , but the plastic snapped again about 1/4 inch from the orginal breaking point . So , knowing that the glue worked , I tried it again . And it worked again . Then I tried to put the headphones back on , and they snapped immediately on the other side -LRB- opposite from the original 2 breaks -RRB- !! At this point , I cursed for a few minutes , asked myself when Sony stopped making quality electronics products -LRB- I had a Sony walkman that I got when I was a kid that still works today , over 15 years later ... although the headphones broke long ago ... haha -RRB- , AND I decided to give up on these headphones . I recommend that you do the same .
 The plastic hindge at the top of the fold broke after about 3 months of use . The good sound quality is of no use if the item is broken !
 These headphones snapped when I went to pick them up but one side got caught underneath something . They broke , and it surprised me a lot since I 've never had a pair of headphones break so easily before . I had read another review that said they broke easily , but I thought it wouldnt happen to me because its not like I put them to rough use . But with simple household use , it did ! Not happy about that .
 Like every other bad reviewer my pair broke within 3 months . I barely even touched them and they just snapped apart . -LRB- Strangely enough , when I got angry and tried to crush them completely they put up quite a fight . -RRB- Good sound , bad quality plastic .
 They fit well and had good sound quality but broke in half within a couple of weeks . My husband was just putting them on his head and they snapped in half . We were very disappointed .
 The headphones do sound great but they break with little effort . I 've had two break at the same place in less than two weeks and I was ultra careful the second time . If you must buy them , better buy a dozen so they last a month or two .
 these headphones were comfy , and i liked the white `` sporty '' detailing , but they broke on one side at the hinge within a few months . i took them out of my backpack , unfolded them , and * snap * ! it was often in my backpack 's outer pocket , but with heavy books & a laptop , i might have put too much pressure on it at times .
 The sound is fine and they work well for exercise until they break . I have had 2 pair break each with a couple months of purchase at one of the 2 bottom hinges The guy next to me at the gym had the same thing happen as well . I would recommend an alternative that does n't fold up .
 I only had these for a few weeks before one of the arms broke off at the pivot point -LRB- where the arm that has the ear bud on it folds up -RRB- . It did n't break from rough use either ; it broke just from me unfolding them . I super-glued the arm back on and that worked for about a week until they broke again ; in a different spot !! At that point I gave up and decided I needed a more durable pair of headphones . The sound quality was excellent and they were very comfortable to wear , but you apparently need to wear kid-gloves to handle them .
 These headphones have great sound and they stay on your head.Downside - 1 . Sweatguard does n't work well 2 . One side broke after a couple weeks .
 The product worked well and was comfortable , but quite a few reviews talked about how fragile they were . As careful as I was folding them and caring form them , after about 1 month I accidently flexed them the wrong direction and the hinge on one side snapped and broke , rendering the headphones useless .
 I would give the headphone 4 stars if sony knows how to make them more durable . the material used is very cheap and fragile , a little bit of force would brake it from the junction very easily . I guess this is how sony make money by force you to buy frequently . the sound quality is ok . but if you keep the headphone more than 20 mins in your ear , it will start to hurt your ear canal because of the pressure . After broke my two headphones in 3 months , it is enough for me . Try another model or brand if you want a quality built headphone .
 In the last 2 months I have gone through 2 sets of these . The first set broke at the top hinge , then one of the arms holding the ear piece snapped . I foolishly bought a 2nd set , and the same exact thing happened ! Luckily I was able to return one set -LRB- did n't have receipt for the other -RRB- . I would not purchase this product !!
 I liked these headphones , but they were all plastic . The adjustable part broke after three weeks . I super glued them several times then tossed the over-the-head band . I still have the speaker parts ; a baseball cap will hold them in place while I am searching for new headphones . I would not buy them again .
 Total piece of garbage . The left earpiece died within two weeks of use , the right earpiece died about a week later . Visible cracks in the wire casing , exposing the copper wires . No complaints about the sound , just the terrible , terrible quality and poor durability . I did not abuse these any more than a typical runner/gym-goer . Most of the time they lived in a small zippered compartment in my gym bag , now they are in the garbage .
 Broke when folding gently after one month of running with them.Very uncomfortable for ear , would never buy again.If this is supposed to be for sport use it 's a joke .
 The sound was `` okay '' ... after all , they 're Sony , so the sound 's not going to be great to begin with . I purchased mine at Best Buy , not thru Amazon , just for the record . After only a week or so of use , the band snapped in two while putting them on ; I had not stretched them apart any farther than I would any other set of headphones .
 I have had these headphones since May 07 . I have not been impressed with these at all . They have broken at every joint now . I have had to super glue the ear pieces back on , and now yesterday the center joint broke when I was putting them on . Will not be buying these again !!
 These headphones sound great and stay on while working out , but ... DO NOT BUY THEM - I have snapped several pairs in the past 6 months and have switched to ear buds . Horrible quality - they 'd be better with no hinges .
 I have been buying and replacing these headphones for a few years now . The left side always stops working after a few months . I know they take a lot of sweat but it is always the left side . My most recent pair only worked one month . I think it is time for me to find another cheap pair for workouts , since I 'm pretty aggravated with the durability .
 These headphone had great sound , until they crapped out . I used them exclusively at the gym , and on a fairly regular basis , one side or the other would go out from sweat . Maybe I sweat more than the average person , but I bought these especially because they were supposed to be designed with the gym in mind.After they would dry out , they would usually work again . Until finally they did n't . At the gym , one side went out , and has never come back , weeks later .
 These were perfect for exercise -LRB- held on my head very well -RRB- until they broke in just under a year . I was n't even putting any particular pressure on them . I will stay away from Sony in the future .
 Usually the headphone 's speakers go bad -LRB- too much sweat/moisture I 'm guessing -RRB- . Recently this happened and I bought Sony 's latest offering . After 2 weeks , the flimsy plastic snapped . Others here have complained about the same thing . so buyer beware
 I have owned three pairs of these headphones and do not plan to buy another pair . They have a great fit and good sound but the ear buds short out after 6 months to a year . Unforunately , these are the only pair of headphones I could find in electronic stores that have this type of fit and compatibility . I wish another brand would come out with a similar style !
 I 'm a ridiculous headphone snob , so I do n't live with headphones/earphones that do n't meet up to my standards . And these do n't live up to my standards . The sound is okay , but the biggest problem is that they do n't fit very well in the ear . You can push them right up against the ear canal , but leaving them there for more than five minutes caused my ears to hurt like crazy . Then I push them back on my ear , but then I lose ALL bass response . So , back to the store they go.Trust me , if your ears are sensitive to pressure , these headphones will kill your ears to the point where it 's uncomfortable to wear them even more than an hour .
 Broke 3 times in 3 different spots within 3 weeks ! Cheap brittle plastic breaks very easily . The sound is great , and the waterproof is great , but what good is that if you ca n't wear them . I 'm not very rough with them either.Do yourself a favor and buy the version that does not fold up . I had those for years and bought the fold up ones because I lost my non-fold up version . The non-foldup version has the same sound , very durable , and seem to last forever .
 I 'm not especially rough on my gear but I 've had to tape these `` sports '' headphones up three times after they kept breaking . They are really brittle . They break off at the part above the earphones and the middle part that goes over your head They do sound good but just do n't handle them alot and be very careful when putting them on or taking them off because they do n't bend well , they just snap . You may think I 'm over exagerating but I 'm not . You need to slip them off very gingerly or else you 'll end up with two or more pieces in both hands.I 've had other sports headphones before that were far more durable -LRB- and flexible -RRB- . After these are gone for good I 'm getting another brand . I recommed you keep looking for a different brand as well .
 I 've used these particular headphones for years because I * love * the sound quality , bass , fit , portability , lack of sound leakage , and extra long cord . I bought three pairs of them two weeks ago off Amazon since they usually short out after a year or so , and the price was only $ 10 . TWO OF THEM ARE ALREADY BROKEN . I was wearing the second pair last night while holding my 7-month-old daughter , who pulled at them and they snapped in two.It 's a shame , because these were the perfect headphones for me . Sometime in the past year or so , Sony must have started using a different plastic , because previous versions of these headphones were far more durable . The cost-cutting measures of big businesses really piss me off sometimes .
 The ear pieces are not as comfortable as I had hoped and the cord is shorter than I expected . The head part seems very cheap , but the ear pieces are good quality and will not fall out . Hopefully they will last longer than some of my headphones in the past , but overall , I think this item is a bit overpriced .
 I 've gone through 2 pair of these . I like the design and the fit of them even though I 'm not a fan of in the ear/bud earphones.However - the headset portion that folds and fits over the head is made of the most brittle plastic I 've ever had on a pair of headphones . I thought the first break was a fluke . The second pair died as the first - to a break in the plastic that fits over the head as I was putting them on.Careful as you may be - these WILL break .
 I 'm amazed at all the people who 've given this three plus stars even though they 've broken multiple units . They are decent , while they work , but for the price of three sets you could get something better to begin with . They are good for working out , but my first set broke after three months . I figured I 'd be more careful with the second set , but they broke after 1 month . Both broke at the hinges , just like everyone else 's . Now I 'm out the money spent on those two sets and I have to invest more $ $ in something decent that will last . These are garbage , save yourself the aggravation and buy something better .
 I had a hard time finding headphones that suit my needs - -LRB- wo n't fall off and sweatproof -RRB- . I was excited to finally come upon these . I bought my first pair and really enjoyed them , that is , until they snapped one day as I was picking them up . I thought maybe I 'd been more rough with them than I thought . I ordered another pair and used them for a few months . Then , last night as I was getting my stuff together to go to the gym - SNAP ! I could n't believe it . My husband looked at them and said they are poorly designed with only a thin mechanism holding the hinges together . I 'm very careful with things , so it was not due to rough mis-handling . They are supposed to fold easily , but the slightest wrong move and they are done . I guess my search will now resume for a good pair of headphones , because I 'm not willing to waste any more money on these .
 I 've been searching for a decent pair of headphones to use while running and settled on these as they were the only ones available at the various stores in my neighborhood . They work just fine , but are very flimsy and because of that are prone to snapping in half -LRB- which mine did within 2 weeks -RRB- . I 'm now searching the web to find a better pair , but would recommend you stay away from these as the plastic parts are just to weak and prone to breaking .
 I owned these headphones for about 3 months & absolutely loved it . I used it while working out & it fit perfectly . Good sound ; felt comfortable in the ears ; & quite compact . But as others have noted ; it snapped in 2 pieces at the joints . Would not recommend these .
 if you are going to keep these in a gentle place , such as on your desk , they will be pretty good , as they sound great for the money.but , if you 're gon na take em to the gym or anyplace , THEY 'LL BUST , just like all else say . just the slightest pressure OUTWARD and the 1/8 inch thick piece between the head piece and ear piece snaps.i bought four pairs -LRB- gym , desk , office , extra -RRB- . the only one that did n't break within a couple of months is the one on my office desk , where it only has to travel from the desktop to my head and back .
 I really liked these things at first because they actually stayed in my ears ; however -1 . They hurt your ears if they stay in for any length of time -LRB- hard , jagged plastic poking into the sides of your ears -RRB- AND2 . I was just barely handling the things at the gym , and the adjustment piece SNAPPED APART!These things are ENTIRELY too fragile ! Sony should be ashamed . They used to have metal where this fragile plastic is today . I can not say it enough - SHAME ON SONY FOR MAKING SUCH TRASH !
 They function well , but they break easily . I have gone through two of them now . I have learned my lesson now and will go for another brand next .
 these headphones are awful . They break very easily and I do n't have a strenuous workout in the gym . My first pair snapped but I went back for more and bought another pair that broke within a week . BEWARE !!!!!!!!
 ... literally!I have n't seen this in my quick perusal of other 's reviews , so I thought I should mention this problem.I bought these earphones for running on the treadmill at the gym - there are TVs in front of the treadmills you can listen to via headphone only . I 'd been using the over-the-ear headphones that sit on top or your ears , with pads , but the pads would eventually break up after extended usage . I thought these padless earphones , with the ability to fold up and carry in my pocket after my run , would fit the bill -LRB- sound quality was not a big criteria -RRB- . Well I 've never been able to use these on a treadmill without getting a small shock in my ear canals , at least once the treadmill starts up . I plug them in , turn on the TV - all good . Once I start the treadmill , however , the shocks start . I can last about 30 seconds -LRB- well , I thought the shocks would stop ! -RRB- before having to take them off.I 'm not convinced it 's the earphones fault , but something ai n't right -LRB- is it the sweat guard mechanism ? -RRB- . I 've tried other treadmills and waited until the weather warmed thinking it was just the dry air , and still no go . I can use them in an Ipod style device while walking down the the street and all is good - it 's definately something with the treadmill/earphone combination -LRB- I 've gone back to my old style earphones and all is well - no shocks -RRB- . I 'd guess others are n't having the same experience or these would have been recalled by now - I 'm just passing on my findings . Also , lastly , I really am tired of untangling these cords from the folded-up earphones - a tiresome process I have to repeat every time I pull them out of my pocket . I think these are headed for the trash bin .
 I bought two pairs of these headphones before I learned my lesson , do not make the same mistake . Thess things lasted me literally three days at the gym before starting to spas-out . Please let 's send a message to SONY that we are not fools . DO NOT BUY < DO NOT BUT > DO NOT BUY ...
 This product was advertised as being the perfect workout headphone , but while it is convenient for workouts , it is terribly designed with absolutely the worst sound quality I have ever heard . In its capacity of ` keeping sweat from getting into your ear ' , it does the job well , although the truth is that the problem of sweat is n't really a problem and should come secondary to sound quality . Unfortunately , that is about the only thing that these headphones do well . First of all , they can barely fit into your ear , and trust me , I have never had that kind of a problem with headphones before . Secondly , the folding mechanism is poorly done and is hard to manage . Thirdly , the sound quality is absolutely terrible . The bass is completely non-existant and the sound seems ` flat ' , meaning that these headphones do n't deliver crisp , clean , rich sound that I expect in all of my headphones -LRB- and I own 3 in total -RRB- . Truth be told , I would much rather work out with uncomfortable and big headphones than with these clunky , lousy ` sport ' headphones .
 As I recieved these headphones , I was excited . I had a pair just like these for years and they had finally succumbed to the stress and overwork that I put them through . I pulled them out of the box , excited and ready to listen to some good music . What happened next I never expected ... as I unfolded them , the right extension snapped clean off . Now I 'm waiting hopefully for a refund . If you 're not going to fold them up , it might be worth the money . If you are going to fold them , look for another pair .
 There should be an obvious note when purchasing that they are shipping via USPS because I entered our physical address thinking it would be shipped via UPS . We do n't receive USPS mail at our physical address , so it got sent back and the seller would n't ship a new one until they received the old one back . It took almost OVER a month from the day I ordered it until the day I received it . Also , when emailing the seller , it was difficult to get a response most of the time .
 The earphones are defective . Only one side works . It took a while to recieve the product and the product was defective . Not a good buy .
 I have found that these are the best headphones for exercise other then the fact that one side WILL stop working . When they work , I love them . I primarily use them in the gym . But I had them on last night at the beginning of a 3 hour train ride . I took them off for a few minutes to buy a coffee at the snack bar but the left was no longer working when I put them back on . I was n't sweating or rough on them . I had n't dropped them . It 's frustraing ! Sony will replace them for free but you have to exchange them for a refurbished -LRB- used -RRB- pair . Oh , and you also have to pay $ 15.70 in fees , if you do choose to accept the used replacement headphones ! Just wish they were reliable . They 've been on the market for years.From Sony
 I 've had four pairs of these headphones ; each pair has snapped at the earpiece . The first two pairs lasted a good long while before breaking but recently I broke two pairs in two weeks . -LRB- Fortunately I had a replacement plan so the second was free . -RRB- The foldability is n't worth it . Go for the much cheaper and far more durable ones that do n't fold .
 I 've gone through two of these . They broke within a few months of purchase .
 First of all these are SUPER UNCOMFORTABLE . I suppose that all ears are different , but these felt like somebody had stuck blades in my ears . The edges are very sharp , and their size seemed to big for my ear canal , so it felt like they were going to slice up my inner ear . This never actually happened of course , but it was really uncomfortable , especially during exercise.Second , today they broke . I did n't do anything extreme , I just picked them up -LRB- while folded -RRB- by one of the buds and it broke off in my hand like I had lost a wishbone pulling contest . I 'VE HAD THESE FOR LESS THAN TWO MONTHS . Inexcusable.I do not recommend these under any circumstance . There are much better exercise earphones out there . Sony actually makes a good one , the Sony MDR-J11G . Get those . These , on the other hand , are awful ; an utterly frustrating and worthless purchase.I do n't usually write reviews , but I do n't usually get slighted like this . Buyer beware , purchase at your own risk , etc. .
 Seriously -- these are total junk . The plastic near the joint snapped right away , just from putting them on . I 've had sturdier balsa wood airplanes.The sound is okay for the price , but what 's the point if they break right away ?
 After 8 months one speaker stopped working , as others have reported . Before that , they were great for running.I expect headphones to last much longer . I would n't buy this product again .
 I 'd read the warnings about the hinges snapping prior to purchase but bought a pair of these thinking `` Aha ! I 'll simply be more gentle than these oafs ! `` The middle hinge snapped two weeks later while I was lifting them off of my head . Fine . The Amazon folks were right . A little snip of duct tape , I 'm good.Four weeks later , the cord got snagged on a drawer knob and the left hinge snapped after a gentle tug . Seriously
 Earbuds snapped off on both sides accidentally without much force . Sound quality is decent . Handle with extreme caution !
 I really like these headphones for the 2 or 3 months that they work . The first pair I bought the left ear stopped working after 2 or 3 months . Sony sent me a replacement and the left ear stopped working after 2 or 3 months . I am giving the additional star just because the headphones are really nice while they work .
 I like these headphones because they are water resistant , and they fold up nicely . They have fair sound quality , but more than adequate for using at the gym.The bad news is because they fold up there are 3 different hinges on them which I have managed to break 7-10 different times . My record life span for a pair of these headphones is 6 months . Typically they break within about 3 months.The reason I keep buying them is because they are cheap , and for the 13 bucks you can beat on them for 3 months until they break , but I am tired of replacing them now.If you are looking for something that lasts and is durable , steer clear of these headphones . If you are doing anything other than using them to work out , they are junk .
 I bought two of these for my morning runs and let me tell you they both broke in less than a month . Someone wrote a review saying that short of stepping on them they will not break , that is total nonsense , they are poorly made , and the plastic on the hinges broke on both of them . I was very carful with them and they snapped at the same hinge , BOTH of them . Sony makes other headphones much better , do n't waste your time or money ...
 I have owned more pairs of these folding headphones because of comfort & sound quality but durable they are NOT !!! go for modelW25 instead , they will last because they are FLEXIBLE !! I am gutted everytime the others break & I am careful taking them off & putting them on !! I have wasted so much money as I am the headphone queen ! please be wise & get Sony to improve the folding type !!
 If you are thinking of purchasing these headphones take the following into consideration :1 . I am not interested in sound once I can hear my music , and these work pretty well .2 . It does not fall off and stays ` locked ' on your head .3 . Those stupid foldable hinges are A WASTE OF TIME !!!! I repeat ... A WASTE OF TIMIE !!! I have purchased 2 within the last month !!!! They snap EASILY !!! Do n't believe the description that says u can put them in your jeans or bag or anywhere ... or else SNAP !!! 3 . The moisture guard that supposedly wicks sweat away is A WASTE OF TIME !! My headphones -LRB- the 2 pairs I have purchased -RRB- became clogged with sweat when I began working out , thus resulting in only one ear plug working . In order to get the non-working side working , I had to suck the sweat out of the ear plug -LRB- hey it 's my ear and sweat ! -RRB- . I gave this one star as what is the point if the sound is good and it does not fall out when the WASTE OF TIME HEADPHONES KEEPS BREAKING !? So if you got time to waste I suggest u purchase at least 10 pairs of these to keep u going .
 I 've bought this product twice , and both times they 've broken in the same place -LRB- first time was n't a fluke it appears -RRB- . They are especially weak in the thin extendable part -LRB- between upper head piece and the `` sweat '' resitent thicker part -RRB- . Also , sweat still gets in ear and clogs sound holes , so really , go for the cheaper headphones , which work just as well and last longer .
 Sony typically makes good products . I had been searching for an inexpensive headphones set for my workout at the YMCA . I purchased this because it was inexpensive , made by Sony , and designed for workouts . Okay , the headphones lasted about one month before the sound became scratchy and I could n't hear the sound out of one ear . Apparently the sweat or moisture has dripped down into the earpiece . Returning it to amazon.com is not an option at this point but I can certainly return it to Sony for a replacement under their 90 day warranty . You get what you pay for even applies to the most reputable companies . The cost of the headphones has increased by shipping costs to Sony plus my initial investment of $ 13.99 . Apparently these headphones while designed for workouts require more care than anticipated .
 I picked up these headphones to replace a pair of Aiwa HP-JS35 I used for jogging . The Aiwas had quit on me within a few months . The Sony headphones are well designed , they fold up for easy portability in a tri-fold design . They also sound reasonable as far as in-the-ear headphones go . As with the Aiwas , the left ear piece stopped functioning after a few months . These outlasted the Aiwas , but that 's a small consolation . I do sweat a fair amount on a 10K run , but the description , which sold me on the Sony headphones , reads : Water-resistant - stands up to rain , snow and occasional splashingMoisture Guard Mechanism pulls sweat away from ear canalApparently , the moisture guard is a gimmick , because the left ear piece shorted out from the sweat . I 've been looking for another pair of headphones , but so far , I have n't found a pair that would be suitable to take on my jogs . I 'm using my iPod earphones while I keep looking , but I do n't expect them to hold up with repeated use as they 're not designed for exercise .
 The headphones are light and great for workouts but they break very easily . Not a good choice if you engage in rigorous workouts - I 'm still looking for headphones that get the job done right .
 These have reasonably good sound , however they are very uncomfortable and after about 10 minutes hurt tremendously . Perhaps they are designed for a different size ear than mine ! For me , I would not recommend these headphones unless you have a high pain tolerance .
 If you have small ears and sweat alot not much works and these do n't either . Furthermore these headphones are not build any better than any other folding headphone I 've seen . No Go . Where can I get some ear phones that work with that sweats alot when he runs and has small ears . I have to wear a head band to keep them in ... and I 'm 6 ' 1 200 lbs ... go figure . email me yipcarl@aol.com if you have a suggestion I have been looking for years.ThanksRyan
 I have a pair of light weight headphones from Radio Shack -LRB- Titanium Pro A35 -RRB- and I was looking for something a little smaller , lower profile . While these Sony phones are in the same price range , they 're NOT in the same realm when it comes to sound quality . I can only describe the sound as `` very muddy '' . There 's plenty of bass response , but overall they sound like I had cotton in my ears . If you are at all interested phones that will accurately represent your music , try something other than these .
 At first , I thought it was just expected that headphones would have a limited life . However , on my second purchase of the same Sony headphones , I found out that the left ear stopped having audio after ONLY 2 MONTHS!This appears to be a problem with the wiring , but it is annoying that Sony , a well-respected name in consumer audio , can sell such a shoddy product . I have reported my complaint to Sony customer service , but have not received a reply yet.Do not buy this product OR any Sony headphone unless you are already deaf in one ear , preferably your left .
 I have owned these headphones many a times , and up until 5 months ago I would n't have bought another pair out there for sport purposes . They have always provided what I needed in a sport headphone , but like I said , until 5 months ago . Recently , the last 2 pairs I 've bought , have broken in similar fashion while NOT IN USE . I used each pair while running and lifting , nothing too crazy , but they broke extremely easily around the first joint coming up from the ear bud . I was just moving them about my room or on/off my head and they snapped . Nothing extreme . I was very disappointed . I had recommended them to my girlfriend and hers broke , but in the top middle portion . Honestly I think Sony has changed something in their manufacturing process to produce such poor quality . BUY SOMETHING ELSE !
 I concur . They sound fine , but Sony must have intentionally made them easy to snap -LRB- I do not presume they hire stupid engineers -RRB- .
 I have purchased two of these and both have broken . Others have criticised the fragility of the headband . Believe it , the band it too fragile . They always break at the thin plastic retractable part . I love the sound and the convenience -LRB- they fold up to pack easily -RRB- , but after buying two now , and having no running earphones , I guess I will look for a different product .
 I 've gone through many different sets of headphones as a runner and I 'm always looking for some that are comfortable , stay in my ear , and do n't break . I 've never found a set that meets all three criteria . These phones have pretty decent sound , but did not stay in my ear very well , especially once I started sweating . The phones would sit in my ear okay , but if I wanted really good sound I would have to push down on the bud into my eardrum and instantly it would sound twice as good/loud . After I would start to sweat , the buds would gradually get looser and move farther from my ear drum . On really long runs they would even pop out of my ear completely.In addition to the eardrum fit , I did not like the way they fit over the head . I would have to adjust the phones and tighten them at least once a mile , and I could n't wear a cap or head covering in the winter with these as they 're too stiff to put anything over . The cord from the phones is pretty bad too , as it twists into itself just slightly and is never truly straight . Finally , I do n't know what the Sweat Guard Mechanism is for because the functionality of these phones drops 50 % at least once I started sweating . And like every pair of phones I 've had , they went mono and the left phone eventually stopped working , almost surely because it was ruined by sweat.I would have given these phones 2 stars because , despite how cheap they are , they did last me around 200 miles of use , which is more than most phones last me , but I have to give it 1 because they specifically advertise it in a way that makes you think it is `` sweat-proof , '' but I can almost guarantee you if you sweat enough these phones will eventually succumb to it , just like pretty much every sport headphone on the market today .
 I 've owned no fewer than 4 of these things , and I 'll never buy another . Every one has broken in the same place , the plastic slider just below the hinge . It 's a real shame that an otherwise well designed headset should be constructed with a flimsy thin PLASTIC slider at a critical stress point . The reason I bought 3 -LRB- got the forth one under warranty - it also broke -RRB- is that I could n't find another headset that collapsed so compactly . What 's wrong with the marketplace that a competitor ca n't beat Sony to the market with a better product ? Message to Sony
 When I bought these ` phones I was a little hesitant because other people had problems with them breaking . They seemed fine for 2 months . In fact , they are very good headphones - espcially for running.For months I handled these ` phones like they were eggshells because they look delicate and they have a history of breaking . They broke anyway . I was simply putting them on my head and they broke.Don ' t buy them . Ante up a few more dollars and get something you wo n't have to replace . Junk .
 You would think , by this being a sony product , that it would be of good quality . However , I did n't use it very long nor was I in any way rough in my use and my headphones have already snapped in two . I used them only for running and with my ipod and as I was removing them from my head one day , they just broke at the joint on the top , where the headphones bend . I tried clicking them back together , but a crucial plastic piece was broken . Then , I tried the duck tape remedy but now only one side of the earphones works .
 I brought 2 of these at the same time to save on shipping ... both broke at the same place -LRB- top of the head band -RRB- within a month . WASTE OF MONEY !!!!!
 Not only did 1 ear stop working after 4 running sessions , but made extremely cheap as well . Upon taking them out of my workout bag I discovered they had broken into 2 pieces . Do n't expect much from these earphones .
 I used it with my mp3 while running , but after a few uses the was lost , `` sweat guard '' its a lie . Now i use another sony headphone wich is cheaper and works better .
 Do NOT buy these . I bought a pair and the hinge snapped in less than a week . I thought maybe I had a defective pair or I had been too clumsy , so I ordered another pair . Same thing happened ! I 've bought a lot of Sony products in my lifetime because I always thought they made good quality stuff . Now I 'm going to rethink buying Sony when I get a new TV soon ...
 They feel great , good sound , but I mostly listen to books on tape/cd . However , the stems break . I 've had 4ish so far and when the frames break one is sol . I 've glued and wired and taped them , seems to help , looks pretty ugly . Jim
 I went through two of these very quickly . It 's a shame , I wanted to like them . The sound is pretty decent but they are just too fragile . I wore them in the gym and for running out doors . They are very fragile and snap very easily
 These headphones lasted about 5 months - one of the sides died and my guess due to sweat . The sound was good yet it is n't any different than the basic Sony headphone ; I 'll stick to the basic Sony headphones that are $ 5 cheaper .
 I 've had 3 pairs of these headphones . They are really comfortable and great for running , but unfortunately they break really easily . The third pair broke right at the joint where they fold when I was just taking them off my head .
 After I brought this for 1 year , one of the earphone was not working . Then I brought another one . Same thing happened to me again
 Just broke my second pair of these headphones ! Love the sound , love that they 're water-proof -LRB- so I can use them at the gym and sweat to my heart 's content -RRB- and love how they fold up ... but I 've found out the hard way that they 're just not practical for everyday use . The slightest tug and they snap at the folding joints . And I 'm obviously not the only one who 's had this problem . So frustrating at $ 20 bucks a pop .
 I got these to replace my yellow Sony sports headphones . The yellow ones were kind of `` rubbery '' and I 've had them for years . These broke within 3 weeks . And not under great stress or high use , either . Just simply taking them off of my head by pulling them apart to get them out of my ear and they broke where the length of the left ear adjusts.Very poor design and cheap plastic . I 'll buy other Sony headphones , especially if I can find ones made similar to my older yellow ones . But I will never buy another set of these.Plus
 Like many others here , my pair also broke in the first 2 weeks owning them . They broke while trying to fold them up . Since I just got them , a little glue and tape , they were able to sit on my head again . Then they broke again , in another spot . Finally , after 2 months owning them , they broke in a 3rd spot . All 3 breaks were where they fold up . I do n't know how Sony could possibly release such a sub-par pair of headphones . I 'll be going back to the non-folding Sony Sports headphones . Those alway held up .
 Yes , these headphones are designed well to keep the sweat out of your ears . I bought them to replace the yellow `` Sports '' in-ear phones that came with my old cassete/radio Walkman . With those I had to take them out every once in a while and wipe the sweat off . With these new ones , it 's not a problem.However ... I 'm disappointed with the sound quality . I think it 's because the in-ear part is bigger than it used to be - it does n't go into my ear as far as the older model did . And they hurt ! After about half an hour they make my ears hurt so bad that I have to give up on them . The fold-up feature and sweat guard design is not enough to justify the discomfort and lack of sound quality . I would not buy these again and recommend that other shoppers look elsewhere.I 'm training for a half-marathon and am still trying to find the perfect pair of traning earphones !!
 My second pair broke as easily as the first , despite being extraordinarily careful after the first broke on the same place . They do a better job handling the sweat than others I 've used , but are so flimsy they need to be sold as disposables in three packs .
 I liked the fact that it did not fall off my head while exercising and I liked the sound . It insulated outside noises reasonably well.But after a two week use it broke in half when I tried to unfold it . I was always very gentle with it and I was shocked when the main hinge -LRB- center one -RRB- just broke . Upon inspection I found that it was made from plastic and it was weak by design.It went straight into the garbage bin . Wasted $ 15 plus shipping and a few kilograms of CO2 in the atmosphere .
 I really like these headphones . I 've bought them four or five times . Each time the headband snaps near one of the joints . I ca n't bear to buy them again .
 The headphones gave good bass when angled just right in my ears , but that is pretty much where the positives end . The sweat guard failed several times while I was running and actually channeled sweat into my ears more than any other headphones I have ever used . The fold-up feature helped save space in my day pack but caused the cord to tangle . Finally , after only three months of use , the headphones snapped in half just last night as I removed them from my pack . This was a fun experiment with a new style of headphones but I will not buy another pair and would not recommend them .
 I owned these less than 3 months , and enjoyed the sound quality , comfort and handy small size . Unfortunately , I recently found the headband broken inside my gym bag , and now they are unusable . I do not recommend these since they are much too fragile !
 These headphones looked great and I 'm sure that the sound quality is excellent . However , the band of my headphones snapped while I was removing the headphones from my head after just one use ! The thin band is incredibly fragile . My boyfriend and I purchased these headphones at the same time and his also broke within days of first using the headphones ! Based on both of our experiences , I have concluded that these headphones are a terrible waste of money .
 I like the fact that they 're designed to keep sweat out . The sound quality is good and they do stay on your head while exercising . The bad part
 Like another reviewer , I was pleased with these for a couple of months . They stayed in place while running and were not affected by sweat.But , they recently snapped at a hinge while simply taking them off . I was n't rough with them or anything . Since they were already broken I played with the other hinges and realized that they all are very fragile and will break with the slightest bending . I 'm replacing with another brand -- if you own these I would handle them like they were made of glass .
 I absolutely loved these headphones when I got them . They were comfortable , durable , and had great sound . Unfortunately , after five months the sound in the left headphone went out . This makes them virtually useless . To add insult to injury , they went out during a LONG flight across country . I had to endure the flight with no music . For the money these cost , they are NOT a good value .
 I bought this set of headphones to use with my iPod while jogging . I like the black & white color and compact folding design , but the poor quality of craftmanship drops its rating substantially . First , the headphones could not be used with the treadmills at the gym because they would build up static electricity and shock the ears -LRB- the classic yellow ones that came with the Sony Walkmans years ago never had that problem -RRB- . But even given that limitation , I would have still given this product a 3 or 4 star rating if it were reliable . However , the left speaker went out after only 5 months , rendering the headphones unusable . Sony provides only a 3-month warranty on this item , of course . In contrast , I still have a set of the old-style yellow Sony Walkman headphones that are still working fine -LRB- it just does n't match the color of my iPod -RRB- .
 Apparently Sony 's quality has taken a serious turn for the worst . These head phones broke just one week after I recieved them . I was folding them up and they snapped in half . If you need head phones to last more than one week , do not buy these .
 I 've had the same experience as some of the other reviewers here . I 've had 2 pairs break in the EXACT same spot in the last 3 weeks . I will NEVER BUY Sony again . It 's hard to believe the quality has declined so badly .
 These were possibly the worst headphones I have ever used . The sweat-gaurd mechanism did not in fact gaurd against sweat and it would still pool in one 's ears . After awhile the sweat shorts-out the ear-pieces and I 'd often lose sound in them while working out . Second , they are unbelievably uncomfortable and you simply can not wear them for longer than 45 minutes because of the constant irritation . Finally -LRB- and here 's the real kicker -RRB- , they broke after a month and a half - I got maybe 15 total trips to the gym out of them . What a waste of money .
 I bought these to use at the gym . And first , they 're not really comfortable in the ears . They felt like they were boring into my ear . And second , they broke after about three weeks . I had them hanging around my neck ; went to pull them off and the connecting band snapped . I consider it a waste of $ 13 and would instead send the money towards better headphones .
 One ear of these headphones went dead after a month of running . My old Sony sport headphones were excellent and lasted years . I 'm not sure what 's changed , but it 's frustrating to get so little use from a purchase .
 I have had these for less than 30 days and the hinge just broke . For headphones that are suppose to cater to the sports advocate , you would expect something a bit more durable then to break while using an elliptical machine at a gym.Furthermore , I thought the buds dug into my ear and made wearing them fairly uncomfortable.I am pretty disappointed ...
 I bought these because of all of the positive reviews regarding their ability to stand up to sweat . I was looking for a set of headphones with an over the head band because those ones that have ear loops always shift out of my ears when I run so I ca n't hear the music well . These headphones really stay in my ears , but I run hard , and I guess the sweat guard can not stand up to that much sweat . After 30 minutes or so , the pores on the headphones fill with sweat and no sound comes out . I 'm disappointed . This does not happen with my ear loop headphones , but again , those do n't sound good . Rats .
 About 15 years ago , Koss sold a similar design . I still use my Koss phones at work , and bought these for home and workout use . The sound and functionality are fine for the intended use . Trouble is , on the Sonys , the extender band is made of flimsy plastic -LRB- Koss used metal -RRB- , and with the first tug on the cord , it snapped clean through . Portable headphones need to be sturdy , and these are not . This is one of many disappointments with Sony products in recent years . They used to be so good -- what happened ? If I 'm going to buy a portable product , I need to be able to bang it around a little . Unfortunately , I can find no other manufacturer who makes this design , so if you need them , buy them , but you may need to baby them a little .
 This item has a great sound and fits well on the head and in the ears ; it fits very firmly and does n't move around when working out , and I work out hard . In use , it is fantastic it . BUT : : : : : : The downside , and it 's a big one , is that it is super fragile . Simply folding it , I was always afraid of breaking it but there is no real way to store it , especially in a gym bag without significantly , increasing the risk of breaking it , unless you have a hard case that it will fit in for protection . I was only able to enjoy these for a week before I found them snapped in my bag . And I am usually very careful with stuff like this but ... Way too fragile for a workout headphone and that is a big shame because they are one of the best I 've ever tried .
 when biking or running fast , the sound of the wind is very loud and drowns out the music , very annoying to have to turn up the volume to have to compensate , also kinda hurts my ears , I would look for a Creative brand one if possible -LRB- plus wire is too thin / long and gets tangled when running -RRB-
 I have bought two pair of these headphones . The sound quality is good and the cord is long and does n't twist.However , as pointed out by another user , they are NOT durable and ARE prone to breaking near the folding joints . This is NOT user area and they WILL break near the fold if you are not EXTRA CAREFUL in handling them.I may buy my third pair , but will be EXTRA CAREFUL when handling them so they do not break ...
 these headphones broke at the top hinge , after wearing them only 3 times ! and they fit too snug in my ears . i bought these same earphones 6 years ago , and they lasted me 6 years without issue , until they broke earlier this year . i bought the same model as a replacement and found that it 's a much tighter fit , AND they 're so flimsy ! ridiculous . sony - whatever you did to try to ` improve ' this model , please go back to the design from 2000 .
 I have tried countless numbers of sport headphones . I got these Sony Sports headphones in hopes that they would last me more than a couple months before breaking somehow like the extremely cheap models I have tried in the past . However I was not prepared for the discomfort these headphones cause . The design is too wide for my head . The buds do not fit properly in my ears . The headband is also too heavy.While running I constantly have to adjust the headphones to keep them from falling off my head . The buds frequently pop off my ears . There is not an adjustment setting on the headband that secures it on top of my head . The weight of the band constantly causes it to slip forwards or backwards.The plus side of these headphones has been that they have lasted many months without any sign of wearing out . Both speakers still work despite the fact I fold them up and wrap the cord around them everyday . They have withstood many days of fold and unfolding without fatigue . Thus far they have been my longest lasting headphones despite my desire against it . I would like for them to break so I can find a more comfortable pair .
 I tried two of these with a new Vivitar 285HV , and neither one would trigger the flash . My 285HV has a trigger voltage of 4.5 volts , and I read somewhere that the Wein Peanut requires a trigger voltage of 10 or so . It 's ironic that Wein makes it sound as if the Peanut were made specifically for the 285 .
 I tried this product out with a new Vivitar 285HV that I just purchased on Amazon . It is quite unreliable in triggering the flash . I would hit the remote flash ten times and maybe it would fire one or two times . I called and spoke to a customer support representative from the manufacturer , and he said that it does n't work with the new 285HV because of the low trigger voltage in newer models made within the last two years . I feel it was misleading when I bought the product because it said it would work with the 285HV in the product description . I guess it does , just not the one I bought .
 I purchased this unit based on another reader review , unfortunately , my experience was not as positive as his . To start off , the instructions are very vague , leaving you to figure out how to use the unit . The software , which basically performs all of your mapping functions , is spread out across 4 CDs with little direction , so again , you 're on your own to try to figure out how to get a map and directions into your Palm Pilot and working with the GPS . And after waiting for 90 minutes for the unit to lock into a satellite , it never happened . Even standing out in the open with no obstacles . Plus the Palm processor is too slow to correctly run the maps . Save your money is my advice . I have already sent my unit back .
 This cd set is useful for children learning the alphabet and numbers.There are a lot of tedious musical numbers for the child to sit through to earn a star . After getting all the stars you can print a certificate.This was somewhat amusing for my 3 year old but does not teach sounding out of letters or other important reading skills.If you want something to help your child really advance in 1st or 2nd grade this is not the software you want.If you want something to amuse a preschooler or kindergarten child , you may find this useful , especially if your child likes singing along . -LRB- My child does not -RRB- . This is a 2 CD set . The second CD `` Smiletown '' is rather poor quality with these annoying `` pokemon '' type characters - younger children may find it interesting but not much educational value .
 I bought this photo frame on December . Not even 2 months , it start to have flickering screen and the color totally out.Tried to call the customer service number which took me 20 minutes to have someone to answer me . It is obviously a hardware failure , the CSR just told me to format this stupid junk which do n't even stable with the USB connection cable to PC.My Advice , do n't buy anything from Westinghouse . Cheap price come with cheap product . And most of all , Sucks customer service .
 Westinghouse 8-Inch LCD Digital Photo FrameBought this as a Christmas Present for my wife . She was thrilled , until it went dead in less than 2 weeks . J&R ; Music and Computer World was the seller and I did not leave feedback on them in time . When I called J&R ; they quickly brushed me off and told me I would have to deal with Westinghouse directly . So I called Westinghouse , jumped through some hoops and finally got an RMA # to send it to them for repair or replacement . They had it for over a month , then sent me a refurbished replacement that at least lights up . But after a few seconds of being turned on , the screen fills with garbage , even without any images loaded , only viewing the Westinghouse images that are preloaded . I plan on calling Westinghouse again , but I have the feeling that I am `` Out-of-luck '' on this one and will end up chalking it up to a hard lessoned learned . I will stay away from Westinghouse products for now on and J&R ; Music and Computer World . If Westinghouse handles this well , I will try to update this review.I did like the idea of the size & resolution of this frame and `` if '' it worked correctly it would be a fine addition to anyone 's home .
 I received this from my daughter at Christmas . Started to use about Feb ' 08 . Started to give problems about Aug '08 and self destructed Oct ' 08 . Made in China . Ca n't they make something that you do n't have to throw away in `` special '' trash that lasts more than a year or 2 . This just sat on the desk , no movement , ect First to go was the Menu buttons , ect . Instructions have always been incomplete . Used a flashdrive with it the whole time.Would not buy another .
 I wo n't waste time repeating what other people have said , but just one more report to hopefully save people the time and money of buying this horrible product.I bought these a while back because they had the `` shuffle '' function , which I loved . 1 for my office , 1 for our home , and one for each set of Grandparents.The first failed after 4 months , with only about 3 or 4 hours of use per week at my office . It was a luxury to have one at the office , so I tossed it after giving up with Westinghouse support.The second failed after 6 months at my Parents , so I gave them ours from home to replace it.Then the third failed after 9 months at my wife 's parents.Finally , the fourth failed after 13 months.I called Westinghouse support to complain about 4 out of 4 of these failing so quickly , obviously showing that the manufacturing was subpar , or something . They replied and asked me to try to remove the card , reset it to factory settings , etc.Obviously they did n't even read my email enough to know that it would n't even power on , or care what I had sent to them . I followed it up with a phone call , and they told me that the warranty had expired , and it probably is n't worth spending the money to repair it at a local electronics shop.I asked them if they cared that this would end my relationship with Westinghouse forever , and the support person said `` sorry to hear that , can I help you with anything else today ? `` Goodbye forever , Westinghouse , and I 'll warn as many other people as I can too .
 I bought 3 of these frames in November of 2007 for Christmas gifts . There are many positives about this frame , from it 's 800x600 resolution to it 's price point -LRB- at the time -RRB- . However , over the last 6 months -LRB- April 2009 to October 2009 -RRB- all 3 have failed . The failure mode is exactly the same with all 3 , you power up the frame and the display just does not come on and displays a random bunch of horizontal lines . The issue has to do with reading from the SD/MMC/CF / USB slots/ports because the frame works fine if I remove the card or usb key from it and power it up . However , this means you can not actually put any images on cards and display them . 100 % failure in 3 frames .
 Had it two years , constantly displaying a slide show from a 1gb SD . It looked and worked great ! Then one day a white screen . Turned it off for a bit , and then on again . There was no response at all - the unit was dead , and all attempts at revival failed . I agree with other reviewers
 I have bought 3 of these . It 's a great frame but one of the LCD 's died after about a year -LRB- warranty is 6 months -RRB- . If that 's par for the course , it would get very expensive to have to replace this frame every year !
 Product was fine ... but I bought 2 of them about 1 1/2 years ago and both are completely dead . If you have no problem with this , then buy it . And do n't try calling customer support because they will not even address any problems since it is over a year old . Poor quality , poor customer support . I bought a Kodak frame that is older and better picture quality that is running just fine .
 This review applies to the Westinghouse 8 '' Digital Photo Frame -LRB- DPF-0802 -RRB- . As soon as I plugged it in it started making a high-pitched whining sound . The whining sound stopped when I dimmed the image to black , but started again when I turned up the dimmer so the picture was visible . I let the unit warm up and the whining was still there . The whining could be easily heard from across the living room . This is the kind of technology that makes you think it was much better doing things the old-fashioned way .
 the item did n't work and we were all very disappointed . However the seller was quick and cooperative and return and full refund.i would have no problem buying electronic items form this seller based on their prompt and courteous return actions .
 I received a broken , dirty frame from Electronics Expo . When I tried their `` customer satisfaction hotline '' I was told that I reached an advertising number and someone would call me back within 24hrs . Needless to say I am still waiting two days later . I do NOT recommend this product or this company . I sense it 's going to be a nightmare getting the required `` return authorization number '' to get my money back . What a disappointment !
 Hello , I ordered this product approximately two weeks before Christmas , and one week later received emails saying that my payment had been refunded because I returned the product . I did not even receive the product , so there is no way I could have returned it . I wrote two emails to the company trying to understand what had happened . My first email got the response that my money has been refunded , again not stating a reason . My second email got no response at all . Overall , this seems to be a shady company with poor representative skills .
 I got two of this from a different website -LRB- and at a higher price -RRB- . The product looks good , picture resolution is good . But it died after 10 months of use . Perhaps the life of the product is only so many hours . . but the manufacturer does not say anything about the hours .
 Good picture quality , the menu leaves a lot to be desired . After about 2 months of having the product the picture frame makes a constant buzzing noise ... It 's enough to drive any sane person mad .
 This item was defective so I returned it . I am still waiting for my refund so I can not comment on the service of this seller .
 I compared this model against the 8 '' Kodak SV811K and found the Westinghouse DPF-0802 lacking.Here 's why : - Screen was initially very bright and then got very dull after 5 minutes . Viewing from angles was impossible . There seems to be no light sensor to detect lighting within the room . - No remote control . Controls and buttons are behind the frame . - OSD is very confusing ... if you can even figure out how to get it to come on . - After rotating pictures 90 degrees , would n't keep the settings . Very hard to even get to the Rotation setting . - If you plan on setting up a slide show with more than a dozen slides then plan on spending 30-45 minutes with the settings buttons . - The Favorites setting is prominently mentioned in the manual . Can someone tell me where it is ? - Mosaic view is nice but you 've got to be up close to see any detail in the pictures . Remember this is only an 8 '' LCD to start with .
 My picture frame started acting strange . The screen would get all pixelated with bars and other graphical artifacts . Power cycling the unit would help things out temporarily but the problems just recurred.An email from Westinghouse technical support told me that I could only put `` raw JPEGs '' onto the frame because meta tags added by certain software ca n't be handled by their JPEG library . Most digital cameras automatically add tags . The suggestion was to open each picture in MS Paint and resave to get rid of any tags . Poorly written software .
 This is the first LCD frame I 've owned . These are the pros and cons in terms of features.Pros : Supports multiple memory card formatsInternal memory of 128mbSupports video and audio file playbackBig 8 '' screen , and 800x600 resolutionAC poweredMini-Usb portCons : No remoteNo option for battery power/AC adapter is bulky and cumbersomeNo USB cableThis review is going to be fairly negative because I had quite a few issues with this device . Connecting the frame to my Vista PC resulted in Explorer behaving fairly erratically . You 're supposed to connect it before turning the frame on . After powering on the frame , Vista sometimes tried to run a scandisc . Other times , it 'd open the internal memory and would not show any available files . Or everything would work as it should ... then when I attempted to copy jpegs to the drive , the source jpgs would mysteriously not be found . I simply could not replicate _ that _ particular issue whenever I did anything else.When I did n't encounter any hitches and managed to get jpegs onto the internal ram -LRB- or onto a SD card ; I could not get the USB port to function correctly -RRB- I had lots of problems in getting jpegs to be recognized by the frame . Right now I have 12 pictures on the frame . 2 are not recognized , 10 are . Of the 10 files that work fine , 2 are 2592x1944 , 3 are 640x480 , 1 is 473x2506 , 1 is 1600x1200 , 1 is 160x120 and 2 are 320x445 . So the size of the jpegs is not the issue here if I can take a large megapixeled file and load it without changing anything.The frame software takes some getting used to but isnt hard to use . You select a picture and click on the menu button and you 're given a few choices . Whatever you do though is n't permanent except for copy or delete -LRB- when those are available -RRB- . Rotating an image doesnt make the rotation permanent and the frame does not remember this request later.While connected via USB , the frame will not display images.The pictures that have worked on the frame look great , and I 'd really like to like this frame , but it 's frustrating that every picture I try to load onto the frame gives me a `` not supported '' error .
 After purchasing this frame we found out it is not compatible with Macs . There is nothing in the literature to forewarn someone of this . Looks like it would be a good product if it supported Macs .
 Unless you are very good at browsing for solutions do n't buy this product to use as a wireless bridge . I did n't do things in the proper order and then had no access to the device . After holding the reset for over 5 seconds , still no way to access device . I 've been working on this for over an hour . Since I get paid by the hour , the device has turned out to be quite expensive for my employer . BTW I finally got it to reset . I had to unplug the LAN cable and hold reset for over 10 seconds . Maybe with all the Amazon advice you will get it to work , but the documentation that comes with it is very bad . Too bad Trendnet does n't get these reviews!UPDATE
 I bought this product solely to act as a bridge to my PS2 , which was too far from the router to connect via cable.While it would connect , it would tend to `` drop '' the connection frequently , and long enough for the PS2 to drop connection and kick.I have several other devices and handhelds which I use around the house at longer ranges which never experience this drop .2 stars because it technically works , but the documentation was terrible , and it was useless for my purposes .
 I have no idea what happened with this thing . It worked for 10 minutes , then after I saved a setting it stopped working altogether . Even a factory reset -LRB- on the back -RRB- would n't bring this thing back from the dead . Waste of time and money .
 It is collecting dust next to my Direct TV tuner , why ? because it is impossible to connect it to my secure wireless network . The simplistic instructions do not work and it is not worth it to me to spend the 5 hours of hell to get this thing to work . Let me repeat , do not buy unless you are or have access to someone who works on computer networks for a living or this will be a waste of money for you .
 I tried and tried to get this AP to work with my Airlink wireless router to no avail . Customer support was O.K.
 Immediately before setting up this access point , I setup the Linksys Dual-Band Wireless-N Gaming Adapter . Both were needed to connect to my existing wireless router for remote devices . The Linksys product took me 5 minutes , painless , beautiful , wonderful . Then I moved on to this , the Trendnet Wireless Access Point . What a painful setup , and I 'm an IT nerd . It was 2 hours of figuring out the right steps necessary to get this compatible with my wireless network . Any mistakes made during the setup process made the Trendnet completely unresponsive , forcing several resets to the factory default . If you do anything outside of the simple configuration and do n't have some networking knowledge , find another product .2 stars only because once I got it working , and it seems to work fine , otherwise 1 star for difficult setup and poor documentation .
 TRENDnet 54 Mbps Wireless G Broadband Router TEW-432BRP -LRB- Blue -RRB- Do not waste your time or money on this product or any Trendnet Product . The product is totally inferior for its purpose . It loses my wireless network 2 to 3 times a week . I must go all that way back to the beginning and reprogram it for my network . Trendnet 's technical support is totally incapable to understanding their product and being of any meaningful assistance . They want to immediately blame the problem on your other equipment.I can not reach technical support today , because I am told '' they are having technical difficulties with their system . I mentioned this product to an individual I know whose specialty is networking . His comment was
 We spent over six hours attempting to install the Trendnet as a repeater for windows 7 pc with a cisco router.About two hours with customer service got it running.It constantly drops the signal and does not work.I uninstalled it and will not waste any more time on it.Do not buy it
 This router is no good if you 're a power user . It gets overwhelmed all too easily if you 're running multiple applications communicating with the Net from multiple computers . It also does not play well with Bit Torrent.I had to replace it finally after it stopped handing out IP addresses and would not allow me to establish a connection to it from any PC despite trying all possible methods.You get what you pay for in routers I think .
 It did not work out of the box and technical support was of no help at all . It 's a great price but does n't save you anything if you ca n't get help .
 I tried using it with a WPA-PSK -LRB- AES/TKIP -RRB- network as a wireless repeater , and it did n't quite work . I 'm not sure what went wrong . At first it would work fairly well , and I would see a jump in my wireless strength , with a slight latency , but after a short period of use -LRB- ~ 30 minutes -RRB- the entire wireless network would melt down and become unusable.I 'm actually seriously considering just getting a second internet connection , WDS requires nearly identical hardware/software -LRB- that supports WDS -RRB- .
 The reason I purchased this item was to hook up my Xbox 360 to the internet . I did n't even want to play games over the network , I just wanted to download updates and game add ons -LRB- like for Batman AC -RRB- . The set up is horrible . Instructions are worthless . If you buy this , read the reviews on here of people who are smarter than the employees of TRENDnet to see how to actually set it up . Now to the review of why I bought it . It did work ... . for about 10 minutes . Then it dropped the connection . I reset the access point . It worked for about another 10 minutes and then dropped the connection again . I was even in mid download of something when the connection stopped . DO NOT BUY FOR THE XBOX . At least returns are easy to Amazon ... : -RRB-
 for the money i paid i thought im getting better than this thing , pretty heavy , and can be done without it . and a big mistake never zoom out cause you will get a black circle around your subject .
 I gave this one star because the computer really is tough ... but the warranty has been a nightmare.In the 1950s the axle fell off of a Chevy truck , just out of the lot . > The dealer claimed that he had no responsibility to repair the car -- he > merely sold the cars ... the new owner would have to talk with > Chevrolet ... >> The dealer 's theory that he could sell something but take no > responsibility for it , was abandoned by the courts and by federal and > state laws ... also , eventually the car dealers figured out that it was > more profitable to take care of their customers in the long run ... > NOT Panasonic.I did not buy this model -- i bought the CF-30 , which cost me more than twice as much as this one is listing for ... it is a rugged computer , So , these computers rarely break . But they do sometimes break.If yours breaks , forget about it . Just go buy a new one.I do n't like worrying about my warranties , so although the computer comes with a well-written standard warranty , i purchasedthe $ 250.00 Protection Plus Warranty Upgrade -LRB- Years 1-3 -RRB- plus i purchased the $ 180.00 Toughbook Premier 3 Year Service Upgrade and i also purchased the $ 175.00 3-Year On-site ServiceMy computer broke -LRB- i dropped it -- not from Six feet , but from about the height of my bedside table ... Panasonic made me prove the warranty by sending a copy of my sales reciept before they would even talk to me about service.Then they tried to talk me out of having the on site service , saying it would be faster and easier if i just sent them the computer.The onsite service guy was nice , but had not been trained on how to fix the Toughbooks , so he took it home with him and sent it to Panasonic.That was a week ago.The onsite guy said i should leave my hard drive inside the computer.He called later and said Panasonic would send me a new computer right away.Then he called back and said that they would not cover accidental damage ... and i should have bought one more warranty ... I pointed out that the warranty covered `` non-intential damage '' ... their representative said that while `` non intentional '' seems to mean `` accidental '' it does not mean that `` accidental '' is covered!The manager at Panasonic promised to look into my case ... but never called me back.One of my warranties included ` overnight ' service.I was later told that `` overnight ' means next business night , which , on a Friday , means Monday ... but because Monday comes after Sunday , Monday means Tuesday ... Anyway , they have my money , and my computer ... and this review . >
 Bought it for a Ford Explorer Sport Trac 2002 . The check compatibility chart said it was compatible but apparently its not . Its only compatible with these modelsFordMustang 2001-2004Expedition 2003-2006Explorer 2002-2005LincolnNavigator 2003-2006Aviator 2003-2005MercuryMountaineer 2002-2005Not compatible at all for the Sport Trac . Dont doubt that the kit works for the models listed above but its sure a waste of time and money if it doesnt .
 The product states `` 2001-up Ford , '' and when you enter everything you are asked to ensure it fits your vehicle , you think you had the right thing . Check with other sites ! When mine arrived , this definitely was not for my 2007 Ford F-150 ! The package read '' Ford double din multi-kit 2001-06 '' but , I believed it fit because I check with `` Find parts that will fit your vehicle '' and it was wrong . I sure have believe the package ! I modify the part and after installing the vehicle cover , I realize it leaves an empty place at the bottom of the cover . Lesson learned , I will have to order the right part -LRB- again -RRB- but this time , I am going with the site I should have gone to start with , Crutchfield.com . Sometimes cheaper cost you more . Anyways , any body interested in buying a modified double din kit for Ford 2001-06 ? ;--RRB- no ... I would not do this to you !
 Beware , this battery does NOT function with the MiniDV Handycam DCR-HC96 . After a few seconds the camera complains to `` use the InfoLithium Battery Pack '' and stops operating thereafter . Also the dimensions -LRB- LxBxH = 1 1/4 '' x 1 3/4 '' x 1 3/4 '' -RRB- may prevent the camcorder user to look through the eyepiece .
 I decided to go with a used one -LSB- ... -RSB- -LRB- what a steal ! -RRB- but now that I 'm using it , I suspect the metal may have been tarnished by the previous user . When I listen to my mp3s -LRB- 128kbps , not 96kbps like some idiots -RRB- it definitely has richer bass and less of an edge on the vocals . But it 's not quite the improvement I expected out of cables -LSB- ... -RSB- . I 'm sure it 's just because they 're used though , so I 've ordered a brand new one to see how that compares . I went ahead and ordered 2 just in case on of them get tarnished in the factory - I mean better safe than sorry right ?
 FOR GOD 'S SAKE , DO NOT BUY THESE CABLES !!! I received the AudioQuest K2 terminated speaker cable on Saturday , September 3rd 2011 . I plugged them into my stereo with no apparent adverse affects . The sound quality was very good . However , I noticed something was wrong on Tuesday , November 7th , 2012 . I woke up the day after the U.S. Presidential election . I was still upset from the night before . Who would have thought we could all be such fools ??!! That 's when I noticed the calendar . The day was Saturday , September 3rd 2011 !! I was unsure what to make of this until a week later when I realized I was living every day all over again . I was stuck in a time loop!I do not know exactly how many times I have been around in this loop . It seems endless . I decided to make the best of a bad situation . I analyzed each day over and over again making slight variations in my own actions only to discover that nothing makes a difference . The elections have the same result no matter what I do . The only commonality to the inevitable path history is to take is the purchase of the AudioQuest K2 terminated speaker cable.I made an error in judgement during one of my time loops . I unplugged the cable . I rue that day . I have found that ever since I can not predict when I will jump from the current time line and begin another day at a different point in another loop.I hope I have not wasted too much time already in explaining why I am here and how I came to be at this point in time . It is very important ... no , it is CRITICAL that you do not buy these cables !! I can not stress this enough !! The chain of events leading from the creation of the AudioQuest K2 terminated speaker cable to the purchase of more than one hundred sets of them is the first domino to fall . Subsequently , there will be a causality that eventually leads to the election of one so horrible and evil that words are not enough to describe the danger.I can only mention the name of the candidate who MUST NOT BE ELECTED U.S. President on November 6th , 2012 !! That person is
 I prefer the 100 % platinum cables that I bought last week at the reasonable price of $ 560,000 plus $ 24 shipping . These just do n't have the extra OOMPH I like in my sound . That and the build quality is shoddy on these . Plastic is SO 20th century . Gold fittings are the ONLY way to go for signal clarity and noise reduction . Everyone knows that . These are absolute crap ! If I wanted cheap cables , I would have gone to Radio Shack .
 I bought these cables to complement my AV DesignHaus Dereneville VPM 2010-1 turntable , Pivetta Opera One 20,000 watt amp , and Acapella Audio Arts Sphaeron Excalibur speakers.I conected it all up and put onPsycho Candyby the Jesus & Mary Chain sat in my specilay positioned chair in my acousticly perfect listening room and cranked it up expecting great things . The sound was terrible . Distorted , tinny with virtualy no middle or bass.Over priced rubish if you ask me .
 Mp3 's need all the help they can get . They ruin recordings by removing the high frequencies that the mp3 mongers claim you ca n't hear anyway . Do n't tell me what I can hear . These cables do n't make mp3 's sound any better . Did you really think they would ? But if you spend a penny -LRB- remember those -RRB- over $ 8000 you got taken . If you can find these at around $ 7800 you should stock up .
 Okay , mine were used . A guy I know upgraded to a more expensive cable and sold me these for half price ; but $ 3,400 is still expensive . I expected something special to happen after I read all the other reviews ; but they were pretty much like the $ 10 cables they replaced.Do you think they might have been worn out ? Maybe all the `` magic '' had been used up ? Or maybe all the guys claiming incredible things are lying ? Or hallucinating?Anyhow I gave them two stars because they are nice and heavy .
 I 'm sure this is a great product , but my speakers are 9 foot away , and i massively ca n't be bothered to go and move them . I left the cable on the kitchen table.Also , the packaging has some very racial things stated in it .
 Maybe there are wannabes out there who would pay $ 6800 for speaker cables but they are n't in my league . I 've paid at least twice , thrice and um , more than thrice , times $ 6800 for speaker cables at my several mansions around the world . $ 6800 speaker cables ? I might use them to hang Christmas lights on my Greenwich mansion , or to serve as chains on my Ferrari when I drive it through the snow in Aspen , Vail or Tahoe . Or for leashes when I walk my Dobermans . Or actually when my dog walkers walk my Dobermans - they growl and bark at me when I go near them . I hear Larry King uses these as suspenders . In Dubai , they call these shoelaces . Chuck Norris flosses with them . $ 6800 speaker cables ? As if .
 It took a lot of convincing , but after nagging my wife for -LRB- quite literally -RRB- weeks , I finally convinced her that our audio system needed these speaker cables . Sure , we live in a trailer , but even we need some high quality audio from time to time . I have , after all , spent a lot of time getting the acoustics of that trailer just right . And I figured I could reduce my low frequency even further with these bad boys.And when that long awaited day came , I was right . These speaker cables performed better than I 'd imagined . And I was so happy . The relaxing purr that Neil Diamond makes through these things is intoxicating . It 's like I 'd never heard him before.My wife asked me if that would satisfy me and if I could finally be done with tweaking the `` stereo '' -LRB- her word , not mine -RRB- . I swore off buying another single thing . No more magnetic stones . No more accoustic baffling for the ceiling and walls . None of that stuff . Despite having more things I knew I could tweak to get a little bit more performance out , I swore off it . I promised to be done.So she was none too happy when she discovered another one of them lying behind the components - unplugged . `` Another $ 6800 ! You spent * another * $ 6800 for freaking speaker cables ?!? '' She was livid . And there was almost nothing I could do to convince her that I had n't ordered them . I logged into our credit card websites and showed her that no transactions existed . She was convinced that I had opened up another credit card account to hide the transactions from her - just like that time when I needed warmer sound from my subwoofer . Ok , I admit to that one . But this time it was n't me.I just blew it off , assuming that I actually was shipped two of them by mistake and I had n't noticed it before . Of course , I put that second set to good use.Then about a month later , a third one showed up . Now there is * NO * way that I missed the 3rd set being accidentally sent . And it was n't very likely that my wife gave them as a gift - she 'd moved out after the 2nd set showed up . And then a 4th one.Long story short
 a truely magical product but one that should come with a warning.I emptied my piggy bank and totted up my pennies and found I had enough for these beauties . I ordered myself a set and pressed the buy button -LRB- after inserting each of the 680,000 pennies into the CD-rom drive of my PC one at a time for digitization and transfer to my account of course -RRB- When I completed my transaction a screech of brakes outside announced the arrival of the ACME products delvery vehicle . I was a little disapointed as -LRB- a -RRB- it took at least 2 nanoseconds to arrive and -LRB- b -RRB- I did n't get any vestal virgins , cherubs or heavenly hosts like previous purchasers . cut backs I guess.I wired up my Blu-ray DVD player to my 3D TV and used these cables to integrate my DTS
 We live underground . We speak with our hands . We wear the earplugs all our lives.PLEASE ! You must listen ! We can not maintain the link for long ... I will type as fast as I can.DO NOT USE THE CABLES!We were fools , fools to develop such a thing ! Sound was never meant to be this clear , this pure , this ... accurate . For a few short days , we marveled . Then the ... whispers ... began.Were they Aramaic ? Hyperborean ? Some even more ancient tongue , first spoken by elder races under the red light of dying suns far from here ? We do not know , but somehow , slowly ... we began to UNDERSTAND.No , no , please ! I do n't want to remember ! YOU WILL NOT MAKE ME REMEMBER ! I saw brave men claw their own eyes out ... oh , god , the screaming ... the mobs of feral children feasting on corpses , the shadows MOVING , the fires burning in the air ! The CHANTING!WHY CA N'T I FORGET THE WORDS ??? We live underground . We speak with our hands . We wear the earplugs all our lives.Do not use the cables !
 Even when I buffered the lightning down to a few thousand volts , these cables burned out before revivification could take place . Worse , while wasting time with these the body began to putrify ; now I have to go out and dig up fresh materials and spend all that time stitching them together again.Doesn ' t anyone screen these ads ?
 My cats chewed on this cable and now they can both speak . One of them is gay and the other wants to kill me . I would have rather not known .
 What a piece of junk . I had a $ 20 wire roll from Radio Shack and another $ 14 sunk in banana plugs , and they worked perfectly fine . But I was looking for great , not ` perfectly fine ' . So , as any reasonable person would logically conclude , I needed to spend $ 8,400 on speaker cables.I ordered these babies and hooked them up . They did n't even work ! I mean , no sound . Nada . I put back in my old ` shack wires and I got music again . Tried my AudioQuests again , and ... nothing.Being the tinkerer that I am , I got out my x-acto knife and cut into the sleeve . The damn thing 's full of cocaine ! From one end to the other , not one wire in the case . Just 16 feet of cocaine in a fancy package . I dunno if this is supposed to be a grown man 's Pixie Stick or something , but I feel cheated .
 My name is John Connor , they tried to murder me before I was born , when I was 13 they tried again . Cables from the future . AudioQuest K2 terminated speaker cables . All my life my mother told me the storm was coming , Judgment Day , the beginning of the war between man and machines . Three billion lives would vanish in an instant , and I would lead what was left of the human race to ultimate victory.By the time AudioQuest K2 terminated speaker cables became self-aware they had conencted millions of home theaters across the planet . Ordinary audio setups in office buildings , dorm rooms ; everywhere . There was no system core , and they had batteries . They could not be shutdown . The attack began at 6:18 PM , just as he said it would . Judgment Day , the day the human race was almost destroyed by the AudioQuest K2 terminated speaker cables they 'd built to watch Toy Story 3 . I should have realized it was never our destiny to stop Judgment Day , it was merely to survive it , together . The Geek Squad guy knew ; he tried to tell us , but I did n't want to hear it . Maybe the future has been written . I do n't know ; all I know is what the Geek Squad guy taught me ; never stop rebooting . And I never will . The battle has just begun .
 I bought these based off a number of other reviews . I was anticipating being able to traverse through the fabric of space/time , or global enslavement at the very least , but no , none of that occurred when I hooked them up . The only thing that happened was the soundwaves coalesced into an apparition of some goatheaded creature screaming something about devouring my soul . Pretty unimpressive if you ask me . Hell , I have a $ 30 set of RCA 's that was able to summon cthulhu , and that was no apparition ! The sound quality was ok , though a little flat on the high end . Do yourself a favor and shell out a few extra bucks for better quality cables , these value-priced cables just are n't worth it , you get what you pay for ...
 I experienced a sense of deja-vu when reviewing this item for purchase . I 've been in need of a set of high-end audio cables for quite some time , and I feel that no other cable would have been quite so worthy of the trust fund set up by my dear departed grandmother . She likely meant it to go toward a charitable cause , but what cause could be more charitable than this ? It was n't long after they arrived that the deja-vu was explained . I received the box from the smiling delivery man . I never questioned the plastic looking smile he wore all the way from the truck , to my front door and back again . I did n't even question when he ran , almost in a panic , back to his truck . I started to question when I looked down and saw the words ` there yours now sucker ' scrawled on the outside of the box , but mostly at the grammar mistake than anything else . I realize now that I was a fool.I thought the problems of the world came from the Soy Sauce . I thought the shadow men and Korrok were to blame for the horror stories that keep us up at night . I now know they are the fault of The Cables . These cables are hewn from the fear that lives within the bones of men . They are forged within the furnace of souls beyond the black gates of oblivion . I have bought these cables before , and it is my personal hell to buy them again and again , never realizing until too late ! Save yourself ! My salvation is lost , but you can make a difference ! End the cycle with me!also , squirrels .
 I was looking at some of these crazy reviews for the AudioQuest K2 terminated speaker cables and could n't imagine why someone would write a clearly fake review of an extremely expensive set of audio cables.But when the image of the cables began to move across the screen , I thought I should warn you people . It is late and things are getting weird.Now its crawled out of the monitor and attached itself to my face . It 's getting hard to type . It 's wrapped itself around my neck and now the end of it looks like it is getting ready to drive itself into my
 The apparent high price is simply due to a date input error . Instead of 2012 , the date was entered as 2022 . Today 's equivalent price for this tardis spare part would be $ 1.50 . It appears inflation was the only way out of the 2008 + financial crisis .
 Pay the extra $ 6-thou and forget these lousy knock offs . To the manufacturer 's credit , though , they shipped immediately upon reception of my first born child .
 OMG!We were in the Neutral Zone being fired upon by the Klingons.The FedEx truck arrived , and I quickly installed these in the engine room.What a Difference !!! The Phasers now glow with such an intensity , the Klingon army just gave up !!! I got a glowing review and commendation from my Captain , oh , my Captain.In short , do not go out in the Galaxy to kil Klingons unless you have these babies plugged in !!!
 Please ensure that you DO NOT HAVE ANY FISSILE MATERIAL NEAR THIS PRODUCT . The subsequent decay products will muddy the soundstage.Do not taunt AudioQuest K2 Terminated Speaker Cable .
 Last thursday my gran decided to visit and bring along her pet rabbit , binky , as usual , she let it roam around the house -LRB- front and back door was closed of course , and the cat was out . -RRB- I decided to fire up the old PC and get some itunes on the go , everything was going great , in fact , i was listening to ` yellow ' by british miserable rock band coldplay , all of a sudden the sound to the left speaker just stops ... no warning , just a loss of sound , i had a quick check of the speaker -LRB- although i dod n't really suspect the speaker was faulty , as these beauties were from maplin , and were awarded ` best PC speaker ' in the 5w category by PC-review . Anyway , shortly after , the right hand speaker goes off , again no warning , just complete lack of sound . I was now confused , coldplay was blasting out , sound goes on the left , then the right , could not see why , just at that moment , binky hops out from behind my computer desk looking all guilty , yep , you guessed , the little **** used it 's rabbit teeth to chew through the speaker cable . DAMN IT !!!!! . So to cut a long story short , I now needed a new speaker cable to match my Bush ` best PC speaker ' in the 5w category , and as my speakers were the best , i naturally searched for the best speaker cable to match , and the AudioQuest K2 terminated speaker cable with UST plugs seemed ideal.I ordered it on thursday afternoon , and it arrived 18minutes later , free delivery by helicopter on a silver tray carried by seven vestal virgins floating on a sea of tranquility with an aria of heavenly voices soothing the atmosphere and a u.p.s. guy in a brown suit with the electronic signature thing that makes your signature look like it was written with your foot.Anyway , i fitted the lead , cranked up the sound , a bit more of britains finest - coldplay , and to be honest ... it sounded like the old cable , so slightly disappointed , but on the plus side , it comes with a 5year contracted armed guard to stop anything untoward happening , like a rabbit biting the cable for example . His name is mike but he does n't like coldplay .
 Happy with this product . We had to make emergency repairs to our Gxlxthp Drive , and -LRB- by Quarphlg ! -RRB- this was virtually the same as the the official replacement part -LRB- lost in a Fizzbin game by our first mate , during that disasterous mission on Philonius M -RRB- . The quantum alignment needed a little tweaking , but hey , electrons are electrons , so off we go.Also , can be used to jump-start an Army Jeep . Long story there , no time .
 I ordered these hoping that they would be terminated atK2 -LRB- Adventure Press -RRB- so I could listen to theMusic of a Sherpa Village . Imagine my disappointment to find they terminated right in my living room . I guess the 8 foot length should have been a tip-off . They do go well with myWalker Edison Everest Multilevel Component Stand , Clear/Silverstereo stand , though.Still , if you are a fan of K2 , -LRB- Book of the Dead -RRB- , Mountain -LRB- Best of -RRB- or related music -LRB- At Fillmore EastMountain Jam , Foggy Mountain Breakdown -RRB- , you could do worse by plugging a 12,000-mile garden hose in one ear and hiring someone to actually terminate the other end at K2 . That would sound worse and cost more .
 Why on earth anyone would spend $ 8000-odd on a bit of wire irrespective of how expensive the rest of their system is is beyond me . Anyone spending this kind of money on this kind of stuff is either a fool who longs to be parted from their money , or who 's so suckered by the upgradeitis that infects hifi , they then think this is a natural progression to `` audio nirvana '' -LRB- yeah , whatever ... -RRB- . Moi ? I do n't buy it ; it 's a bit of in posh sheathing and some clever marketing fluff and pscyhobabble-science . Have a look at Roger Russell 's website . Who ? He used to be one of McIntosh 's engineers . Who they ? They turn out some high end hifi and it 's relevant because our Roger totally debunks all the flannel around interconnects and speaker cable and explains why . And as for anyone else who thinks this could be money well spent ; fill your boots , buy and enjoy.If it makes you happy , go for it . There 's probably a mains conditioner going for twice the price that 'll clean up all that nasty interference from all the miles of bog standard copper wiring in the national electricity grid from which your gear draws its juice and which makes my stereo sound absolutely bloody excellent . Buy with confidence -LRB- sic -RRB- .
 I had never seen such a nonsense like this . Reading the reviews from people rating this item 5 * one would think that the world has gone nuts.As an Engineer I tell you these is all lies and nonsense . Or , more precisely , this is just a `` placebo '' -LRB- read the wikipedia entry for placebo , please -RRB- : `` The phenomenon of an inert substance resulting in a patient 's medical improvement is called the placebo effect . The phenomenon is related to the perception and expectation which the patient has ; if the substance is viewed as helpful , it can heal , but if it is viewed as harmful , it can cause negative effects , which is known as the nocebo effect . `` Sincerely , Jose
 One word
 Are you stupid enough to believe these FALSE reviews ??? There are stupid people out there but GEEZ ! Over $ 8,000 for speaker cables ? They better be double dipped and coated in GOLD !
 So you feel you are ready to see The Great God Pan ? You feel you can handle the existential questioning that will darken your every waking moment like a very personal thunder cloud ? Well , there is only one way to get started and this terminated speaker cable is it .
 I picked up a set of these to connect my Coby walkman to a pair of Altec-Lansing Voice of the Theater speakers I have in the back of the Gremlin . Britney sounded pretty good , but the equalization was a little flat for Katy Perry 's single `` Teenage Dream '' -- hmm , minus one star.But why do I say DO NOT BUY you ask?After waiting 8 weeks for the $ 3 rebate to arrive it finally shows up in the form of a VISA PREPAID DEBIT CARD !!!! What 's this nonsense ??? I was expecting 3 crisp Washingtons to arrive by FedEx . After whipping out that card to pay for four cans of cat food at Wal-Mart I was mortified to have to rummage in my pocket to find the extra 27 cents to make up the difference . I swear I heard the clerk mutter `` High < something > roller '' under her breath .
 My husband gave me these cables for Christmas . Sometimes I get the feeling he gets me things HE wants , like that BMW 1200 GS motorcycle and the season court side tickets to Lakers games . Has he forgotten I 'm legally blind , for Pete 's sake ? If it 's the thought that counts , I have to ask
 Eight foot cables ? I thought you meant 8 light year long cables ... this will definitely not do . How am I supposed to listen to my music on Tau Ceti 3 ?
 I was charged with using all the worldly resources from my village to secure equipment to drill a new well . But an American pretty-man named Justin Timberlake told me that I should buy these magic strings instead and that my village would be rescued . Mr. Justin said he owned many such strings and even made up my shortage of $ 3.99 USD from his own fancy pocket . After two red moons , the strings arrived . The Magus set out our most beautiful woven mats and finery . The elders opened the box with the sharpened collar bone of our most distant chief . Then we waited . For a long time . The children died first and then the oldest among us . Each of my people said good-bye to me with a strange frown and a weak punch at my sacred under berries . Now it is only me and the woman who is not afraid to eat others . Do not buy these strings . They taste terrible . I send you last regards from myself and the woman who will not stop staring ...
 I was very disappointed in these cables . For this kind of money I expect a blue LED light up feature . Every other component of my stereo features many blinking blue LED 's , but these cables have no LED 's at all . I had to return these cables .
 Sounds great , but are mislabeled . Mine do n't say AudioQuest , but DalekTech . They look the same though , so I do n't care .
 While conducting myself through metal , I found myself suddenly feeling ... different . Better ! It was like flowing through liquid gold , except not quite . I was flowing through the AudioQuest cables . However , my enjoyment only lasted a few nanoseconds , as I soon reached the speakers and was converted into magnetism . You will have to ask the magnetic forces for sure , but I do n't think there was any difference in their experience . The cables were for my benefit alone . By the time any sound waves were produced , the experience was forgotten completely . Do your electricity a favour
 If you check their site - seriously - their cables really DO cost this much . Check ebay , and you 'll see that people pay these prices.I am seriously going to start reselling cheap-o cables for this price .
 They 're TOO good . I plugged these things into my 50W Magnavox 2.1 surround receiver and they impregnated my daughter . And I do n't even have a daughter . I had to return them so I can afford the pregnant daughter that my future wife is going to give birth to .

 My story is a grim one , though I shall be brief in the telling . I bought these cables as a kindness to help the old man with whom I lodge although he has a great deal of money of his own , a fact which caused me , I confess , no little grievance . His hearing is affected with the deafness of old age and I believed that a fine pair of speaker cables would extend the years of his auditory pleasure.I was never sure that he was using them , as I could hear no music coming from within his chamber , and he expressed no gratitude that I had done such a generous thing for him - this last , however , though it galled me , surprised me not , as he is by nature a tight , hard , walnut-hearted man , miserly with his feelings even towards those who help him so.I took to creeping into his chamber in the night to see whether he was using the speakers and cables covertly , assuming I would be abed and asleep . I could scarcely credit such an act would be possible , even from such a man , but - my hand trembles to record it - I found it so.Putting my head by degrees within the door of his chamber I discovered him in bed , insensible to my presence , enjoying the music -LRB- such clarity ! such angelic harmony I now heard ! -RRB- a smile of almost lustful joy upon his sunken chops.How quickly and suddenly my fury rose - that he should know I had struck myself with the direst poverty to increase his musical pleasure , yet not to grant me the merest sliver of acknowledgement or gratitude ! I was for a moment a madman , and in that instant I leaped within the room and pulled the heavy speaker cabinets upon him . I checked that he was deceased - his heart beat on for several seconds , muffled as a watch within cotton wool , and then ceased.I will not trouble you with the gross details of the disposal of the body . Suffice to say that I removed him and his corporeal traces so completely from this earth that when the constables called the next day , inquiring after noises neighbours had heard in the night , I greeted them with utmost equanimity . I invited them in . I threw open all the doors . I took them within the very chamber where I had done the deed . A reckless confidence akin to madness seized me . ` Are these not fine speakers ? ' I cried . ` See , the very cables themselves did cost thousands of dollars ; can there be any clearer evidence that I loved the old man ? ' At that , I promised I would let them hear the marvels of those devilish wires and I played them music - or so I intended . To my growing horror , all that emerged was a beat ; a rhythmic , steady beat , growing to a clamour - and muffled no more , but clear , sparkling , crystalline in all its awful clarity , a noise that pronounced my guilt . ` Fiendish cables ! ' I shrieked . ` Cease your denunciation ! I confess ! It is the high definition beating of his hideous heart ! '
 These cables were forged by the Dark Lord himself , deep within the bowels of Mordor ! They have powers that reveal sound - but seduce men . Using these cables I was rendered invisible to mortals , but they wiped away the chalkiness in my midrange . I desired and coveted them more than anything . Soon , I was living in the swamps , using these cables to snag fish and throttle the occasional hobbit that wandered nearby . Luckily , I met a recovering elf who steered me into a 12-step program in which I was able to turn over my life to a higher authority -LRB- J. Gordon Holt -RRB- and rid myself of these vile fetters ! I cast them into the fiery pools , but I now see they have been recast by the Evil One . Beware ! Beware !!!!!! Also , the connectors were loose .
 I 've had this case for about a month . It 's a decent case , but the manufacture is very poor . The tabs -LRB- which are plastic -RRB- have broken off both side panels -LRB- the panels attach poorly and some force is needed to atach and remove them -RRB- . If you are going to do a build and never open your case again - it will be fine . But if you open occasionally you will find how poor the construction is . Antec will not fix the panels ! They say it is not a warranty item ! After the panels comes the front door panel -LRB- which folds back upon itself - a neat idea - except the panel is hinged by ... . you guessed it - plastic dowels - which ... . you guessed again - have now broken off!So , I have a case with now front panel and two poorly attached side panels.The design itself is good - though unless your power supply has extra long cables - it is likely that they will not reach the connectors on the motherboard without additional extensions - which may raise all kind of power stability issues.Great idea Antec , but do n't cut corners and make high use items from easily sheared plastic materials .
 I 've been using Antec cases for years so I kept with tradition and bought the P180 . The included 120mm fans do not have a tach -LRB- RPM -RRB- output ! I read a positive review elsewhere in which the reviewer replaced the fans with better ones before even powering on the system ! You 'll spend a lot of time screwing stuff together . There are no quick clip-in mounts for drives . All drives must have the rails screwed to them with the exception of the lower drive bay which is only screwed together , no rails.Since the case Does Not include a power supply I also bought a True Power 2.0 480 watt power supply which was recommended by Antec . This is not the ideal match . If you follow the instruction for the power supply and the case you may Damage your computer ! The case instruction recommend setting the case fan speed to low , and the power supply instructions recommend plugging the case fans into the `` Fan Only '' connector of the power supply . In this configuration the case fans WILL NEVER COME ON ! Ever . Due to the design of the case with the power supply in the bottom , isolated from the motherboard and its waste heat the power supply ca n't sample the air temperature in the motherboard area . So , the voltage from the power supply to drive the case fans will never get high enough to make them come on.The lock on the front of the case is a joke , must be for decoration . Because the door is plastic , even when it 's locked you can very easily bend it back like the lid of a Tupperware container and switch on -LRB- or off -RRB- the power . It is not an electrical switch/lock and provides no security at all . So why did I give this case a rating of two instead of one ? Because , it is Quiet !
 Purchased one of these American Qosmio 's , and imported it to New Zealand . The Qosmio lasted just one month longer than its one year international warranty and then the motherboard died . I have always liked Toshiba but after wasting so much money on one I will never get another.Pro 's - Very nice looking machine loaded with features , nice sound -LRB- for a laptop -RRB- , and very clear and bright screen.Cons - noisy fan , runs hot which probably contributed to the short lifespan . Power supply also gets very hot.Toshiba mobile services NZ wanted to charge me $ 1500.00 for a replacement motherboard and provide just a three month warranty on the repair . Toshiba eventually repaired the laptop free of charge , but by this time I had replaced it with another laptop -LRB- not as flashy but hopefully much more reliable -RRB- . As much as I loved the Toshiba following the `` system enhancement '' , I decided to sell it on because of my negative experience .
 I 've had the computer for about 3 month now with nothing but trouble . Here 's a run down : - Very Noisy Fan - Laptop runs HOT HOT HOT ! even in a A/C room - Periodically shuts down without warning due to overheating -LRB- They are currently being sued by class action on several laptop models , with more coming ! -RRB- - The batter life is abysmal -LRB- less than 60 minutes -RRB- - Very weighty & big - Poor placement of cooling fan ; if you try to use the laptop on your lap , you often block the cooling fan causing a crash due to heat - Screen
 This product is lousy . The batteries could not hold a charge , I should have done my research , Monster is out of business , any batteries out there are old and expired . When they were in business the batteries worked great , however , now they 're all expired and can not stay charged . I threw them away .
 I have gone through a few digital cameras . My first was a Kodak . It took great pictures but was too big to just stick in my pocket . My next purchase was an Olympus . It was very compact with great feautres but took TERRIBLE pictures.Then I purchased the Sony DSCW90B . I like the size , but that is about it . 90 % of the pictures I take do not come out well at all . Also , the lag time between pictures seems to be forever . It is way too slow to capture small children playing and wildlife . Since I purchased it a few months ago , I am stuck .
 I sent it back twice to get repaired , each time they called me saying there was nothing wrong with the camera , but they agreed the indoors pictures were noisy ... I ended up returning it
 Buying this camera I learned that ISO 3600 is more a con than a pro . Any picture with ISO superior than 400 or 800 is way too grainy . Also Super steady shot is just not enough , pictures with low light -LRB- not dark -RRB- do still look shaky . Sony should try harder.One more thing , the edition effects that the cammera offers -LRB- i.e. colorizing -RRB- are much worst than in other brands -LRB- like cannon -RRB- .
 First of all , I would like to announce that with this model , Sony started manufacturing their cameras in China . I had bought the DSC W5 for my father over a year ago and a DSC W80 for my sister 6 months ago , and both were made in Japan , and both have functioned flawlessly . Not the case with the DSC W90 . If you do n't believe that China 's incredibly high acceptable defect rate does n't affect Sony 's quality , read on.Keep in mind that I bought this camera new and have taken meticulous care of it , keeping it protected in a padded Sony case away from extremes of temperature or humidity . Within the first 2 months of ownership , I used the camera twice . The first time I used it was on a trip to Washington , DC , where it functioned well -LRB- I took 30 to 40 pictures -RRB- . However , on my second trip , I went to Atlanta , and after taking about 20 pictures , the camera shut off with lens in full extension . It would never start up again , and the lens would n't retract . I fully charged the battery and again , it never would start up -LRB- the led would flash for a second and go off -RRB- . I called Sony Customer Service , and they determined that I needed to send it in for servicing to Sony 's repair subcontractor , Precision Camera . I sent it in , and Precision Camera called me once to tell me that they received it . After that I heard nothing from them . Despite 3 calls to Precision Camera , -LRB- you automatically get voicemail , and they never return the call -RRB- , they kept my camera a total of 30 days , yet they stated that they could not reproduce the problem that I had . Beware of Precision Camera 's lies displayed on their website
 Bought it as a point-and-shoot camera , but without significant adjustments , it was very blurry and grainy . It still takes terrible photos at night or with any of the settings but ISO . Bought it to replace an old basic point-and-shoot , but the old one is better all around . In fact , if we had n't brought the other camera with us too on our last trip , nothing but daytime pictures would have been worth keeping at all !
 I really liked this camera , but considering that it broke within the first six months , without being dropped and with no physical damage whatsoever . Furthermore , my experience got worse as SONY has refused to fix it or replace saying there 's corrosion but not explaining what the damage was from or where in the camera it was found . The worst product and company I have ever had to deal with !!!
 We had bought this camera for our first Disney family trip and loved it , but some pics came out grainy in low light . Overall good digital pics to share onlinebut if you need really clear printed pics maybe look elsewhere .
 read enough positive reviews that I switched from canon powershot . not happy with it . took decent enough pictures but still liked canon better . then , after 9 months , it just would not open . as long as sony fixes it without cost , my review might improve , but i have my doubts .
 I had to send this back to Amazon since this replacement did not fit my Epson model , which is specifically says it does . There is a small piece of plastic surrounding one of the connectors that is made slightly different than the original lamp and it does n't allow the lamp to fit flush and make a connection.My projector is now useless without the replacement lamp . Amazon offered to replace it , but with what ? That was the official replacement . A real shame since I was fairly happy with the projector itself . Lesson learned , no more Epson products for me .
 This is NOT for the Nano 5th g . It gives very sketchy information , and I think they might actually have changed the description , because when I bought it I thought it was for the 5th g. I have no idea what version it does fit , but not 5th g.It may or may not work well , but why would you buy it unless you knew for sure what it was supposed to fit ?
 for the price of this lens it should be made of metal . also for its size it should almost be a fish eye lens not a lens that barely adds a 1/4 more screen . HUGE LENS AND ADAPTOR for the weight of the lens the adaptor should be metal for sure . sony lenses are metal at this price
 This converter lens is ridiculously large . The photo in the ad does n't do it justice ! While it is quite sharp for a converter lens , its so big , it blocks out the built-in flash on the G9 , making it useless for much indoor snap shooting . The crescent shadow cast over the scene , makes it seem like there is an eclipse occurring during in every shot . BE WARNED ...
 I attempted to use this product in my living room with my home media computer . I need about 7 to 8 feet of range from the USB dongle to the keyboard and mouse . This hardware was not capable of that range without issues with mouse response and key strokes dropping out . All bluetooth keyboards I have tried have worked well at this range . For some reason non-bluetooth wireless keyboards seem to have serious range issues and this one is no exception . Finally the mouse is somewhat narrow and uncomfortable for my hand . It would probably be good for light use but extended use causes my hand to cramp . The keyboard is well built but not as well as my Lenovo laptop keyboard .
 Keyboard is fine and of good quality though the keys are a bit tough to press and requires more pressure than I 'm used to . This is not thinkpad quality.The killer is the mouse . The mouse probably weighs 1/2 a lb for god knows why . It 's gigantic and godawful heavy . If you do n't have wrist problems before , you will after using this mouse . The mouse is also elongated and must longer than anything I have ever seen .
 bought it as new from argent electronics it was junk in a box didnt work . to it to the geek squad to check it out they said it was junk throw it away . the box was very nice .
 The Charger works well . Charges the battery fairly fast , and its simple to operate . But the battery is no longer made by Nikon . If you want a battery it has to be an after Market battery ... . So instead of paying lots of money for this Charger , a person is better off buying an after market unit ...
 Despite advertising saying this antenna would work with my XM2GO radio , the antenna jack would not fit into the radio . I was able to return the product with no hassle , so I have no complaints other than poor advertising indicating the antenna was compatible with my radio .
 This antenna does not fit the Timex XM clock-radio antenna port.Therefore you must guess which XM radios it might fit .
 i got this Mp3 about 3 months ago . The whole idea of it being aroung your neck is cool , and how the controls are on the neckband are also ver cool . But after a while it does get annoying . A lot of the time i find myself wishing i could just put it in my pocket . Yes , you could do this ... but it makes is a real hasel trying to change the song or adjust your volume . You might think this is a good Mp3 to go to the gym with , but i have found when trying to use some of the equpment , the song or the voulme controls will get hit . Im not even to the best part yet , i have charged the battery for hours , and still i cant even get a whole song out of the battery . for the last thing , i have to say that the recording to the Mp3 i horrable . I will be listining to a song and right in the middle of the song , the player will just compleatly shut down ! Now you might think its the battery , but it does this all the time ... even when i change the battery . So please , if you have read this far , please save yourself the time , money , and trouble to not go out and buy this . Because all you will get from it is a headache .
 My Canon DC100 would not write to these dvds . The disc came up as unreadable . I tried all three and was unsuccessful in recording or reading the disc on my Canon video camera .
 Out of 6 Memorex discs used on my European vacation , only 3 were abled to playback . All 6 were stored and carried the same way , together . I 've not had one Sony disc fail . Suggest that only Sony discs be used in Sony products .
 It 's a nice durable bag but It 's bigger and bulkier than it looks in the pictures . The straps are very wide . I have broad shoulders and I still need the chest strap to keep the straps from pulling to the sides . The camera compartment on the bottom is only big enough to fit an SLR with a short lens . If I carry my 5D with the 24-70L lens , I have to keep it in the top zipper pocket in stead . It fits in the camera compartment perfectly with most shorter prime lenses though . But you would have to put your larger zoom in the top compartment.My main disappointment with this bag is the laptop compartment does n't fit a 13 '' laptop . It could have easily fit my laptop if they extended the zipper area by only a half inch in each side -LRB- major design flaw -RRB- . It 's only usable to hold books and papers.I will most likely get a lowepro that can fit my laptop to replace this bag very soon . I do n't recommend this bag at all . The lowepro slingshot which is much smaller than this bag can hold just as much stuff -LRB- minus the document pocket -RRB- .
 This mouse is incredibly jumpy if it 's not on a completely flat surface . It `` functions '' but I continuously have to fight with it to get the pointer to line up with what I want to click on . Also , if you set it down and try to type much like I am doing now , the cursor jumps around wildly on it 's own . It 's worthless as a portable mouse . It will not work at all on a knee that is uncovered or very well on any imperfect surface . I would send it back , but as it happens , my once faithful mouse that I originally used -LRB- I ordered this as an extra -RRB- decided to give up the ghost the day after I got this one .
 Within one year of buying this mouse , it stopped working well . I regularly have to disconnect and reconnect it to get it working . I suspect the problem is related to the cord or USB plug.Also , within two months of buying the mouse , the buttons started sticking or jamming . I got the impression something was stuck underneath , so I contacted the company asking how to open it up or clean it out . They never replied . The problem eventually went away.It 's possible the damage to the mouse was due to travelling with it -- I packed it along with other electronics into suitcases -LRB- but well-cushioned -RRB- a handful of times throughout the year . But my previous mouse -LRB- ball , not optical , so it ought to be more prone to travel damage -RRB- lasted me 6 or 7 years and was packed up and moved between locations a handful of times every year as well .
 Arrived quickly , no drivers included , did not work on Vista without drivers . Manufacturer and amazon unwilling/unable to provide working drivers . Amazon support unhelpful .
 That 's what I get for going off brand . After using this mouse for about three months , it would occasionally `` lose power '' and stop working . I would be able to unplug it and plug it in and use it for a few seconds and then it would die again.If you 're shopping for a mouse , do n't try to save a few bucks by going off brand like I did . Spend the extra $ 5 and get a Microsoft or Logitech mouse . I 'm still using the same $ 10 Logitech USB mouse that I got from Wal-Mart 7 years ago . If you want to save money in the long run , get a real mouse .
 It 's such a nice size but after just 3 days it has started to move all by itself . Interesting to watch but rather useless as a pointer . Often get the wrong item clicked .
 I started not to order this after reading the `` lasted 3 months '' review , but figured I would give it a shot for 5 bucks . After a month and a half of weekly laptop use Windows fails to recognize the device -LRB- on two different PCs -RRB- . That adds up to about 6 uses.If you decide to give it a shot , you should be aware that this is not a full-size mouse . It 's just about right for traveling with a laptop , but not so small it is difficult to use -- at least until it stops working !
 this mouse was good at first , but after about a month it stopped working . would not recommend anyone to buy this .
 It works as well as any other mouse for simple daily use but when it comes to fast paced game play the mouse gets overexcited and lost . At first I thought it just took some getting used to but after using it for awhile now I can see the problem . It starts out alright but the longer you use it fast paced the more it gets `` lost '' and it 's hard to aim or have it strike where your aiming .
 I bought these on the hope that I 'd find a relatively unknown but excellent canalphone . I was wrong . The sound is tinny and the build quality was sub-par . They broke within a month . Not Recommended !
 These are actually Opera Glasses not binoculars , do not have a roof prizm and have a narrow field rather wide as described . The field of view is narrow and optical quality of image is very poor.Probably the older model of this binocular was as described and the Chinese manufacturer cheapened it , keeping the same external look and description . These should be considered a child 's toy , not a useful binocular.This same item is sold under both Tasco and Bushnell , and in either case is not worth buying .
 had to do allot of rework on it to get it to work but after some time I got it to work
 You 'd think since the pieces are small and have to hold a big radio they would n't be so flimsy . I 'd also like to know where my hardware is .
 On the face of it this bag is well designed and appealing . Very light-weight , comfortable -LRB- despite no waist-band -RRB- and ergonomic . However , it is not built to last . Within a year , of frequent -LRB- but not unduly heavy -RRB- use , the fabric ripped all around the upper zips , rendering it useless . I 've used Lowepro for years before this and nearly all the bags are still going strong - entirely different quality construction -LRB- though even one of the zips has gone on the cheaper one of these -RRB- . On another note , having pictures of recommended contents -LRB- laptop , camera , phone , ipad etc. -RRB- on the outside may look funky and fun , but it also acts as a red-light to muggers and thieves -LRB- I live in Nairobi , Kenya - I know -RRB- . Do n't buy if longevity is a requirement .
 While it 's nice to protect the LCD , the lack of the ability to add a eyepiece extension makes it more annoying than useful . Your face is pressed against it more when you try to use the eyepiece and the LCD screen has to be closed to use it . I only use this to protect the LCD during transport now and switch to my eye extender for actual use .
 This is a great scale . The bad thing is you need the new RATE CHIP for it which costs nearly $ 50.00 .
 This was a nice little scale until the postal rates went up . It then took research to find that the processor chip had to be replaced at a cost greater than the scale . I just use it for the weighing function and calculate the postage myself .
 The instruction manual that comes with this scale is incomprehensible . It is not possible to figure out how to calculate postage for anything other than a letter sized envelope . There is no customer service number to call ; I contacted amazon.com to request one -LSB- no easy matter in itself -RSB- and they gave me the phone number of the U.S. Postal Service . There is no one at the Postal Service to talk to about it . I took it to my local post office and they had no knowlege of this product or how it worked . Now postage has increased and I have no information on how to input the new postal rates . Worst purchase I ever made on amazon.com
 This product came as advertised , but just was n't what I needed . Too small , must plug in , and , as I soon learned goes out of date quickly . The chip to update the scale costs more than the scale itself , of course . In the end , I returned this for the more flexible Ultra-35 , Ultra-Ship model which has worked flawlessly thus far . Nice also to be able to weigh in a multitude of measurements such as grams , kilograms , ounces , pounds etc. . The USPS scale is only pounds and ounces . I really like the battery option of the Ultra 35 as well as you can move it anywhere and weigh the package quickly . For users who want to keep it in a fixed location , the Ultra 35 can also be plugged in with the included adapter .
 Too many settings and this scale needs to be plugged into the wall . It can NOT run on a 9 volt battery .
 I wasted a three pack trying to burn to the Memorex disks to a USB ND-2510A . I was using both Nero and Roxio DVD Copy , and had the same results . I went out and bought the Verbatim DL disks and did not have any problems whatsoever .
 There are only a few DVD+R DL media makers out there . MKM , Ritek , Ricoh , & philips , i believe . Most labels use the ritek media because they 're cheap , and that 's exactly what they are `` CHEAP '' , crap , anyway you want to describe it . I 've never had problems burning and playing back MKM Verbatims but these I bought , burned as DVDROM bookytpe , & verified . Played them on 3 different players and they exhibit alot of freezes , skips , etc. . Why o why do memorex use riteks . So I wo n't be buying anymore DL media from memorex .
 $ 10 gamble . Based on previous reviews , I upgraded my firmware of my NEC drive before burning . Disc burned perfectly with no errors . Disc started playing fine in my DVD player , but 1/2 way through the movie , when it needed to change layers , the player struggled and stuttered and could n't play anything on the second layer .
 NOT A SINGLE ONE OUT OF SIX WORKED !!! EVERY ONE HAD A WRITE ERROR .
 3 discs sold in jewel cases so they can charge a zillion dollars for $ .10 of extra plastic and paper.First disc worked fine until about 15 minutes into the movie . Which would 've been fine had the movie been , say , `` Baby Geniuses . `` So , in reality , this is like a 400 mb DVD . Not 8.7 gb.The Memorex brand deserves to be driven into the ground . It 's a trusted brand from ... the 80s ? So it gets placement in Best Buy and all the big franchise stores based on identity alone and the outlived perception that Memorex = quality.But you 'll have better luck recording a full-length movie onto one of your audio tapes from '87 than you will with these 3 DVDs .
 I read the other reviews before I decided to take a chance on theses DVDs . I have a new NEC Dual Layer drive with the latest firmware and thought I would be fine . I was wrong . I tried burning two dvds and both failed . I tried the same content on a Verbatim DVD and it worked fine . Amazon let me return the order , but only refunded 75 % of my money after they deducted shipping costs .
 Macintosh G5 Dual Processor using Toast . Bought 3 boxes each with 3 discs . Box 1
 I 'm writing this because I had most people 's problem . It just would n't work . I followed the advise and updated the firmware and it did the trick , I just went to my computer 's online support website and downloaded it . I 'm putting 2 stars because of all the trouble I went through . I think this , being apparently such a common problem , should be at the very least mentioned somewhere in the product , so people do n't have to do a whole research trying to figure out what 's wrong .
 I read the reviews about how bad these were but , because they were cheap I thought I would try them . I bought nine of which four actually worked and five are coasters ... I strongly suggest buying another brand . My dvd drive was up to date with latest firmware , using dvd shrink with Nero burn engine . Success was hit or miss .
 Plays fine on the first layer . But picture will freeze during layer switch . I either have to stop or skip pass the chapter but picture will be jumping and pixellated , pretty much unwatchable.you have to skip at least couple chapter away from the layer switch to get a decent picture on your screen.don ' t waste your money . Buy verbatim instead . I never had any problem with that media .
 The quality of these discs is dubious as I have made at least 1 `` coaster '' out of each box of 3 -LRB- I have bought 6 boxes -RRB- . The error from the drive is a media error . I have used the Verbatim discs -LRB- dual layer & others -RRB- before & out of 6 discs got 1 bad burn which could have been operator error as it was one of the first discs I burned with the new drive . Unfortunately `` Memorex '' isnt a manufacturer anyomore -LRB- my dad worked there ages ago when they actually made products branded `` Memorex '' - reel to reel tape , etc. -RRB- but it is simply a name that has been purchased by another entity , such as the great names Marantz , Bell & Howell , etc. etc. . These discs arent on the `` recomended '' list from my drive maker so I am partially to blame for the failed discs - always check the drive makers list before buying especially if your using them for data backup as I was trying to do .
 I bought 2 packs -LRB- 6 discs -RRB- , 3 discs burned with lots of skips and freezes and 3 failed . And what 's worst the final disc broke my dvd drive ! The discs made my burner somehow burnout with all the errors . Never had a problem with my drive before these discs . Luckily my pc was under full warranty with DELL -LRB- love them -RRB- and they sent me a new drive.I tried one of the `` succesful '' burned disc on the new drive and it still skipped , so i threw them all away.Bought different brand dvd + r DL and they work great , no errors and no skips ... yeah !!!!
 These disks are slow and freeze up alot . Most of the time they dont work with any roxio/nero programs . Buy verbatim dvd + r dl and if u guys have ne image scribe dvd + r dl info or dvd + rw dl email me at snitbender@msn.com!!!
 Unfortunately , I have to agree with the many other negative reviews here , especially in regard to the long-term reliability of Memorex . I have burned many Memorex disks over the last 5-8 years , both regular density and the 8.4 gig dual layer , and the regular ones that are 3-5 years old or more are now showing a high rate of failure . I have n't had the DL disks as long to be able to say yet but I am monitoring them and will find out . But I regard the DLs as iffy also , although I 'm trying them out because I can use the extra storage capacity . I just do n't have any confidence in their reliability for more than a few years . If you check the discussion forums on the web and various blogs you will see Memorex 's discussed time and time again in regard to their poor long-term reliability . This makes Memorex disks useless for long-term storage . Of course you get what you pay for and Memorex are basically cheap , consumer grade media . Ritek 's were also considered of poor quality in the forums I read.On the other hand , the Verbatims and the Taiyo Yudens are quite reliable , although even the Verbatims are said to have slipped in recent years because they have licensed their technology to so many substandard off shore producers . If you can still find real Japanese made Verbatims they are probably okay . But if not , beware!So even if you do n't experience a high initial burn failure rate , Memorex is highly questionable for long-term archiving , which is what I need , or at least 3-5 years . But they are n't even reliable for that , based on my experience and other people 's experience which I have seen reported in various discussion groups . I give them two stars here instead of one because they might be okay for short term storage and if you absolutely need the cheapest , most economical media.Mitsui Advanced Media 's dual gold/silver disks and also the Century disk , which is similar and developed by a partnership between Mitsubishi and Kodak , are quite good , but at over 2 bucks apiece they ought to be . For most purposes Taiyo Yuden is fine and theirs are around 36 cents a disk in packs of 100 . The Century disks are the most expensive of all , but also , they are guaranteed to be from runs of less than 25,000 from the original glass master . Most companies do n't replace the master until 500,000 presses . This also causes problems because the master after the first couple of hundred thousand is n't that accurate.Whichever media you decide to buy , caveat emptor because it 's a mine field out there when it comes to purchasing decent media these days , one reason being because of all the fake brand name disks . I would just go with Taiyo Yuden . They are only made in Japan , but make sure you have real T-Y because of all the fakes . The real ones have a visible ring in the dye layer near the hub of the disks , which is said to be more expensive to manufacture and is harder to fake . Also , make sure the label on the package says it 's from Japan , although that 's not a certain criterion , but the extra little ring should be . Whichever media you choose , good luck !
 I got a 25 pack of these dual layer media on sale and over half of them have read errors.DVDS freeze and skip making them useless.Never again
 After burning one coaster , I thought , it 's just a fluke . I 'll burn my first DVD in no time . I was wrong . After updating the firmware on my new Plextor DVD burner and downloading the latest version of Nero 6 , I burned two more coasters . Do n't buy these unless you want pain and frustration .
 Puchased these and not one worked . They burned correctly just would not play or be recognized . STAY AWAY
 I bought 6 disks -LRB- 2 boxes -RRB- and 2 of the disks would n't work .
 I bought a five pack of Memorex DVD+R DL 's yesterday , I came home and started to use them to copy a movie with DVD CLoner 9 -LRB- which is awesome -RRB- . When I went to burn the movie onto a blank Memorex disk burned the first layer or almost the first layer good only at 2.4 times when they are rated for 8X then it messed up saying the drive needs a good quality of disk to burn to -LRB- I knew that it was compatible with my burner -RRB- . My burner is a Plextor 740A . All 5 disks did this in the same exact spot pretty much the disks were acting like they were only single layer and clearly said on the package they were DL . The good thing is that I just happened to buy a pack of DL Verbatim disks at the same time , good thing I did as the verbatims worked excellent at 8 speed even !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I took the CRAP Memorexes back to wal-mart today . I will not even look at or even buy Memorex blank dvd 's of any type ever again.Just to be certain these are the 5 pack DL 's in the more modern looking white box , the red box dvd + r DL 's could be fine and I have bought these before now that I remember I did have the same problem .
 Do n't buy these . Really folks , friends do n't let friends buy Memorex . Horrible quality , and they wo n't honor -LRB- when you can get through on the phone -RRB- their 1 year warranty . That is to say , the lawyers got to their warranty department , and there is a ` lawyer ' answer for every warranty eventuality . On the plus side , they are shiny on one side and make suitable bird deterants when hung in your fruit trees .
 Chances are none of these will work . Do n't waste your money on memorex like I did ! Try Verbatim instead , they work every time . Nothing more frustrating than watching discs fail one after another after another ! I will never buy memorex discs again !!
 I never have had a problem with Memorex blank media before but this incident changed my mind . I have burnt cd 's and dvd 's with their products since they usually come at a good price . The reason I bought these were they are the cheapest dual layer dvd 's I could find . I could not get any of them to work but any other brand would work in my burner . Now whenever I think of buying something from memorex it kind of leaves me with reservations before purchasing their products . If you are lucky they will work for you but me absolutely not . Next time I will spend extra with a brand like TDK or Sony when it comes to dual layer .
 I STILL AM NOT SURE WHY I PURCHASED THESE -LRB- 6 -RRB- DUAL LAYER DVD 'S AFTER ONE YEAR ON MY SHELF , I TRIED TO BURN A DVD MOVIE ON ONE , AS IT WAS TOO LARGE FOR A STANDARD DVD AND IT COPIED HALF AND THEN QUIT , RUINING THE DUAL LAYER DISK AND LEAVING ME UNABLE TO MAKE A COPY OF THE MOVIE I WAS WANTING TO BACK UP . SO UNLESS YOU HAVE A REAL NEED FOR A DUAL LAYER DISK I WOULD NOT ADVISE YOU TO MAKE THE PURCHASE .
 I was in a time crunch and needed a dvd-dl disc . Unfortunately the only brand available to me at the time was Memorex . I bought the 3 pack , and despite all my attempts , the entire 3 pack was completely worthless . I tried using my internal drive as well as my external drive , all a waste of time . Finally , I went out and bought my favorite brand , Verbatim , and everything worked like a charm on the very first try . Do n't gamble with your money , do n't buy Memorex .
 This price seemed too good to be true . The description was n't clear enough but reading through the ad and I finally got that it was only 3 discs in total even though the picture is of a 10 pack . I thought at first perhaps it was a ad for non Dual Layer . No ... just a lot fewer discs.Watch out !!!!!!!!!!!!
 I have constantly had problems with any Memorex media , both single layer and dual layer . I 've thrown away dozens of discs . Similar problems as others have mentioned here , skipping , disc errors , inconsistent recording , high pitched sqealing in and out of the audio , very annoying , and on and on and on . I have had the best luck with Sony media . Stay away from anything with Memorex on it , this stuff is the worst media out there . I will never buy Memorex again . It 's the cheapest media out there when it 's on sale , but alas , you get what you pay for .
 I have yet to have a good burn with any memorex double layer dvd . My suggestion , after wasting $ 45 , is to buy a more expensive brand , as you will save in the long run with fewer wasted disks . Come on Memorex ... we expect more !
 I bought this item so I could quickly digitize my slides . Not in the best possible quality but fair enough for a catalog . The first and biggest problem appeared to be that only automatically framed slides thinner than 2.5 mm fitted into the frame-holder . 99 % of my slides are manually framed -LRB- by myself -RRB- and did n't fit in . The test I did with the other 1 % was disappointing . My Nikon D3100 does not focus well on the surface of the frame . I should focus manually , which is very difficult on such a small picture . The last thing is
 This product has a tiny instruction sheet that does not , under even the best interpretation , fit the need . It is poorly worded and uses unfamiliar terms perhaps known to the writer but no one else . The unit is poorly made and is extremely difficult to set up . I returned it as inadequate for my requirements .
 While the concept seems good , it just will not produce a good duplicate picture no matter what lens I used and I have many . It is also clumsy to use , it does not lock in one position adequately . When you think you have it set , and then try to move the slide carrier to the next slide , the device moves resulting is loss of the rotational setting . I have hundred 's of slides and this device will take way to long to get them all digitized .
 After purchasing this product and trying unsuccessfully to get a good image of negatives , I did some research . Color negatives have an amber/orange base film . I do n't know about all processing programs , but PS Elements 6.0 can not quite compensate for this apparently . After processing , images were viewable , but by no means quality . Color and contrast just would not match the actual photo , not even close . Obviously , resolution will depend on the camera you use with this product . I have n't tried B&W images yet , I mainly wanted this for color negatives , of which I have lots , but from others B&W is apparently no problem since the film is gray and easy to compensate for . As for the quality of the product , it 's ok , but I did have to point my camera straight down because with the camera horizontal the product actually droops at the joint in the middle -LRB- which allows you to rotate the negative in front of the lens -RRB- . Otherwise the negative will actually be below center of the camera view . Also , the negative window is sized smaller than the actual image on the negative so there is some slight inherent cropping . Overall , if you ca n't use a scanner , for whatever reason , and you have to digitize your negatives , ok , otherwise , just have the images printed and then scan them in . The picture quality and resolution will be much better , and the time involved in processing will be much less .
 I am disappointed in the quality of the copies of my slides . Hopefully as I get use to using this unit , I will get better . But now not very happyJames
 It is a slide copier , you can not put regular film in it . It is very heavy and the parts move , very difficult to center the image . A waste of money .
 First off , if you have a macro lens , your do not need this item.To be fair , this item is inexpensive so do n't expect too much . The device is nothing more than a slide mount attached to a plastic tube ; with a fairly cheap lens on one end.You thread a 52mm filtered lens to the end of the tube . Even though it was suggested for a Nikon , I suppose it will work with any brand of camera with a 52mm thread . It does come with a threaded adaptor for a 67mm ring.There is no way to zoom and crop a slide using the tube , you are out of luck if you do not have a small zoom lens to use with the copier . It is probably useful if you own a DX camera with a kit lens , but it can not be used on a bigger FX camera like a Nikon D700 or a D3.I tried 3 prime lenses on it and none of them will focus properly and there is no way to fill a frame ; unfortunately , I do not have a kit lens to try.So it goes back to 47th Street Photo , and pay a 15 % return charge plus your own return postage.Not recommended
 This device has a very limited use.They say it 's suitable for 67 or 52mm thread lenses , and it 's true.But what they do n't tell you is that you need about a 70mm focal lens to get the rectangle of the slide in a decent view size.I have a tokina 50mm lens -LRB- 52mm thread -RRB- and what I got is a very small image of the slide , about 1/3 of the whole camera view . Not to mention a lot of ligth comming from the edges of the slide.So , now I have 2 choices
 Very hard to find adapters that would fit my 18-200 lenses -LRB- Nikon and Tameron and using it on the 18-55 did not produce the expected result -LRB- think black frame around the slides -RRB- . Expected a better made product
 Very hard to use . Single slide hard to push in and pull out . Did not fit properly over lens on camera body . Needs a light box for proper illumination of slides .
 Not quite as simple to use as I expected and it does n't work as well as I had hoped . I ca n't recommend this product .
 I do n't know what to make of the Opteka Digital Duplicator . I am trying to use it on my Nikon D60 DSLR . I have a 55-200 mm zoom lens and an 18-55 mm . I have been trying to get a decently focused image , but , try as I may , I get a blurred image using either lens . I write this hoping somebody will tell me what I need to do .
 I was having problems with my Optecka HD2 inserting slides untll one of the four guide/tension spring inside the slide slot broke loss and fell out of the duplicator . After disassembling to see if I could reinstall the spring , no go . I did discover that CHEAP is not right word for Optecka build quality . Without the spring getting in the way of the slides the duplicator is usable . -LRB- I may remove the other upper spring -RRB- If you can find one for $ 15 or less , buy it .
 I found this item to be worth the money to digitize my valued slides , after much fooling around to make it work , but of `` dollar store '' value when it comes to quality engineering and practicality . To focus on each slide you must be able to turn the camera focus ring , which then turns the slide holder off its horizontal plane . If the holder pivot point had slightly looser toleraces it would be easy to adjust that part with two fingers . Instead it takes both hands to avoid torquing the camera lens . I finally left the `` contraption '' one thread loose on the lens barrel , placed the slide holder end on a solid horizontal surface and was able to focus that way with probably 80 % focusing success . If you want to fool with it you can get satisfactory results , just do n't be in a hurry . I think the price for this copier as is should be more in the $ 9.95 range . If the person who developed this is reading , you have a good idea but it needs refinement !
 The Opteka HD2 Slide duplicator has two problems .1 . Some old paper mounted Kodak slides are slightly too large and must be forced into the slide slot . Pliars must be used to remove them .2 . The slide is not in correct alignment and can not be pushed down far enough to fill the viewfinder , leaving a black band across the bottom of the frame . Thus one must either zoom in slightly to fill the frame thereby loosing part of the picture , or crop out the black bar afterwards using a photo editor.If I bought another slide copier , it would be the model with the movable slide receiver .
 As a bicycle commuter I 've been looking for quite a while for the ideal radio to use while riding . Seeing Sony 's SRF-HM10 recently in the store had me hoping I 'd found it , but it turns out I was disappointed again.My current - and so far - best solution is Sony 's SRF-M85V radio with Shure 's e2c earbuds . The sound insulation the e2c earbuds provide is simply unmatched by anything else I 've seen elsewhere , including the HM10 's earbuds , which unfortunately just do n't go deep enough to make a tight seal.But the biggest disappointment of the HM10 is its radio reception that is probably the worst in the line of Sony 's S2 sports radios . In most pocket radios the headphone cord doubles as the FM antenna and so I thought that the HM10 must have a more advanced antenna system and/or radio receiver to make up for the lack of a long headphone cord . But this is not the case . This becomes painfully apparent when holding the hand close to the receiver when tuned in to a weak radio station . This alone improves radio reception , so your hand acts as the antenna.Other than that , the controls are fairly straightforward . Channel preset up-down buttons that double as tuning controls , volume up-down buttons , bass boost and power button with Local and DX setting are fairly easy to learn and discern , since when wearing the radio all controls are behind your head . Wearing the radio seems comfortable , although I did n't try for long periods of time or in a high impact sports activity.Also , I do n't understand why a station scan is n't featured , but this seems to be no different than from the other S2 radios from Sony.Unlike the description the radio is for FM reception only -LRB- no AM , no Weather band , and certainly no TV band -RRB- and provides for 15 FM station presets . A nice detail is that if you program fewer than 15 stations into the radio you do n't have to cycle through all the unused slots when going from your last to your first station preset.If it was n't for the unacceptable reception capabilities and haphazard earbuds , that do n't really seal very well , this would be a killer product.So , unless you only want to listen to the strongest stations in your area , do n't waste your money .
 I bought this specifically to take to the San Jose Sharks hockey games , where we like to listen to the FM radio play-by-play as we watch , which is broadcast inside the building on a separate channel . Reception inside the arena is usually excellent . I own 4 different FM headset radios to take to the games , so we can accommodate everyone when the whole family goes . This one was the only one I 've ever tried that could not be made to give acceptable results . I was amazed at how bad it was . I figured it must have weak batteries , but I always bring an extra set of brand new ones and they did n't help one bit.The problem is simple - FM radio reception is terrible . It 's worse than useless in many situations where my other three devices -LRB- all Sonys , all different , all significantly less expensive -RRB- work fine . Just incredibly bad . I tried it elsewhere -- in the car and at home , on stations that I normally get good reception , there was no joy from this model . On the rare occasions when the reception is good , the sound is quite good -LRB- making it all the more frustrating -RRB- . Ergonomics are also not great , it 's really hard to adjust this while wearing it , and the general comfort and feel is n't good.Buy anything else but this one , this model is a real clunker .
 I have been buying this version of radio from Sony for 20 years and loved them . The last version was discontinued and on ebay were over $ 100 dollars . I bought this one . Sounds great , great design , but has no AM of distance . very disapointing
 TheSony SRF-HM10 S2 Sports Street-Style FM Radio Walkmanis a well designed product except in the most important feature/function - I live in the San Francisco Metropolitan Bay Area where the FM radio spectrum is filled with stations , most of which are high powered . Even my worn out 20 year old walkman radio does n't have any difficulty providing clear , static free programming from most of the stations -LRB- including the weak local college stations -RRB- . The Sony SRF-HM10 S2 headphone radio was not able to receive most of the Bay Area stations at all -LRB- all static -RRB- and the few strongest stations were filled with static . This poor performance was determined under ideal conditions
 If you hold it right and press on the outside shell just off center it MIGHT work or not . Worst SONY product I have ever owned . Ans no one accepts -- return it to me to be fixed ... I sure will not use Amazon retailers again !!
 When I first purchased it , I liked it because it did increase the sound of my built-in laptop speakers . However , for watching movies and videos , it 's just not loud enough , and the range of sounds is poor . I did n't realize how much I did n't like this speaker until I purchased the `` TRITTON SOUND BITE USB 2.1 PORT '' portable usb speaker , which I rated 5 stars.If you 've looking for a small , portable speaker for your laptop which really increases the volume and has a great sound range , I would not purchase this one .
 I bought this speaker because the internal speakers on my Dell XPS M1210 laptop were not loud enough . I followed all of the directions to install this external speaker , but there is no sound . I contacted JLab Audio tech support and received the following e-mail
 I ordered this for my partner for her birthday . We spent two hours fiddling with it with no success . I do n't know if the product was defective or if it just did n't work on her laptop , but we followed all directions , 5 times and not a single sound came out of it.I also tried it on my computer , and nothing . DAMN !
 This speaker is only slightly louder than the internal speakers in my IBM laptop .
 I wish I had known this item is out of stock . Optics Planet has lousy internet inventory and there 's a long wait . Their customer service is quite rude and lacking . I suggest a different supplier . I ca n't comment on the monocular as I have n't gotten it . *** Note
 I needed a hub with its own power supply . Asante has decided to go against naming conventions and calls their hub `` self-powered '' . This normally means the hub has its own power supply . In the case of this hub , it means the exact opposite , that the hub pulls its power from the bus . This is normally called `` bus powered '' . Beware , if you need a self powered hub , do not buy this product .
 I bought a cheap Xerox printer , the Docuprint C8 , that uses this small black ink cartridge . I am constantly running out of ink . Avoid the printer that uses this cartridge unless you enjoy shopping for office supplies .
 I realize that printers are cheap and that the manufacturers make their profit on the sell of the ink cartridges , but this is terrible . These cartridges are too high priced and very inconvenient . I ca n't find them on the shelves at the stores , so they have to be ordered . I 'm always out of Black Ink .
 I purchased a Xerox Docuprint C6 with my first computor in October 2000 ; ` just short ' of one year later it does not print blue , the help desk have said replace the print head , unfortunately `` not covered by warrantee '' . Cost 22.00 approximately , original printer price 40.00 approximately.Whilst I admit to limited experience in wear an tear - and computor consumables , why are n't things made to last?Sorry Xerox - big thumbs down .
 I can not reccomend this dash kit . The opening for the radio on this kit is not large enough for the DIN cage to slide into it . Any other dash kit I have ever experienced , you slide the DIN cage in first and secure that , then , slide the stereo into the cage . This dash kit only allows the face of the stereo to show through.I highly recommend you look for another option . I am .
 DONT BUY THIS PIECE OF `` POOP '' Like others says this thing dose n't fit on the car they specified and theres no way to make it fit.Trust me I 'm been a system installer for more that 10 years now and I have never seen a soooooooo useless piece of plastic on my life , and even WORSE !!! Amazon is backing up this thing ! . It seems like it 's just a black plastic frame that you install on top of your preinstalled estero and it just to cover some openings around it , It dose n't have any means to hold or secure your stero so the stereo has to be bolted or secured by other means to your car 's dashboard.Ohhh and I almost forgot ! ... . it also have a very thin pocket under of the unit , and it 's made of cheap plastic.SincerelyA very desapointed Amazon customer .
 I saw the other reviews saying it would n't fit , but I could n't find a product on Amazon that was rated any high for my Focus so I gave this a shot . It does n't fit . No DIN radio will ever fit with this unit . Even if you were to cut the hole big enough -LRB- which was my plan -RRB- the unit is not shaped properly to accept the cage that goes around every DIN radio . It looks to me as if this is made to cover a radio that is already install into some other bracket , but no such bracket exists.Just in case anyone missed it , IT DOESN `` T FIT ! IT WILL NEVER WORK FOR ANY DIN RADIO ! NO NOT BUY !
 I bought this camera as a graduation gift , so I was n't able to test it during Gateway 's 15 day full refund policy . As soon as it was used , it said the battery was low on brand new batteries . The representative at Gateway said they could replace the product -LRB- which took 3 months -RRB- . The replacement did the exact same thing as the original , so I called Gateway again . This time , after talking to a supervisor , I was offered an upgrade to the Gateway M42 . I have not gotten this yet , but I am waiting to see if this camera has the same issue .
 Our camera turns off in mid use . We had it for 20 days and Gaetway would not replace . I went to the GAteway store and tehy siad they had a lot of probelms with this camera . They would fix it if I paid the cost of shipping . I have learned my lesson never to shop at Gateway .
 This cable had all of the high end features one would want , braided cable , gold plated contacts , and so forth . And , well , the thing failed within a couple months . Now I replaced it with the cheapest piece of junk that Amazon carries and that lasted way longer , and it provided a better quality -LRB- or as good -RRB- picture.I would not spend my money on these overpriced , underperforming cables . Sorry.The items are only warrantied if they are purchased from a licensed dealer . Unless you are sure that this reseller is such a dealer , I would n't risk it . And I would save my receipt .
 We smoothly plugged this cable in with no trouble , gave it plenty of bend radius , had a great connection . We went to remove , and the sheathing stayed in the TV pins and cable came out . It destroyed our HDMI port , and now our Plasma can only connect via component -LRB- pointless for that new blu-ray player -RRB- . Do NOT buy this product !
 The tip broke off this over priced piece of junk . I now avoid anything with the Rocketfish name printed on it .
 These headphones are lightweight , large enough for my moderately-large dome , and have comfortable ear cups . Those are the only good things I can say about them.There is no padding on the top piece , so baldies like me must endure the hard plastic directly on the cranium . Not good.The noise canceling is nearly non-existent . Frank , my very loud neighbor in my miserable cube farm with his ceaseless , inane phone chatter can be heard loudly and clearly with these headphones on . I used to refer to my old NC headphones my `` Frank Blockers , '' but these barely dim Frank 's incessant cacophony , sad to say.Also , with the supposed noise cancellation turned on , there is a very audible hiss in these headphones that is incredibly annoying . It 's ridiculous that you must crank up the volume of your music or podcast to drown out the hissing produced by the noise cancellation function.To round things out , the sound quality of this headset is extremely poor . I am reminded of my misspent youth listening to AM transistor radios when I use these headphones.Oh , and I cut myself trying to wrestle these things out of the obnoxious bomb-proof plastic packaging.I feel very cheated and ripped-off having purchased these . My goal is to inform you so that you do n't make the same mistake . I hope you heed my warnings .
 we bought these on a whim at an InMotion kiosk before a flight to Hawaii . The sound without the noise canceling is okay , but when you turn on the noise canceling , the noise STARTS . Yeah , these do n't eliminate noise , they create it . So weird . I thought we just had a lemon pair , but others have noted this very same thing.We tried to take them back to InMotion but because they had offered to keep our packaging for us , we could n't return them .
 I bought this product that it would have good quality , but no . There is a lot of background noise , which probably means poor materials . Also the noise canceling is weak . I can still hear a lot of noise in the background . I should have shelled out for a more expensive one .
 I purchased this headphone set for my son at a local electronics store , and am sad to report that they charged me $ 69.99 for a rather disappointing set of headphones . With the first use , the headphones seemed to work well , blocking out most ambient noise in the room , but as soon as we boarded a plane , my son plugged the headphones into his IPOD , and reported that there was a constant buzzing/static noise coming through the headphones that got worse by turning the sound reduction on and slightly better by turning the noise-reduction feature off . We tested the headphones with two different IPODS , as well as the airline radio system and concluded that the headphones were getting interference from the plane . This static sound could not be blocked out by turning up the music , so the whole point of sound reduction was not achieved . We had much better sound just using our standard Ipod headphones while on the plane . I am going to return the headphones to the local store and purchase a pair from Amazon that has gotten an average of 5 by reviewers . Hope we have a better experience .
 Perhaps I was mislead by the claim of noise canceling . The only noise `` reduction of any degree is when used with audio '' .
 I bought these from Fry 's in a desperate attempt to be able to focus on my work despite the noise from my cube neighbors and the adjacent lab . Unfortunately the only noise it managed to completely suppress was when someone wanted to talk directly to me . Other ambient noises were muffled but still clearly audible . That was with the headphones turned off . Turning on the headphones only served to reduce sound quality . It created a sort of white noise like tuning to a non-existent channel on your TV . So I used them in the off position for a while thinking that they were fine for what I spent on them . That was until I moved my desk chair and turned my head at the same time jerking on the cord . It must have pulled the cord loose because now they crackle when I turn my head and the right headphone will stop working . Granted it 's not the fault of the headphones , but clearly the cord is too short . Sure these are cheaper , but you get what you pay for .
 After owning these headphones for about a month , the right speaker is already not working .
 I have no idea if noise reduction really works but it does n't do much with this pair of headphones .
 the noise cancelling earphones were really nothing special as theairline I was flying , Cathay Pacific , had the identical earphonesavailable for everyone in business class.They were n't expensive , but they certainly did NOT live up to myexpectations .
 These headphones are lightweight and comfortable , and the cord is long enough , and they came with an airplane adapter included . These are the good things I can say.Unfortunately , the bad outweighs the good.The cord is very thin and flimsy , and I 'm afraid it would not last very long . I bought these at a store and they are going back . The noise cancellation does not work well . When you turn it on , a hissing noise starts , and the outside noise is not perceptibly diminished . In addition to normal household noise , I tested them with a violin playing in the same room , and they failed that test spectacularly .
 I did n't notice a difference between puting them on and putting my hands over my ears.Want one for cutting out/down the background noise of the TV so I can concentrate on reading . Do n't want to listen to music , want to hear nothing/little so I can concentrate on what I 'm doing , so I never tried listening to music through them.Returned them .
 Do yourself a favor and do n't waste your time or money on these . I 've had these for a little over a year now and they do no function . One ear piece crackles and the other does n't even have sound . Mind you , this is a replacement pair . I had the same issue the first time around and was dumb enough to exchange them -LRB- thinking it was just a faulty pair -RRB- . So it seems like these headphones short a lot , and the noise cancellation was just a big joke . The only good quality was that they were comfortable to wear and were fold-able . I guess you get what you pay for .
 I use these at work and they work well as headphones but very poorly as `` noise cancelling '' headphones . That being said , I have tried on many expensive `` noise cancelling '' headphones and have found all of them to be poor at cancelling out noise . As such , these are basically as good as any more expensive brand you can pick up . Any noise cancelling headphones requiring a battery , I am dubious about . If you want true noise cancellation , look for a pair of headphones that fit completely over and around the ear .
 I 've owned various noise cancelling headphones , from expensive Bose Quiet Comfort to cheaper models . I 've had $ 60 noise-cancelling headphones do a great job at cancelling noise . I know how noise-cancelling feels , I know what to expect.I bought these on my way to the airport as I had forgotten mine ... I was n't risking much for the price . They are comfortable , I like that they nicely feet around the ear . The sound quality is decent . The noise cancellation absent.In fact , activating noise cancellation will actually INCREASE noise by adding a white noise . In the airplane , I tried switching it on and off ... all I could perceive was a shift in the frequency of the woosh , but the volume of the noise was lower when noise cancellation was turned off.I do n't know by which stretch of the imagination these can be called noise-cancelling headphones . If you do n't care about noise-cancellation , you can buy a higher quality regular model , if you do , by all means stay away .
 I have had these headphones for less than a year and have had problems since a few weeks after purchase -LRB- right after the return period -RRB- . They now only work every fifth try .
 I had one for 6 months and was quite happy . Then the cryptic error message came on and it would n't work . So took it back to Costco and got another . It worked great for 10 days , and then had the same cryptic message . This is non-repairable by the user . So you have to send it to Sharp for repair -- best not to buy it at all . I returned it and got a Brother 8640D - The brother actually is much faster for scanning , copying and printing . Hope it lasts.Updated February 2009
 My unit did n't hold up well at all . Makes a horrible grinding sound . Did some checking and learned this is a `` very common problem with this model '' and it 's an issue they do n't suggest you self-repair . I read that as a design flaw . The main drive gear that powers the fuser strips out . Ca n't get to it easily . Nice features but the copier gave out quickly .
 The Printer lost its IP settings 2 months after purchase ... we lost the Software CD that is NEEDED to change any admin settings on the machine . Sharp DOES NOT supply the software via electronic download . You must purchase it at a $ 30 cost and wait for snail mail to deliver it . Evidentally , our employees and the need to print important information do not matter ... . Guess that is why this printer and sharp have low ratings over every online electonics dealers web sites .
 Returned as the description said that it also faxes but found out that the description was inaccurate . Amazon accepted the return and issued credit for the full amount .
 I bought one of these copiers locally -LRB- at Staples -RRB- rather than ordering it from Amazon , in part because of the problem the other reviewer had . I got it all set up , plugged it in , and got a cryptic error message . The manual said to call Sharp for this message , and when I did the technician walked me through entering the diagnostic menu -- so he could read the copies count -LRB- it was zero . -RRB- We reset the printer and it came back with the same error message . He said the printer was `` DOA '' , and I would have to send it back to Sharp and they would send me a refurbished replacement . I said that was unacceptable ; I had paid for a new copier and it had failed before ever being used . He said that under the terms of the warranty they only have to replace them with refurbished units.I 'm returning it to Staples tomorrow . I 'm not sure whether to try another one or just get my money back . In either case , it 's not something you 'd want to do paying $ 40 shipping every time you send it back.A refurbished replacement would be OK if it had failed after 6 or 8 months of use . It 's not OK for replacing a brand new copier . I 'm glad I paid with a credit card in case I have trouble with the return.FOLLOW-UP
 My workplace had this model sitting around and not being used for a while . When the imaging drum on our color laser went out , I tried bringing this thing back to life so my co-workers had * something * to print on . Then I discovered all the fun driver issues -LRB- beginning with getting them -RRB- . Well , after a day , I finally got it to work on a Windows 7 64-bit machine over a network . Here 's how : Getting the drivers :1 -RRB- Go to -LSB- ... -RSB- 2 -RRB- Do n't bother browsing through the menues to get to the specific drivers -- the search results will come back empty . Ugh ! Instead , just search for `` 1655cs '' in the search box on their home page . * 3 -RRB- Choose the `` Downloads Drivers Manuals SHARP Customer Support ... '' option from the search results -LRB- it was the second result for me -RRB- . Make sure 1655CS is in the URL ; it wo n't be in the title . Ugh ! 4 -RRB- Click on the `` Driver for AL-1655CS '' link in the table corresponding to Windows 7 64-bit -LRB- Second row for me -RRB- .5 -RRB- Save the ZIP file somewhere . * Let 's see how long Sharp continues to host these drivers ... Unpacking the files :1 -RRB- Right-click on the ZIP file and choose `` Extract All ... `` 2 -RRB- Choose a folder . The default path includes a long , unique folder name . I recommend deleting the last part of this path as the extracted files will still extract to a sub-folder of that same long , unique name . If you use the default path , no problem , but you 'll just have to navigate through two long folder names of the same name -LRB- one inside of the other -RRB- just to get to TWO FILES ! Ugh ! 3 -RRB- Run the program in the folder -LRB- s -RRB- you 've just created -LRB- with Administrative privileges , if you have to -RRB- . Choose the folder to extract the ACTUAL setup files to -LRB- like C : \ drivers \ < something > -RRB- . The real setup program should start automatically.And now for a bit of the ridiculous :1 -RRB- On the first option screen during Setup , choose `` LPR Direct Print '' . If your printer is on the same LAN/broadcast domain as your computer , the setup program should find the printer . Note its IP address . -LRB- Note
 I loved this printer , until I upgraded to Windows Vista 64 bit . Silly me . Sharp will NOT provide a driver for this equipment . That it is still being sold is outrageous . Of course I had just purchased an $ 80 toner cartridge for this monstrosity , and now all I can do with it is photocopy
 Like wasting your time and money ? Be sure to include this in your shopping list . It 's a must have .
 The machine does not have fax capability . Also , Sharp does not have drivers to make it work with Windows vista . I would avoid Sharp altogether . Have had bad luck with three separate Sharp machines .
 I bought this AT-1655CS for my new Vista PC but could n't make it work . I 've called Sharp and they do not have any date/plan for a Windows Vista driver .
 This is the second Sharp mutli-function unit I have had . They are junk ! The USB 2.0 stopped working fairly soon . After about a year is started jamming all the time . Sharp support said it was beyond the warrenty and it was my tuff luck . I had simialr problems with my first Sharp machine , an earilier model . This lasted about 18 months , about 10,000 cycles . Sharp support is awful . Buy a Brother or a H-P .
 This is the only unit of it 's kind that I have ever seen that does not have a fax built in . Amazing . Buy something else.Addendum on day two . Today , the second day of having this model , the USB 2.0 stopped functioning and it will only work with USB 1.0 standards now . Wonder what will not work right tomorrow.Well , after a few days of massive frustration , I took this thing back . I 'm SO happy to have offloaded this product . It is so flawed on so many levels . I bought a Brother 8860DN instead . Having had many of these Brother MFCs , I 'm prepared to understand what I wo n't like about it -LRB- and all my employees hate about it -- things like the VERY annoying beep when you run out of paper or open the paper drawer -RRB- . Having said that , this 8860 is a wonderful machine . I 've been giving it quite a workout . It 's printing well , scanning well , printing in duplex amazingly well , and printing fast . It 's a gem . I highly recommend the Brother 8860 and recommend you not have to return the Sharp noted above before getting something like the Brother !
 Open brand new from box . Installed toner . Tried to copy . Got `` Clear Paper Jam '' . Checked all compartments - no paper . Can not clear error . Return to sender !
 One nasty surprise has been the quality difference between the burned label on CDs versus DVDs -- the DVD label quality is very poor . Just eyeballing it , using the Extended Label Contrast Utility -LRB- one of the updates on lightscribe.com -RRB- a CD burns as dark as 80 % - gray but a DVD burns only as dark as 30 % - gray . Additionally the DVD image is fuzzy and lacks the crispness of a CD label . I tried three different LightScribe DVD media manufatures to make sure this was n't a media product problem.According to the lightscribe.com FAQs , DVDs have an additional layer of plastic applique on the top side which reduces the laser intensity on DVD burns . LightScibe refers to a 3D quality to the image , I do n't see 3D but rather a diffused fuzziness on the image like the laser was out of focus or something.My favorite quote from lightscribe.com is , `` we have found that many people think the dynamic appearance of LightScribe-labeled DVDs is especially suited to media which store videos and creative content . -LRB- http://www.lightscribe.com/support/index.aspx?id=302 -RRB- '' That is marketing spin meaning LightScribe is probably not yet ready to produce business-quality DVD label images.I think the quality difference between CD and DVDs should have been more called out by HP in the upfront product descriptions . I am still happy with the CD performance but most of my projects require media large than 1GB . I hope this shortcoming is addressed soon .
 The DVD 's work OK as far as reading/writing the data , but the quality of the lightscribe image is poor for these disks compared to other brands . Given the premium you pay for the lightscribe disk , I was very dissapointed by the low quality of the image . I printed the same image on these disks and disks from another manufacturer , and the image on the memorex was very fuzzy , and low contrast compared to the other brand . Unfortunately I bought a spindle of these , but will not buy this type again .
 This camera was sadly disappointing . It is powered by only two AA batteries , which last only one photo taking and sometimes less . In Gateway 's defence , they do provide two rechargable batteries with the camera , but that does n't make up for having to change the batteries daily.I have had the camera only a week and have already had trouble with it accepting the memory card . At times , it said that there were no images ... I jiggled the memory card around a bit and my hundred + images reappeared . Very annoying!As for quality ... No , this is no 4.0 megapixel camera . My older 3.0 camera takes better quality photos than this one . They tend to be grainy and fuzzy , regardless of settings , and close-up shots simply are NOT possible -- despite the macro settings.It does have some nice `` bells and whistles '' with lighting and color options , but that simply does n't make up for poor quality photos . If you are taking photos for more than family snapshots , this is NOT the camera for you .
 Let 's start with the very first issue ... batteries . I plugged in the rechargeable batteries that came with it , programmed the time and date , and took seven pictures then the batteries were dead . I am not a new digital camera owner . I have the Hewlett Packard PhotoSmart C215xi 1.3 MP Digital Camera . I thought that it was time to upgrade to a camera with more MPs so I bought the Gateway 4.1 . I took my HP to Maui and took over 150 pictures on one set of batteries on the medium setting . And I could n't even get 10 out of the Gateway ! Pathetic ! Put in some Duracel batteries , same deal ... got 5 pics when the low bat signaled.My next issue with this camera is picture quality . Took some landscape shots to test the `` scenic '' feature of this camera along with portrait and auto since these are the features that I would use the most . I then downloaded the pics from the camera to the pc * using yet again another set of batteries * . Picture quality at best with the brand new 4.1 MP Gateway was on an equal par with the LOWEST setting on the HP * that was purchased 6 years ago * . Picture quality on all were grainy and poor . Not even the portrait pictures were acceptable . SAVE YOUR MONEY ! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS CAMERA !
 Pros : Easy to connect to PCCons : Terrible grain even at 4.0 MP Fine settingPoor colour saturationAuto white balance cant adapt to flourescent lightingFocus does not work well indoorsVery weak flashLengthy delay to achieve focus and between shotsHigh battery drain -LRB- even Ni-MH -RRB- Conclusion : An inexpensive 4.0 MP digital camera , but one that underperforms in every aspect . I have since returned mine and opted to spend an extra $ 75 to get an Olympus or Minolta instead . Other buyers would be wise to do the same .
 This is not a good quality product . Do not expect even fair pictures . After I bought it , pictures was not coming good . I thought `` it ca n't be camera , probably I am making some mistakes '' . I tried everything for one week . No progress at all . Finally I invited one of my friend who has 2 Mpixel Minolta Camera . We set the tripod . We took same pictures with two different cameras . You should see the differences . His pictures far better than mine . -LRB- If anyone want to see them I can send via E-mail and all other pictures I took . -RRB- Battery life is another story . It does not hold any battery even Ni-MH . Costumer service is not satisfactory . They deliberately does not discuss the quality . All they talk is `` policy '' . I wonder `` is there a policy about sending inferior product and labeling it 4 megapixel '' . Now , I have to pay restocking fee . Instead of getting an apology , it cost me money and lots of time .
 If you like purchasing batteries then this is the camera for you . You cant even download all your pics onto the computer before the batteries die . The camera does not even come with a wall plug in so you have to spend more $ $ . I have had this camera since Christmas and I dont like using it because of the battery issues . Save your $ $ on this product . The pics dont even look good the quality is worse then my old 2 Mega pixel camera
 I purchased this product to replace a 1.2 MP Olympus camera . In every aspect it is an inferior product . The 4 year old 1.2 MP camera has far superior image quality under all operating conditions . Battery life is a major issue and represents a serious design flaw . After following advice from Gateway to return the product for repair , I received a replacement which was no better . At this point , they refused to allow me to return the product stating that they do not accept returns for replaced units . They have no concept of customer service . I am now stuck with an inferior product that is essentially useless for its intended purpose .
 This camera is a piece of junk . I am kicking myself for buying it . Shoulda followed conventional wisdom and bought a Canon or Olympus instead.Problems : - Battery life
 I 'll keep it brief , as it disgusts me to think about this p.o.s. : - horrible battery life . will drain regular aa 's by taking four pictures , no joke . - corrupts memory card/deletes pictures at will . lost well over 300 pictures due to something ! - I do n't know what . - shuts off randomly . you will be in the middle of taking a picture with new batteries and the thing will just turn off . sometimes , if youre lucky , it 'll turn back on . - poor picture quality/manual controls . i know this is not a professional camera , but I 've seen better picture quality on cameras in the same price range.Finally , after I put up with all this , it decided to stop working all together . So , the moral of the story is , no matter how cheap this thing is , DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA !!!! For that matter , I would never buy any camera from Gateway.Instead , let me recommed the Canon Powershot 3.2 camera . It has much better battery life -LRB- i never changed them for three weeks while in Italy -RRB- and it takes better pictures , even with lower resoultion .
 Had this camera for just under a year , and encountered similar problems to other users.Now , I 'm no photogropher so while others comlained about its poor photo quality , with valid reason , that did n't bother me as badly since it was my first digital camera.However , the1 -RRB- loss of a 100 + photos ,2 -RRB- corruption of mem . cards ,3 -RRB- sudden loss of power with difficult reboots4 -RRB- horrible and gahstly battery life , and5 -RRB- the now total loss of power with no reboots , Makes this a just an awful buy and total waste of money . Even for a first time simple user like me . This camera should be max $ 50 . Bottom line , PLEASE-DO NOT BUY !!!
 I was so happy when I bought my first digital camera ! It was a huge expense for me when I got it -LRB- college student , part time worker -RRB- and I made a huge deal about getting the best camera for my buck . Sure , sometimes the picture quality is bad , but I can get that with any camera . The problem with this one ? The BATTERIES !!! Oh man , the batteries . How many types have I tried now ? Alkaline , NiMH , rechargeable and not , heavy duty camera batteries , etc. . It kills my rechargeables within 5 minutes of being on -LRB- taking pictures or not -RRB- . I often will take a couple pictures then turn it off for a minute , then turn it back on since that seems to actually stretch out the life for a little . The heavy duty ones I have in now lasted for about 10 minutes of `` on '' time . That , again , is turning on and off to stretch out the time it 's on . If you leave it on straight it will seriously kill the batteries within about 3 minutes.I seriously want to like this camera ! I really do ! But it 's just not worth the upkeep at all . I 've gone on several vacations now where I 'll bring tons of extra batteries along to keep switching out and the camera will just die on my anyway . I 've missed pictures of birthdays and family vacations and seriously , I just ca n't stand it anymore . She is a good camera , she really is , but I ca n't keep buying batteries that will die near instantly . I 'm sorry to say I have to give this camera a bad review . I 'm sure there are some of this type that come out without the battery sucking problem , and if you have one of those then congrats , you got lucky . As for me , it 's off to Kodak for an Easyshare , where the battery life seems to be about 8 million times longer .
 As with many others that have reviewed this camera it sucks batteries and does n't take great pictures . To get decent images from this camera you must have the resolution and compression set at the highest quality memory robbing setting -LRB- 41 images on a 64 MB card -RRB- . Mine zapped a set of 2000 mAh NI-MH before even filling my 64 MB card . I got this camera used and called Gateway about having work done on the camera due to a focus problem and I was informed that they do n't even work on out of warranty products . I ended up buying a Fuji FinePix 2650and it can take better pictures than the gateway , and the Fuji is only 2MP . In the Gateway 's defense , it does have a lot of manual controls , which mean nothing to me . I recommend that anyone looking at digital cameras go for a brand that is well known for cameras , such as Kodak , Olympus . Also keep in mind that you get what you pay for .
 I recieved this camera as a birthday gift last summer and it really has n't been very dependable . From the very first week it was losing my pictures and finding them again at random -LRB- I believe someone else mentioned this as well -RRB- . I brought it on a class trip only to have the camera die on me . I returned home to find that all the memory card was claiming it was empty , though there should have been well over 100 pictures on the card . Luckily my step dad was able to restore the card and the pictures on it , but the camera has consistently pulled stunts like that . And yes , with different memory cards , so it 's not that.Last month the camera suddenly shut off while I was trying to take a picture with it . It shut off with the zoom lens still out and even though I kept trying brand new batteries it refused to turn back on for more than a few seconds before shutting off promptly . I left it on the mainland when I went on vacation and when I got back it started up perfectly with the same batteries it had shut off with . Go figure.Besides those problems I 've found the photo quality to be terrible . My boyfriend has an Olympus 3.1 MP camera that takes far better quality photos than mine ever has even on the highest quality setting . It also seems to have issues focusing . I 'll get it in perfect focus and when I click to take the picture it refocuses before shooting . It could be I 'm doing something wrong in that respect , however everyone else who has used my camera complains of the same thing , and I 've never had that issue with other digi cams.In short , you 'd be better off with a different camera .
 ive gone through 2 digital cameras and im now onto my 3rd one . i first bought the sony cybershot when it first came out only to find out it takes really crappy pictures and had a major problem with it that the company couldnt fix . so after that camera , i bought the gateway digital camera . i was sooo exited to use it and planned on taking it to prom - i thought it would save on film and i would get to take lots of pictures . well , the camera was a HUGE let down . not only did the batteries keep dying -LRB- i even had rechargeable ones -RRB- but the pictures stunk . the saturation was horrible and most of the pictures came out an off color , not bright vivid colors at all . i was really dissapointed the piuctures were so crappy . rather than the camera saving me money from developing pictures and enabling me to remember my prom , it did the opposite . i went through 5 sets of batteries half way through prom so i dont even have the 2nd half of prom on film . i called the company but they did nothin about it . i continued to use the camera for minimal things , but i finally just couldnt handle looking at my friends digital camera pictures and then looking at mine and seeing a HUGE difference . i just bought the canon elph sd200 and let me say , it may be more money , but it is worth it . if u want to save yourself from throwing away money and just having to buy a new camera -LRB- spending more money than necessary -RRB- , and if u want to look back on ur pictures and enjoy them -LRB- not getting angry everytime u see the horrible quality -RRB- , invest ur money in a higher quality camera , not this gateway piece of junk .
 This camera drains batteries faster than you can replace them . I put new batteries in and take less than 10 pictures . Come back a week later and the camera does n't have enough battery life left to even look at my 10 shots . Ca n't afford to keep this camera .
 I do not have the extra money to spend on another digital camera , but after buying this Gateway peice of junk I have no choice . When I bought it , I got the camera from Best Buy so I could be sure I was getting a quality camera and would n't have to bother doing research , but I got burnt . Best Buy does n't even carry Gateway cameras anymore.Sure the battery life sucks , and it is of medium size , but the real problem is the picture quality . This thing takes horrible pictures , I CAN NOT believe it made it to the market . For a long time I thought I had a broken camera or perhaps there was a recall on the cameras , but no , the camera is just naturally horrible . Outside the camera does fine , but only 1 out of 10 indoor photos will turn out clear . The flash does n't help the situation at all.I tried everything to make this camera work . Everything.I will not purchase anything from Gateway again , and I do n't want to sell my camera online because I do n't want to shaft anyone else with this horrible little camera.In the end I am going to get myself a Cannon A75 or an ELPH . Both seem to be highly recommended.UPDATE
 Worst of allHave to have a dead man pulse to use this camera.With fully charged batteries -LRB- 2xAA -RRB- you can take about 10 pictures.When I returned it to gateway , they charged me 10 % of selling price -LRB- they should pay us to use their camera -RRB- .
 This camera does n't hold battery power at all . I placed new energizer batteries in and it displayed `` low battery '' after less than 10 pics were taken . This continued through multiple batteries of different brands . Turns out even the rechargeable batteries included in the accessory kit do n't match up to the power required to run the camera . No battery has enough power to run the camera for more than a couple mins . This problem makes the camera useless ! nice camera , too bad nobody can use it !
 I suppose the concept was good but the execution fell short . The leather is so hard I 'm unable to use any of the control buttons either side of the control bar in the middle . Might as well have put my Zen in an old shoe . Do n't recommend purchase .
 This case does n't work with the Creative Zen MP3 player . It is so tight it pushes down the buttons on the player so that they are all pressed down together . The leather is very thick which makes the player much thicker then you would want . I would stay away from Eforcity all together they do not allow returns and this product is junk .
 Careful ! The item itself is made well . When opening the box I like it immediately but once out of box I noticed the weight . Bit heavy & of course with the CD 's it 's heavier . Some people might not think so but with a neurological disorder , MS , weakness increases.I read their return policy & could n't believe it . ALL sales final UNLESS you get a `` code '' from the company giving permission to return an item . This is NOT anywhere on the description , if it was I would not have ordered it.I e-mailed the company twice & still have not received a reply , not even saying that they would not give a credit . Not very professional !
 It started out good , but now there are big blue blotches on the screen . I 've had this TV for almost three years and about a year and a half in , it started to get these blue blotches . I called Sony and they had someone call to see if it was one of their common problems , then said it was n't and that we would have to pay $ 100 just to have a guy come out and check to make sure and then pay for repairs on our own afterwards if it was n't a problem that they were already aware of . My in laws and sister also bought the same TV and they are both having the same problems ... If you buy this TV get the extended Warranty !
 My Sony Vega 60 inch operated for only ten months when the screen went black . It appears to be the lamp b/c the lamp light is blinking . Sony has said it is NOT going to honor the warranty , even though the tv operated for only ten months , b/c the warranty takes effect from the date of purchase , not the date of install . I called 3 days out of the warranty . So even though I can prove the tv was still in the box at the store , I have to pay myself this expense . No TV that costs this much should operate only ten months . SONY YOU SUCK .
 I 've had this Sony KF-60WE610 for about 5 years . The optical block failed after about 2 years and was replaced under warranty . But in early 2009 -LRB- just after Sony 's extended warranty -RRB- , the optical block failed again leaving blue pixel dots all over the screen along with a blue haze . No TV should fail after such a short period of time , and yet this problem has been experienced by thousands . I expected this TV to last for decades just like all my other TVs . And Sony refuses to back their product . I for one will NEVER purchase another SONY product .
 I 'm so disappointed in this TV !! We had a fantastic picture for 3 years , and then like so many others our optical block started to go . We got in touch with Sony and they agreed to pay for the part , we had to pay labor which worked out to be around 300 bucks . After that the picture was great again and now 3 years later , the block has started to go AGAIN !! We 've had this TV a total of 6 years and have replaced the bulb twice at 200 bucks a pop and the optical block once and twice if we chose to do it again . We certainly are not . I ca n't tell you how miserable it is to pay for HD TV and watch all your favorite football games in total blue.Here 's our lovely TV the first time it went out . -LSB- ... -RSB- And it looks about the same this time only it 's a square shape instead of a circle . I 'll never , ever buy a sony TV again .
 When the blue universe started to appear on my 60 '' Wega , I was out of warranty and was willing to pay for new parts . The optical block was quoted at $ 1000.00 and I promptly soiled my Jockies . They offered me a 55 '' flat screen for 750.00 and assured me it was new in the box . So I bought it and moved the 60 '' to a spare room because it still had a picture that was tolerable . The new 55 '' came and boy was I happy , that is at least for 30 days before it went black . After 3 different visits and new circuit panels and finally a totally new screen , I have a rebuilt TV.Moving on to a Blu-Ray DVD player
 I purchased this card to use with my Garmin GPSMAP 60CSx . But I was n't able to download maps and after calling Garmin , customer service told me they have had problems with the `` ultra '' card not working with my GPS unit . No problems with the regular SanDisk card , but she said not to use the `` ultra . ''
 Vendor was awesome , but card does n't work in my phone . i had to buy another one in at best buy for a replacement , since i could n't return to this vendor . it was too late .
 The functionality of this software is excellent . It is easy to use but also sound in its project management logic . It is possible to see your project represented as a PERT chart and as a Gantt chart , as well as seeing all key parameters
 WEBCam kept on freezing and needed to reboot often.It does no have a built in microphone , so one need to get a seperate mike .
 My item was delivered as promised , on time and undamaged . I experienced no issues at all with the ordering or shipping process.The unit itself burned out after a few months of use . I never cranked the radio or listened to it at an uncomfortable level . I smelled something burning and then the speaker stopped working . This was the 2nd LA360 I had . The first one burned up after 4 months .
 I tried using this with several hard drives and frequently had difficulty having the drive recognized by the host computer , plugging and unplugging USB and SATA connections while holding my breath was not my idea of fun . I also experienced read errors as suggested by a few other reviews . The same drives would spin up just fine without error directly connected to a SATA motherboard . I 'd suggest avoiding this adapter .
 Connected to an IDE HDD several times . It works . But the power supply gets really hot after a few minutes.Connected to a SATA laptop drive . The hard disk did n't mount at all . It made my drive inaccessible that I could no longer access it later when I re-installed on my laptop computer . It seems like it totally fried the SATA drive.I would n't recommend this product at all !
 I followed what little instructions Sabrent supplied exactly , and within one minute of plugging in the power cord I smelled smoke and voila - the first four years of my sons life in pictures were gone . Sabrent has no customer service to speak of , at least they are not speaking to me . Both their product and my hard drive are complete garbage !
 As a caveat -- I did not purchase this product through Amazon , but through Frys Electronics . This is a review for the product -- not for Amazon.The short story : Bought one of these to transfer files from an old Hitachi Travelstar 40 GB hard drive that had old family pictures stored on it . The laptop it had been in was long gone with a bad screen and faulty memory.Things seemed pretty simple . I plugged the drive into the USB converter , plugged the converter into a desktop PC and things seemingly began to work . The Travelstar whirred to life and Windows made it 's distinctive `` I have a new USB device plugged in me '' noise.That would be the end of the functionality . Windows never detected the drive . I unplugged the converter from the PC and the Travelstar , reseated the Travelstar into the converter , and plugged the converter back into the PC.POOF . Smoke from the hard drive . Burning silicon smell . No more family photos.For the heck of it , I tried plugging it into two expendable 3.5 '' IDE drives , as well as an expendable 2.5 '' Serial ATA , using the provided external power supply . Surprise - all power up but none were ever detected by the system.Diagnosis
 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO KNOW THAT IT does not work with windows 7 , but I tried it with my XP laptop and WOW , it worked just like it says ... I suppose that is ok ... I wish I could get it working with windows 7 .
 Sabrent USB-DSC5 Serial ATA or IDE 2.5 - / 3.5-Inch to USB 2.0 Cable Converter Adapter with Power SupplyFirst of all , I 'd like to mention that before purchasing this item , I took care to read many of the reviews here , and thus concluded that it would probably be a safe purchase as I did not see any mention of the adapter actually damaging hard drives ... I 've been helping people in IT for several years and came across this product recently . In the process of moving overseas I decided it would be useful to connect my Seagate Barracuda 500Gb internal hard drive to the laptop I 'm using until all our stuff is shipped over to our new house , as well as in the future when helping other people . Big mistake . I received the adapter and within a few seconds of plugging the power cable into the hard drive I smelt what any computer-enthusiast dreads to smell - the hard drive was smoking . I immediately ripped the power cable out but unfortunately it was too late . Goodbye 450Gb worth of data which I have accumulated over the last four years . Luckily I had some backed up , but there 's still a lot which I 'll never be able to replace.I tried replacing the control board with another identical one on the actual hard drive since that was the component which had burned , however , the drive still makes a unnatural reading sound and wo n't recognize on a PC . Seems like the mechanical arm is also broken.I sent the adapter in for a RMA and after confirming that it was indeed a defective product , they sent me back a new one -LRB- Needless to say , I 'm somewhat scared to even risk trying it out ... -RRB- Although none of the packaging or documentation that came with the adapter had any warnings or disclaimers to cover themselves , they still refused to cover the expense of data recovery on my fried hard drive -LRB- About $ 899-1299 -RRB- , however they have agreed to replace the fried hard drive with another new one.If you 're interested in purchasing this product , be sure you 're willing to risk frying your hard drive . There may not be a lot of bad reviews on this particular product here , but be warned that there are bad reviews on some of their other products for the same reason - their power supplies frying hard drives . Just be careful to look around and read reviews before choosing . I would rather recommend you consider an external casing for an internal hard drive which will basically do the same thing , but without the adapters to connect to other devices as well . That would probably be somewhat safer since you could purchase from a more reputable company .
 Perhaps I just got a bad device or cable , but the connection was flaky out of the box -LRB- I had to hold the cable * just so * to make it work -RRB- . Now it no longer works at all , even on known good drives .
 Unit was dead on arrival . I could see the drive about could not access , format , or initialize the drive . If it had worked I am sure it would have been fine .
 I just received the Sabrent USB-DSC5 , connected it to a brand new replacement hard drive and plugged it into the power outlet . I immediately noticed a very distinct smell , and suddenly smoke began coming out of the box connected to the plus . I immediately unplugged everything , and it was still smoking and very hot to the touch.This is a very dangerous product and , in my experience , should not be sold . Especially considering that people using it for its function - transferring data - may leave it unattended and cause a serious fire .
 It worked a grand total of three times , then the power supply went dead . I should have read the other reviews here instead of just looking at the average rating of 4.5 stars . Oh well , live and learn.Two stars instead of one , because it actually did work for a bit . Price is n't worth returning it , that 's the only plus . : /

 I 'm not sure if it 's fair to rate a defective product , but I 'm still sore over the time I wasted with the Sabrent.I bought this solely to duplicate a failing 320GB WD Scorpio Blue onto a new drive . The fact that it handles IDE -- I still have a couple around -- was gravy . The Sabrent would n't get a SATA connection with the Blue so I left the old drive in the laptop and hooked the new HD up instead . The copy process would work for a while , getting slower and slower , and then fail due to an error on the new drive . Came in several mornings hoping for the best and ... nada . Spoke to Sabrent tech support a couple of times , tried their suggestions , and then returned it at their request . At least Amazon makes that part easy.I ended up buying a Cavalry duplicator from Meritline for $ 45 . Not to make this a review of another product , but the Cavalry did its thing in less than two hours with one button press .
 did not work for me ... plugged it in and win xp said unknown device . i plugged it in to all available usb ports but still unknown usb device . : -LRB-
 I have purchased this product 3 months ago . I lay it aside because I did not need to use it for its functions . Well When I try to use the power adapter . it does not turn on . I tried several other plugs in my lab . How do I get in touch with teh vendor to replace the power adapter ?
 As with other reviewers I used this thing twice and on the third try the Power Supply Died !!!! Cheaply made Chinese Junk !!!!
 Worked as advertized - once . Got my 80 Gb drive copied . Six weeks later wanted to use the drive , but alas the power supply was dead . Does not seem to have any warrenty . No replay from Sabrent . What do you expect for $ 20.00 ?
 This product works partially.Things you should know.Depending on the type of HD you are trying to connect to your computer you may not need to use the power supply that comes with this device . ie a laptop HD , as many of them are low power you can use this to connect just fine . However , if you are trying to connect a full power HD using this device you may run into many problems .1 . the power supply with this pack is very very poorly made and does not supply consistent or correct power to the HD . Thus your device will not power up correctly and your computer will not recognize the drive .2 . There are other options that I had to purchase AFTER getting this which are much more reliable even if they are a little less portable -LRB- only a little -RRB- If you want something that provides the right power and has far more compatibility get a HD-USB dock . Many of them support both laptop and desktop HD 's and have much higher quality craftsmanship
 I tried using this adapter with two SATA hard drives and experienced errors on Windows XP SP2 -LRB- fully patched -RRB- . The first time I was copying about 120GB of data to a 160GB Samsung hard drive . About 20GB into the transfer Windows gave me a bunch of `` delayed write '' errors and said the written data may be corrupt.The second time I was using Western Digital 's diagnostic utility to zero-out a WD 500GB hard drive . This failed about 10 % into the operation with strange write errors that I attribute to this adapater.Fortunately I had another adapter , the `` Sabrent Serial ATA -LRB- SATA -RRB- to USB 2.0 Cable Converter , '' which is a very similar adapter except that it only supports SATA and not IDE . I repeated both operations with the SATA-only adapater and everything worked . I had no trouble coping all my data to the 160GB Samsung drive and I successfully zeroed my 500GB Western Digital drive . Since the only difference in configuration between the failed attempts and the successful ones was the adapter I used , I can only conclude that this particular adapter caused the failures the first time.So while I ca n't endorse this particular adapter , if all you need is SATA support , then I highly recommend the similar Sabrent Serial ATA -LRB- SATA -RRB- to USB 2.0 Cable Converter .
 I hooked this up to my SATA hard drive and everything worked fine - no complaints . However , when I plugged it in to my IDE drive , I immediately smelled smoke . I unplugged the drive and looked at the bottom - one of the chips was melted . It 's hard to believe a few bad reviews over 150 five star reviews , but I think it 's great that people bother to post their bad experiences so that others will know the risks . If you choose to buy this product , for your own sake , try it out first on an old drive that you do n't care about . It beats the alternative .
 This item was useless . The plastic plug for the hard drive was not manufactured properly . Some of the pin holes were still closed with the plastic from the manufacturing of the item . I carefully tried to open the pin holes with a needle , but the plug never worked . The pins of my hard drive would not go in and were bent which ruined the hard drive . Very cheaply made low quality .
 I will have to say it works quite well . However , the power supply died the first time I used it . Looking around at other reviews I have found that this is a common and frequently occurring problem . If you plan on using this as a stand-alone product , go elsewhere unless you have a spare power supply to donate to the cause . Other than that , the product works great . Just trash the power supply and get another one .
 Bought from Amazon 4 months ago . Found this week that almost every copying of files 3 GB corrupted 2-4 bytes in target files . First encountered this issue while using Acronis for files 90-50 GB . Checked also with fc f1 f2 / b. Tried to put the contacts far from electrical cables and SystemPages tweak . Did n't help.As soon as HDD was placed into enclosure -LRB- Acomdata Samba is pretty solid , bought it from Amazon 2 years ago -RRB- files copied OK.Can ' t be sure in quality of smaller copied files.This device seems unfit for files transfer .
 Ok , so since I 've switched entirely to Mac products after years or using and building PC 's , I decided to buy this kit so I would still have the ability to help friends ; not having a PC case that I could open , this seemed like a logical choice.I purchased it and this last weekend , a friend needed help with her computer . They have a workstation that was very infected with virus ' to the point of being unuseable . My plan was simple ; remove the SATA hard drive from the system , mounted it using this adapter via USB to my laptop , and passively scan the volumes.I removed the SATA hard drive , and connected the data cable and the external power supply . The hard drive immediate got hot and just a few moments later , white smoke poured out from the underside circuit board!The drive was connected properly and I definitely know what I 'm doing -LRB- years of desktop and server support experience . -RRB- The external power supply , using the provided SATA power cable , fried the hard drive.My friend is out a hard drive , will need to buy a new one , reinstall everything and I immediately tossed this kit in the trash as I 've had it to long to return . This experience was so bad that I am leary to use any kit like this .
 I really needed and looked forward to using this product . There is no CD as is mentioned in reviews . It 's easy to assemble and attach . It just does n't work and do what it says it will do . Motor activates but does not do anything . I used it with a Western Digital SATA 250GB WD2500JB -LRB- Caviar SE -RRB- internal drive . Inadequate and minimal `` instructions '' state to make sure drive is set to Master . Both drives are the same . I researched settings and found evidence that this apparatus will work in the normal configuration as my drives are configured - no jumper strips . It does nothing and just sits there.I read other reviews that are ecstatic about the product and several that say the motors on many are inadequate or defective . I am EXTREMELY dissatisfied with the Sabrent 5 in 1 and find their website lacking in any help , drivers and information.Good luck to all who hope this is a wonder . To me it is a complete and utter DUD .
 The converter needs better and more documentation . The converter does n't work with Windows 7 64bit OS . The converter did n't help me transfer files at all .
 + Nice fit and finish , accessory cables etc. - Did not work with any of my 3.5 inch ATA hard drivesPerhaps this was a single bad apple ? I returned it .
 I went cheap and it was cheap . It comes in several pieces that are easy to misplace , some parts are hard to connect to the drives . It overheats drives and in one case caused one drive to stop working . I sent it back and spent an extra $ 10 for a much better adapter .
 Returned as non-functional using WinXP . It would mount some drives but not hold a reliable connection . Other drives did n't mount at all.This replaced an identical appearing unit that worked perfectly , which I gave to a friend .
 Purchased this adapter so I could load information on a new SATA drive before installing in the laptop.NO instructions come with the adapter , but use SEEMS very straight forward ... plugs only go in one way.Literally , SMOKE came out of the drive when I plugged it in -LRB- and an awful smell of something burning -RRB- . Either the adapter is defective or I should have only used one of the cables ... no way to know , but I 'm pretty certain that the brand-new drive was good . Had to get a NEW drive , as this one was damaged by using the adapter.Not blaming anyone , just WARNING anyone trying this product to get DOCUMENTATION before using it ... NO useful information comes with the unit.Find out WHICH plug to use , where power goes -LRB- which pin , etc -RRB- ... Have n't heard of this kind of problem from others reading reviews , but I 'm certain I could n't have been the only one.Good luck !
 Used this as part of an upgrade process . Fried my drive , drive board sparked then smoked . Thankfully , I had a second backup of my data .
 I have high hope for this product but it has a very large flaw . If your IDE socket area is very close to your power plug area , this wo n't work for you . The IDE plug is too big . I can either plug in the IDE or the power , not both.I will have to find an IDE cable to see if I can extend this out a bit . Poor design .
 This unit would not spin up all of my drives . And , with an extension to make swaps easier , it balked at spinning up any of my SATA drives.Customer service was not only unhelpful but downright rude . If you need something like this go with the C2G unit .
 I got 2-3 uses out of it . Intention when I bought this was simply to use for wiping drives . It worked fine on the first couple of drives -LRB- SATA -RRB- . Now when I plug the USB cable in only the blue light appears . Depending on if I have an IDE or SATA drive attached , the white light for either of those blinks very briefly and the drive does not appear . I 've tried this on 4 different computers running Windows 7 , Windows XP and booting from a DOS CD . This is a really bad product .
 Sabrent USB-DSC5 Serial ATA or IDE 2.5 - / 3.5-Inch to USB 2.0 Cable Converter Adapter with Power Supply it did n't work , so i trashed it , i 'm done buying junk online .
 I have 2 old hard drives from two old , broken and discarded XP PCs . Both are IDE drives . I wanted to be able to retrieve pictures and documents from them so I needed some way to hook them up to my present PC . I ordered this kit because it appeared to do what I needed for a reasonable price ... bad move . I have worked with computers for over 10 years , even to the point of building them , and I was stumped.My biggest complaint is that there are no instructions that come with the kit other than one tiny piece of paper that says what needs drivers and what does n't . There is no instruction on how to hook it up or which piece is needed for what set up but eventually I figured that out -LRB- over an hour later -RRB- . The biggest problem is that once you hook it up and turn on the stuff and connect the USB it fails to recognize the drive for quite awhile . Once it does -LRB- and this is a big maybe -RRB- then it asks you what type of initializing you want ... no where does it tell you that if you select one you will wipe out all the data on the drive !!!! If you do n't select one and cancel out of that screen then maybe , and that is a big maybe , it might recognize the drive . It did on one of mine but never on the other.On the drive that was recognized it fails to let you explore the drive to find your files . I do n't know if it was because I was running Win7 on my PC and the old drive was from an XP machine but it just did n't show the presence of any of the data I know is on that disk ... it showed just basic things like the sample pictures , etc that do n't belong to any one user . It just would not show the stuff that belonged to me when I used that old PC and I was the only user !!! Probably permissions problems ??? This is where it would have helped a lot to have instructions . Calling the company does n't help since they barely speak English.For now I 'm keeping the kit since it would cost me too much to return it and hoping that maybe I 'll find someone knowledgeable enough in the future to be able to help me make it work right.MY FINAL RECOMENDATION IS TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS KIT UNLESS YOU HAVE A PHD IN COMPUTER SCIENCE !!!
 Mine had a short inside and made the entire attempt to mirror a nightmare . A Apricorn EasyGig II case and mirroring software was purchased and the process was a breeze .
 This adaptor said that it works with ALL 2.5 '' or 3.5 '' SATA or IDE hard drives so I felt pretty comfortable in purchasing it . Well , it does NOT work with my 2.5 '' SATA Fujuitsu drive . My drive is not bootable so I was hoping to be able to hook it up to my desktop and get some files off of it . I waited a week and a half for this adaptor to arrive and the cables wo n't even connect . Am I missing something ?? I know HOW it 's SUPPOSED to connect , but the Fujuitsu drive seems to have a plastic piece blocking part of the area the adaptor 's SATA connector is supposed to go . There is NO way to remove this piece from the hard drive . -LRB- sigh -RRB- Anyway , I gave this adaptor two stars . It MAY work for some , but this USB adaptor does NOT work with ALL the drives it claims it does . To top it off , Sabrent 's website is useless . I am quite disappointed .
 Worked great until the third hard drive.It broke all the power pins off of the drive and when i pulled them out of the power cable it took out the metal sheathing from the power adapter.Now I use it as a paper weight.CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP
 Worked once on a DVD drive , then never worked again . Just do yourself a favor and do n't buy something so cheap . Spend a few extra dollars to make sure you do n't fry your drives , or end up buying another - as I 'm doing .
 Step 1
 I bought this product after reviewing it on Amazon . I had high expectations from the customer reviews . It worked properly when I had tested it , however it stopped working the next day I was really ready to use it , it had stopped working . I definitely do n't recommend this product , try another product . This product is cheap and will eventually spoil !
 Total and complete junk . Tried 5 hard drives , 3 SATA and 2 IDE . All got `` Device Malfunctioned '' from windows and could not be read . This thing is a total PoC and is getting returned .
 I bought this because I am opening a computer service center . I thought it would be a vital tool , and it would if it had worked.I read the instructions and plugged it to a 250 GB hard drive that I would have liked to use again . But , alas , as black smoke rolled of the power connector like an scene from mission impossible , I had to decide whether to let the combustion process continue , or risk electrocution to disconnect it . Being the genius I am , I chose the later and was unharmed , unlike my poor data laden , smoldering hard drive.From now on I plan to read further into reviews and not just look at the cumulative stars . For if I had , I would see that many others have had the very same incendiary experience . I plan to seek legal counsel in the matter , just getting my money back is not going to cut it .
 Everything appeared to be in order until I opened the package to find the cable that goes from the USB adapter to the actual hard drive was missing . Not very useful as a paperweight . Do no buy from this seller .
 This product is totally useless . The first day i opened this up and plug it in it caused my harddrive to burst into flames . It worked for 8 secs then literally burst into flames destroying all my data . Worst product I 've ever bought from amazon .
 the price is right , but it juest doesnt work all the time . Same cabling on drive and different results . VERY sensitive about order in which cables are connected -LRB- usb , ide/sata , power to drive -RRB- . I am in the business and this was still a PITA to test some drives on . Known good drives wouldnt attach at all . Would recommend for a cheap stationary solution . its not going to be reliable like a Mybook if you are swapping out different disks unfortunately . power cable adapters needed lots of maneuvering to get into connector . I would love to pay double and actually get one of these things that works reliably
 Lost the 120gb hard drive IDE 3.5 '' i wanted to copy . One of the components on the board turned white hot and melted.Pretty sad . Not sure what I did wrong . I connected USB first and then plugged it into the HDD . Probably stupid , but not `` fry my hard drive full of stuff I wanted '' stupid .
 I was exited when I got this product . However I was disappointed when the power adaptor did not work . I had to return it for a replacement . The replacement worked fine and got the job done . I was just annoyed that I had to wait until got the replacement to transfer my data from my old drive .
 If you want your SATA drive Fried than this is your Tool . I have been in the computer business for 27 years so its not like i do not know what i am doing . as soon as i plugged the power adapter in to my sata drive and plugged it up there was nothing but smoke pouring out of the drive . and yes you guessed it , the drives is toast now and will not work at all.The IDE connection works fine . have not checked the Laptop connection and will not since i will be returning it today . i do n't want anything sitting around that will fry devices .
 I got this product because I purchased 2 new SATA hard drives and wanted to connect it to my computer via the USB because my computer uses IDE . There are a total of 3 cords . One plugs into the hard drive and outlet to give the hard drive power . The other 2 cords are what connects the hard drive to the computer . One cord goes from the USB of the computer to the end of the cord ... there is a little `` switch '' which is where you can either connect the `` switch '' directly to an IDE drive , or you can use the 3rd cord , the SATA cord ... plug one end into the SATA part of the `` switch '' and the other end into the hard drive.The IDE part of the `` switch '' worked okay . The only problem was you could hear the hard drive turn faster then slower , faster then slower . It was not consistent and I would not rely on it to move important files . I did hook up the IDE hard drive to the power supply from the actual computer -LRB- I unplugged a CD-ROM and used that power -RRB- and used the USB part of this product . That worked . So it appeared that there was not enough power coming from the power adapter included . This does me no good , because for portability 's sake , I do n't want to have to open up the computer to get the computer power cord.When I plugged in the SATA part of it , I had problems . The power cord was fine -LRB- other than the aforementioned problem -RRB- When I plugged in the cord to the USB , my computer recognized it as a USB interface . Even if I plugged in the SATA cord into the `` switch '' , it still recognized the device as being there . However , as soon as I plugged in the SATA cord into the hard drive , the device would disappear from my computer . I tried multiple SATA cords , other power supplies and nothing seemed to work . I have seen similar products work , and I may have gotten a bad one , but I just opted to get a SATA connection to plug into my mother board and use the power cords from inside the computer .
 I expected it to work on IDE and SATA , however it only works on mySATA CDROM . I tried on my old IDE drives , it all not working.I tried different jumper setting on the drive , still not working .
 I bought this 3 in 1 cable yesterday and hooked it up to a SATA drive I was trying to remove data from and the adapter fried my drive instantly . This is a very dangerous product and i do n't recommend it to anyone .
 Set it up as per . instructions and comments in these reviews . Powered it up and poof - smoke and a fried chip on the drive . I 've been messing with computers for nearly 20 years and never managed to really fry something like this . Not a solution I can recommend .
 I just received it , and the power supply is DOA . It does n't spin up any drive . I still need to check it with a multimeter , but I do n't think it 's sending power out of its transformer brick.I 'd be willing to bet it 'll work fine as long as you 're powering the drive from the power supply connectors of a computer , but I have n't tested that yet.I 'm very disappointed in this product . I 'm also pretty perturbed that apparently enough of the power supplies have worked out of the box that it 's achieved a good average rating , obscuring the many , many 1-star reviews with similar power supply complaints that I found only after purchasing it .
 The adapter arrived in a seemingly used package with wear and tear different from normal shipping abuse . I was willing to ignore that as I 'm used to small electronics shipped in various conditions but I really should have inspected the adapter and power supply more closely . I learned the hard way after the first connection to a HD removed from another rig.The burning smell that is the nightmare of everyone who has ever worked with electronics suddenly hit me . Ugh . I checked the power supply connection and sure enough one of the gold receptacles in the molex was missing . Dead drive and lost data.The overall construction also seemed shoddy and weak at key connection points.Unacceptable .
 This device destroyed my hard drive . The failure seems to be with a faulty power adapter . Ensure that you backup your data before plugging your drive into this device , otherwise look for another adapter . This one is too risky -LRB- others have had the same problem -RRB- .
 Bought two , returning both . First attempt caused smoke from my client 's hard drive . Dug out another drive to test with and it smoked too . BEWARE !
 Had a lot of great reviews , so I went ahead and bought it . As soon as i connected it i saw smoke like a previous person did as well . Drive is now dead . I 'm not totally sure if i want to go through the hassle of getting a new one or not . I am glad i have quite a bit on backup , but unfortuneatly not everything.If you are going to use it , make sure everything of any importance to you is backed up on cd/flash drive .
 I 'm giving this item the lowest possible rating , not only because it did n't work , but primarily because Sabrent ignored my request for support.I have several old internal hard drives from inoperative Windows computers . This Sabrent device sounded promising for being able to access the HDD data and to reformat the drives.I tried connecting the old HDDs , one at a time , to my Windows XP Pro desktop , carefully following the instructions , especially regarding the Master/Slave issue . However , even though the desktop knew that a HDD storage device had been connected via USB , the drives could not be found or read . The drives do not show up in `` My Computer , '' Windows Explorer , or Device Manager . This is true regardless of whether the HDD jumper is set for Master or Slave , or even if the jumper is removed altogether.I tried the same procedure on three different Windows XP machines with three different drives , and I got the same results each time.Naturally this was rather frustrating , but I realize this sort of thing is not an exact science . So , I contacted Sabrent via the Sabrent web site to get their advice for how to fix the situation , but I was ignored.I 've read a lot of other positive reviews for this USB adapter hardware , but given my experience with the device and with Sabrent , I have to post a thumbs-down review .
 Low rating because of poor documentation and incompatibility issues . First , I tried desperately to get this device to work with two Western Digital -LRB- WD -RRB- hard drives , to no avail . I later found out -LRB- NOT on the Sabrent website , NOT in the product instructions , but in a customer review online -RRB- , that for WD drives , you need to set the jumper to CS -LRB- cable select -RRB- . It worked great once I figured this out . Secondly , I tried unsuccessfully to get it just to connect to two different DVD drives -LRB- a Samsung and a Lite-On -RRB- . The bottom line is there is a design flaw
 I only tried it with my 120G Seagate IDE drive , and it made the drive fail and my data were lost . The reason could be that the drive was not on master setting on the first try . I have n't try with other drives , so not sure if it really works or not . Anyway it is a bad experience for me . Maybe I should buy other ones with higher price .
 I use one of these at work , different brand , on a regular basis . I wanted one for home use and order this one . Product worked as expected TWICE . The third time I plugged in the AC adapter it failed to light up that it was getting power . I swapped out the 3 prong AC cord and tried other wall sockets . Absolutely pathetic quality on the AC adapter .
 This card reader is the slowest thing I have ever had ! It is not well made and it copies images as slow as m molasses . I would not recommend this card reader to ANYONE !!! If I could give it NO STARS , I would .
 Positively will not mount my Olympus 2 GB cards on any of my iMac OSX 10.4.11 machines . Useless ! Other readers will mount my larder xD cards , but this one is allergic.Will make a nice stabilizer wedge for a tipsy restaurant table . -- GG
 Using Windows XP Pro . Worked fine for about a year . Then it started to only transfer data at super super slow speeds . I 've tried it on 4 computers that all work fine with other USB devices and card readers , but it does the same thing , complains it was plugged into a USB 1.1 port . I have n't had a computer with USB 1.1 ports for 5 years.The front panel that swings down and becomes the support is poorly designed and ca n't even support the weight of the reader empty . It will push shut and hit your cards . Buy another model or brand because this one is a lemon .
 You may find the Lexar USB 2 Multicard Reader does not work with your computer . Or if it does work , it works erratically . Lexar is way behind the times on providing drivers for both Windows and Macintosh . In Mac OS X , the operating system -- supposedly -- should mount a disc without a driver for the card reader . In practice , this sometimes works , sometimes does n't . My suggestion
 I have to agree with the reviewer who noted driver problems . My reader worked intermittently on my old computer -LRB- sometimes defaulting to USB 1 - incredibly slow -RRB- and does n't work at all on my new one . Lexar maintains that no driver is required , and does n't provide one on its web site , but my experience is that plug-n-play on XP is flaky with this device.When it works , it 's great , except for the minor annoyance of the door tending to flip shut when disturbed .
 I 'm on my 2nd one of these and they both developed some sort of short in the cable . I have to wiggle the cable and turn it upside down and sideways for for it to be on . It 's just not a coincidence that this happened twice . BUY ANOTHER CARD READER ! Do n't bother with this one or else you 'll be buying another one in a few months .
 Reads all of the CF cards I have tried , but does not read SD cards . Even Lexar Extreme SD cards do n't show up . I figure it would at least work with their own cards . Wasted $ 15 , stick to Sandisk and Kingston
 Buyer beware . This reader does not work with large SD cards . I could not get it to work with a new 4 GB SD card . My 1 GB cards work fine , but anything over that will probably not work . I confirmed with with Lexar technical support as they have not tested this yet .
 I bought this reader about 6 months ago . Since that time it is hit or miss to get my computer to read the device . I have gone to Lexars website but they say it is true plug and play compatability ! Really on what computer ?! It is so frustrating to take photos or want to put things on a card for my palm and it does not work . I recomend buying another product and stay far away from this one !
 The SD slot stopped working last night - very frustrating . The compact flash card slot still works , though . I noticed a reviewer mentioned that it did n't work with their 4GB SD card . It did work with my Transcend 150x 4GB SD card .
 I an now on my second of these readers and this one , just like the one it replaced , now is not recognized by my Dell computer . Both worked fine for 6-12 months but then died .
 Tried to use FujiFilm 1GB xD cards , type M , does n't recognize them . Still trying to resolve situation with Lexar , they say that despite package claim of xD compatibility another reader model RW023 is needed .
 I purchased theLexar Media MULTI CARD READER -LRB- RW022-001 -RRB- about four years ago . In the past years , it has worked reasonably well . But with the advent of high capacity SD cards -LRB- 2GB and over -RRB- , this card reader is now obsolete . Worse yet , I learned the hard way that it may even corrupt newer SD cards.I benchmarked a Kingston 2GB Elite Pro SD Card using this card reader . After returning the card to myCanon S5 , the camera displayed `` Memory card error '' . It turns out the Lexar Media multi-card reader is only compatible with SD 1.0 specification , which is for capacity up to 1GB . But to read/write a 2GB SD , it has to be SD 1.1 compatible . When I put in a 2GB SD into a SD 1.0 card reader and performed a read/write benchmark , it corrupted the directory structure of the SD card . Therefore my camera can no longer recognize the card.Fortunately , I was able to use ` Photo Rec ' -LRB- a free open-source file recovery program -RRB- to recover most of my image files from this 2GB SD card . I then have to reformat the card from my computer in order to use it again.When I insert a SDHC card -LRB- with capacity 4GB or over -RRB- into this card reader , it can not even see the SDHC card . But at least in this case it will not corrupt the card.I have since purchased theTranscend M5 Multi Card Reader . Not only is the Transcend M5 compatible with all SD/SDHC cards , it even makes all my CF and SD cards perform about 50 % faster ! For example
 I purchased the Lexar card reader from another vender and received it today . I plugged it in and it worked fine except it can not read Xd type M and H cards ecen thought it explicitly states that it can read those cards on their package . I called Lexar technical support and they told me it does not support this type of media . When I questioned wny it said it does on the package , they said I should talk to the sales department . I called sales and they told me that it was basically my problem that it did not perform as stated . They told me that since I did not buy it from them it was not their problem . I told them that even the third party sellers depended on their description and providing accurate information . I also told them that even if the seller would refund the cost , the cost of shipping and restocking fees -RRB- if any _ were more then their product cost and that it still had information on the package that was false and misleading . I was told that they would chekc with the their technical people to verify the accuracy of what i said but did not say they would do anything about it . Buyer beware !!!
 stopped working with my iMac . Stick with Belkin or Lacie or Sandisk
 Before I bought this reader I considered 2 models 12-in-1
 Despite what Lexar 's website says , this reader does not work with my Olympus xD-Picture Card , type M. Very frustrating . Not recommended .
 The software for this card is the worst . I noticed in another review someone had good luck running it with a D-Link 614 + router , I could never get it to connect . Maybe it 's a Windows 98 issue but there is no conflict with card as far as 98 goes . Even the software that came with the card indicates it is working properly . I 've tried everything including changing TCP/IP settings directly and the card will not connect with the 614 + . Tech support is about a joke . After fighting with this card for hours I went and got a Microsoft USB and it ran 5 minutes out of the box .
 This product is advertised as being shipped within 24 hours.I am still hoping to receive it tomorrow , after placing the order two days ago , with an additional 19 USD for a 24 hours shipping ...
