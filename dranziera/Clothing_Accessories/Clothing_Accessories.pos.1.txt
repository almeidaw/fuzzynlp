 I get compliments every time I wear this . I took a chance , because I tend to be a bit plump . As other reviewers noted , the sleeves do run snug . But otherwise it 's a great jacket at a great price . The grommets are just so fun.It is fully lined . I just love this modern addition , and it 's not too `` young '' feeling , just right .
 Love the product - great workmanship , fun to wear , nice find on Amazon . Thanks for the great jacket , Brandon !
 I love the look of this jacket . It is a little smaller than marked .
 It 's really original , I got a lot of complements and it 's nicely made jacket . It goes excellent with the Brandon Thomas Women 's Yolkster Skirt .
 I got this jacket last week , I liked it for the price i paid .
 Very happy with the fit , feel , look of these pouch briefs.For those guys out there who like pouch briefs I recommend .
 I ca n't believe I 'm writing a review for underwear . Jeez . But , C-IN2 's standard `` Contour Pouch Brief '' are the most comfortable I 've ever worn . I am average height , 30 '' -31 '' waist -LRB- I purcahse medium-sized C-IN2s -RRB- , with a short torso and portortionally long legs . I generally purchase low-rise jeans and fairly fitted trousers . Standard-cut jeans and typical US-style cuts of trousers place the hip/belt & snap/button too high to be comfortable . -LRB- Think Martin Short 's Ed Grimley character on SCTV & Saturday Night Live . * grin * Well , not that bad , but it feels like it ... -RRB- Especially if your physique is similar to mine , these C-IN2s might be great for you , too , and worth the expense . Even though C-IN2 does not call them `` low-rise '' or `` no-show , '' they would be considered low-rise compared to discount or common retail brand briefs -LRB- FotL , Hanes , etc. -RRB- . I would never purchase C-IN2 's `` no show '' designs -- their cut would be far too extreme to be comfortable on me , I think . I have over the years puchased briefs by 2 -LRB- x -RRB- ist , Gap , Banana Republic , and a now-discontinued style of low-rise Hanes , and I strongly prefer C-IN2 's contour pouch briefs over the rest.Only their high price keeps me from giving them 5 stars .
 These briefs are a little expensive but worth the price . The fit is very comfortable and the material is not as soft as cashmere , but comes pretty close . The product is made in Thailand and is well made .
 These are the most comfortable pair of underwear I have ever purchased . They fit well all around and the material is extremely comfortable . I will definitely be buying more of these to replace what I have .
 This onsie ie SUPER CUTE ! My god daughter is having a baby & this will be the perfect gift for him when hes born
 I have bought at least eight of these bras since I first discovered it . It is very flattering and comfortable . Even though I have other bras , this is the one I wear the most , by far .
 It is the only minimizer that fits right . Definitely takes you down a size . I have worn this style for many years .
 This has been my favorite bra for about 8 years . It is comfortable and makes me look SO much better in my clothes . It truely minimizes . I have even used it as a sports bra because it is very supportive and has very little give .
 great item - fits well , soft and silky and light , even in humidity - has a tennis ball pocket on both sides !!! YEA !!! would buy from again

 Great product . Lots of my fishing friends that are full-time guides wear this product . It 's not too expensive , keeps your warm and can take a beating . The product seems to run a bit on the big size , but I would n't downsize to a smaller size .
 My husband bought one of these shirts last year to try it out . I was very skeptical of the `` no ironing '' claim . I could n't believe my eyes when I took it out of the dryer the first time -- not a wrinkle to be seen . The material is truly miraculous . We both love this product and plan to buy more . Thank you , Jos. Banks !
 I own three of these shirts and they are great . I get my shirts cleaned and pressed and here is an example of what great shirts they are
 I own two of these Traveler non-wrinkle shirts and they are absolutely the best shirts I have ever owned . They are of high quality material and the size I bought was right on the money . The colors offered are very versatile with just about anything a person would own and can be worn formally or casually . I am going to stick with buying more of these shirts .
 I bought 2 to begin with and now own seven and I ca n't see myself buying other dress shirts
 I received this shirt as a gift over Christmas . Since then I have bought two more . The fit is outstanding and I have never felt a finer material in a dress shirt - it is soft yet sturdy and always appears pressed . The iron free is for real . I hate ironing and will pay the extra 20 dollars per shirt to never have to dry clean or iron again . I will never buy another shirt and I almost want to throw away my non-iron free dress shirts . I highly recommend this shirt . You will enjoy it and probably buy more of them .
 These dress shirts are the best ! Wrinkle-Free , Breathable , Durable Material , Plus lots of styles , sizes and color options . Compare side-by-side to other dress shirts and you 'll see and feel the difference .
 This romantic negligee is part of the JLo collection . 100 % polyester , this negligee is soft and comfortable , with a flatteringly high waist and a dazzling sheerness that is erotic without being over the top . I love this nightie and highly recommend it . -LRB- Review of JLo Lingerie Wink Nightie Sleepwear -RRB-

 This is a very comfortable bra . You barely notice that you have it on . I also have Bravado bras which are not as comfortable and not as well structured as Fancee Free one . Great comfy home bra .
 I own the Austin Reed dartmouth blazer in every color in which they make it -- it is a staple of my business wardrobe . Well made , quality fabric , nicely tailored , classic lines , appropriate for a professional woman . -LRB- something that can be hard to find at times -RRB- It should be noted , however , that the periwinkle and raspberry colors are lovely , but the fabric and buttons are slightly different than the `` classic '' colors -LRB- lighter -RRB- and the linings and interfacings are not as substantial as the brown , navy , camel , red and ivory . It 's still a good value , particularly as these are colors appropriate to warmer seasons and climates , but I was a bit surprised .
 The key chain arived on July 10,2010 the shipment came 2 days before I was sopose to start watchig for it.It is in great shape . And well worth the wait . I will order from them again verry soon .
 The keychain is hand stitched and the quality is great and its big enough that you will not lose your key or keys again . Great Product . Buy it if your a Manson fan .

 I love this bag ! I purchased the gray/silver color which goes with everything I wear . I really like how the material the nylon-like because it is n't prone to getting dirty . The shoulder strap is very cushioned and does n't dig into or cut into your neck/shoulder . I love that it 's bigger than a normal purse but smaller than a backpack . If you hate carrying a backpack and your purse around or if you hate always taking stuff out of your purse to put in your backpack , like me ; this is the right bag for you.You do n't even have to be a student . I 'm also a mom , and on the weekends when I do n't feel like carrying a diaper bag , I just take out my notebook , slip in a few diapers and some wipes , some snacks , and stick his sippy cup in the mesh pocket on the side , and we are ready to go!Some things I wish were a little different about the bag are :1 . -RRB- The `` cell phone '' pocket is REALLY small . I do n't know why companies continue to make `` cell phone '' pockets so incredibly small when no cell phone made today will fit in those things .2 . -RRB- I wish the length of the bag was a little bit longer . I have a hard time fitting my standard size 3 subject notebook into the bag . It 's even more of a struggle getting into the bag when my wallet , pencil/pen pouch , and external hard drive are in there also .3 . -RRB- The front of the bag has a flap with little pockets , an ID slot , and the pen loops to keep your pens/pencils . I wish the pockets had a little more width to them so I can actually put small things in and take out with ease . The pen holder loops are n't even big enough to fit a normal pen ! You would have to use one of those ball point stick pens -LRB- which I 'm sure no one buys to use regularly -RRB- .4 . -RRB- It just seems to me like there should be more pockets on or in this bag ... which is my main disappointment with this bag - the lack of pockets ... 5 . -RRB- As much as I love the cushioned shoulder strap , it feels a little thick or bulky.All in all , I really like this bag and am going to continue to use it . Luckily , I only have one class this semester and I rarely need to take my notebook out of my bag . This bag is perfect for the light load carrier , but would be a nightmare for someone who likes to carry around a locker.Sorry about the short novel ! I know I like to read really informative reviews , so I try to do the same for the other people out there like me . = D
 The hat is very high quality BUT it took weeks to get it . There was no email notification of back order and when I emailed to find out when I could expect it , the response was a vague `` the item is on back order '' and no expected tme of arrival . Good thing I did n't need this for a gift . I would hesitate to order from the vendor again
 My child really liked his costume . One note however ... It does not come with any socks ... black shoes look the best -LRB- or flip flops -RRB- . Overall , it was a great costume .
 If you have worn Goddess bras your whole life , like me , and could n't find a replacement until now -- this is it . I even heard that the cutter from Goddess changed to this company.I have a very small band size -LRB- 32/34 -RRB- and huge breasts -- I could never find a bra that fit much less supported me while active . Some woman at a bra shop actually asked me , `` What do you like about the no-stretch straps ? '' Ummmm -- they do n't stretch ! This bra is for those of us who need to run around , jump , climb and not flop all over the place -- this is REAL support . Yes the style is pointy , yes the straps are wide and you 're not going to wear this with some skimpy top -LRB- not that those of us this size could ever find a skimpy top to fit us ! -RRB- This is a supportive bra with a size range to fit those of us who need it.THANK YOU ELILA JACQUARD!PS -- If you are going by your old Goddess size , you will need to go up in the band size and the cup size -- their sizing is different . I ordered one , sent it back and then got the correct size . Good luck to all busty ladies you out there !
 I 've had this bra for a year now and am looking to order a replacement . I was very pleased with how well it fit my chest and the support it offered ... especially after ordering online without having tried it on in a store . I agree with the poster that commented about the strap cushions not staying put and sliding around . At times the loose end of the strap will work its way out of the cup also and is annoying . My main complaint about this bra , however , is the metal clasp on the strap . It tends to dig into my right shoulder -LRB- which is my heavier side -RRB- and then the strap slips and falls off my shoulder at times . Maybe it digs in bc I have it adjusted too tightly for the weight it is supporting ?? Overall though , it really is a good bra . Also 37 years old , it seems very old-ladyish , but gives me the support I have n't found in other bras my size -LRB- 46H -RRB-
 This bra is very comfortable for a support bra . The straps are the type where you adjust them and they hang down into the bra . You ca n't tell this from the image , and considering I do n't like this type it was a huge turn off at first . Yet , unlike others these straps do n't slide out of the grasps after a while , so that is a plus . The cup size is exact , I did not have to send it back , and the no roll band actually does not roll ! The shoulder cushions slide all over the place though , and are annoying but when they are in place they feel great , no bra burn . Overall a really good support bra for us well endowed females .
 Great bra with excellent support . Material a little hard , but by far the best bra I have bought so far.Thanks
 beautiful shape , wonderfully comfortable . All in all , a perfect undergarment ! I love that they have a wider range of sizes , so you can find one that fits perfectly no matter your size . I will be buying more of these !
 This is the only bra I will buy or wear again . It is so well made and actually holds up my large chest . The straps do n't budge which is great . They have metal clasp in the front to adjust the length you prefer and then it snaps right into place and stays there . Thats not an easy task for some of us with large chests . I highly recommend this bra .
 Product was exactly as described , great service and received it super fast , w/in days of ordering ! Would definitely order again and reccommend it to anyone !
 The bra fits well , with the exception of the straps falling off my shoulders and hanging low if not lifted periodically while wearing .
 Wear it everyday . Makes me feel sexy . I love the feel and show it off under my white TEE Shirt when shopping
 My daughter is on a weight loss journey of enormous magnitude , and this has been the bra with her as the bust line gets smaller and smaller . The support lasts for months before needing a new one , and it looks great . Sometimes it is difficult for a large busted woman to get the right level of support needed to keep those gals pointing in the right direction . This has been a dream come true keeping the gals up high . The straps are comfortable and do not dig into the shoulder leaving those icky grooved , and there is plenty of support along the back . I have never been happier with what this one offers my daughter . Thank you so much for providing a wonderful bra !

 As a Simpons fan I found this t-shirt a cool way to express my choice for Simpsons in a subtle way . When I wear it I like to find that only those one who also loves Simpson 's show quickly identify the prefered and luring beer Homer digest , for those who do n't know or care for the Simpsons they see what I wear is only a red t-shirt with a commercial and clueless phrase.It is a good quality t-shirt , I have washed it several times and still hold its cheerful color .

 My 11 month granddaughter wears this in the heat and it has protected her well . Not the most stylish , though .
 I own several pairs of them now and they give you awesome support , they move with your body almost flawlessly , comfortable in jeans and workout pants . . Just a good pair of briefs .
 This line of underwear is super comfortable , and very sexy . The fit is great , but as other reviewers have noted , be sure to order one size up as the fit is snug . Recommended .
 This shirt is really nice ! In fact , it is so nice that a coworker stole mine and is wearing it to our luau . I , of course , am very upset about that , but wow , that shirt does look good on him .
 I bought the red version of the shirt , and the deep vibrant colors make this classic lei design stand out from other makes . The `` addition '' comes with a third color in the hibiscus flowers , making them more realistic in the red & blue versions -LRB- see my customer image closeup -RRB- . The fabric is lightweight 100 % cotton , which is perfect for hot or humid days . The medium size runs small . I 'm a 38 '' chest , but had to exchange for a large as the medium would not fit . The care tag says to wash cold and dry cool . If you dry it hot , it will shrink and wrinkle ; no surprise there.The seller exceeded my expectations with a fast delivery and no hassle with the return for the size exchange . I will buy from him again .
 Got this a while back and I love it . Fits well , very comfortable , and looks great . Quite a few people in my area wear Hawaiian shirts , and I get a lot of compliments about this one .
 I have ordered from Winnie Fashions before and will again . The items I order always arrive fast and seem to be of excellent quality . This shirt is greaat and I have recieved many compliments on it already . Thank you .
 The fabric is a little stiff and paper-like . No matter how many times I washed it it still does n't get any softer . It 's a really pretty shirt though so I did n't care . I used to wear it all of the time open with a tank top under it ; used to get compliments all the time , and not just the back-handed kind either .
 I bought this shirt , and it is exactly like the photo . Comfortable , and actually made in Hawaii . Yay .

 ok . . so warm . . so comforable and fits really well - i bought 2 at first and i just bought 4 more diffrent colors . you wont regret buying 1 of these : -RRB-
 This was my first online buying experience of clothing and I have to say I was not at all disappointed . I bought two of these pull overs for myself and my husband and we both love our fleece hoodies . They are perfect for going to the store , playing around the yard , just anything . They are so comfortable . I would definetly recommend one of these and we definetly plan on buying more in different colors .
 Very warm and I really like it.Only thing I dislike is that it is kinda short -LRB- not the arms , but the bottom part -RRB- Other than that , it 's awesome !
 I consider myself a hoody aficionado , and this one is instantly my favourite . This is not a bulky , heavy hoody you wear when it 's very cold , this one you throw on when the temperature starts dipping a little in the evening , or it 's a little windy , or you do n't want to turn the furnace on just yet . It 's a pure comfort hoody ; it breathes very well and stays dry , so you can comfortably wear it if you 're not quite sure whether it 's cool enough out for a hoody yet . You can wear it outside , then come inside and forget you have it on . It also fits really well , perfect sizing . I bought two , and might get another , since the dog put a bite hole in this one -LRB- my fault for leaving snausages in the pocket -RRB- .
 I would n't ever buy another brand of sweatshirt ever again after buying these Russell sweatshirts . They are warm , comfortable , and you ca n't beat the price . I would recommend them to anyone .
 Not sure how my home offices are always in the coldest room ... I wanted something warm which would fit over my already layered look and allow me to move . I love this hooded sweatshirt , it is warm and very comfortable .
 Russell Athletic hoodies are supreme in functionality . If you need something that can wear well , wear long and keep you dry , warm and not shrink with washing - this is the best sweatshirt ever !
 Russell Men 's medium pullover sweatshirt was a good buy for the money . Size was very accurate and priced just right considering the prices of sweatshirts for young men today . Purchased mine for my 15 year old son . He was very pleased .
 This is a good basic hoodie at a very good price . Not too heavy and can be worn inside when the air conditioning is too cold .
 Ordered this sweater for a set of sorority standards . Condition perfect , delivery quick , material strong .
 This sweatshirt was exactly what I wanted . It is well made , the color is bright , and it comes out of the drier looking great time after time . It was an excellent purchase .
 This is an awesome sweatshirt that keeps you dry and warm in the snow and cold . I bought two for my construction-working brother a couple of weeks ago , and he 's asked me for more already !
 The front pocket is HUGE . You could park a car in it . Great for holding keys , an iPod , or other essentials.The hood is big and warm . Plenty of drawstring on the hood too . You can pull the hood in tight on a really cold day or just let it hang loose on your back.I did n't get the whole `` dri-power '' thing until after I wore it for a full-day . Russell claims this new `` dri-power '' thing helps with `` moisture management '' -- meaning it helps you keep dry during workouts . After wearing one for a full day and sweating a lot , my t-shirt underneath the pullover was barely touched by sweat . -LRB- Other pullovers have drenched the t-shirt -RRB- This pullover is 50 % polyester and 50 % cotton . It is 100 % comfy . Highly recommend . In fact , I bought three myself . Get these . You will not be disappointed .
 I bought this sweatshirt last year and it is one of the most comfortable articles of clothing I own . I am a little ashamed to admit that I do n't use it when exercising , its so comfortable I use it to lounge around the house .
 My son loves these as they are really soft inside . He has many sweatshirts but will only wear these ! So , now we only buy these !
 i was surprise when i got the product . it is very good quality sweatshirt and i like the color .
 My husband and son both wear Russell Sweatshirts and they last wash after wash . Russell is a better brand of sweatshirt , thick , fits well and roomy . I have tried the cheaper sweatshirts and they do n't last as long or fit as well .
 I like this sweatshirt a lot , however the the shade of black that was shown here is different from the one I received . Err yeah . . good buy
 I bought a black one . Great hoodie ! Very comfortable and warm ! Fits great ! But I do n't like the fact that the hood is pointed . I look like an elf or something with the hood on . That was kind of a disappointment , hence the four stars .
 I was extremely pleased with the quality of this sweatshirt . It was sized right , did not shrink when washed , is thick and warm , and is well constructed.It definitely lives up to the Russell name .
 GREAT sweater . it fits perfectly and does n't seem like it 's been washed after you wash it .
 I wear this on somber occasion 's . Goes well with black suit and black shirt . The extra length is a plus .
 I have a very large neck -LRB- shirts that have to button at the neck must be either altered or custom made -RRB- , and it 's not easy to find a tie that will fit comfortably . Elite Solid 's extra-long tie did the job perfectly . The tie is beautifully made and very attractive . This is my tie place from now on !
 My husband bought one of these shirts last year to try it out . I was very skeptical of the `` no ironing '' claim . I could n't believe my eyes when I took it out of the dryer the first time -- not a wrinkle to be seen . The material is truly miraculous . We both love this product and plan to buy more . Thank you , Jos. Banks !
 I own three of these shirts and they are great . I get my shirts cleaned and pressed and here is an example of what great shirts they are
 I own two of these Traveler non-wrinkle shirts and they are absolutely the best shirts I have ever owned . They are of high quality material and the size I bought was right on the money . The colors offered are very versatile with just about anything a person would own and can be worn formally or casually . I am going to stick with buying more of these shirts .
 I bought 2 to begin with and now own seven and I ca n't see myself buying other dress shirts
 I received this shirt as a gift over Christmas . Since then I have bought two more . The fit is outstanding and I have never felt a finer material in a dress shirt - it is soft yet sturdy and always appears pressed . The iron free is for real . I hate ironing and will pay the extra 20 dollars per shirt to never have to dry clean or iron again . I will never buy another shirt and I almost want to throw away my non-iron free dress shirts . I highly recommend this shirt . You will enjoy it and probably buy more of them .
 These dress shirts are the best ! Wrinkle-Free , Breathable , Durable Material , Plus lots of styles , sizes and color options . Compare side-by-side to other dress shirts and you 'll see and feel the difference .
 I got this for my daughter and she loved it , she got tons of compliments on it.It is kind of thin fabric , but it sure has hold up to the test , we are pretty ruff with it , and it is like new .
 I like the bag b/c it resembled one that I had before . This one seems to be a lot smaller but I it serves the purpose as to why I had purchased it .
 I love my backpack ! I use it everyday because I carry a lot of stuff and it 's so easy to carry , so comfy ! It 's super resistant ! It 's the best backpack ever !
 I really enjoy that I found this bag here , since the heiny color Superbreak is discontinued I believe . The bag shipped quickly too . Standard free shipping and it arrived in about three days . They 're trustworthy .
 I bought this for my third grader and it 's the perfect size . The material is very lightweight , but seems to be strong enough . The padding in the back and on the shoulder straps is sufficient . My daughter loves the bright colors .
 the backpack came in perfect condition and arrived faster than anything I have ordered from amazon before . ******
 The bag looks baby blue on the internet but its really green but it looks nice still . My niece loves it .
 Great product . Shipping was fast and product is exactly what was advertised . Highly recommend
 It holds everything my daughter needs for school and looks classy and not `` loud '' . Quality looks very good , her other JanSport lasted for 3 years ! It is a good buy .
 I HAVE PURCHASED SEVERAL BACKPACKS FOR MY 14 YEAR OLD SON . TYPICALLY , WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME UNDER MY SON 'S DAILY USE , THEY FALL APART . THIS BACKPACK HAS NOT ONLY WITHSTOOD THE TEST OF MY SON 'S HEAVY SCHOOL BOOKS , TOSSING AROUND ON THE BLACKTOP , ETC. , BUT THE LITTLE COMPARTMENTS ARE GREAT TO EASILY ACCESS HIS PHONES AND GADGETS !! HIGHLY RECOMMEND !
 Jansport backpacks are always lightweight and durable . The one i got in middle school lasted me until mid high school and its still laying around . I bought this blue streak color for my brother and its spacious enough to carry four thick textbooks and his notebooks for all 6 subjects . The strap has good padding so it wont leave marks on your shoulders . It only has two zippers but its more than enough . The color is somewhat bright but can be used by both guys and girls . There was a tag that came with the backpack saying that it has a lifetime warranty . Not sure about the terms and conditions but i doubt ill be using it . Overall it is a good backpack and i would recommend it for school use . Its durable enough and wont rip easily . I used to put mine on the classroom floor and it never got scraped or ripped , just dusty .
 I bought this backpack because it was about $ 20 dollars cheaper than what they sell it for in stores . I am a junior in high school and I wanted to carry my books around in a backpack rather than a tote bag that I usually carry . I have to say that the straps are rather uncomfortable even with just a few books in it . My shoulders were sore while carrying it just within the distance of me walking home from my bus stop -LRB- 1 block -RRB- . I never had this problem with my oakley backpack ... but for the price I ca n't really complain . I pretty much traded comfortableness for the looks . I wanted a small backpack to carry around through the hallways in school too and my oakley was just too big for that purpose . All in all , this backpack is great for just carrying books . It 's a small , plain , original Jansport backpack . It fits multiple textbooks and notebooks , -LRB- but beware of putting strain on your shoulders with the more books you add -RRB- ... just do n't plan on using it for hiking . Overall , I give this backpack 5 stars because I could n't ask for more of the backpack for the price of $ 22 bucks . It gets the job done .
 I bought this backpack for my brother and from the moment that he took it to school all he can say is that he loves his backpack and that everyone at school wants it , both girls and boys are begging to buy it off of him . It 's not too big nor too small , and can easily carry what is needed for middle school and high school .
 The bag is small in size and thinner than most jansport bags but serves its purpose and seems sturdy for the price . I got it with free shipping so made the purchase worth it .
 This is a great backpack it has plenty of space for all my stuff .
 The bookbag was exactly what I was looking for . It was so easy to find on amazon , and inexpensive . It come quickly , and was in perfect condition .
 I ordered this backpack as a temporary solution . I thought it was cheap -LRB- $ 20 item , around $ 10 shipping -RRB- , but now I realize it is n't . Maybe I will start with the negative aspect of the product
 This backpack is very soft cloth . Not what you 'd think of a back pack as being , but I find it works a lot better . Its more like a sack . Because of the material its made of , it conforms easier to larger items , such as books and lunch boxes and purses . I 'll buy another just like it when school starts again , just so she 'll have a choice .
 hello , this bag is excelent you can chose from over like 40 colors instead of the usuall , black , navyblue -LRB- well the black is pretty cool it is the one i am buying -RRB- it can store alot verrrrrrrrry confortable even if you are hualing alot of wieght = D
 The pattern on the backpack is really cool . I bought this backpack because it does not have a plain jane color design , I wanted something different .
 My last JanSport lasted me about 5 years , and that was after I had found it used . I expect the same out of this one , and they 've improved a lot of the design as well . Plus the new exteriors are great .
 Speedy delivery and I loved the bag . Very practical and sturdy . Protects books even in the rain ! And is strong enough to carry all my stuff .
 it value its price.you know the fabric is not so thick as I imagined and the design of it is simple.It can hold my sony laptop which is enough for me.I recommand it to the school girls or boys.The bag can hold one laptop and three books or if you like you can put the pet dog in it .
 Service and products both nice , material is good quality and product reach on time ziplock use very good quality I 'm really like it
 i did give this 4 stars as i remember these being larger when i was in high school but maybe i got bigger . Quality stitching and craftsman ship i ordere one about 6months ago as a gift and it looked to have been cut with a box knife but i didnt notice till after it was to late to return as it stayed in box till i wrapped it to gift so inspect yours well other than that quick deleivery and good product
 so it only has one main pocket which can make it difficult for more tha one textbok along with notebooks and binders however is pretty hardy . Doesnt look axactly as the picture advertises though . the blue strips dont go directly across but its still really cute .
 This backpack was great and withstood heavy weights and use every day . In school , it held up all of my books -LRB- which was a lot -RRB- and it did n't hurt my back -LRB- I trek 2 miles everyday -RRB- . I chose to buy an orange backpack . It got nasty and black on the bottom pretty fast . I would suggest a darker shade . Overall , very good !! Zippers did NOT jam .
 My son is rough with his backpacks and this one is tough and still looks like new . The grey and black colors are really popular at his school so this one looks great as well .
 I RECEIVED MY BAG WITHIN A WEEK AND HALF AND I AM CURRENTLY WORKING IN AFGHAISTAN . IT IS N'T TOO BIG OR SMALL AND STURDY ENOUGH TO LAST OUT HERE . GOOD BAG FOR THE PRICE .
 Always lasts for years with my tough High School Teens!Last one lasted my son 3 years and that was part Middle school too!Worth the extra $ $ $ $ $ $ to save in the long run!Love this product .
 I liked my new backpack a lot . The colors are beautiful and the orginiser pocket is the best.Thanks a lot
 My daughter is not easy on her stuff this back is great strong and durable I highly recommend worth the extra $
 I ordered two of these for my kids for Christmas , they look way cuter in person than in the photo . I hope that Jansport still has the same great quality as they did when I was kids . So far so good .
 Ca n't go wrong with JanSport . Good backpack - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 I bought mine when I started to study again . I always wanted one , and it exactly what I was looking for . I love mine .
 My son loves his backpack ! His old bookbag was a JanSport bookbag that he had for years -LRB- about 6 to be exact -RRB- . They are durable , fashionable , washable , and last longer than other brands that I have purchased . Due to my son being in middle school , he needed a durable backpack that could take on the weight of multiple school textbooks . He can get all of his supplies in it too , so that 's why I rated the backpack like I did .
 i love it , im very happy , the backpack is for my daugther and she is very happy , i like very much the color
 The price is suitable . And it looks like pretty . It is big enough for me to carry my books in whole day .
 I am a college student and I bought this bag to be easier on my back for when I have to run around campus . It is the perfect size to hold all my notebooks and my iPad , and it is extremely comfortable . I love this brand .
 I 've been using this backpack since my 2nd semester of college and it has been holding up very well . I just wish it had more padding though .
 Someone else in my school even had this backpack I recommend for middle school . Its awesome . I got the purple/blue zebra one .
 I received my package within a short amount of days . Was very excited to get a new backpack . I love Jansport .
 I 've owned 3JanSport classic backpacksand have different usages for each one
 On time and perfect quality I am using the book bag at school as I type ! Filling in space to be able to submit this lol
 this is just what i was looking for . it is a backpack.no bells or whistles , just a backpack.no secret packets , no extra hooks , nets , holders , or containers . just a backpack . it is perfect !!!!!
 Only reason I gave this item 4 stars is I grew up when JanSport backpacks were made of THICK canvas material throughout and lasted for years in school for the same price as this one . Im not saying this product is not sturdy because it held a full sized laptop and charger , baby formula dispenser , ten diapers , portable baby wipe container , 10in tall baby snacks , 2 medium pouches of baby snacks , 3 burp rags , 1 medium sippy cup , two full 10 oz bottles , a change of clothes for 8 month old , large womens wallet , three prong manilla folder and a few more smaller items that were crammed into it and held up without rippng through airport security . But the material isnt the way they used to make them 10 years ago . It feels like canvas from the outside but has an almost smooth plastic interior . I was dissappointed when I revieved it because of the change in manufacturing . I was fully expecting it to rip half way through my flights but it held up and held everything that I had crammed into it .
 I like this backpack for the design AND durability . Very sturdy unlike the Nike & Adidas backpacks I 've had in the past . Keep in mind that this bag is very simple as far as compartments go , but that 's what I like about it . Lifetime warranty ai n't bad either .
 awesome color , as i saw on the photos !!! i got it super fast and was everything i expected , besides the prices was amazing!free shipping and fast shipping what else i can ask !! . super happy with my purchase ! = D
 This backpack is a classic ! I use it all the time when I travel . Its just big enough to hold anything I 'd need on a plane but not too big to get in the way or be too heavy once stuffed full . It has held up very well over 6 years and 10 countries . I 'm sure I 'll buy another one if this one ever gives up on me .
 This lives up to Jansports reputation . Excellent quality . Perfect size.Shipping was super fast . My son is still using it .
 This is your basic backpack , great for school , the beach , or a day trip anywhere . It is sturdy , lightweight , durable and can withstand teenage boys . I have used Jansport backpacks for over twenty year and they never disappoint .
 the color is great !! and the bag is well packed . very satisfied with this itemso lucky to buy such a good stuff with a good price
 Good backpack for a great price . Daughter is still using it with no complaints . Product looks like the picture in color and design .
 This bag is a nice , simple bag with few pockets . Not useful for carrying a laptop , but it is a reliable brand .
 My daughter wanted white so she could draw on it . It is a nice purchase and no problems with it.JanSport Classic SuperBreak Backpack
 it was worth a money . i would recomment anyone to buy this . good . It was very nice and comfortable and durable .
 This backpack is excellent . The color is even better than it is in the picture . It 's closer to a purplish magenta than a pure purple . The back and straps are more of a violet . It 's very cool looking . However , while well-made the canvas is a little lightweight . No problems yet though . God , it 's cool .
 Perfect condition , exactly how it looks in the picture . it is everything i imagined and more . spacious , yet small . pretty , yet simple . love it !
 It was a excellent purchase.It have lots of room inside.It is very resistant.I love the material print.I highly recoommend this backpack .
 I bought this to carry my folders , notebooks , and occasional texts for my freshman year in college . It looks fairly small on the outside but has enough room to hold four folders , four one-subject notebooks , a 32-oz water bottle , a two-inch thick binder , and two 500 page books . The small pocket in the front is good for pens/pencils and anything you do n't want to lose track of in the main compartment.I 've been using the bag every weekday for almost a month now and it is n't showing any signs of wear yet -LRB- which is more than I can say for other backpacks -RRB- . The colors are bright but not overly dramatic -LRB- Black Cabesa Blue Perry Plaid -RRB- . My only complaint is that the padded part of the straps feel like they 're a bit high . Maybe it should be a little longer ? Either way , it 's still a perfectly good backpack and not uncomfortable at all .
 Exactly what I was looking for !! The perfect present for someone who loves the color orange !! She loves it and was so happy !!
 Nice backpack for my elementary school child . Only two pockets which is much better than a lot of the backpacks out there . With too many pockets he was always losing things . It fits him well and hopefully will last a long time .
 Classic bag you ca n't go wrong with . This bag is black and grey -LRB- forge grey -RRB- . The straps are black and the part of the bag that sit 's on your back is also black -LRB- you do n't see the black part of the bag when its on your back -RRB- . The rest of the bag is a nice neutral grey . This is a great quality bag at a great price . Amazon sells this bag for at the very least , $ 10 cheaper than any other store . If your looking for a new bag that lasts ... this is the one . I 'm replacing my old jansport that lasted me approx . 10 + years . Great investment .
 We bought this for our daughter 's birthday and she uses it daily , it stands up to her packing it full and dragging it around . It is very durable .
 I 've had my JanSport backpack in black for about 6 years now . It 's gotten me through High School and now my first year of college . It has carried things from clothes to about 30lbs . of textbooks for school and it 's still in prestine condition . Buy these backpacks people ! They wo n't let you down ! = D
 My son is very happy with it . He was using a Swiss Army pack , prefers this one .
 I bought this Jansport backpack for my daughter after the one her grandmother got her for school broke . I always bought jansports in the past for my cousins and little sister and so on ... I love the fact of the life time warrenty ! If it ever breaks or rips it just gets sent back and either fixed or replaced ... what more could you ask for ! And the backpack is as described ! My daugther loves it and never wants another one ... well for now anyhow ... lol
 This backpack is everything a backpack should be ; simple , functional , and well-fitting . I would undoubtedly buy it again , although it seems as though it will be holding up for a long time to come .
 Excellent quality for a reasonably priced backpack ! If you want a simple backpack without the frills and on a low budget , this is your backpack . Backpacks can be expensive , and children from K-6 do n't need a complicated-many-pocket backpacks . It 's just enough for their things they need to store , and it is not huge or big on the child . It 's a well made !
 I WAS SO IMPRESSED WITH THIS BACKPACK . I ORDERED IT FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR SCHOOL AND AND SHE WAS HOPING THAT IT LOOKED AS GOOD IN PERSON AS IT DOES IN THE PICTURE AND IT DOES . SHE LOVES IT . THE COLORS ARE SO VIBRANT . PAID $ 29.99 ON AMAZON . SAW IT OTHER PLACES FOR $ 69.99 .
 works as advertized . the only drawback is its lack of pockets . its got just the one pocket with an inner pocket . not a big deal to me but for some it might be a problem . its simplicity is a strength and also a weakness i guess .
 I love this backpack ! It is just like the one I used to have in elementary school and I LOVE it ! It is the perfect size for my college load and it is the most durable material ever !
 This is a nice looking , sturdy back pack for most elementary school children . The only drawback is , it 's a bit small.I bought it for my middle school son . He loved it , but could not fit all of his books and school supplies in it . My fourth-grader , who is notorious for tearing up back-packs , uses it every day . It 's a perfect fit for him . It is holding up quite well !
 This was a beautiful back pack , just as described and seems well made . Are kid 's school bags ever sturdy enough . Sadly , no . This is the 3rd we have been through this year . We can only hope it lasts the rest of the school year . Can somebody come out with a super strong and lasting bag ? Mine from back in the old days lasted 2 years or more . It 's a thought .
 I ordered this backpack for my high-schooler . She loves it ! At first she was worried that the straps would be uncomfortable or not hold up since they are thinner and lightly padded vs. the big , thick , heavy padded ones on her past backpacks , but three days into school and she says they 're good and she likes that they do n't add extra weight . She loves the daisy pattern and reports that she 's the `` only one '' to have it ! Which means it 's `` totally cool '' ! Product shipped in a timely manner and came in perfect quality . I would buy again from this dealer .
 The Superbreak backpack has been my daily companion for the past 2.5 years . It 's been through 5 full-time-college semesters , always handling extremely heavy bookloads -LRB- think lots of hardcover science , math and english texts -RRB- very well . It 's a great fit for someone of small-medium stature -LRB- 5 ' 2 '' thin-to-average female -RRB- . I 've just ordered another one , only because I like my current Superbreak so much that I do n't want it to begin to fade or tear -- that 's right , it has n't even begun to fade , or wear , or tear , after 5 semesters of heavy daily use ! This is a freakin ' awesome backpack .
 I 'm 17 . I 've been looking for a backpack b/c my handbag was really starting to hurt my shoulder . This backpack is great !!!!!!! I take it everywhere . It 's light and the straps are comfy . It 's always on the ground in school and never gets torn . There is alot of space too . I carry a typical 3 in . binder , two folders , 4 journals , 2 english books , a pencil case , 4 oz water bottles , and my handbag ! Its very cool . I recently took it on a trip when I was traveling and it fit all my clothes and other necessities . I 'm glad I got this backpack . It also arrived 2 days later . BOOST !!!
 I thought that this bag was very useful and had a very nice appearance . I think it is value for the money and I recommend it .
 Because of the price , it is good enough . But it seems not be able to carry heavy stuff , the skin is so thin .
 i hadnt used a backpack since middle school , but my large shoulder purse/bag was hurting my shoulder so i finally convinced myself to get a backpack . jansport is awesome , it got here in time and my 15.6 laptop fits in it , their warranty is a major reason why i also decided to go with them . plus its a great color
 Not really much to say about a backpack other than it holds items in it . 2 zippers for the big pocket and 1 zipper for the little one . Very roomy and never had it open up accidentally .
 Just what my daughter wanted ! She loves the classic look of JanSport . I love the durability . They last a long time .
 I have used it for more than 1 month and i am so satisfied with it . the color is beautiful
 I liked it . It 's just it 's not as good as the old jansport bags . The skin of the bag is not as thick as the old ones . But over all its nice and will recommend to other people
 I bought this bookbag for my son for school . He loves the color and so far it 's holding up well .
 seems to be holding up really well - had it for about 3 months . The colors are great and it 's unique .
 This is a durable backpack not too small and not too large . It does appear to hold my 15 inch macbook pro laptop in it with a few books but it seems like the bottom fabric is under stress when I do so therefore I am using it just for the books which it does just fine .
 I love it , so good comfortable affordable price and nice shape for me for any of college student . I am suggesting you to buy . .
 I was looking for a backpack for a three week vacation to Cambodia , Vietnam , and Thailand.It may not be the right bag for travel but it was cheap , simple , durable , and met my needs.I did n't want a big backpacking type bag with many pockets that would be too heavy to carry when full or at risk of having things stolen . This one had adequate storage for my electronics to keep my iPhone4S alive in all sorts of places , some clothing for the unexpected temperature changes , toiletry bag , bug spray , and sunscreen.I also had the ability add a flexible Master Lock to secure all three zipper tabs.Overall it came back home like brand new .
 Got this for my son 's first year in High School & it 's exactly what he wanted . It 's the standard Jansport . Heavy duty & durable , no frills .
 Purchased for my daughter , and she likes it . Roomy enough to carry her books . Quality seems pretty good , I hope it will last .
 I 'm in high school and this backpack , although it looks small , works just fine for me . I carry 2 1.5 inch binders , and 3 textbooks comfortably . It 's easy to access the pouch in the front and is the perfect size to fit in a locker if needed .
 Good size for school , cute pattern and adjustable stripes . Love it ! Must be really cool for school . Fair prices as well : D
 I got the BlueStreak back pack . It fits all my necessary college text books and notebooks . What more do you need ? Its durable and it also comes with a LIFE TIME warranty . It just takes like 3min to fill out on their website . So 5 stars for me .
 As my daughter said , she has plenty rooms for her books and she 's very happy with the style , the color . It 's worth to buy . She said she loves it so much and would use it for long time . Thanks
 Purchased two of these for my high school age daughter . So far so good , it seems to be made well and the color is great .
 Thanks for the great service . The shipment was done very quickly and the bag arrived even sooner than expected!I was impressed . .
 I bought this backpack for my daughter in high school and it fits it 's purpose . It 's a really nice purple color , sturdy , and fits all her books . She loves it , and the best thing was it was priced reasonable . Great product , fast shipping and I plan to order again next year !
 With 5 sons attending school , backpacks are a large financial investment each year . We have learned through trial and error that Jansport is one of the best investments that you can make in backpacks . The zippers last , and believe me we have had our share of wimpy zippers . The material is completely durable , washable and can withstand a lot of experiences . We love the SuperBreak backpack , for the great price and functionality . You ca n't go wrong with Jansport !
 Although I had offered her several other brands of backpacks similar in price , my daughter was insistent that we purchase a Jansport bag . I now see why ... This bag is just right for carrying several of her textbooks back and forth to school . The straps rest comofortably on her shoulders without being bulky . The fabric and the constructions appears to be well thought-through and well-made , ready to endure the abuse that my daughter will certainly wreck up her new backpack . She tells me that she expects this bag to last through the last two years of high school on into college . I believe , after actually seeing the pack in person , she may be right ! : -RRB-
 Yea this backpacks basically perfect . Its comfortable and portable its the perfect size and it holds alota stuff definitely a good school backpack .
 The product is simple and such a classic . Will never go out of style !! Durable and easy to use/clean . Highly recommend for college students . Jansport also provides a lifetime guarantee for their products . Got it fast from the seller !
 I bought this bag for my son . . He likes the fit as it is compact and not bulky . . Plus the colours are cool !!
 Jansport has always been a favorite of mine . In fact , I do n't think I have ever purchased any other brand backpack ! I could n't quite afford the suede bottom style this time , so I ordered this one , and it is just as good . Of course , I got it in my favorite color . The Electric Purple is even more vibrant in person . It 's a gorgeous color . This is the best deal that I found on the internet .
 This is like the 10th Jansport SUperbreak backpack I have bought and loved them all the time . . Sometimes the colors are not the same as perceived online but they are fine nonetheless ... I reccommend this product . . I am a fan of Jansport backpacks all day everyday . Super strong . Always look to buy it from seller Amazon first .
 This item was listed as being instock . I chose this item over others because I needed it within a week -LRB- according to the listing that was possible . After I paid for the item I received an email stating it was out of stock and would be delaied for one week . Beware is all I can say .
 I ordered this backpack for my son . The pack we received does n't look like the photo at all , not so many stars and the other graphic looks like polka dots ! But good construction otherwise .
 I like Jansports backpack because it is made very strong and light weight . Also Jansports has excellent lifetime warranty .
 I received the shippment in about three days . The backpack was in perfect condition and it has been very good and stirty.It is very clean and looks good . It might not look like it can fit many books but I 'm a college student and I 'm doing fine with this back pack I definitely recomend this item .
 The backpack came in perfect condition and it came pretty fast . Since it 's new , the first few weeks you need to be brake it in , cuz it 's hard .
 My old back pack was ripping at the seams . I 've only had it for a year , so when it started getting too bad I looked up backpacks here on Amazon . I found the JanSport backpack and bought it after a bit of research . I 'm very happy about my purchase . I love the front pocket . It holds A LOT of stuff . It does n't even look like it would hold so much , but you can just keep piling things in there . The backpack itself also holds a lot . I always saw other people at school with these backpacks and thought they did n't have much in them , because they still looked fairly empty . Now I know that that is just how the back pack is ! Glad I bought this backpack . Very sturdy and a lot more comfortable/compact than my old one .
 Im really glad I chose this bag among the others I saw . I really like it ! No complaints at all !
 You ca n't go wrong with JanSport . Do n't know why but their backpacks last a really long time while the other brands rip and break . My son loves anything camo and this one fit the bill . He loves it and it is very durable . Thrilled that I could get it mid-school year because his old backpack died . Plus it 's original , no one else at school has it ! Highly recommended .
 I bought this backpack for my son for Christmas and he loved it . I had been looking all over for a Jansport backpack that was n't so expensive and I found this one . It is now a couple months later and no complaints . Good deal !
 I bought this pack bag for my high school niece and she loves it ! The size is perfect for her school stuff and the color is pretty .
 Bookpack arrived as expected . My 7 y.o. boy loved the green and black fabric design . It appears durable and plenty large for his needs . Would recommend .
 I got this back pack and use it for school , it is quite nice and stylish . It is made up of very good materials and the stitching is very nice . But I have two complaints , the plastic part that controls the straps is very cheap and I bet it will break easy and the material is good but kind of thin not that good when it rains . But over all very good product I recommend you should buy it .
 I looked around for a backpack for quite a while and this was the cheapest one I could find . Despite it being the cheapest , Jansport will always be my favorite brand . The quality is excellent and it 's perfect for traveling or carrying books around .
 Bag is exactly as described . It 's the quintessential backpack - one large pocket for textbooks , notebooks , laptop , etc. . . and one smaller pocket to store pens and the like . I 'm convinced I 'll be pleased with the durability and functionality for time to come .
 I purchased for a great price . my daughter was looking for this color to match luggage she received .
 my daughter loves this clock . She 's 7 and wanted to start waking up by herself . It works !
 When I bought this , I saw that the picture was a medium turquoise , but I hoped that there was a lighter turquoise to choose . I ordered it anyway because of its cheap price . When I got the backpack , I was really happy because it was a light turquoise ! It looked great and it gave me confidence when I walked through the school hallways .
 I had this kind of bag back when I was 6 y/o , it 's very classic . Although there 's a noticeable change on how this product was made before and how it is made now , I mean , the way they made this product before looks more `` expensive '' , today it looks like it has cheaper materials , I 'm still glad with my purchase .
 Great product :-RRB- I 've been using it for months and it still looks and functions same as the first time I used it . Satisfaction guaranteed . : -RRB-
 I 'm in college so I still need a backpack . It 's the cutest bluish purple color in person . It 's more purple than what the image shows . It looks and feels strong too , so it should last me awhile . My siblings think its nice and it 's unisex looking .
 The backpack is simple and yet still girly . I 'm not normally one for purple but it looks really a nice color . It 's great for carrying books around . The main reason I got it was because I am starting to ride a motorcycle but now I love it and would not choose anything else even when I am not riding .
 what 's not to love ... Its a JanSport . Great colors to choose from , great size even for kids in high school and they last forever . LOVE , LOVE , LOVE THEM !!
 I 've ordered this Bag for my daughter . . she loves it and happy with it . this Bag is simply cute , and very useful .
 This bag is sturdy and a great buy !!!!!!!!!! I bought this for my 14 year old who has already gone thru 2 bags and it 's only the end of october.So far so good !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 Even better color than the display ~ I believe it would be a perfect bag for girls . Multiple usages.Love it !
 It 's nice and very classic . Exactly what I want ! And the shipping is fast too ~ I highly recommend it ! -LRB- It 's not as big as the other type though . -RRB- But it 's enough for school I think .
 Very comfy and extremely cute - I especially love the alien green color -LRB- easily identifiable in a crowd ! -RRB- . Ordered this two days ago and received it a day later - very pleased : -RRB-
 Back pack has all the space I need and nothing more to make it bulky . Great for me to be carrying around college , perfect size , tons of color options , and you can adjust the size to whatever you want . Cool backpack !
 I bought this backpack for my son I love it ! He loves it also . The quality is outstanding and it has a lifetime warranty . It 's water resistant .
 I Love this back pack !!! It 's perfect for college students . you can fit up to 3 text books and a folder .
 My daughter loves zebras and when she saw this of course we had to listen to the whining until it was bought . School has been in session now for 5 weeks and so far so good . Nothing has broken or ripped which usually does happen with backpacks . It is big enough to even carry her 3 inch binder with some of her other school books .
 My son loves this backpack . He is 9 and it is his first . I was concerned about the color but its very gender and age neutral and looks great . He will be able to use this for many years .
 The item is great . Purchased two , one for each of my boys . They loved it . I also received it when promised and the price was great . Loved the service . Thank you .
 My daughter has always been really hard on her backpacks for school , and so far this one is holding up to her usual abuse ! It has plenty of room for her notebooks , reading material and her lunchbox . The fabric repels liquids as well , so it still looks clean after weeks of use , dropping it in the dirt , etc. . I have hopes that it will last through an entire school year !
 The product was what I ordered and expected . It was of good quality not inferior . I was very satified as it was also delivered in a timely manner . The price was indeed affordable and I would recommend it to others .
 My high school daughter loves this backpack & selected it because her college siblings love theirs . Well-made , fair price & the right size .
 This backpack is very sturdy , and it 's the perfect size for carrying a couple classes ' worth of books . It 's also reasonably priced , which is a plus . There are only two main pockets , the body of the backpack and the front pocket , which is nice . Other backpacks usually seem to have two main pockets , which is not very helpful organizationally in the first place and sort of annoying after a while . This is also a good bag for hiking , as it 's comfortable to wear and it dries quickly . I got the navy color , and it 's very true to the picture , possibly more vibrant.Bottom line , I 'd buy it again , and I probably will .
 It 's a great book bag . Very roomy , and sturdy . The pattern is pretty
 The backpack looks very nice and the color pink bring out the details in it casual is , ore of my style and well be order more from you 'll in the future
 It was the exact replacement for the backpack I used for several years . Exactly as ordered .
 Product came in right on time , in brand new condition . Awesome brand named product for a cheap price ! Would recommend anyone who need a cheap brand name backpack !
 her favorite color is purple , so its perfect for her , she had told me to buy it for her at the mall , but me as always got on my android amazon app and checked the prices on amazon , and for sure found a better price .
 This eye-catching pattern is really with it ... with strong stitching and easy to clean finish I expect many years of good usage .
 When i got it , it was neatly in a box.Took it out no tears , no stains or spots.Brand new even came a day earlier . -LRB- :
 I had a JanSport follow me from my freshman year in high school to my sophomore year in college , that was over 10 years ago . Well , going back to school after a long hiatus and thought buying something else would be smart ... . WRONG !!! Should have remembered how much abuse my first JanSport went through and how long it lasted . Lesson learned , now I am a proud owner of another JanSport and could not be happier . If you 're looking for a simple pack for books and misc . junk your kids will haul throughout their years in school , look no further .
 I bought this for my teen daughter and she likes it alot . Very well made and perfect size , not too big , not too small .
 This is a Jansport so of course quality and durability are n't even a problem . This is the cutest Jansport bag I 've ever had -LRB- and I 've had QUITE a few -RRB- . What you see is exactly what you get . Cute purple and white argyle pattern , the back of the pack is a solid purple -LRB- maybe more of a plum color -RRB- . The zippers are silver metal with purple flaps connected for easy zipper use . Straps adjust very well so the pack can fit very snug or very loose depending on how you 'd like it . The small outside pocket has a built in open pocket inside for various items and also has two small slots made for pens or pencils . Overall great buy and of course the lifetime warranty is included with the Jansport bag . Great for college students . I used this same line of Jansport packs -LRB- in a different pattern -RRB- for the first 3 years of college with no problems .
 Great backpack ! My son goes through them like you would not believe . This time , I think he 'll have no choice but to make this one last !
 I thought it is a really nice backpack . Not to big and not to small . the only bad thing was that it got dirty after 4 days of using it because its so white ! but ofcourse you can wash it . also there are different colors too . Anyways , overall , it is a very good backpack and I still use it for everything !
 I 've one of these for 12 years ! For one of those years it was on my back every day on the back of a motorcycle . Incredibly sturdy , faded from the sun , but still going . Only now the zippers have gone out . You ca n't beat this bag .
 This backpack is really cute , and hides dirt really well ! It is big enough for what I needed for college classes . I wish it had at least another pocket , but it served its purpose really well !
 very good and efficient , is holding up very nice and no signs of wear after being used daily for one month
 Most amazing school backpack you could have!Its light weightIts comfortableLooks goodGood room not to big not to small.Good qualityCant go wrong with this !! * Ive had mine for a 2 years and still no tears or anything !
 I have had this reliable pack for years and for the cost I can honestly say this is the best backpack . Although the straps are n't the most comfortable under a heavy load and the zipper has failed on occasion , all in all this backpack has helped me through some tough times . I have carried loads in it of over 40lbs . -LRB- literally 40lb . weights -RRB- and the straps still show no signs of tearing . There 's easily enough room to hold plenty of books and and a laptop , but I would add cushioning . . It 's light , durable , and very economical , what more do you need ?
 I bought this backpack because its convenient , its cheap in price , durable , and its what everyone else is using ... overall its one of the best packpack out there , ive had it for a month and no problems so far
 This is my favorite backpack . It never fails me ... even though I do n't think a backpack can ...
 Gave this as a birthday present to a young friend , who reports that it is very pretty , and holds all her school things . Probably very similar to the JanSport backpacks of my younger days , but in more modern colors .
 Best prices anywhere around for these super trendy and stylish packs all the kids want today . I mean under $ 15.00 is what I paid right before Christmas for a super cute one for my daughter . Quality is as expected from this brand , which I always have viewed Jansport as durable and made for use and abuse without ripping or fraying etc. , not a cut rate discount item sold for cheaper because it is defective or flawed . 5 stars all the way around !!
 this backpack was well worth the price . it 's a bit thin , but it 's really light and comfortable even when you 're carrying around tons of books . the front pocket has lots of storage room and although this backpack looks small , it has lots of space . i 'd get this again if i needed . great backpack ! u wo n't go wrong buying this
 I 've always liked Jansport brand backpacks . They weigh absolutely nothing and this is kind to my back and the extra padding in the straps is nice , too . The material and stitching is always far superior to other brands.I love the new fabrics they are making these out of ! I got the Black Tattoo Love and simply adore it . I can feel the eyes on my backpack when I go out in public . It 's cool to have a unique backpack .
 I 've used Jansport backpacks for years and the quality is great . I wanted to find a rare color so I purchased it in Light Purple Passion and love it ! The color was slightly different as I thought the strap/padding part of it was black but it turned out to be a dark violet & the strings to the zipper were striped not solid . Even though it was n't the same as shown -LRB- not really a good thing -RRB- I ended up liking it better than the sample picture .
 I can not leave it at home since I bought it . It became my everyday friend . Not big , not small , just the best size and beautiful .
 Got this bag for my sister , who loved it ! Recommend these bags and this seller as well .
 My son selected this bag though I wanted him to take other model . He loved it sooo much . It is light one and very comfortable for his back . All his friends liked it .
 This is a great standard backpack , simple and sturdy . My kids do n't need iPod ports and tons of little pockets ; generally those go unused . Maybe when they 're all older ... I do like the huge variety of colors and fabrics . My daughter loves the pattern and how it is unique . I wish Jansport was cheaper , but then again when I do buy cheaper backpacks , the zippers break and the seams unravel . Recommended for all !
 The Original black Jansport backpack is a classic . I have an old one that still has not broken after at least seven years . My boyfriend liked mine so much that I got him one , too . It 's big enough to hold a good amount of stuff -LRB- especially books -RRB- and has a couple compartments inside the front pocket , but there are n't too many pockets .
 The backpack was very good , however , it was packed in a box that was wayyyy to big and i have to incurred additional charges since it was shipped out of the US to the Caribbean . I will really like it if you guys can send make your packages much smaller . ThanksRemo .
 La mejor mochila para un estudiante , muy c&oacute;moda y el precio vale la calidad que compras tengo otra desde hace mas de 10 anios y sinceramente eh abusado de ella y aun sigue aguantando .
 Very nice and fun to take to school I would definitely recommend it to my friends and family . You should buy more than one . Woot woot !!
 Basic back pack elegant color I really enjoy having this back pack to take my groceries and this was the purpose , so it 's perfect . The plus is that this gray color is pretty elegant and I can go other places before food shopping and it does n't affect my looks . I think the price is great as well , smart choice !
 Its very comfy to wear . I wore it for 2 + hours on the back of a motorcycle with presents inside and it was n't uncomfortable at all . It even rained and got dirty , but nothing inside got wet and the dirt just brushed off the backpack . Plus the color is perfect , exactly like in the photo ! Totally recommend !
 At first when I received this backpack I was a little taken aback with just how thin and light it was . I admit that I thought it would be shortlived . I bought this for my son in elementary school , and anyone who has young juds know they live to destroy things . I 've had to replace backpacks every year like clockwork , and around this time -LRB- about 5 months into the school year -RRB- I would start to notice tear , splitting seams and broken zippers . This backpack is pristine , not a single sign of wear . I 'm beginning to think I may get away without having to replace his backpack this year . As far as the unit is concerned , the colors are a lot more vibrant than the pictures indicate . Its a georgeous backpack with brilliant white , skyblue and black colors . It definitely stands out . Inside it 's very spacious in both the main compartment and smaller accessory compartment.Overall its a good unit and I would not hesitate to buy it again , in fact I think I 'm gon na get one for myself as well .
 Wow , i really love this one , it 's a perfect one.it 's so strong ; it can hold a lot of book . You should buy this : D
 I bought this for my kid sister at the beginning of the semester and she loved it because I also gave her a package of fabric markers . It let her personalize it without it looking tacky . It is now December and it is holding up great .
 Perfect for school or for travel . Best backpack I have ever bought . The corduroy stays clean and is perfect for a carry on .
 well i ordered this back in 2009 and man its so sturdy i still use it now i hasnt really shown a sign of and damage nothing falling apart and i throw my backpack around everywhere at home the floor at school its shoved in lockers blah blah blah i really do love this backpack it is really great and it isnt bootleg if its bootleg then the small pocket of the back packs zipper is on the leftso bootleg backpack = small pocket zipper opens from left nd in this picture it starts on the right and the jansport is blue and yupp not bootleg i guarentee you
 I bough this guy as a replacement for my old jansport backpack that died after about seven years -LRB- I tend to destroy things -RRB- . I use this for everyday use in college . I like the design , but most importantly I picked jansport because their products tend to last a long time . It 's a great backpack . I 'd recommend it especially if you like no-nonense backpacks like I do .
 honestly happy to have found this at lowest price then anywhere else , I purchased it for my son for school and he has no complaints .
 Jansport backpacks are well made and are always a fan of students . All of my 4 children have this backpack in varying colors and they all are happy with how they function and how they look .
 I regret not getting one of these for high school , I still would have trashed it eventually , but it would have lasted til I graduated . I 've been using it for college for years and it still looks like new . It 's in such good shape I could probably sell it once I get through my education . I love that water beads off the material , too . I never have to worry about my homework getting wet in the rain .
 I purchased this backpack last semester as my laptop bag simply was n't cutting it anymore . First off , I will say that this backpack is well made . The material is very tough and seems like it would take years of abuse to even begin to wear . As stated in the title , I found the blues to be of a deeper shade than depicted in the photo ; however , this turned out to be a good thing because I ended up liking the deeper colors better anyway . Just something to note if you are super set on the color shown . The main pouch of the backpack easily fit my usual compliment of overpriced textbooks -LRB- three 500 pagers -RRB- and two 2.5 &#34; binders . The front pouch provided ample room for a few packs of pencils and headphones , etc. . To sum it up , this is an awesome looking backpack at a killer price . I have received many compliments . The quality is great and the material is top notch . You wo n't be disappointed !
 Am very satisfied , I love this swag product ;-RRB- am from Algeria and I am very happy with this magic back pack thank you amazon
 this is a purchase of exactly what i thought i was buying ... sturdy , fashionable , color matches the look in person . . attractive print
 This item is exactly what I wanted and it works perfectly . I would buy it again . And it shipped very fast too .
 We have to source them from the US , but they are a great schoolbag . Light and strong . Great fabric.Highly recommended .
 Bought this about two yrs ago . I have to walk across campus all the time -LRB- and my campus is HUGE -RRB- . The shoulder straps are comfortable , It does n't rip easily , and it can carry a good amount of books , computer , etc. . Easy to wash , and is pretty sturdy . I love it.Cons
 My grandson is tough on backpacks . My granddaughter had asked for a new JanSport backpack for Christmas , and that request was handed off to her aunt . Auntie said she still had the JanSport she used in college , and still used it regularly ! I thought if it was that sturdy maybe it would be good for my grandson , too . And the variety of colors and prints and plaids is so great ! So I got him the Red Riff Bomber Plaid because it looked like a 13 year old boy 's sort of print - and he loves it . So far no rips and tears , the zippers are still stitched in place and still work - and he 's proud to be seen carrying it . Five stars are well earned !
 It looks nice its not to flashy so people wont feel to overwhelmed lol its perfect for college SWAG ! AWESOME
 I purchased this for my husband , and he loves that it is so simple . It fits lots of books/notebooks but it could use more pockets
 Its a simple Jansport bag . In the front pocket it has three slots for writing utensils and space for other small items such as lotion , hand sanitizers , calculator , etc. . The main portion of the bag is just one compartment . It can carry two of my 2.5 &#34; thick textbooks and my laptop comfortably . . . Good buy .
 It is an amazing backpack that is affordable for the quality . You 're getting a nice Jansport backpack that holds books and a laptop . The smaller pocket holds various pens and highlighters.If you are a college student looking for something to get you to class and back , this is a great backpack . I love the gray simply because it is something different yet sleek .
 This backpack was just what my daughter wanted . The only issue was that the Jansport label was placed directly on the face of the humming bird so we removed it .
 I bought this for my sister for Christmas , she actually specifically asked for this color in a jansport backpack.She loved it when she opened it on Christmas morning !!
 I always own jansport in high school now I am in college decided to buy this again and it seem pretty cool overall . Nothing wrong with it used it for few months and still holds up great
 My son loved it . Sturdy , yet lightweight backpack . Great color and good quality , just what you 'd expect from a Jansport product .
 muy buen producto los recomiendo , fue enviado en el tiempo ofrecido y muy bien empacado , el producto es bueno muchas gracias
 I love backpacks so much very useful when I 'm in school in like five textbooks and my binders.This is my favorite backpack .
 Very cute and good price too ! I do n't know why this design is so cheap while some other solid colors are like $ 50 !
 Im a college student and I have a lot of heavy books to carry around on campus and this backback is just right . Its not too heavy when I have 2-3 heavy books in it or just my work stuff . I say its a great backpack for an everyday college student but if you have to carry a big load this is not going to be for you . I like how its a simple backpack it had one big pocket for books and my laptop and a smaller pocket for my pens and other random items . I like this backpack a lot .
 Great backpack but when it came in the mail i guess it was squished and when i first put on the backpack it did n't look / feel right and it just needed some wearing before it got to feel / look right . Great backpack order one ... . I do n't know why they complain about the size its just fine but if you do need a bigger backpack they do have a bigger version of this backpack just bigger with 2 large zipper places and 2 small ones . But they do have a lot of room unless you 're crazy and carry around like 5 textbooks and 3 binders . Good size not to big or small just fine great backpack .
 The backpack is well fit , perfect size , and is a plus with only two pockets . Having multiple pockets is a hassle , you forget where you put things . Great backpack though , I recommend this to any student .
 Very Durable , but I warn you DO NOT GET THIS IF YOU ARE GOING TO GET IT DIRTY ! 1st week into school and I got a scratch on it , also you ca n't bleach it .
 I bought it to my son . He liked it very much . It 's a good quality product and seems durable . Reasonable price .
 this product was great , it was my first time purchasing from amazon and i must say it was exactly what i was looking for i did not want some cheap quality back pack . i got the real deal just what i was looking for i was very satisfied and i made my little sister very happy with her new orange back pack . the shipping was great did not wait very long received it quick and the price was great , i look forward to buying more products in the future .
 the backpack looks the same as the one online but just not as solid as I thought . But it 's worth the price .
 When I was in High School , I had a Red Jansport which I still use up to now . This is actually for my brother who had an Addidas backpack and wanted a sturdier one . I was browsing at a Sunday newspaper and saw that Sports Authority has a JanSport sale . I saw this exact color and design and it cost $ 29.99 plus tax . I checked in Amazon if they have the same style and they did ! I have a Prime Membership and it 's cheaper by $ 4 no tax . Now he 's been using it for a week and he never said anything bad about it . JanSport is a great bag especially for High School kids . They could hold very heavy books and last for 10 years .
 This backpack was soo worth the price . Although the material is quite thin , it makes it really light and comfortable even when you 're carrying around tons of things in it . the front pocket has lots of compartments and storage room and although this backpack looks small , it has LOTS of space . i 'd get this again if i needed . great backpack ! u wo n't go wrong buying this
 For as long as I can remember I have wanted a JANSPORT BACKPACK . In middle school everybody had them . They were great because they were lightweight , relatively inexpensive , and had just enough room for what one might need . However , growing up , who usually buys your school stuff , your parents , so that was that . Fortunately , I needed one for bicycling , -LRB- running around town or whatever , going to the mall , shopping , etc. -RRB- and finally decided to get one . The idea behind buying a YELLOW one was , -LRB- if you 've ever bicycled in traffic before , then you would understand . The brighter and more visual you are , the greater your chances of being seen.This backpack appears small , but looks are deceiving . It 's quite roomy , even for athletic gear , as I discovered by putting a pair of Reebok leather hi tops in the main compartment , two books , a lunch bag , and my wallet , and that was just in the main compartment ! I have n't tried the smaller front compartment , but I 'm sure this is just fine as well . The straps are comfortable , maybe not as comfortable as other packs , but for the price , you ca n't beat this one . I also love the fact too about the brighter colored packs , if you 're biking in traffic on a sunny day , believe me , after trying it out , the sun will catch the nylon in which JANSPORT backpacks are made out of , -LRB- at least the SuperBreak ones -RRB- . Overall , definitely worth the money . I would n't recommend to somebody who has to use it every single day carrying more than 25-30lbs of books . But , if you 're looking for something for college use , community college , night school , running errands , exploring , whatever along these lines , this I would recommend . I get looks when I have this on , -LRB- are people staring at the backpack because they 've never seen a yellow one before or are they just in awe over it ? I have no idea , as long as I 'm safe & comfortable with it on me -RRB- .
 This year , I am glad I decided to buy a backpack for my kid that looks great and wo n't fall apart on him . The cheapo , $ 15 Wal-mart bags do n't look nearly as nice , and never last us more than a few months . This size is perfect for a few folders , a couple books , and a lunchbox .
 i got this bag in september for school and it is very durable , good looking , and i do n't have an issue with the size of it . i love jansport backpacks and amazon made it easier for me to enjoy them !
 Jansport is still popular and `` trendy . '' Not because everyone has it , but because the quality of it . This is my third jansport backpack . They do n't rip easily for up to years , zipper is well made and durable . Comfort is always great , and the classic two zip pockets never get old . Amazons always good w receipts and shipping .
 MY DAUGHTER BOUGHT THIS BAG FOR SCHOOL . IT IS A GREAT COLOR AND VERY LARGE AND STURDY . SHE HAS A LOT OF HEAVY BOOKS AND IT IS HOLDING UP VERY WELL .
 My 7 year old LOVES this back pack , It is very sturdy and holds all her stuff and is not too big . Love the zebra print too !
 Bought this for my 11year old son just starting Middle School -- looks and is as stated on the description . Works fine for school back pack purposes !
 I especially love the color of this backpack , it is very cute , however since this backpack only has two pockets it does not have a lot of space for textbooks . Other than the space issue it is a very nice backpack .
 very satisfied with school bag and binder . . good quality and material . . everthing fits in the binder nice and neatly and without it being extremly oversized . love it
 delightful back pack just what i wanted . just a little thin on the fabric . colors very good hope it hold up for a long time
 I was looking for a backpack for my fiance to have for her classes . And this pack is great for her because its small and yet can hold all her books for class .
 I 've used these backpacks for years , and I 've only owned two so far . I like that it looks simple . It does n't have too many unnecessary pockets . I sling this over my right shoulder to keep from being pickpocketed during my commute . My current backpack has been used for maybe four years , and it 's still going strong . It has enough support padding on the straps , but could use some padding on the back for heavier things to carry . This is n't a big deal since I do n't like bringing a lot of stuff in my bag too often . Classic backpack . Would recommend .
 I love it . . the quality is great too . . small and nice looking . . perfect for high school students.fits about 2 textbooks . . perforated pockets in the smallest pocket -LRB- the one in front -RRB- . .
 JanSport is always a great product and very durable . This was bought for my son in college . I personally think it was too small for a college student . But since his classes were spread out , he only needed to carry 1-2 books at a time ; so it did n't matter anyway . Great product though !
 Try finding a decent packback in March . My daughter needed to replace her backpack during the school year and this is perfect . We tried all the local stores but they had no selection . So of course we looked to Amazon and bought this backpack . We are very pleased .
 This is just what I was looking for for my son . He 's rough with his stuff so I got him this and it 's working out well . It can handle being lugged around everyday without any issue . It has a `` cool '' design which he loves . Highly recommended .
 Bought 2 years ago and still it looks like new . I love this stylish design and from time to time I get compliments about how coll my backpack is .
 I was looking for a basic backpack for my daughter that is smaller than the one she uses for all of her school items for a trip to Europe . This pack fit the specs perfectly . It is a good size for walking around all day , is sturdy , and the front pouch gives her easy access to small items . The pack is made with both a sturdy zipper and strong material . It also is perfect for carry on . I was happy to see that basic backpacks are still available .
 Out of all the backpacks we have purchased throughout my son 's school career thus far this backpack is their favorite . It is light weight , made well and simple . My sons have said they do n't like all the pockets other backpacks have . . they can never find their stuff . This has one large zipper pocket for books , etc. and one smaller zipper pocket right in the front for pencils , etc. . Will purchase this again .
 My black JanSport Superbreak Classic Backpack rocks ! It is very well made and constructed . The material feels great and sturdy . It holds all of my heavy college books and then some!There is a pocket inside the smaller compartment that is great for holding my wallet when I don ' feel like having it in my pocket . The bag is not too big . Its simple and just right , not bulky.The top loop is great for hanging it on the hook that 's on the door of the restroom stall when you do n't want to place it on the floor.This thing looks great in black . I was afraid that the blue background of the JanSport logo -LRB- that is on the black bags -RRB- was going to be too bright , but thankfully it is darker than it is in the photo . It is a dark navy color.This bag comes with a lifetime warranty that I doubt I will ever need . I 'm sure that this is the last backpack I 'll ever need to get ! : -RRB-
 I 've been using this bag for my commute now for about 2.5 weeks . And I have to say , so far I 've been pleased with it , except for one afternoon when we got a torential downpour . The backpack is not waterproof , but I knew this before purchasing , so it 's more of an observation rather than a complaint . This bag does n't repel water much at all , and almost all of my stuff in my bag was socking wet after 15 minutes of waiting for my bus in the rain . However , during a mist or a light sprinkle , this bag is great.I 've been a fan of Jansport bags since I was little , and they have lasted me through middle school , high school , and college , and one bag had even lasted through 9 months traveling through Europe.I chose this bag because of it 's design . I wanted something simple and black , without a lot of doodads attatched to it . The front pocket is quite spacious and holds my -LRB- very fat -RRB- wallet , phone , iPod , keys , pressed power compact and a few other things . The main compartment holds my stuffed travel pillow -LRB- which does not compress down at all -RRB- an 6 '' x 8 '' x 3 '' hardcase lunchbox , my Kindle , makeup bag , folders and paper I carry back and forth , and when I 'm not carrying my Kindle , a book , and a water bottle . My only complaint really about this bag is the lack of an outer water bottle pocket . I always have a liquid on me -LRB- I ca n't tell you how many times that 's saved me on delayed trains -RRB- and I like it easily accessible . However , with this bag , I either have to hand carry it , or put it in my bag . This is a problem in the mornings as my bottle comes out of my fridge , and by the time I get to work , the condensation has made things in my bag damp . The lack of a water bottle pocket is the only reason this bag will not be making the cut for my back packing trip through Eastern Europe next spring . Instead , I 'll be taking my other Jansport bag that 's larger and a bit heavier , but has 2 outer water bottle pockets.Overall a great bag , as long as you do n't take it into the elements , and you do n't mind not having your water bottle immediately accessible .
 JanSport backpack is a perfect size and fit for textbooks ! It goes well with my laptop as well ! A great buy for the price !!!
 I use this pack every day , and while the main compartment is huge , the front compartment could use a couple of more pockets . Other than that , it is well-made , durable and quite functional . The appearance is utilitarian but it performs pretty much as promised .
 I purchased this backpack to carry my oil paints in to give my arms a rest . This light weight back pack is roomy - tough ; takes a load of weight off this adult woman and the dots are excellent . Lots of compliments . My niece covets the dots - she will have to get her own . I highly recommend this product !
 I bought this pack for hiking . I find all JanSport products to be of good quality . I do n't like lots of `` bells & whistles '' on a day pack and this one is pretty basic . It is a decent size to allow me to carry all my necessities and some extras but not so big to tempt me into over-packing . A larger pack would be preferable for a winter hike to carry bulkier items . This pack is fully functional and if it lives up to previous Jansport packs I 've owned , then it will be around for some years to com .
 All in all a very nice backpack . My daughter could n't get too excited about the backpack as it reminded her she was going back to school . Fast shipment and nice price .
 This Jan-sport backpack is Top notch , nice for carrying on the go items like books , electronics , etc.It does get dirty fast if placed on ground but poofs right off . Its adjustable to fit your comfort and a great buy !
 It 's very dependable . My kids love its looks and color . Size is just right for their books in middle school .
 As soon as I got this product I must admit I was a bit scared . The bag seemed so small and I was worried I would have to return it . But thankfully once I got some books and folders in there I realized it was the perfect size . Easily carried two large textbooks and a binder with room to spare . Though , it int without its flaws.One thing I do n't like about it is how plastic-ey it feels . Feels kind of cheap , but I think it will hold up nicely.It also collects dust fairly easily when laid on a floor . Its easily wiped away though.My last complaint is that the straps are very cheap and thin and need to be worked in.Other than that its a great bag . Suites my needs nicely .
 No problems with this product from Amazon . Great quality and extremely satisfied . I love it and reccomend it for anyone !
 It is a very nice sturdy backpack . The color is a pretty pink.We are very happy with our purchase .
 You ca n't go wrong with this backpack . The color is what hooked me because it 's my favorite color and the backpack is very durable .
 I bought this a few weeks ago . It 's great for school . Initially I could n't decide between Jamsport and eastpak . I 'm glad I chose this .
 I love it because it 's generic and sturdy . I use it daily and it fits my laptop and it 's sleeve perfectly . -LRB- 15.6 '' -RRB-
 The backpack is great . It has room for all my child 's book , plus other items . It 's sturdy and will last for years . Jansport is the only backpack my family uses .
 This backpack is perfect for pre-K . It is large enough to hold regular size papers without being too bulky . Color choices are great , and we found just what we wanted .
 this is a great backpack love it had it for 5 years lasted through middle and half of high school but then my brother dropped it in a lake .
 I have had this bag for a while now and I must say it looks exactly the same as when I bought it . This is a bag that was made to last . But anyways I would recommend this as more of a casual bag than a school bag . So overall a great product .
 My grandson chose this backpack -LRB- he 's 11 -RRB- and also the black and white graffiti so he can change up once in a while . He likes them very much and feels quite cool in school . Thanks Amazon for your great selections and fine products.Linda Phillips -LRB- better known as `` YaYa '' to my Grands -RRB- .
 Sturdy backpack , roomy for all necessary items for school . Color is nice and cleans up easily with soap and water .
 Great backpack ! Really fits nice on ma back ! Its a classic American bag with extra frills , I like that , and you will too .
 I had a friend that used to work for JanSport and she told me that it maybe a little pricey and may not be cars or monster High but is totally worth the money b/c they have a lifetime guarantee . Well with the previous back pack I ordered breaking the first day of school I decided to go for it . I found that they have more than just basic colors now and actually have really cool prints to choose from now . So when my daughters big girl back pack arrived she loved it and I have had not one problem with it yet and guess if I do I will send it back to have it repaired :--RRB- .
 I think the backpack is fine and it 's really cute . Just wish it had more pockets , it only has a big one and a small one . otherwise fine .
 My 5th grader has the need to carry more books then ever , Jansport is simple , durable & gives us exactly what we need . TOTALLY RECOMMEND !
 Great backpack , nice and sturdy but not too big for my 10 year old daughter . It has plenty of room for what she needs and seems like it will last !
 Great buy , my son loves this backpack . Jansport is always the best bags to buy , specially because of their warranty .
 I needed a backpack to hold up under a 3rd grade boy . Zippers , straps and handles are the trouble zones . This backpack is very well made . Everything fits , there are not 20 pockets to lose things in and it looks great . JanSport will be it for us from now on .
 Just what my daughter wanted for back to school . Not too bulky but room for her books and lunch and the quality you 'd expect from Jansport . Great find on Amazon and a great price .
 This was a present for my granddaughter and she loves it ! It was exactly what she wanted for a reasonable price .
 This backpack is simple , durable , and pretty awesome . The color vibrant and fantastic . Sturdy and the lifetime guarantee is fantastic .
 Was exactly what Grand son asked for . He does art work on white back pack . We received item very punctually .
 I 'd almost go so far as to call it flimsy - the material is quite thin.Aside from general impressions of not being particularly sturdy , the bag is pretty well constructed and my 7th grade daughter loves the way it looks -LRB- she got the blue streak tone deaf model -RRB- .
 The backpack is great . the size is a little small . There are know places to put your water . It fits everything yo put in it .
 The simplicity of this backpack is what makes it great . There are no extra pockets or straps . It is very comfortable and the material used to make this backpack seems quite durable .
 The Backpack arrived promptly and is exactly as advertised . Pretty pattern on it and nice and roomy . We will get lots of years of service from this backpack .
 Love jansport , always wanted a white bag and now i have it . I have no idea how i 'm going to keep it clean but the white look so crisp i 'll try my hardest . I heard scotchgaurd should help and if it 's like my other jansport bag its and easy as tossing it into the washing machine and hang drying it . LOVE THE BAG !
 I was weary of getting this bag after reading that the bags were of thinner quality , but I went ahead and purchased it . Although the bags being thinner was true , it has n't been a problem yet and I 've had the bag for over six months . The bag is still very durable , despite me having thrown my bag around on the floor . I 've been using JanSport since I was in elementary school , and it still serves my needs as a college student . Thus , I definitely still recommend it !
 purchased this bag for my daughter since she already had a janSport and she loves it .
 THe colour is great . It has a desgin in the interior pocket that is extremely cute !
 All my backpacks I 've had since 2nd grade have been a Jansport backpack . I 've never had any problems with any of my backpacks . When you first get the backpack the straps are a little stiff but they quickly form to your body . The backpacks are cute and durable . With all of the different kinds of backpacks it 's great .
 The shipping was on time & the quality of JanSport never seems to fail me ! I 'm finally ready for school .
 I bought this backpack for my daughter for kindergarten . I was concerned it might be too big for her because she is petite and only five . However , the adjustable straps make it fit her perfectly . I really like that the bag itself is very lightweight but can hold lots of stuff . She should be able to use it for many many years to come .
 Love the bag!It is everything I hoped for and as advertised . Received it promptly too !
 Nice quality bag . Good size for a teenage girl . Roomy enough to carry a few textbooks and the other essentials .
 ESta es la segunda mochila de estas que compro para mis hijos , son resistentes durables y comodas de llevar a mis hijos les encanta .
 I bought a Jansport bookbag for my 6 year old daughter . While the size was perfect for her , the material is a lot thinner than the canvas Jansport bookbag I have from 10 years ago that I used . But is does have a lifetime warrantee so we will see how it holds up .
 Good fashionable backpack at an affordable price.not much to it just a simple straight forward backpack , perfect for high school students and people who do not carry much and just want something that is pretty straight forward .
 Its Excelent it arrived earlyer then expected and the back pack is roomy if your a college student and need alot of room this bag is the one for you !!!!
 I got it in rosebuff pink ~ I really like the size and all . . Always satisfied with JanSport backpacks : D
 I used to own one of those `` I 'm - a-mountain-hiker '' bookbag and for quite a while , the bookbag actually weighted more than the notebooks that I carried inside . So I finally decided to invest in one of these . Let 's just say , I will never go back !! It 's simple in design , yet it 's everything you want in a bookbag . It 's spacious , EXTREMELY light , and it does n't have a tons of pockets for you to lose your pencils in ! I was actually impressed at the amount of stuffs that this thing carries . However , the straps are a bit uncomfortable ... I supposed I have to `` break '' them in ...
 When I first saw this bag it was love at first sight . I wanted to have a unique design for a jansport backpack and this is it ! Barely anyone has this design . I 've only passed by 2 people in 3 years that had this exact design . I always get complements on it . I love it . I 've used it for 3 years straight , and it has served me well . The wear and tear produced a hole in the bottom where the material meets the black backing . But that 's expected after such a long time . I 'm tempted to buy a new one just to keep this around . It 's too cool . Buy it if you 're looking for something edgy and unique ! :D There 's more than enough room for books and looks cool wearing it !
 The retail price for this backpack at your local Sports Authority runs for about $ 40 not including tax . I received the package today and I am impressed with the quality and price . Great buy if you want to save a couple of bucks . Would buy from seller again !
 This is the same backpack you would buy at the mall or anywhere you go to buy a JanSport backpack .
 I bought this backpack for my niece . We saw it at Penney 's , but it was much cheaper here . It is quite cute and very durable .
 I love the JanSport backpack ^ - ^ I probably have a diffrent design than anybody else in my school.It was definitely worth the money I payed for it .
 We purchased this backpack for our daughter going into kindergarten and are very pleased with it . The color and size are perfect for her . It is very roomy and holds everything she needs for school with plenty of room to spare . We purchased the larger Jansport Big Student Backpack for our fifth grader because he has so much more to carry . The zippers on the Jansport backpacks work really well and do n't get hung up like some of the cheaper backpacks we have had in the past . Hopefully this backpack will last for several years until she has to start carrying larger books and binders to and from school .
 this was on my daughters MUST HAVE list for back to school . she adorned it with PUFFY PAINT . shipped easily and school starts in a week .
 Exactly what i needed for school :-RRB- Very nice look , and the zippers are really durable . I 'm sure i wont have any problems with this backpack when the new semester of college starts .
 I bought this Book bag for my eleven year old son who wanted an all black bag . I was pleased in the look and the durability of this bag . My son seems to be happy with it so I am happy . Also I ordered it and four days later I had it . So shipping was very fast . I am very pleased with this Seller .
 This is a typical Jansport backpack , the basic kind , the navy color goes well with the logo . My daughter loves it and takes it everywhere -LRB- trips , sleepovers -RRB- .
 My 14 year old daughter loves this backpack . It shipped quickly , arrived fast and was a good price .
 The back pack is sturdy and compact but seems to hold a lot of books without being bulky .
 purchased before and will purchase again . the external pocket has divisions that are kind of useless , should have bigger slots for pens , only complaint , perfect size
 I like the color and the material can always stay in shape . But I think I need more small bags for my small things .
 Jansport backpacks has been trusted and known worldwide by their quality and cool design . This one is no exemption . It is light but strong enough to hold hardbound books . This make perfect for my kid .
 Thank you for getting this product to me in a timely manner and in the shape you said it would be in .
 I always buy Jansport backpacks . As a mother of 3 I have bought a lot of backpacks for my kids . The only ones that seem to make it through a whole school year and even longer is Jansport . I will always spend the extra money knowing I 'll only have to replace it half as much .
 The bookbag is a very pretty print ; and very versatile . Jansport has always been a favortie brand of mine and I 'm very lucky I got it for such a good price .
 I expected something a little cheezy but , in fact it was a great purchase . I was very satisfied with my purchase .
 This is a great quality product and holds up well with big loads . It is comfortable to wear as well . Recommend this seller as well . Fast service and item was exactly as described .
 grandaughter loved it . We got 2 and I was charged for 2 but only ordered 1 . Guess we will have one for next year . Thanks
 The product is nice and I got it faster than I expected . Very nice purchase experience !
 I would normally wear totes from abercrombie or hollister . When I saw the black crazy dots I thought it looked really cool ! This is the best backpack I have ever found and I wish that I figured that out a long time ago . Bit you know what they say it is better late then never finding that out . Overall JanSport mad another great , durable , and cute backpace . I reccomend it for anyone that needs a new , stylish backpack !
 This is the best . I have always used Jansport backpacks they last forever .
 These bags I bought for my son and daughter are great . Last year I bought a bookbag for my daughter and it broke close to the end of the year . I was quite upset because I bought this from a reliable department store . Well this time around the bookbag is holding up even with all the books that my fifth grader brings home .
 This backpack is very sturdy and great for my son who is in high school . It was not as roomy as I thought and he would of liked more compartments .
 I 've always loved Jansport backpacks and this is no different . I purchased a Jansport backpack similar to this one about 3 years ago and up to now it 's still in very good shape . Not to mention some of the newest designs they have to offer . This is well worth your money !
 The Jansport SuperBreak Black Crazy Dots Backpack is a great product . My niece likes it because it is fun and colorful , and I like it because it is durable . Not to mention , it was nice to have the product delivered right to our door . It was one less stop we had to make during the busy back-to-school season .
 Bought this backpack because I 'm sick of carrying tote bags . Love it and I love all the cool designs but I like to keep it simple so I went with navy .
 These jansport backpacks are amazing . they are durable and can hold a lot of stuff comfortably . the padding on the shoulder straps are a little thin though.One thing i would not recommend is to put an unprotected laptop in the backpack . the backpack has very little padding on the bottom so most likely the comp would be damaged.another great thing is that this pack contours to your back so that there is not a hole inbetween your back and the backapck
 Great item . My daughter loves her backpack and uses it extensively for school every day . It is about 30 % smaller than I thought it would be from the picture however .
 I bought this for my grandson who is 13 and he seems to like it and uses it all the time and I think that is a really good product , that holds up well .
 EL PRODUCTO LLEGO SIN INCONVENIENTE ALGUNO , ESPERABA MAS DE LA CALIDAD , PERO POR LO DEMA ESTA BIEN SON BONITA , EN LA PROSIMA COMPRA QUISIERA ENCONTRAR DESCUENTA PARA PODER VENDERLA
 Item was mailed in a timely manner . Item was received as described . Very pleased with the purchase and the amount paid . Thank you for great customer service !
 I ordered this backpack on the 15 and it said it was going to come on the 25 but it did n't so im still waiting . Hopefully I 'll get it on monday
 Justm what my son wanted and I did n't have to go anywhere with him except amazon !! Thanks so much more than I can say !!!
 Maybe can be cheaper ? I bought my previous Jan 's port for 22 on amazon , but it was 3 years ago .
 My seven year old LOVES red . We could n't find a red book bag in stores . This is a classic jansport bookbag that he will be able to use for years to come . Shipping was fast , bookbag exactly as you remember it from when you had your Jansport in grade school . Ca n't go wrong .
 Nice quality , good space , great for preschoolers specially if you need to send bulky things like a blanket or toys for nap time .
 Bought this backpack for my 4th grade daughter . She is very happy w it and loves the colors . It 's holding up well I just wish it had a lining . No pics of the interior of the pack .
 i love this backpack ! the color is so vibrant and beautiful . the color grabbed my attention quickly and i knew i had to have it . the jansport website didnt even have this color in stock and i was very fortunate to find it on Amazon . i got this backpack brand new with the original tags and everything ! : -RRB-
 My daughter is in 2nd grade this year and its good to know that JanSport makes a light weight but yet durable backpack that will fit in her locker at school ! We had so many colors and patterns to choose from but this one was an instant wow ! Hope it lasts the whole year but it came with a lifetime warranty , so no worries ! The shipping was great , just in time for school ! The price with shipping was within my budget , so it worked out great ! Thanks : -RRB-
 We received this really fast and we were very happy with it 's vibrant colors and good quality . We saw it at the retail stores and it was usually marked higher than for what we got it .
 Great price , brand new , had alot of colors available no problems with the bag my daughter loved it . I would definetly buy again . Thanks
 This is even more vibrant in person ! My daughter wanted a fun , bright backpack and absolutely loves this . Very sturdy and the perfect size . I 've had a Jansport since Middle School and I 'm now in my thirties . These are very well made backpacks !
 We are over all very happy with this backpack . My six year old chose it off here herself . The only thing I do n't like is there is no water bottle pocket . Therefore almost daily she comes home with water spilt in her bag . On the bright side the fabric seems to be waterproof . My twelve year old cousin also chose this back pack and loves it . So I think it 's good for multiple ages . The fabric print is cool !
 I did a lot research on those backpacks , I was first settled with jansport right pack , but after looking at my pal 's superbreak I decide to get that one . Right pack is just long , not much of a impact on volume , just long ... I settled with Dark French Gray because I havent seem anyone use it in school , it arrived today with nice package , the fabric feels strong , and it look bigger than the photos . I can put in
 this bag was just what i was looking for and it came really fast with just regular standard mail .
 This product was shipped fast and in perfect condition . I bought it for a Christmas present for my daughter and she really loved it . They had a great selection .
 My daughter was looking for a turquoise and brown backpack . This was exactly what she wanted . It has great quality at a great value . We received our order very fast .
 The product was just as described and it works wondefully . I recommend this product !
 i use this bag while attending classes in college and it is perfect for all my needs .
 I always liked JanSport bags for their durability . I bought one for my husband 5 years ago . He uses it to go back and forth from work , to rock concerts and when we go rock climbing .
 So far , this has been a great backpack for my daughter . It is very strong & durable and she loves the pattern . Unfortunately she brings a lot of heavy items home from school on a daily basis and her last backpack strap tore because it could n't handle the weight . However this new Jansport backpack seems like it will hold up for a long time . Love it !!
 As expected , I had this same backpack a few years ago but lost it . I 'm glad I purchased a replacement as I 've used it for college , camping , carrying photos for meet & greets for celebrities and much more . It 's made very high quality .
 I love this book-bag . Small , durable , and looks really nice.Would recommend to anyone that 's in college or high school .
 I purchased this for my son and he loves it . I purchased it because of the Jansport name and I am very pleased with quality of the backpack . Would highly recommend .
 My sister earned some cash for doing some yard work , and decided to spend it on this backpack . When it came in she said she loved the color . It looks durable . After a period of about a month , she has been using this backpack and it is still in great shape . It fits everything she needs in it . Jansport is a great brand , I have a Jansport backpack myself .
 I got the white one came brand new in sealed bag so it was still white . Very hard to keep clean but im older wouldnt reccommend white for a child . Very durable simple bag . I throw mine in washer no probAny questions just ask-Bee
 This back pack was a good value for the money and came in time for my daughter to take it to college even though we ordered it at the last minute .
 The backpack is great . My boyfriend uses it for school everyday . It 's managed to carry a couple of heavy textbooks as well .
 All I ever used in HS were JanSport backpacks . They served me well then and the one I ordered off of Amazon is working great for me in college . Fits my 2 college books , binder , calculator , vitamins , water bottle . Anything I want to throw in there fits ! I am very happy with my purchase .
 The book bag is perfect for a 9 year old , I chose it for my son , he is very happy with it . It 's light , cool , and tough.I really recomended for any one .
 My daughter is really into zebra print right now , and she just loves her book bag . She is a first grader and just loves this !!
 I was nervous to get this , because i was worried it would n't be up to par for a college student . I got it , and loved it . Cute color , I got Blinded Blue . It holds all of my books ANd my lap top with extra room . This is a huge plus for me , my last backpack was so tiny . I will definitely be a big fan of this brand
 Got this backpack for school and it is just about perfect . It is durable and comfortable . Jansport makes quality products .
 The yellow in actuality is a little too bright for my taste and it runs a little big for my body but well , I 'm small -LRB- 4 ' 10 '' -RRB- so what do I expect . The item came quickly and it was exactly as described . It stands out a lot so if you do n't mind catching peoples ' attentions and being associated with a yellow backpack , then go for it1
 I 've been using this backpack for about 3 weeks now , and it 's in great condition still . It holds all my notebooks and binder well . I have no complaints other than the fact that it gets dirty really easily . I have to place it on the ground from time to time when I go to tennis and there would be marks that can only come out if I wash them.Other than that , it is waterproof . That comes in handy since the weather here in Texas is bipolar and rain may hit randomly . Saves all my notebooks and homework from complete disaster . This was the first product I 've order from Amazon and I definitely love how fast the shipping is and how well they send the product -LRB- in protective packaging -RRB- .
 I wanted a jansport backpack for quite awhile now and I finally decided to order one from amazon its perfect to fit all books and even my netbook . Amazon is excellent with the shipping it was extremely fast I ordered my backpack Friday Night and with the exception of the weekend I recieved it Monday afternoon ! Very Satisfied THANKS AMAZON !
 I bought this backpack for my 10 year old son because i know its awesome and will last along time . My dad has the same one and hes has it for many years .
 Very pleased with the product . Good quality , colour and standard . Happy with the purchase . Everything seems to be in order . Highly Recommended .
 I bought this bag because I am studying abroad in the UK for one semester . I needed a good sturdy bag , that would n't look awkward or out of place . A bag that I could take anywhere and not be looked at twice . It has a lot of room for your things , and it does n't strain your back . I used it as one of my carry ons , and as I walked around Liverpool.The dark color hides dirt , and it is durable . All in all , a great buy , and definitely worth the money . I gave it 4 out of 5 because although it is comfortable and what not , I just wish it had longer straps , but that is mainly for me and my long back.If you are traveling , this is a MUST , and if you are just using it for school , then GET ONE !!
 I ordered this book bag to use for the new semester of college . I must say that the color is fantastic ! I got it in electric purple . While purple is my favorite color , I do n't see myself changing this bookbag until it wears out ! The material feels great and its lightweight . I wish the bag was a bit bigger but nonetheless , I love it ! Thanks , Amazon !
 Okay so i just got the bag 20 minuets & so far i 'm impress . the shipping was fast . the bag was packaged nice & neat . the only problem i see with this is if it gets rained or wet on i could see the dye running . perfect cute bag !
 My nephew found this and had me buy it for him which i sent it in the Philippines just in time for school . His classmates loved it ! In fact , he 's the only one in his class who has this kind of backpack which made him very happy !!!
 JanSport has the best quality with there products have bought them before would buy again and if you ever have a issue with it they with repair it or replace the best .
 Great , just what I wanted . Not much to expect but a regular backpack . Since it is brand new the straps are all stiff , so it takes a while to break it in and get it comfortable .
 Love my throw back , Jansport.I ordered the all black.I 'm pretty satisfied.It came brand new with all tags and a lifetime warranty.It did n't take long to arrive either.Thanks Amazon !!!
 This Jansport Backpack was exactly what my daughter was looking for . It 's the perfect size for middle school books/homework/etc . It 's not too big & bulky but fits a ton of stuff ! Very cool design and excellent quality !
 Lifetime warranty , Nicely finished and good quality . I recommend this for any student . It will be nice having a warranty with teenagers . For the price it 's worth it . We usually are pretty hard on our backpacks , multi usage - school , hiking , walking , and other activites . She LOVED it , she is 17 yrs old .
 The product was shipped with professional care and arrived almost a week before the start of school . Absolutely love the color , and loved how it was not damage at all during the shipping . Very lightweight , but spacious . Have no problems with the backpack and will absolutely adore it forever .
 When our church started taking collections for school supplies and backpacks , I knew I would order nothing but a Jansport . It 's a good size , carries a decent amount of supplies -LRB- I stuffed it full of supplies , including 3 binders ! -RRB- , and the quality is great . In my opinion , you ca n't go wrong ordering a Jansport . I 'm hoping the child who receives this bookbag is pleased , and that it lasts them a good few years . : -RRB- As far as shipping and cost , this bookbag is a steal and was shipped promptly . Very happy with my purchase . : -RRB-
 I owned one of these for over 10 years . It went through college with me and was big enough for all of my books , etc. . Post college , my son used it for school and during it all , it went traveling with us several times a year . I probably would still have it and use it for travel except that on one of those trips , I parked my car across from the Air & Space Museum in D.C. and someone broke in . All they took was my pack and a knit cap ... so even the homeless -LRB- ? -RRB- know a good pack when they see it . They left all kinds of electronic games they could have sold for some dough !
 In these days and times backpacks , bookbags , etc have become so outlandish . This is a classically styled all american backpack . No bells , no whistles , just a good ole standbye bag ! Hard to find now-a-days .
 I love this bag because it is light and roomy . However after laying it on the concrete a few times , it has 2 small holes at the bottom because the bag is so thin . I got my money 's worth , but will look for something with a leather bottom if you lay your bag on the ground at all .
 This backpack is very large inside . It is the third year I am using this brand and style . Being a girl I have to have a new color every year . This one is green . I like the color , it 's very vibrant . Last years ' was pink and though it was durable , it got dirty too easy and had to be washed quite often . Yes , I wash it in the washer on gentle cycle and hang to dry . It can hold all of my school books , but I 'm thankful that I do n't have to bring them all at once . Front zipper pocket is very large and holds my pen pouch , a small purse , and cd player . All around great backpack and it 's washable , what more could you ask for ?
 I think this backpack was so amazing to me because I used it from 2nd grade to 7th grade and I still have it now . I happen to love rainbow , so I chose the color of `` Peace Out . '' You Can Fit almost anything in there and the backpack can fit into almost anywhere . I definetly recommend it to anyone , any age is perfect . I want to keep this backpack for a long time . But best of all , if you want to keep it forever , the colors never fade out . So you will still notice the colors even ten years after you purchased it . I think I will definetly buying more things from Amazon . At least I 'll be sure it will last a very long time.Horray for Amazon !!!!!
 This bookbag is amazing . i love the whole look of it , and the style , and the fact that it can hold a lot of my books and papers and what not . It 's great . . thanks amazon for the speedy delivery too .
 It 's got ta be good if 4 months of school passed and there are no rips , tears or broken zippers ... especially if it belongs to one of my kids !
 I purchased this backpack for my 6th grade daughter . Many of the girls in her class are also toting this pack in the various designs available . As a parent it 's great to have purchased something at a resonable price that is highly in fashion and is of excellent quality . This is the first year she has not requested a new backpack within the first month of school .
 After trying many different daypacks , this one is definitely the best one if weight is a problem . Many backpacks have so much padding that the bag is already somewhat heavy before you even put your books and other things in them . I 've given away countless bags due to the weight issue , until I found this basic JanSport . Another added bonus
 Structurally , this backpack is amazing and everything I was looking for . It 's sturdy , lightweight , and very spacious . My only problem with it , is that the color was not accurately depicted . The picture shows it as a pale green , but it 's really more vibrant and almost the color of the Hulk . I would recommend Googling what the color actually looks like before placing the order .
 These backpacks are great for school , my daughters have always used Jansportthey last all year and wash up nicely to use for the summer.They are very sturdy , zippers are strong for all that tugging . i recommend to all parents with kids in school .
 This is a great backpack , it is very durable and looks great . I would buy again probably next school year .
 This backpack is very resistant . I have many heavy books that i need to carry around and this backpack has n't ripped yet . I ordered the Black/White Torn Triangle . The color was n't what i expected since the picture makes it seem purple/blue but its actually purple/pink . Other than that this backpack is very good .
 The pattern looks good , light and convenient for student . It 's the gift for a friend 's child . Will buy this brand again .
 So nice , it 's a gift for my brother , he like it so much ! The quality is also good !
 bought this and it 's a perfect sized backpack for a student ! not the mini but a full size jansport ! You could easily fit 2 textbooks and some notepads in it !
 This is a great quality backpack . After watching my school age child go through 1 to 2 backpacks a year I decided to spend a little more money for a better one . This JanSport is holding up great . It 's well padded at the shoulders so it 's comfortable to carry and it fits a lot of books and folders . The zippers are easy to pull and do n't snag . There are several pockets to help organize things . It 's a good investment .
 Their are so many types of back packs . But , if all you need is your basic back pack this is it . It 's made of tough material , sewn together well . Has large main compartment . A smaller compartment that has two pen holder slots and a wallet size pocket . I recommend this prodent .
 This backpack has lasted me for over 2 years now , and I have not had a single problem with it . Zippers are still working perfectly , and straps are still as comfortable as they 'll ever be . It 's a perfect backpack for college and beyond.Now , I do n't toss and drag my backpacks across asphalt and concrete -LRB- like I used to in elementary school :P -RRB- , but I have stuffed this bag many times with textbooks , paperwork , clothes , etc , until the seams seemed -LRB- hah ! -RRB- like they were going to burst . Much to my satisfaction , the bag still held strong each and every time.Only issue I have with this bag is that it 's almost too commonly used ! So make sure you personalize your backpack before you accidentally switch it with someone else !
 I needed this simple old school backpack for use as a toddler diaper bag . this works perfectly and was a great price !
 it 's good , and the color is the same that i saw in the internet . i love it so much . the express speed is fast .
 Durable and worth the money . Light weight , fits a lot of stuff and my 13 year old ca n't destroy it , no that says a LOT !
 Exactly what my daughter wanted ! the color matched the photo . great small backpack perfect for the skinny lockers now located in schools
 My son is says that it is compact but hold a ton of things . He is very happy with it .
 It arrived within 2 days of ordering it and it was the exact size he wanted . Great price great backpack .
 It was a Christmas present for my son and that is what he was looking for . It was perfect . These are the only kind of backpacks he likes .
 I was looking for a bigger pack , and did n't have ideas on size dimensions . Oddly enough , I 'm growing fond of it . I carry my gym shoes and clothes , towel , protein bottle , vitamins , and bathroom goods . With a main pouch and single size zipper pouch , the pack is essentially full . It serves it 's purpose .
 My daughter loves the color . It looks a little different than on the computer , but the real color is even better . It 's up to the Jansport quality and is used to carry school backs every day .
 My old Timberland backpack was too big and ugly . But it did n't strain my shoulders . I needed a new backpack and I was gon na pick an Everest but I saw everyone in school wearing this . I decided to get this and it 's really good . The front pocket is good for storing my iPod and pencils and stuff , and the big pocket was for my books and work . It 's easier than my other backpack because that one was a hassle trying to find my pencils . Overall , I have no complaints and it looks stylish and fits . I would recommend this to a collage student . Just do n't carry a load with it .
 I purchased a cheap knock off version of the black Jansport backpack a few years ago in Chinatown . After having that one for years and putting it through hell it finally ripped and fell apart , almost instantly . So I decided to splurge and buy the real deal . Boy is it amazing the material quality is amazing , it is very roomy , and has all the bells and whistles . Definitely a great buy .
 We got tired of replacing backpacks for school every 6 months or so and bought one of these . I had an older style that I used for 6 years with minimal wear . Lasts so much longer than the spiderman or hello kitty bags it is worth the extra money .
 Been using one of these for about 6 months to travel , take to gym , and take to work . No problems with it and it still looks brand spanking new . Very simple , clean , and surprisingly durable . If this one ever wears out I plan on purchasing a couple more .
 love it great for my laptop and running to class and not too bulky . I have a 13.5 '' laptop and it still fit
 I was on a search for a simple backpack that would fit all of my books and binders for an affordable price . Jansport was my answer . This bag is perfect for my needs . The large component is perfect for my binders and textbooks , I can even fit books and drinks in it too . I did n't want a backpack with a lot of designs all over or bright colors as I wanted it to be semi-professional looking . I highly recommend this backpack , especially for those looking for an affordable , simple bag .
 I got this backpack for my granddaughter for Christmas . She is a backpack collector , but this quickly became her favorite . This is sturdy and put together well . We expect to get a lot of use from it . Very attractive too . We are extremely pleased with this purchase .
 Love , love , love this backpack . Perfect color , really like the size and look of it . Totally old school and functional . Shipping was fast and I 'm really glad I went with this choice .
 this is a must have backpack its really great to have ... its a heavy duty backpack that can last you through out your school year ... i love my new jansport backpack thank you
 It 's been known Jansport backpacks are of A1 quality . I just luv this newbud green color in particular .
 My bag has remained fresh since its still wrapped in plastic , but everyone should know what to expect from Jansport bags
 We bought this for our 16 year old grandaughter for school . Besides being the popular backpack to have this year , the quality and durability are good . It has held up well to the rigors of high school day ins and outs . Jansport has always made quality products . I have owned them over the years myself .
 The quality seems to be nice as does the design . I got this at 70 % off and feel like I got a great deal . I do n't know if I think it is worth the list price but if you can snag this for half off you are getting a good deal . One thing I did notice about this backpack is that it is rather small . If you are a larger person -LRB- I 'm 6 ' 1 , 195 lbs -RRB- then this is going to look silly on your back with both straps on . I carry it on just one shoulder so it 's not a big deal to me but just something to think about . It seems to be made for the 12-16 age group more so than adults . But still works for my needs .
 Arrived quickly , great value for a bag that would cost over $ 35 at a store , exactly what I ordered and saw was what I recieved in great condition .
 The Backpack is so roomy . It is great for when you are taking two or more classes at college.Also it will be great for a weekend trip somewhere . You can put all your clothes and accessories in backpack .
 The backpack i received was better than i expected it to be but it took over a week for it to get here when i was told that i t would take only two days.i was extremely dissatisfied with the time it took for this to be delivered .
 This backpack is ideal for my 15 year old son . It 's strong enough for him to throw around with books in it . We love it .
 I gave this Backpack as a gift to my daughter to use a a diaper bag for her new born son . It 's perfect .
 Ok ... the last time I owned a jansport backpack was about a decade ago ... so I ca n't really remember and compare the quality back then and now but I 'll tell you that for around $ 15 that amazon had the shocker pink in ... it was a steal . So to me I ca n't really tell the difference.Will make a nice gift for the `` tweenies '' god daughter or niece still in school who like it simple.This is the same model that my wife used to carry and she loved that it came in this kind of pink -LRB- shocker pink bag/dark charcoal strap and back -RRB- ... she said that if there were n't any `` unwritten rules '' to professional attire , this would 've been a practical bag to use . Fits everything she needs , not small as in , it wo n't stuff till it bursts from the zippers and is n't too big like a black hole waiting to engulf a whole set of encyclopedias.For amazon 's low pricing -LRB- $ 15 + for my order -RRB- on some of the colors , 5 stars ... but for the other color 's around 29.99 , it 's just so and so ... probably 3 stars .
 This is a super cute backpack . Not exactly for heavy school books but quite enough for in-between period loads . A great buy for the price .
 It looks smaller than what it says , but quite able to pack your huge college text books in it . Simple and clean design and light weight can save your strength to carry all the stuff you need around the campus.I only wish it had thicker zip teeth like a sport backpack , then I would have given it 5 stars .
 It seems to be made very well and has alot of room for books and/or a laptop .
 My Grand-daughter loved her new book bag for school and was verypleased with the bright colors also .
 I really like the quality of JanSport . I remember in college that this was the backpack to own ! Now that my 5 year-old will be enjoying it , our school year will be off to a great start . I also liked the many color and pattern choices available . I do n't think there will be a problem for her mistaking her backpack for a classmates ' . Other than Amazon , I have not seen this pattern available in any retail store . Yea !! The only thing I wish it had was an outside net pocket for a water bottle . I 'm told that she will need to bring one to school each day . I like the padding on the part of the backpack that rests against the child 's back . My daughter even commented on how soft it felt . We are very happy with our first `` ready for school '' purchase !
 The bag I initially ordered was out of stock becuase their inventory was off - at first I was really upset because I really wanted that color . However , they worked with me and got me a great backpack that I was very happy with !
 Okay so this came two days before expected -LRB- I ordered the Forge Grey -RRB- and I am very pleased with the shipping , the cost & the color ! I got this with free super saving shipping . The quality feels different , but overall I am very pleased.-Besides , in the stores this is 34.99 , but I only got it for $ 26 ! : D
 I am the mother of 5 kids - I have purchased this backpack , in different colors , for each of my children before they have started kindergarten . I have taken them to a local embroidery shop and had their first names written on the outer pocket - so that they do n't get lost in the shuffle of 500 kids , some with the same bags . My oldest has been using the same bag for 5 years , and it is still perfect . Each year , the week before school starts , I throw them all in the washer , on cold and gentle , with mild detergent , then I hang them to dry - and they look like new ! I am so glad that I have n't wasted money on crappy kids ' backpacks that fall apart and look horrible in 6 months . I have an adult friend who got one of these in kindergarten , and used it for ALL 13 years he was in school , then went on to use it through 4 years of college , and is STILL using the SAME bag now , and he is 30 . These things are workhorses , worth their weight in gold .
 Not much to say , really . It is light , reasonably durable , and very comfortable to carry . I would definitely buy it again .
 My favorite backpack ! Great color , decent price ... I 've had it for a few months and it definitely has been awesome ! Got ta love Jansport !
 My daughter uses this bag in high school and loves it . Great quality and very roomy inside . I washed it in the machine and hung it up to dry . It looks brand new !
 clean cut , stylish , boy/girl , very durable , most likely for school , price could be lower though , in 2007-08 I bought this item for about $ 35.00 + , too expensive for this type of product I say , but a good choice
 I prefer just the plane and simple jansport backpack . . holds quite a bit and lasts forever -LRB- well . . not if u constantly drag it on the ground -RRB- but u can throw it around and it still looks nice ... well . . anyways . . great backpack . .
 Blue Backpack - Haiku of Praise : Like clouds of canvasBag that floats upon my backHolds all of my stuff
 Jansports are always great backpacks . This one was no exception . Two simple pockets and the black just goes with everything . An excellent basic backpack for all ages
 Purchased this backpack almost a year ago now . I knew what I was getting because my kids have used Jansport backpacks for years , and this was no exception . A year later , it 's going strong , no tears or breakage at all ... And kids have a way of throwing their backpacks around ;--RRB- Shipping was lightening fast and the price extremely competitive . My kids are always happy to use their Jansport backpacks for several years running . I would -LRB- and will someday -RRB- buy another just like it .
 Product was just as described and it arrived right when it was said to be delivered.This same backpack was double the price in the stores so it was a no brainer to buy it off of amizon even with shipping it was half the price then it was in the store.The backpack was not some no name brand either it is a Jansport which is well known name in packbacks.I am total satisfied to say the least .
 Ever since the 6th grade , I 've never owned any backpack but a Jansport . Before , I bought cheap Walmart backpacks that only lasted about a semester of school -LRB- and I do my best to take care of my things -RRB- . Now , I get one for each school year , but I still have the old ones for trips and travel . I have both the super break versions and two big student packs , and they both work great and have a sufficient amount of room . I will probably have these packs for many years to come , and I 'm quite content with that . I heart Jansport .
 really like this backpack its super strong its holds all my text books and my super heavy laptop . the backpacks are just a lil different from the ones that sell at tillys or any other store
 My daughter had been searching for the right backpack in our local stores and was unable to find one in-stock when she found one she liked . I decided to check Amazon and low and behold I was able to get her the one she originally wanted at a much better price .
 This is an awesome backpack !! I have had this backpack for about a year now and it still looks like new . I use this backpack almost everyday and it has held up well . I use this backpack to keep my planner in and as a school backpack . It 's just the right size . I think for the price , you cant get a better backpack !! I would so recommend this backpack to anyone looking for a new backpack !!
 Great Backpack ! It fits everything that i need for school ! Must buy for anybody attending school . Incredibly cheap price , compared to instore prices .
 Arrived quickly and as described . Love the JanSport backpacks . Simple and roomy for all the necessary school needs . The brand my kids will only choose .
 The color looks exactly what is shown in the picture . The backpack is strong and it is comfortable to use .
 I bought this bag for my son for school . It is everything we expected and more . It was the right price and size . Jansport bags are also very durable . Thanks again for quality products
 great bag , shipped in time . good to bring for college or university classes and used in casual . i like the color too .
 My son wanted a bookbag that starts out light , as he is in middle school with NO LOCKERS ! He puts so much in his bag , it gets really heavy . He wanted this bag specifically - -LRB- he saw other kids with it last school year . -RRB- It has few pockets making it simple , it 's light but it 's sturdy so it will last .
 My two eldest daughters and I all three each have one of these packs . I am a college student , they are middle school and elementary school age . These packs stand the test of time and durability and you can not beat the price via Amazon.com . And they are so cute too ! I 'd recommend these to anyone and everyone I know that needs a bookbag , or even a bag for every day events and activities . Great product !!!
 I was expecting the bag to be larger than it was . It is smaller than ordinary backpacks , but since I will be in college this fall and not carrying as many books , it is not an issue . I like the color , the quality , and the speed of shipping.The only complaint I have is that it does not have a drink carrier on the side.Thank you Amazon for your cheap prices ! : -RRB-
 I bought this back pack because its durable fashionable and i love it . It was shipped very fast and defenely recommend to buy it .
 My son wanted a Jansport for the new school year . We ordered it here on Amazon and we got it much quicker then estimated . He was really excited and the product was new and in perfect condition . Thank you .
 i like the color and its style . It looks great with its appearance with $ 25 price . It 's suitable for students .
 I love this backpack ! As for the reviews of being small , I 've carried two books , a notebook , iPad and leapfrog explorer for my daughter . Will definitely hold up ! Buy it !
 It came right on time and was the proper color and the price was as stated in their Ad . This is a very sturdy bag . I am happy as a Clam . : - -RRB-
 This product is so worth the money . The back pack is so comfortable and durable . It can carry lots of notebooks and class books . If your in high school or college , this is a good back pack to purchase .
 Just as expected cool , contemporary back pack and just the right size . The material was a tad lighter than expected . Overall very happy . Thanx !
 My five year old son loves this backpack . Straps are nice and thick good shoulder support , also the organiser in the front pocket helps him sorts out his stationary .
 This is a fantastic compact book bag . It does n't have a ton of pockets or `` features '' but it is perfect for students with a small to medium amount of belongings to carry around . And you can not go wrong with a Jansport bag for under 30 bucks . Well made and highly recommended !
 Bought this for my 15 year old daughter and she loved the fact that it does n't have a ` bajillion ' pockets ! She also loved that nobody else in her school has the same one , and knows what a deal we got on this !
 Product came in perfect shape and was earlier than i expected , i was expecting it here next week or so , but it came just before starting school how great is that !!!!!!
 It 's just what I wanted !! Quality stitching , and perfect size for my two college books and supplies - if you need to carry more you might not want to get it ... its on the small side.I searched all the stores first before buying it on here-white is a hard color to find AND I ended up saving about 5 dollars . I cant say how durable it is because I just got it but it seems sturdy.good buy !
 I originally decided to purchase this brand Jansport for my 7 year old twins because last year we purchased the little cutesy hello kitty and G.I Joe character back packs . Although they were adorable the quality was horrible . I had a Jansport brand backpack throughout college 1998-2003 and I never had to replace it . In fact o still have it . My kids just started using the back pack when school started on August 17th . But I have no doubt that these back packs are made with the same quality as they were in the past . I will keep you all posted .
 Great bag for a elementary school kid . Has the necessary compartments to fit personal and school stuff . One star taken off for not having a water bottle holder .
 this backpack is great as a basic backpack ... we got it for my 11yo who fell for the colors and print and we have had Jansport backpacks before and they do hold up for lugging school books and supplies - so we are happy with this one . there are cheaper versions available but we reached a compromise with this one because it 's fun * what she wanted - well made * what I wanted : - -RRB-
 This backpack , although it took a long time to ship , is great . The materials are very sturdy and the zippers are great . It is an overall greak backpack .
 Not a whole lot to say . Classic JanSport backpack in black . Solid construction . Excellent room with organizer in the front pouch . Worth the purchase .
 My son picked this backpack to carry his school stuff . It 's the perfect size for him and he 's very happy with his new backpack . From my perspective the backpack is well built -LRB- expected -RRB- , zippers are good quality and straps are comfortable enough to carry the weight it holds . It lacks an outside pocket to carry a water bottle .
 I really like this bag , but its a little smaller than I expected . It also gets rather uncomfortable to carry if I try to stick my laptop in it .
 I bought Jansport because my daughter has one and it is high quality and has lasted for 4 school years already . So I got this one for my other daughter who seems to go through one a year - I told her Jansport this year . Well we ordered this and it is too small for middle or high school . It 's more for elementary kids size wise . It 's too much trouble to return so I will hang on to it in hopes of being able to use it somehow .
 We have been buying Walmart $ 10 backpacks because my kids want a new fresh one every year to be cool and in style . But my tween thought the Walmart packs were not cool this year , so we went on Amazon and she picked this one . It cost about $ 30 with shipping , but it 's easy to see this backpack will haul all of her heavy Jr. . High books and last a long time . It 's thicker , better sewn and way sturdier . I 'm thinking it 's about ten times the backpack , but not 10 times the price . Now that is cool even to a mom !
 This backpack has room to carry lots of books and binders for an 8th grader . We especially like the padded back and straps . We shopped a long time to look at the myriad colors and designs . What we received matches what was shown in the picture . The colors and designs are very pretty . When we shop locally , someone else at the school usually shows up with the same backpack . Going through Amazon , with the many different choices , means we have a unique backpack this year ! -LRB- I do n't have to hear , `` Mom , a sixth grader has the same one as mine ! '' You may scoff , but these things are important . -RRB- We saved a few dollars , too , which is very cool because we never before wanted to spend the money on the JanSport name brand . Doing it this way made it feel affordable . Now that we have the brand , we can see the difference in the quality . With free shipping it was delivered before the promise date -LRB- hurrah for Amazon Prime -RRB- . There 's something fun about receiving and opening a box -- a nice little reward for my straight A student .
 This is a fabulous backpack for schoolbooks . The front pocket holds alot of supplies too ! I would buy this style again !
 Great backpack . Durable and has plenty of room for materials . I use it to bring books lunch and activities to my job and have used it for travel as well . . Love the color options .
 I had a Jansport that was passed down to me and used throughout highschool and college . I finaly got this new one and it has a unlimited warranty on it . I know these backpacks are dependable . I would recommend it . Nice price too .
 looks great and packaging was good too . good price for product and really enjoy having it . its perfect thanks again
 This is a great book bag . It is smaller than I thought it would be . The color is so pretty though .
 its just a normal backpack , with an exceptionally awesome selection of patterns . everyone should have one , but not in my pattern because i 'm trying to be pimpin with it . perfect for social sports ; -RRB-
 Item shipped fast and arrived in perfect conditions , it has been suitable to my needs and I have nothing negative in response .
 I brought it for me son and he loves it ! It is washable and very , very sturdy . He puts a lot in it , too .
 this bag is very useful and it has a lot of space which is a good thing and i love using it !
 I love the size , the color , and the simplicity of it . It 's small , which is what I wanted for myself .
 It 's the same color . It has a lot of room , but it 's also not too big and weird . It came like a week after , ... I think you guys should consider it . : -RRB-
 Backpack was a gift to my grandson . He liked it very much and is very please with it . I would recommend the product to those who need a backpack for school .
 The color of this backpack is so bright and pops awesomely!I bought this backpack because my old one was falling apart and everyone where I live has some kind of Jansport , but NO ONE has this one!The backpack looks pretty tiny but it definitely is not ! I was pleasantly surprised at how much room this backpack had . I originally was debating between the Big Student and Superbreak and I am so glad I purchased this one because its perfect for travel and school.Currently I have 2 hard 1 &#34; binders , 1 3 &#34; binder , 2 3 subject notebooks , and 2 600 + page books in my backpack and there 's still a little more room.HIGHLY recommended !
 Bought this for my grandaughter who wanted it to do her own design on with markers ... it looks GREAT ! Bright white worked out great .
 Pretty much the average JanSport ! I still recommend getting a DAKINE , just because it lasts longer , but this is pretty good too .
 JanSport bags are always great
 I got this bookbag for a friend during Secret Santa . She loved it and it came fairly quickly in the mail !
 It has a lot of space for my child to hold all of the items she needs for school and it 's easy to carry and the padding is great support for your back .
 Its great and in my favorite color :--RRB- . Its great use for a college student on the run or super chic as a handbag .
 this is the best thing ever . full of swagalicious products like three zippers . sexy beast bookbag will get you all them girls . so get this bookbag and feel like a god . keep the jeep ridin '
 This product is sturdy , the color is what we expected . My high school student is very happy with it.The backpack has plenty of room for eveything he needs to carry . The straps are adjustable for a comfortable fit .
 I ordered this a few weeks ago for college and its great ! It was shipped quickly and it was the cheapest out of all the places I looked at it . I use it everyday and have had zero problems with it !
 I use it for school every day . only wish it had a couple more pockets and side nets . other than that , very durable backpack .
 I like the fact the you can put stuff in it , and you could also wear it on your back . I prefer the one-strap because it makes you look a lot cooler .
 Nice backpack but not very comfortable . Straps need more padding . Only one at school with this one ' ! I would purchase another next year .
 Great backpack . My daughter ordered the hit pink and got lime green monogram . Big hit , well made , great price ! Love it .
 We have purchased many different brands of backpacks for our daughter and nothing handled up to her level of abuse other than the JanSport brand . It did n't matter what model of the Jansport bag we had bought . All of them handled up to the task and I will always purchase a JanSport backpack for ourselves as well as our daughter . That 's quality I can trust .
 My oldest started middle school this year and she wanted a black jansport backpack . I looked around and found out quickly just how expensive they were . When I looked on Amazon I was excited that the price was right in my budget !! She was so happy when it came .
 I purchased this pack to take to a MLB Baseball game . The dimensions complied with what was allowed to be taken into the ball park . Simple pack with real nice construction . Great price for the quality !
 It was just as we expected - love the color and JasSport Quality . Came well eithin the time we expected . My daughter loves it and needed a strufy backpack this year -LRB- high school -RRB- .
 I have been using a bulky one and it was unmanageable ... this is perfect size and weight . It looks good also .
 You ca n't go wrong with a well made Jansport backpack for kids . Those cheap backpacks with cartoon characters on them that you get for cheap are exactly that ... cheap . Jansport is classic .
 This backpack is very durable and has a cute design . I 've been using it for over a year and it has n't become worn or been damaged in any way . Recommended .
 I 've only ever owned Jansport backpacks , they 're fantastic , very sturdy and hold more than it looks like they would . The colors are bright and are noticeable .
 Great Backpack ! Love the color ! The only thing , is that it gets dirty easily . I got a pen mark on the pocket , and I 'm not sure how to remove it : -LRB-
 Great item . My daughter will love decorating it . It 's great quality , and I 'm glad Jansport is that go-to back pack brand that has been around for what seems like forever ! They always hold up really well .
 jansport is a product you really ca n't go wrong with . It has a lifetime warrenty on it . if the zipper breaks just contact the company and they fix it.kids love them - my son did not need it but every few years it is nice to get a new one vs. use the old one . i donate the old ones
 I would totally recommend this book bag its super reliable !! i 've been getting one since I was in middle school .
 It was a gift to my little sister . She liked it so much . I would like to recommend it to others .
 My daughter found this backpack on ebay - price was n't bad , but I searched other online retailers and Amazon 's price saved me about $ 6 ! The color is intense , the backpack 's design is not revolutionary , but it a time-tested design which is durable and functional . It can withstand the weight of the textbooks she has to carry . It is generally true , and I find it to be the case here - you get what you pay for . Highly recommended backpack !
 This pack is perfect . It 's light by itself , so really the only weight you feel is what you 're carrying . I use this bag for my laptop , camera and a change of clothes . It 's comfortable , sturdy and I 've heard great things about Jansport packs . :-RRB- Its a smart buy for the quality and guarantee .
 Bought this backpack for my daughter and she loves it , it looks exactly like the pic and fits the description perfectly .
 Really nice backpack in LOTS of designs . I currently have this backpack in navy and since I love it . . I want to get one in a more prettier design . What do you guys recommend ? Please comment .
 i loved this backpack , the color , the accessibility , everything . Although I wish that there was a pocket on the side for a water bottle or something .
 this packpack really does live up to its name . it seems like it will last a very long time . its got a lot of room for things inside despite the fact that it doesnt look that big as well , so if you want to be able to carry a lot without feeling like you have a mountain sitting on your back you might like this . the seller i got it from was CJTECH and they shiped very fast and the backpack arrived in prestine condition . it is perfect for people anywhere from 6th grade up to 12th grade -LRB- I am in 10th -RRB-
 Super cute . Loved it . But not black in color more of a dark grey . Still like it and durable and washable like all jansport backpacks
 Finally something we agreed on ! I really like how roomy this backpack is and it has a large pocket in front for her to keep all the markers/hi-lighters/pencils / index cards etc. required !! She loved the black & white pattern and the shoulder strapps are well cushioned ! I do n't know how they carry all those books !
 it looks great , arrived fast and is a nice back pack for my college . I had one of those when I was in high school but I lost it , jansport backpack 's are the best !!!!
 Jansport is an excellent brand of backpack . They carry stylish and durable products . Jansport stands by their products and will replace if damaged from what I understand
 My daughter loves this backpack , because it is not heavy , and more spacious inside of bag . And she told me it was easy to put in or out from her locker at school . She wants to buy one more ...
 If you are a student this backpack is for you . I keep my small things in the small front pocket and put my books in the main pack . It 's convenient if you do n't have lots of things to carry . I 've had this for over 2 years now and I 'm still using it , the color faded a little but other than that , the quality is great . Would buy another Jansport backpack in the future as soon as the one I have right now wears out !
 Well first , to no fault of amazon or UPS , I couldnt get my bag almost 1 week later though I requested two day shipping ! - Due to disastrous conditions in GA. . So I was a bit upset , but this bag is well worth the wait . Its cute , and actually fits WAAAY more books than I thought , plus a binder !! It has tons of space , the design on the inside is as awesome as the outside . Its not just a boring bag . Adds character
 Admittedly , I have n't had the chance to use my new Jansport backpack very much , since I just received it this month . However , if I wait a year to write a review then it will never happen . Lesser of two evils is writing one now . It 's still very valid , IMO.Mine own Jansport yellow has only taken a few short trips to visit my girlfriend in NYC , but it 's held up well -LRB- as expected -RRB- . I write `` as expected '' because I 'm familiar with Jansport quality . My brother has been a Jansport owner/user for the past 20something years , first purchasing his forest green version in high-school . His pack has served him well over the years , and held up remarkably . He 's used it to carry books -LRB- high school and college -RRB- as well as assorted clothing , which is to be expected . However , my bro was also in a local band for many years , performing often in different locations around the city . It was during this time that his Jansport earned it 's respect . He used it to carry musical equipment such as pedals and cords , which are n't light . Some equip has sharp edges , none of which penetrated/damaged his pack . The bag held up through all of this use , without even a small hole or tear.I 've borrowed his pack over the years for various reasons and uses , and until recently we 'd never discussed it 's quality . When I finally asked `` How long have you had this ? '' , I was floored . And I wanted one sooooo bad.I just purchased a backpack that I may use for the rest of my life . -LRB- Seriously , go to the jansport website and read the guarantee . -RRB- For under $ 25 !!! If my review seems glowing , that 's because it is . If my opinion on Jansport changes over the next few months/years , then I will update my review accordingly . Trust me on this.If Jansport ends up disappointing me YOU WILL KNOW ABOUT IT !
 The review title says it all . The bag is n't very bulky so it does n't get hot on your back . It 's simple in design and works great . The only con I would have to list is that for those who like pockets , this are n't very many .
 when i was in high school i had one of these bookbags and i loved it . they are really durable and will last forever . i was buying bookbags from old navy for my daughter and she was always complaining that it did n't fit all her stuff and she 's in the 4th grade . so i finally decided to put a little money into buy a jansport because it 's actually an investment . she loves it and i know i wo n't have to buy her another one for a long time .
 I have been using my Jansport -LRB- different color , same style -RRB- for over 11 years since my freshman year of college in 1999 . It is dirtier than it used to be and the mesh extra pocket has a minor snag on it but I use it everyday as a teacher , for traveling , to throw my laptop in , etc. and the zippers are all still great , there are no tears in the bag , and the bright orange color still makes me smile.I remember just how many backpacks I went through as a kid and can truly say had I had a Jansport I would probably still be using it two decades later rather than just one .
 I saw this color on a jansport in the store , but it was n't the style I wanted . Found it here online and they delivered it within 2 business days ! Very happy with my purchase !
 JanSport on the whole is a strong and certified bad !! The only problem is deciding on a design ... I bought two JanSport 's for myself , a pink from the classic series , which is still in mint condition and a shoulder side-strap bag -LRB- pink of course -RRB- which doubled up as my trendy laptop bag and book bag.I got this one for my boyfriend after and when he first put it on there was a confidence in him and everybody commented on the style of the bag . It was an unusual type in our campus , so it definitely caught their attention.A simple black and white but with such a statement . Love It ...
 I purchase this backpack for my son . I did n't want one with tons of pockets and one that was too big . I was looking for a simple , basic , durable backpack , and that 's what I got . He loves this backpack and it 's held up good . We are going on year 2 with this bag and it 's still super durable and clean looking . No unraveling of strings or seams , no stuck zippers . It 's perfect ! I would highly reccommend this item .
 I bought this for my great grandaughter . She found it on the computer when staying a few days with me . She always finds something when visiting . She loves it and when I saw it -- Wow it was more than I expected . Very nice . I will give this backpack five stars as it is so well constructed and very true to color . Girls , you will love this if you like this Zebra print . Lot of room too . This is the second backpack ordered from this we site . Five stars to them .

 I 've used this backpack for school from 7th grade to 12th grade . It 's also gone with me to summer camp several times , been on hikes across mountains , traveled to Germany and Italy , etc. . It is a wonderful backpack . I 'm sad that I 'll have to retire it for a bigger backpack when I go off to college this fall , but I will still use it often whenever I need a smaller bag . The only part of the back that has been damaged is some of the stitching has worn off on the very bottom of the bag . I 'm very impressed that the shoulder straps and zippers are still in perfect condition . I love this backpack !
 i bought this pack as a more ergonomical pack/purse for a girlfriend with back problems , and she love 's it !!!! a great product !!!!
 I 'm just finishing up my Freshman year of high school , and I used the Jansport Superbreak backpack in Electric Purple for part of the year.I really like this backpack . It 's lightweight , so I do n't mind carrying it around when I have to . It also could fit a bunch of stuff , but being in high school , no one actually wants to do that.So if you 're in/going into high school , I recommend this bag .
 JanSport is a great brand . The quality of their backpacks is great and the size is perfect . I would recommend it to everyone .
 To say the least , this backpack is everything that I 've needed . For years I 've been using designer bags for my schoolbooks but finally decided to switch to an actual backpack . I will never be going back -- especially considering the price ! I 've had bags that break after a semester or even a month because they 're not made to hold the weight that I require for school , they 're made for style . I am absolutely 100 % sure that I will have this backpack for years to come , which so far shows no indication of wear or tear after about a year of use . I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a classic , simple and powerful backpack.By the way , I purchased this bag in navy and it matches with everything , but CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT LIST ??! Kudos to JanSport and Amazon for all of the possibilities .
 jansport backpack , this is the second time I am buying jansport backpack , it is so light , and you can fit lots of stuff in it . I love it : -RRB-
 Overall it 's pretty good . It 's a simple backpack with a main compartment and then a small one . I recommend it : D
 Perfect for going on tours when you are vacationing . Large enough to hold your necessary articles , but small enough not to be too heavy .
 This was a great purchase ! It was as if I had bought it at the store brand new , but for half the price ! I recommend it to anyone who wants a new backpack , but does n't want to pay a lot for it .
 This product is a great product . Also shipping was very fast ordered Tues got it Thurs
 This is a classic backpack that has been around forever . Works great for basic `` campus '' uses . I have had a few of them and the only problems I 've ever encountered involve the stitching by the zipper coming apart . Could just be me , the heavy load I carry , or something else , but it 's something to be aware of if you 're looking to have a really heavy load in there or use your backpack in beyond the average way . If so , JanSport is a great brand and has some other models which are meant for heavier and harder use . For most people though , this model will work great . Even with the problems I 've had , I keep going back to it .
 This is exactly what I am looking for . Thanks to the seller , I receive it in only a few days . The backpack is light , fit to my back , not bulky but can hold my mac . The nice thing is that I can choose my favorite color out of many choices , which is impossible in local grocery .
 I bought this as a present for my sister who is in high school . I think its neat how the Jansport is now branching out and doing more designs . The peacock feathers are good graphics and the colors go with a lot of looks .
 I have a broken leg and am on crutches so I needed a light weight backpack to carry all my stuff and have my hands free . This has been perfect . It is very light but big enough to hold a sweater , etc as well as the former contents of my purse .
 Super cool book bag . Purchased as a last minute birthday present for my son . It arrived the morning of his birthday so I was able to have it for him when he returned from school . Excellent shipping time.Roomy enough for my high-schooler . Thrilled , as always , with the quality of a JanSport .
 This backpack is cute and functional , I cant wait to use it this summer . The design is awsome and the color really pretty . The seller had it for a great price and shipped it to me quickly . Thanks .
 Used for a highschooler , great simple design without a ton of pockets/bulk , son loves it !
 This backpack is awesome . Its simple and perfect . I had one all through High School and go this one for college an it will probably last a long time ...
 This is a very comfortable bra . You barely notice that you have it on . I also have Bravado bras which are not as comfortable and not as well structured as Fancee Free one . Great comfy home bra .
 Very nice gift for the woman in your life . It is difficult to find 100 % silk in typical department stores and these are a real bargain . The quality is good and the length of the top is very generous . Recommended .
 I had been shopping for silk pajamas for a year now . The department stores as well as the specialty stores had none to offer , even at Christmas . I am delighted with the 3 pair of Intimo silk pajamas that I purchased from Amazon.com . They are just what I have been searching for . What an easy way to shop for my needs .
 Great product . Instant hit and success as a gift . Good timely delivery of product . No complaints .
 These are wonderful , very light weight pajamas . The color -LRB- ivory -RRB- looks richer than stark white . I bought a large because I like things loose , but could have used a medium , so the sizing is accurate . If you 're looking for a reasonably-priced bit of luxury , you wo n't be disappointed with these !
 My wife likes silk pajamas , but some sets just do n't hold up well . This is the second set of Intimo pajamas I 've given her , and she loves them . Great silk feel , but still sturdy enough for everyday use -LRB- and washing -RRB- .
 The fit is fine and loose where it needs to be . Quality appears good and the wife is happy . For the price you ca n't beat it . So far it has not fallen apart from washing , although we do n't run it in the dryer . It dries quickly enough on the hanger .
 This line of underwear is terrific . I own several pairs . The fabric and waistband are ultra-soft . The fit is slightly small , so order a size larger unless you like really tight underwear . The pouch styling is great and makes your bulge look great . Recommended .
 i tryed them on and they fit well . other than that i havent worn them . Im saving them for my wedding day . Im a boxerman but needed a sexy pair for my wedding . they make my package look good . I hope the ole lady likes them .
 My husband bought one of these shirts last year to try it out . I was very skeptical of the `` no ironing '' claim . I could n't believe my eyes when I took it out of the dryer the first time -- not a wrinkle to be seen . The material is truly miraculous . We both love this product and plan to buy more . Thank you , Jos. Banks !
 I own three of these shirts and they are great . I get my shirts cleaned and pressed and here is an example of what great shirts they are
 I own two of these Traveler non-wrinkle shirts and they are absolutely the best shirts I have ever owned . They are of high quality material and the size I bought was right on the money . The colors offered are very versatile with just about anything a person would own and can be worn formally or casually . I am going to stick with buying more of these shirts .
 I bought 2 to begin with and now own seven and I ca n't see myself buying other dress shirts
 I received this shirt as a gift over Christmas . Since then I have bought two more . The fit is outstanding and I have never felt a finer material in a dress shirt - it is soft yet sturdy and always appears pressed . The iron free is for real . I hate ironing and will pay the extra 20 dollars per shirt to never have to dry clean or iron again . I will never buy another shirt and I almost want to throw away my non-iron free dress shirts . I highly recommend this shirt . You will enjoy it and probably buy more of them .
 These dress shirts are the best ! Wrinkle-Free , Breathable , Durable Material , Plus lots of styles , sizes and color options . Compare side-by-side to other dress shirts and you 'll see and feel the difference .
 I ordered three of these for my farmers market business and so far they 're very sturdy and nice-looking . Clean lines and work for different body types as well , though a bigger bust would be somewhat of a problem with the narrower top .
 I love this apron . Fabric washes nicely and it not too heavy or light . I 'm short -LRB- 4 ' 11 &#34; -RRB- so the length is perfect . I do n't feel like I 'm wearing an evening gown . Adjustable strip at the neck makes it easy to go over my head . A good product !
 Love , love , love this apron . I use it frequently and with the baking I do it gets washed often and comes out looking great .
 I could not find a good , inexpensive apron anywhere local to me . This one seemed to be just what I was looking for , and I have not been disappointed . It is well-made and not at all flimsy . Great all-purpose apron -LRB- I use it in an art studio -RRB- . I am a big guy and it fits me just fine .
 This apron covers very well and I love the pockets ! It is adjustable at the neck strap so it is very comfortable . Washes up great ! I will be purchasing more !
 Wish I had gotten a couple more of this very high quality apron . Great for short or taller people . The slip neck strap makes it easy to adjust length . Excellent purchase !
 Great little apron -- just what I wanted ! It fits well , the adjustable neck and pockets are a plus , and the fabric is great !
 It has two full size pockets with a small pouch for a thermometer . Fits nicely and is adjustable . For the price it you ca n't beat this .
 I wanted an apron that was sturdy enough to stand up to repeated washings , yet light enough so I would n't feel hot or weighed down . This apron fits the bill . Made of a light denim , it 's long enough to cover me down to my mid thighs . I wish the ties were a little longer , but I 'm able to tie them without trouble , and I 'm kind of thick through the middle , so unless you 're really thick , you should n't have any problem with it .
 Product as described . Good quality material , true color , well sewn . Product arrived quickly . I purchased a red one and a blue one to personalize for gifts and was pleased with both of them .
 This is a nice , thick , and well made apron . It gets a lot of use and a lot of washings and has held up well .
 I 'm a 5 ' 10 '' male and this apron comes down to the top of my knees . I build wooden ship models and there is a lot of hand sanding involved . The apron covers me where I need coverage sitting down . Sawdust sticks to the apron so when I get up it does n't fall on the floor . I looked at a lot of aprons before selecting this one and I 'm very pleased with it .
 Great for Dexter costumes ! Great value too ! Solid material , not too heavy or thick . Will not constrain movement!I definitely recommend this product .
 Prduct was as described . Fast shipping . Love cooking with thish apron in , it does its job and keeps me clean ! Pockets are nice , I just have n't figured out what people actually put in them ! Haha
 The Port Authority men 's apron is a good product . I wish the apron could have been a little longer , but the apron strings were at sufficient length . Also , the adjustable collar was a nice extra . The blazing red color certainly creates a festive setting . I must have liked the aprons because I bought seven of them !
 I ordered two of these and machine embroidery on them . The material , sewing , finishing all were perfect .
 My husband lQQks adorable in this & it is well made & sturdy & good for a man who ... eats . : &#62; -RRB-
 Great fit easy to clean a blessing to have I do n't have to mess up my clothes anymore give it a shot .
 Perfect fits-all apron , handy pockets and very durable material . Well made and great price . Would recommend this as a good day-to-day work tool !
 I love the soft , pre-washed denim and large front pockets - it 's perfect for oil painting in , but would also be great in any art studio , the garden or even the kitchen - the casual , soft denim prevents one from looking like a waiter while the adjustable neck strap and ties ensure a perfect fit . And just throw it in the washer with your jeans . Highly recommended for other artists .
 These aprons are wonderful ! The adjustable neck ensures that they fit both my better half , who is 5 ' 10 '' , and myself -LRB- 5 ' 0 '' -RRB- , and the apron strings are long enough that both of us can wrap them around and tie them in front . I have waist-length hair , and an added benefit for me is that the neck strap holds back the tendrils of hair that always seem to escape while I 'm cooking . Spills do n't seem to soak through the apron material onto our clothes , and the aprons wash -LRB- and dry -RRB- beautifully , keeping their size and shape and coming out wrinkle-free . I 'm really glad we got them !
 Apron made of good thick material ... just wish strings were a little longer ... but overall I am pleased , would order again . Thank you .
 Like it , and it help me to cook avoiding the splashing oil.But I still feel it to be a little bit expensive . It would be even better if the neck tie is shorter .
 I purchased this apron because I do a lot of semi professional cooking . It is nice quality cotton and washes up well . I love the adjustment buckle of the neck because it allows me to take in on and off without messing up my hair -LRB- I 'm a woman what can I say ? -RRB- and I find the pockets useful . This is not a very long apron but I am 5 feet nothing and did n't want it to swamp me so it was perfect and covers enough so I do n't have spills on my dress etc. . Would highly recommend .
 I love this apron , just the right size and it machine washes and dries great , does n't shrink . It 's a must when cooking to save your clothes from getting stained . Would definitely purchase it again .
 I ordered these aprons to cater a wedding . I am amazed at how quickly I received them . I am amazed at how quality the aprons are . I received these aprons in 2 days . . Excellent product.Ranglin
 These are the perfect aprons for cooking to gardening . Durable , wash well , comfortable to wear . Great price ! Thank you ! Quick ship . Would buy again .
 I ordered a red one and the washed denim . The red one is a higher quality fabric and I really like it . The denim apron 's fabric is very thin and worn . It 's cute but not as durable as the red one .
 This is a cute restaurant style apron made of quality fabric . The apron was just as pictured and the company shipped it promptly .
 I bought several of these aprons in white and our craft group painted on them . The fabric is a nice weight , not too heavy , but neither flimsy . I would like it if the bib were a little wider , but it suffices . We are using them to protect clothing as we craft . They took the paint nicely and look very cute ! You certainly ca n't beat the price .
 This is a nice product and the price was right . I bought several colors . One came with the neck strap twisted -LRB- manufacturing mistake -RRB- and the company replaced it immediately without my having to hassle sending the original back . Great customer service !
 I bought 3 of these to feed my baby who tends to have a lot of spit up . Works great , very sturdy . I was surprised how good the quality was for how much I paid .
 We needed good quality and inexpensive aprons for a community bicycle cooperative and these have really fit the bill . They are not the heavy weight shop aprons -LRB- that cost twice the price -RRB- but we have found them to be just what we wanted . The pockets are nice and big too.I will be a repeat buyer .
 This apron is great . It washes up well and I love the placement of the pockets . A very good value .
 i needed a work apron , mainly for finishing and painting . i was a little weary about the quality of fabric based on other reviews , but i ordered the dark green and am very satisfied . although being a softer weave cotton , it seems very sturdy and perfect for somewhat serious to light craft projects . the width and length may be a little shorter than what some people require -- i 'm only about 5 ' 2 '' 100lbs , and it does not swallow me like most `` adult '' aprons . the pockets could stand to be a little larger , but they are hand + ; the right side pocket also has stitching for a pen/paintbrush . pretty neat !
 I ordered the blue one as a christmas present and it looks great , i like the quality of the fabric used and the pockets look well positioned , looks like an awesome product for the price .
 Ordered for a craft project for work . Was very surprised by the good quality . The adjustable neck strap was very handy and appreciated by the different sizes/heights of those who had to wear them .
 Loves it , especially the pockets for various kitchen tools . Nicely constructed . Gets a bit wrinkley after a wash and dry .
 I bought the coffee bean so that when I oil paint it wo n't get all over my clothes . It 's exactly as it says and it seems to hold up fine . The neck adjustment strap is right at the left near your shoulder , so it can be a little awkward at first , but fine once you wear it a lot and get use to it . If you 're looking for a cheap apron that is decent to good quality , then I 'd highly recommend it .
 Big backpack , but not too big . really like it . got it in true blue , the color is nice , though this color is more expensive , recommend for college student
 I bought the red backback for my 8 yo daughter -LRB- 3rd grader -RRB- . The color was a total success and que quality of the material is excellent .
 This is the perfect city-stomping-around back pack . It is just the right size , it 's lightweight , and it 's a cool color . I like it a lot .
 it is my perfect black-yet-not-borring bag . I love the lines of the bag and how is zips up top . a good size also , not to big or small . great for sleep overs or college .
 It 's been almost 3 years and it still looks like new . Very high quality , i get compliments often , and brown is OBVIOUSLY the best color hahaha it goes with everything , seriously recommend
 i choose it because it is a good brand . it was here on time and i recomend ithis item to everyone
 It 's perfect !!! But I 'd like it with more pockets . I actiolly bought it for my nieces they so love it too
 Love this bookback . Nice price nice color and it looks like it will last for a long time . Its really bright red .
 My daughter loves this umbrella . She 's had it for about 6 months and it has n't fallen apart -LRB- unlike some other 's we 've had -RRB- ...
 My daughter had this umbrella before but once she broke it she did n't want a different one because she absolutely loves this one !
 These shorts are excellent quality . AFTCO is one of the finest and is known worldwide . These are heavy duty fishing shorts but dry quickly
 This suite is very warm and comfy the only problem I had after my purchase was I seem it for about $ 10.00 less than what I paid for it
 I just bought a new pair of these coveralls for my dad this Christmas . After 20 + years of working in the winter elements on our family farm in West Virginia , his old pair FINALLY fell apart . So , I 'm not planning on having to buy them again anytime soon . If you 're looking for quality and durability , these coveralls wo n't let you down .
 Thank you very much!This item may someday save my life !! How so?Well , I live in a trailer house with no heating unit like a furnace -LRB- not to mention no running water or sewer -RRB- to heat normally.The space heaters will work well to about zero above , but once it goes below zero it gets down to 40-50 above indoors.These coveralls will keep me from getting chills , because once I get chills I risk Pneumonia and that spells sure death due to not allowed to go to the hospital.My family wants me dead and will find ANY way possible!I recently got sick by being poorly dressed in cold weather , but survived without hospitalization.Next time I might be so lucky , hence the coveralls for protection of my life.The quality is outstanding -LRB- as I 'm wearing it while typing this -RRB- , very warm and comfortable.The fit could n't be more perfect , with enough extra space to accommodate layered clothing underneath . Every feature touted in the label is spot on , especially enjoying the comfort designed into it.I will probably be wanting another in the near future and I hope I can be able to order another from them.They are wonderful and kind , making sure I have my item.This consideration always brings tears to my eyes !
 Walls makes a quality product . If I have a choice I will buy Walls . I ordered these coveralls for my son as a gift this Christmas . I asked my spouse what size to get . Unfortunately we both underestimate how much he has grown . The return process was straight forward , as described in the receipt . The refund was processed in a timely manor and , except for the error on our part ended satisfactorily .
 Found this product to be excellent value , and quality . Shipped in a timely manner . Would recommend these coveralls to anyone working in cold environments .
 Nice to find an XL Tall Walls since local stores do n't seem to carry . High quality and meets all expectations . Arrived in a timely fashion .
 Great Quality . Size is what it says it is . Heavy duty insulation . Tough outer fabric . Came fast , great customer service from vendor as they checked to make sure things were right the first time . The recipient thought they were better than others they had gotten .
 I bought these as a Christmas gift for my husband last year and he absolutely loves them ! He 's wearing them right now in fact , out working on the car ! He says he feels warm and comfy with these and a winter hat on . I picked up another one for my father in law and I think he 's wear them all the time if he could ! lol Great purchase , they are comfy and they wear well , in great condition after a year of pretty heavy use . Also , he 's about 200 pounds a 6 ' 2 '' and they fit him just fine in all areas .
 These were purchased for cold weather wear ; since there has been little cold weather to wear them in I guess we will wait until next year . The coveralls are well made , well fitting and will stand the test of time . Good value for quality product .
 The Walls ' coverall has been working very well for me . I already tried it under low temperatures 20 F , and it works as expected . It 's a good investment for those who work outdoors . I recommend it .
 Bought these for my husband for Christmas and he loves them . At first he was skeptical , but now he 's glad to have them.I did altar them a tad . He did n't like the sleeve hanging over the knit cuff . He said they get caught on things when he is working , so I trimmed the sleeve back and stitched the new sleeve end to the cuff seam and he was happy as clam.It is very nice to be able to get the proper length and fit . Definitely recommend this product .

 These dress shirts are the best ! Wrinkle-Free , Breathable , Durable Material , Plus lots of styles , sizes and color options . Compare side-by-side to other dress shirts and you 'll see and feel the difference .
 I just wear these around the house . I like the light comfortable fit . Quality seems good for the price being under ten dollars .
 I love these pants . I have 8 pairs , all colors , and a couple each of black and navy . Good quality , lightweight , no wrinkling , wear them right out of the dryer . Perfect length . I am 5 ' 4 '' . I wear my pants a bit looser than most women . It 's hot in Oklahoma and I need the air space . I even wear them to town in our small town.Now I have lost a bunch of weight and have to buy a smaller size cause I have to have them.Please get them in again before summertime .
 coat is warm and attractive . It 's a great value for the guy who does n't like a lot of `` weight '' .
 This jacket could not be any more perfect for me . Living in the South , it is light enough to not be cumbersome , yet it provides great warmth and comfort without being huge and bulky . The Trek Parka is a great cross between a light to medium jacket and a wind breaker . I am a huge fan of Columbia products and will continue to purchase them in the future .
 I 'm in the air force . I was deployed to an area where I was fixing jets for 12 hours a day in -15 degree weather and worse and these kept me warm and dry all winter .
 great fit , sizing was easy to get right the first time . Seem thick enough but will no more when the weather changes .
 I love these ! I bought mine because I work graveyard as security and was allowed to buy these after seeing my welders wear them.Anyway , they are warm and did very well in the wind and cold ... . i would buy another pair in a heart beat ...
 I bought these for my husband he is a mechanic for heavy equipment in the logging industryJust recently he had snow blowing in on him all day while running equipment , he said he had about 6 &#34; of snow on his lap but always stayed warm . Just shake them off and their good to go the next day . Their also nice because they are not bulky . They allow you a lot of flexibility for working.Very happy with them !
 i purchased these mainly for ice fishing and they are very warm , my wife wants me to get these for her next winter
 My son was thrilled he works constuction and these bibs are warm and have all the pockets he needs for tools .
 These live up to the Walls name . My hubby is very happy with these as he works outside all day at his job .
 My son works outside for his job , and he loves these , he said they were a great fit and washed up real good . great price also .
 this shirt is way pimp and I 'm sure everyone that knows you and your style will say so I 'm so glad I got it people off the streets just say hey nice shirt or you can just tell when someone is looking hard lol .
 I am very happy with the quality of the robe I purchased and for thegood service .
 My two year old grand daughter loves this umbrella , and I think any little girl would enjoy having it .
 I bought this beanie because the price waa so good . I 've washed it twice to look for defects but did n't find any . When it 's cold it 's hard to beat a beanie
 My husband bought one of these shirts last year to try it out . I was very skeptical of the `` no ironing '' claim . I could n't believe my eyes when I took it out of the dryer the first time -- not a wrinkle to be seen . The material is truly miraculous . We both love this product and plan to buy more . Thank you , Jos. Banks !
 I own three of these shirts and they are great . I get my shirts cleaned and pressed and here is an example of what great shirts they are
 I own two of these Traveler non-wrinkle shirts and they are absolutely the best shirts I have ever owned . They are of high quality material and the size I bought was right on the money . The colors offered are very versatile with just about anything a person would own and can be worn formally or casually . I am going to stick with buying more of these shirts .
 I bought 2 to begin with and now own seven and I ca n't see myself buying other dress shirts
 I received this shirt as a gift over Christmas . Since then I have bought two more . The fit is outstanding and I have never felt a finer material in a dress shirt - it is soft yet sturdy and always appears pressed . The iron free is for real . I hate ironing and will pay the extra 20 dollars per shirt to never have to dry clean or iron again . I will never buy another shirt and I almost want to throw away my non-iron free dress shirts . I highly recommend this shirt . You will enjoy it and probably buy more of them .
 These dress shirts are the best ! Wrinkle-Free , Breathable , Durable Material , Plus lots of styles , sizes and color options . Compare side-by-side to other dress shirts and you 'll see and feel the difference .
 I 'm in the air force . I was deployed to an area where I was fixing jets for 12 hours a day in -15 degree weather and worse and these kept me warm and dry all winter .
 great fit , sizing was easy to get right the first time . Seem thick enough but will no more when the weather changes .
 I bought these for my husband he is a mechanic for heavy equipment in the logging industryJust recently he had snow blowing in on him all day while running equipment , he said he had about 6 &#34; of snow on his lap but always stayed warm . Just shake them off and their good to go the next day . Their also nice because they are not bulky . They allow you a lot of flexibility for working.Very happy with them !
 i purchased these mainly for ice fishing and they are very warm , my wife wants me to get these for her next winter
 My son was thrilled he works constuction and these bibs are warm and have all the pockets he needs for tools .
 These live up to the Walls name . My hubby is very happy with these as he works outside all day at his job .
 My son works outside for his job , and he loves these , he said they were a great fit and washed up real good . great price also .

 This was for a 17 yr old that did not have a coat for winter . He loved it!Love , Memaw
 Very comfortable medium weight jacket . Fits very well . It 's a bit lighter then expected but after walking outside in 30 degree weather , I stayed warm . I would highly recommend this jacket .
 My son loves his new Anakin glove gauntlet . He says it is `` awesome '' ! He wears it all the time even when doing homework .
 The glove was fairly big for my small framed 9 year old but he loved it anyway . The gauntlet and the lightsaber were his favorite parts of his Anakin Skywalker costume . They were the only parts he wanted to keep for playing with after Halloween .

 Having lost , stepped on , sat on , dropped , thrown , scratched the heck out of , and/or otherwise come to part with many , many pairs of sunglasses , I now have one rule
 This is a great umbrella ! It 's really designed for kids with no pinch-points -LRB- when you open & close it -RRB- and no sharp metal stem sticking out of the top . Plus , it 's super cute . We 've been very happy with it , and we 're just waiting for it to rain again !
 The price was fair . Works fine and arrived on time . I 'm happy with it.This is extra text to meet the stupid minimum requirements from Amazon .
 I got this for my friend 's little girl & she loved it . The umbrella survived a big rainstorm in Germany and the trip home .

 This is the first shelf bra I 've ever worn/owned . I ordered this for the boyfriend , and he was more than pleased . I 'm a B cup and this gave me support , and it was comfortable - two things that I was n't expecting .
 Fits perfectTrue to sizeGood qualityHusband loves it . . says it 's very sexyWould recommend to anyoneWorth the money
 Muat Have !! This give me great support and a great look , I would recommend this to a friend.My husband loves it as well
 Product labeled on Amazon as plus size but it is available in all sized . I bought a 34 and it is a perfect fit . The bra supports a C cup well but stops just below the nipples leaving them free to peek out and interact with their natural environment . Honestly this is a great bra . It 's pretty , comfortable , well made and can be worn everyday . I love it .

 This is a good polo shirt overall , good quality and design , the size is a little big though .
 I found these shorts -LRB- 2 pair -RRB- to be better than expected . The product quality was good and the delivery was prompt . If you are looking for a good `` everyday '' pair of shorts at a good price , I do n't think you 'll be disappointed .
 I wear these all the time to work around the house , great , heavy material , all cotton shorts , longer legs than most which I appreciate since I am 6 ' 3 '' . Will definitely buy again . The review needs twenty words , so here 's a few more ...
 Finding these cotton thin mens ' shorts are difficult - they are the only ones my husband will wear . Their year-round cotton comfort and roomy legs and waist is what he wants . He likes the pockets and the drawstring waist too .
 This short is a very comfortable lightweight cotton short that has large pockets and a comfortable long length .
 I HAVE BEEN USING THESE FOR YEARS . THE SHORTS ARE HEAVY DUTY . THEY ARE NOT GLAMOROUS OR HAVE A FANCY LOGO .
 I purchased 3 pairs and washed them before ordering more . The fit is true to size after washing , a big plus for 100 % cotton , I like the feel of the fabric . Living in the South , I wanted something light weight , and the pockets are a good size . The inseam is the perfect height and comes above the knee , not to short .
 Recognizable manufacturer of athletic wear is a plus . These shorts are made of lightweight cotton jersey material , perhaps a bit lighter than some other athletic shorts -- as such , uncertain as to how long these will wear , but ca n't complain because of low pricing . Good proportions and fit . Was also pleased with Amazon 's wider choice of available colors -LSB- i.e. , other than Navy or grey -RSB- for this item . Was able to enjoy no tax or shipping charges with Amazon .
 Ordered these for a Christmas present . I 'll wait to see if husband likes them , I 'm sure he will ... stay tuned ! I 'll come back and let you know if husband liked these for holiday .
 Great shorts , very comfortable for joging , fits nicely on the body , highly recommendedanyone who buys it will enjoy them .
 I have two older pair of the same product . They seem more sturdy , but be ones are good . I would buy again .
 A gret pair of shorts for the gym , comfortable and they survive the washing and drying well.My fingers are crossed that they last well !
 Product was as described and advertise arrive on time or within the promise arrival time , totally satisfied with my purchase , Price was good
 4 instead of 5 stars only because it shrinks -LRB- in length -RRB- after a run through the dryer . No other complaints .
 I like them because of the longer length in the legs , the lighter weight material and the pockets . BTW , I am a woman and find these so comfortableto wear around the house and am not the athletic type at all .
 I wanted something comfortable at a good price and thats what I got with these Russell shorts . The comfort of cotton at less than half the cost of similar items .
 I 've ordered 4 or 5 pairs in different colors for my husband who 's in a rehab facility after pneumonia and other things . He 's wearing these in lieu of hospital pajamas , and looks presentable in these . Easy for him to get on and off , they have pockets and fit him well , Great price , great buy .
 Item exactly as described . True to size . Good quality fabric.Side pockets are nice feature . My son likes this very much .
 this is exactly what I wanted . my husband doesnt like mesh . the fit is true to size . was received quickly .
 I 've been wearing Russell shorts for years and through many , many waist sizes.They last a long time , are very comfortable , and look good on you , even when or if you turn into a tubby like I 've become , but thankfully they have a size that fits even me .
 Muy buenos para salir a caminar , son ligeros y buena calidad , ideales tambien para el gimnasio o para simplemente usarlos en casa .
 The shorts were supposed to be a Christmas pres4ent for my husband but they were so great and fit him so well , he jumped into one immediately ! Great product , it arrived on time and we are very pleased with the transaction .
 Was happy to find.my husband likes these and they are hard to find . most athletic shorts are shiny and he does n't like them .
 These shorts were an excellent buy . $ 11.00 and free shipping . I only ordered one pair because the price was so low . I thought they might be poor quality . These are great shorts with `` POCKETS '' . Shorts without pockets are useless for me . The material is soft , light and breathable . I 'm gon na order 5 more before the price goes up .
 For the price , I think that these shorts are great . I love the material , the size , and the pockets . I see no reason why others would rate these shorts anything less than five , or at least four , stars . These currently are my favorite shorts , but there 's a chance it could be because they 're new . I will probably be buying more of the other colors , if it concerns you , I bought the Oxford Grey .
 I have used these shorts several different times over a 10 year period . They are used in a sports chiropractic office .
 I 'm a dedicated wearer of Russell sweat pants , so I figured that , with Summer just around the corner , I 'd invest in some shorts . I was also curious to see if Russell could gets the shorts to me as quickly as I remember receiving the sweats . I do n't know if I remember getting the sweats in three days , because that 's how long it took for my shorts to arrive . I ca n't stress the importance of knowing that , if I might need a pair in graphite , I will get them in lighting time . Sometimes , the shipping time makes all the difference when considering reordering . This is my sixth online order from Russell , and the main reason is the product ; but getting that product so quickly keeps me coming back for more . Thanks , Russell . Great job !
 I ordered Black , Navy and Graphite , all the same size . The Graphite was 50 % polyester & 50 % cotton , and smaller than the others , even though it was the same XL size -LRB- the description says the color Oxford is 58/42 poly/cotton , but Graphite is supposed to be 100 % cotton -RRB- . I returned it and got another Graphite , which was also 50/50 poly/cotton , but it was the right size -LRB- made in El Salvador , whereas the smaller one was made in Pakistan -RRB- . I guess you take your chances on getting the right size and material . Otherwise , these are good , comfortable shorts .
 My mother bought me these shorts when I was 14 years old for tryouts in high school . I wore these shorts repeatedly all the time to all my competition games and running outdoor . I 'm now 22 years old and I still wear them along with two extra shorts I bought from Amazon upon finding out they still sell them.Eight years and they still fit and feel great , except for the fade between these old ones and the new ones I just purchased.I love the material and its so soft , I may as well wear these for the rest of my life and they 'd still feel great !
 Just the right fit , the husband enjoys wearing them , I enjoying buying something that he enjoys wearing . Sized perfectly year after year . Thank .
 Ordered these for my husband after a knee surgery . The size was a little to large , but did not have any problems returning for the correct size . Seems to be good quality fabric , and were comfortable .
 Has pockets -- convenient . I like Russell Athletic Products . I have used them for several years worth of exercise in my quest to fight the battle of the bulge .
 With these shorts , you definitely get your money 's worth . They are extremely comfortable all-cotton shorts that are prefect for relaxing around the house or wearing to bed -LRB- I use them as pajama shorts too -RRB- . Durable enough to machine wash and dry . They come with a drawstring that helps ensure a good fit around the waist . Sure , there are higher quality shorts out there ... but not at this price point .
 I have always liked Russell shorts and sweatpants . These are great . They replaced another pair of Russell shorts that I finally wore out after many years of constant wear .
 These were just ok for the price . Fit was right . Stitching looks good . Nothing great , but no complaints . I would buy again because to shop at Target or Walmart would cost just as much
 I have purchased Russell Athletic shorts before . They are quality products . As with other Amazon purchases , the price is right and the shipping is punctual . The only thing that would improve the shorts would be better / stronger elastic in the waist . If you load up the pockets , they sag a little .
 these shorts are well made and last a really long time . My husband has about 10 pairs and they last for years . Great price , too . would highly recommend .
 These are VERY nice . Not sure what the people are wanting in fabric thickness and quality ... these are great quality and a nice medium fabric perfect for exercise shorts . The pocket is hard to find and very much a welcome addition ! Very comfortable . They do seem to run a bit large ... I read the reviews and got a medium and it fits perfectly . -LRB- Normally take a large -RRB- I 'll buy more . -LRB- I 'd never rate down for a size running smaller or larger in clothing ... that 's common . -RRB- Nancy
 My husband likes the deep pockets and wears these shorts when he exercises at the gym . He has liked the Russell brand for years .
 Seems to me these are sized a tad large . No big deal as you can use the drawstring , but it slips pretty easily under normal shoelace type knot . Material is very light , not bad .
 My husband had a pair of these that had holes everywhere but would n't give them up because they were his favorite shorts -LRB- like and old pair of shoes -RRB- . He likes them because they are soft , comfortable , and do n't fade when washed . They are very durable and wear a long time .
 Exelent product!For all kind of weatherconfortabledurable !! I wear everyday to
 These are nice shorts but sizes run much much much bigger than you 'd expect . I usually wear size large for my gym shorts so I went ahead with a large for these too . Nope . I was swimming in these shorts , I pulled the drawstring as tight as I could and I still felt like they were going to fall down just from walking around . I do n't know if the ones I got were XLs that got mistagged or what -LRB- they were indeed tagged L -RRB- . I like the shorts otherwise and am going to reorder in medium , if you go with these make sure to choose one size smaller than you usually wear or you 'll be spending most of your workout holding your shorts up !
 Good deal . These fit well and the pockets are nice and deep . I would recommend if you are in need of some cheap shorts with pockets .
 I ordered 3 pairs of these . I did not need anything heavy to run in , and I did n't want running shorts that were too short , and these were perfect . Great for running in and working around the house .
 Sized rather on larger size . Originally ordered an x-large and had to downsize to a large . Other than the sizing issues they 're great shorts .
 It is hard to find a pair of shorts with just the right length for my son , but these definitely fit the bill . Easy on the wallet , durable , wash very well , and are comfortable . Highly recommend .
 These were a little rough when first worn but they softened nicely after a few washes . I walk the dog everyday in mosquito infested Houston , this shorts are nice because they let the air flow due to the wide leg and the pockets are nice for the phone and the bag for doggie do !
 They 're NOT sweat pants , they 're shorts made with a thick cotton . I purchased 2 . I love them . I 'll be buying more .
 I love these because they have pockets to hold my music player . I 've been wearing them for years and they tend to last a couple years before wearing . When I got them , however , one of them had a hole in the pocket . That was a first .
 Good price , fast service , and the pair I had before were realy used up . I think they went to the washing machine at least 500 times before it showed some wear and tear . I play basketball and I run . They are good for both .
 I owned a pair of the graphite -LRB- well I think that 's what it started out as -RRB- shorts . The were made in Mexico and were great . So ... I decide to buy 2 of these . One in graphite , the other in black.The graphite is a cotton/polyester blend which makes for a softer , more comfortable feel . The black is 100 % cotton and it 's not a soft cotton.Although the quality is good , I think Russell should go back to what made them a good company in the first place . They should ensure their product -LRB- same model -RRB- is made in the same place and of the same material .
 Quality very good for inexpensice gym clothes , but the shorts are cut large . Instead of XL an L would have been better for my 38 in waist . .
 I love these shorts and have a pair on right now . I will be buying more and soon . bye bye .
 Nice and lightweight . I got the black in a 3X -LRB- I like loose fitting clothes -RRB- . They will be nice for Spring and Summer but rather thin for the colder months . I do wish the inner drawsting was 2 ties that you could tie together like shoelaces instead of a loop . I would purchase these again . The Soffee brand was heavier -LRB- and pretty good all around -RRB- but , could not get it in a 3 X. Really should just loose the weight !!!
 Great product especially for the price . The quality of the shorts was better than expected . . Arrived as promised too . Overall experience 5 stars !!!
 I wait a while to review clothing items . This was bought several months ago and worn several times.I look for good fit , waist band that does not pinch the heck out of my belly and lasts through wear and tear . This pair of pants hit all the marks very well . Good job.I like Russell , and bought several other Russell items . Will look for their products again
 Have purchased this brand before so it was no surprise in what I was getting . Fit , feel and price were all good .
 These shorts are a great value and quality . Great service thanks and would like to order . More pairs in different . Colors
 I ordered XXL and they are HUGE !!! I 'm wondering if I should have ordered XL . They have been shrinking when I wash them and run them through the dryer , so they 're getting closer to the right size . I love the way these shorts are made -- soft , sturdy cotton , side pockets , and with the covered waist band elastic . This is my favorite style !
 I 've seldom ordered a product that was far too large as these are . They are marked the size I ordered but could easily fit someone several sizes larger . Whether this applies through all sizes or whether I simply received an `` accident '' I can not know . In all other ways they 're the usual quality for which Russell is justly known .
 These shorts were almost exactly what I was looking for ; however , they were not as thick material as I was expecting . I had purchased a pair of shorts like these before at a store -- same brand , size , color -- these were n't as thick as those ones . Otherwise , they are good for working out , do n't shrink in the wash , and have pockets .
 This is a quality pair of gym shorts which will stand the test of time . They are sturdy , comfortable , and almost exactly what you would expect . I am very pleased with the product , and will be ordering more .
 Wear them all the time . Lightweight , cool , comfortable and very flexible . These are a bit longer in the leg which really suits today 's style . Will be buying more .
 These Russell shorts are the best ever . I wear them everyday and everywhere . They are so comfortable and do not make you feel hot like other shorts do . They remind me of the gym shorts that I wore in high school . I highly recommend them as I already have six of them . I have them all in graphite color . I hope Russell keeps on making these high quality shorts because they are the only ones that I will wear .
 Bought these for a guy who only wears 100 % cotton shorts . He says `` they do the job '' but wishes they were a bit longer -LRB- he 's 6 ' 5 '' -RRB- .
 I ordered these for my husband 's work outs . I found that I like wearing them too . Great product , comfortable fit
 the shorts were well made the fact that they made pockets was the selling points , well worth the money , would definately tell someone ofd the good deal for the money
 I bought this in a 44G in Blush . It is simply the most beautiful and best fitting bra I have ever owned . Unfortunately it is discontinued by Le Mystere .
 Hanes is an excellent product , but there is a descrepancy between the description and what 's actually included . Once you place this item in your `` cart '' it says it contains 3 pairs . In fact there is only one pair . The price for one pair is comparable , so I kept them , not to mention they 're hard to find in certain sizes , and especially in white .

 My husband bought one of these shirts last year to try it out . I was very skeptical of the `` no ironing '' claim . I could n't believe my eyes when I took it out of the dryer the first time -- not a wrinkle to be seen . The material is truly miraculous . We both love this product and plan to buy more . Thank you , Jos. Banks !
 I own three of these shirts and they are great . I get my shirts cleaned and pressed and here is an example of what great shirts they are
 I own two of these Traveler non-wrinkle shirts and they are absolutely the best shirts I have ever owned . They are of high quality material and the size I bought was right on the money . The colors offered are very versatile with just about anything a person would own and can be worn formally or casually . I am going to stick with buying more of these shirts .
 I bought 2 to begin with and now own seven and I ca n't see myself buying other dress shirts
 I received this shirt as a gift over Christmas . Since then I have bought two more . The fit is outstanding and I have never felt a finer material in a dress shirt - it is soft yet sturdy and always appears pressed . The iron free is for real . I hate ironing and will pay the extra 20 dollars per shirt to never have to dry clean or iron again . I will never buy another shirt and I almost want to throw away my non-iron free dress shirts . I highly recommend this shirt . You will enjoy it and probably buy more of them .
 These dress shirts are the best ! Wrinkle-Free , Breathable , Durable Material , Plus lots of styles , sizes and color options . Compare side-by-side to other dress shirts and you 'll see and feel the difference .

 These dress shirts are the best ! Wrinkle-Free , Breathable , Durable Material , Plus lots of styles , sizes and color options . Compare side-by-side to other dress shirts and you 'll see and feel the difference .
 My husband loves these . They wash well and keep him very warm when he is working outside . He says they are also very comfortable .
 These do a great job adding an extra layer of warmth in the cold winter months . The material , however , tends to get a lot of ` snags ' in it as time passes .
 I got these to keep me warm in my desk job . I think the polypro are warmer , but these are less bulky and much more comfortable . Another huge plus is these do n't generate nearly the static that the poly ones did , so my pants do n't turn into shrink wrap.Length for the indicated waist size was good . I 'm tall and skinny , and they still fit snug without being capri length.They seem to be good for general comfort as a base layer . For long walks in the winter in business clothes , the edge still goes to poly or wool liners . But then again , I 'm also cold about 70 % of the year .
 I loved the tie . It 's also great for the price . I wish you had more colors in this size . I would definitely order them .
 If you are looking for an affordable ultra thin tie , then this is your tie ! They have a satin sheen , so my son loved that . He 's in a rock band and loves the clean lines and narrow width . They came immediately and were packed with covers so that they are completely without wrinkles and ready to wear ! Kudos !
 First off , a tie this skinny is not going to have a loop on the back because the tongue is basically the same width as the other end of the tie . A tie clip or pin are a good idea , or just let it hang out . Whatever you think goes with the style you 're going for . It 's slick without being super shiny , but not matte either.Note
 Great skinny tie but missing strip in the back to hold the tie in place .
 Thin and easy to improve a look for some casual outing . If only I could remember where I took it off that night ...
 This tie was pretty nice for the price . Really skinny ties that do n't have a strange pattern are kind of hard to find . This tie is classy-looking .
 You do n't need a brand name skinny tie with this product . The material is shinny just enough to make it look nice , and not like a cheap tie
 My son is only 2 1/2 but he adores this costume . It is a little tricky with him still in diapers since the costume is a 1 piece . Everyone we saw adored him and remembered him days/weeks later . My son pretends to be the mailman and give mail to everyone . He felt very important like a real mailman . All pieces are sturdy and tough for a boy playing .
 This is one of the most comfortable jockstraps that I have worn . Not only is it all cotton but it looks really good on me . I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a jockstrap that is comfortable and looks good . this is one of those jockstraps that you would want to wake up with and see yourself in the mirror . This is definately worth the money .
 this is my first jockstrap and i love it , feels great looks great . makes me realize what i 've been missing out on . great purchase i highly recommend
 I wore one in High School gym class , 35 years ago . I needed one for a surgical procedure I was having -LRB- yep -RRB- and purchased this item from Amazon . I seem to remember that when I was a kid playing little league baseball every store in town sold these , for about a buck fifty . Since the good old USA has given up on Physical Fitness in schools , I guess there is n't much of a market for jock straps any longer -LRB- or any shorter , for that matter -LRB- batta-bing ! -RRB- -RRB- . Anyhow , this particular item worked fine . Held up the merchandise like a champ . No complaints . Wore it once -LRB- on the trip home from the doctor 's office -RRB- and now it 's going on Ebay . Any bidders ?

 made a nice birthday present . hubby really liked it :-RRB- it was on sale so that was nice :-RRB- : -RRB-
 Good quality product . Great service , ordered from UK and arrived well within alloted time scale from USA . Very simple straightforward transaction .

 Hanes is an excellent product , but there is a descrepancy between the description and what 's actually included . Once you place this item in your `` cart '' it says it contains 3 pairs . In fact there is only one pair . The price for one pair is comparable , so I kept them , not to mention they 're hard to find in certain sizes , and especially in white .
 These shorts are great . I ordered one in every color during the Friday sale for $ 14.99 each . They 're quite versatile . They 're swim shorts with an inner mesh liner , are very comfortable , and look quite nice to wear to go to the stores .
 This is not a basket short or soccer short , NO !!!! it 's a very very nice beach short or just to sunnys day specialy in my country ... With hot beaches all year , and beatyfull shopping mall near you can use this shorts for both activities . . That 's why i bought it and do n't mess the shopping
 Awesome looking shirt , i get lots of compliments when i wear it . I have had mine for over a year now . It has shrunk a little , and i advise you to let it air dry . Fabric quality is a little iffy , but overall still a good product
 I chose this rating because the vest is exactly what I wanted!It is light-weight in feel yet keeps me warm when I need it !
 Gave this to my sister-in-law for CHristmas present . She loves it . Nice and soft , good fit . Washes up well too .
 I love my Columbia Fern Creek vest , light weightt , but warm , be perfect in the spring , Fit is perfect , true to size .
 Its not sexy but its warm and classic . Have n't washed it yet but its big enough in a small to shrink and still be ok .
 This was a gift for my running partner . She found it warm enough for cold weather runs and liked the fit and softness .
 This vest is well made and very warm . I only wish it had inside pockets . It is a good fit too .
 I got this vest for my 90-year old Mom . It 's soft and a pretty pink , but most of all it keeps her nice and warm .
 This vest is all it said it would be . Super soft , warm , and figure flattering . The length is long enough to cover the `` back side '' gaps . Great quality and style .
 Love the this color great wt to wear every day.Washed a few time inside out sill looking good .
 This is my third Columbia vest . loves them , the fit is good , everything about them . I had been looking for a pink vest and when I saw it , yes , a pink one . Sad to say it is not a true pink . I will keep it but it wo n't be my favorite one to wear .
 I love my Fern Creek vest ! I wear it all the time , around the house , to take my daughter to school and to work . It is one of my most favorite articles of clothing .
 Just what I wanted . I wanted a vest that had a little room at the hips so it just hangs instead of being bunched up when zipped ! This is as described . Plus , it 's Columbia . Good quality . Good looking casual , warming vest .
 Love the vest . It is perfect for all casual fall/winter outfits . Nice fit and well made . It 's a perfect addition to my `` vest '' wardrobe .
 I bought this vest for my Mom . I ordered it in Pink grapefruit , but the vendor contacted me saying they had it only in dark blue which was a beautiful , rich color . My Mom loved it , the fit was perfect for her , and she really liked the zippered pockets for carrying her wallet securely . The fleece is soft and thick , and it looked very attractive on her . A good buy for the price .
 Nice fleece vest . I ordered it for my girlfriend . She seems to like it . And it looks great and seems like it 's a pretty good quality fleece vest
 I have had wanted one of these for a long time but I found them to be to expensive . Then I found this on amazon for the right price . I love it .
 I have ordered this vest for myself in a couple of different colors . It is so comfortable I wear it all the time.I also ordered one for my granddaughter . I would recommend this item.Thanks you .
 I do like it , the corset part is not really a corset , it 's like felt and kind of hangs loose even when you tie the ribbons . I decided to keep it anyways .
 As a college student , before buying a backpack I researched around . I looked around at many different styles and decided on this one . I love it ! It is very spacious , without being too big .
 I purchased this backpack to coordinate with my carry on suitcase used during a recent trip . This backpack worked out great on the airplane . I was able to separate my magazines and other reading material from my snacks and sweatshirt . The bag also has a water bottle holder which is of course a necessity when traveling . I will also use the backpack for school -LRB- finishing up my Bachelors degree -RRB- as well . Just to say , I love it !
 some thread endings are coming off . . but otherwise it 's a great product . totally worth its price !
 This JanSport is a nice change for a guy who always uses black backpacks . The quality is excellent -- durable and beautifully made . This pack is good and sturdy for books . The color is sharp -- navy with gray trim , so it is easy to separate from other packs my son uses for sports . He is very hard on backpacks and still had the last JanSport for years.Another plus on Amazon , most of these are free shipping with Amazon Prime , and some of the colors are lower prices . We saved over $ 25 on this from the retail price we had seen locally . Two thumbs up from our house !
 It holds my computer Nicely . Just to let you know , if there is n't anything in the bag , or if it 's really light -LRB- which I would n't imagine happening too often -RRB- , the straps at the back of the neck might be are not too bad . But this is a total aside since the truth of it is that this bag is great ! I got the red backpack knowing it would be a bright color . And it 's such a great color . I love it . There are great deep pockets all about just when you need to find them . People tell me how great my bag is and ask where I got it . There 's room enough in this bag for a short weekend trip or to use as a school/college bag .
 This is everything I could ever want from a backpack . I love JanSport . My first backpack lasted more than 10 years and I wanted a new style . I 'm a junior in college and this backpack does n't draw attention to itself , but it 's very stylish for what it is . The simplicity of the pockets really works for me . There is a small pocket on the top that is made for CD players , but it 's perfect to put my phone , chapstick , some money , and my iPod in . The shoulder straps are great . Not overly padded , but balance the weight well . After doing extensive research on different backpacks , I 'm incredibly satisfied with this purchase and would recommend it to any student , or anyone else who needs a backpack !
 I bought this as it was small , but big enough to use everyday . I have taken it biking and it is just fine . The small pencil pouch at the top is immensly useful . The construction and quality seem to be fine , but I have only had it for a month or so . Not much else can be said for a backpack.Summary
 I use it everyday for school , i can carry many things such as textbook and notebook . Anyway , the straps is very comfortable , you wo n't feel too heavey when you carry too many staff .
 This backpack is perfect ! You absolutely get more of your money 's worth considering that I got it for less than the regular price .
 Thank you for an on the money description of this backpack , not only a great deal , but my son 14 loves it and that is exceptional in itself !! Kids today are very picky and fashion concious , this was great , mailing was fast also , Thank you !!
 I freakin ' love my backpack ! I use it all the time and it 's so cute ! I look kinda weird with it since I 'm so small , but I love it anyways ! And today I was caught in a rainstorm and it kept allllllll of my things dry ! I love you Jansport Wasabi Backback in Pure Purple/Optimus Grey !!!!!!!!!!!!!! 1
 I bought this backpack for college and love it . The main compartment is huge and holds a ton . I love the MP3 zipper compartment on the top , and the two `` smaller '' compartments as well . I do wish there were more holders or slots for holding pens etc. but I 'll get by . Would highly recommend this item .
 It 's great . All my school stuff fits in here I shall be using it as a carry on as well when I go back home to Texas for spring break .
 I had ordered the backpack previously and loved it ! its durable and I can put a lot in it . My boyfriend liked my backpack so i suggested he buy one and he did ! he loves it and takes it EVERYWHERE ! and now I think it 's cute that we have matching backpacks ! : -RRB-
 This backpack is awesome nice and it fulfill my needs , and the price was nice to . The best part is the waterproof it protects my books .
 I purchased this backpack for my 8th grade son . It has more than enough room to carry all of his books , binders and lunch every day . He likes the small pocket on top to carry his I-pod and cell phone . He 's been using it for about 2 months now and it seems to be sturdy . But I have to admit that the material seems rather thin for long term use . Only time will tell on this one .
 Very well made little book bag . The color of the bag is exactly as pictured . I would definitely recommend it to a friend .
 I have used Jansport backpacks for 20 plus years , this backpack -LRB- wasabi -RRB- is a very good buy . Great pockets for the water bottle , headset and books . My son is very pleased . I would purchase this again .
 For the price , this is exactly what I wanted and needed . It is super comfortable and has just enough pockets for my computer , headphones , water and books .
 Good and exactly like the description . I just feel like the straps keep on moving around , or the backpack is crooked .
 I really like this backpack a little bit bigger than i expected but still satisfied .
 First of all I am a big fan of Jansport . I had one for forever and it finally bit the dust , and hard . I had already patched it a few times , but once there is n't a zipper one must move on . This backpack was exactly what I expected . Its light , so if you have had the pleasure of carrying a heavy bag -LRB- when empty -RRB- for a while then you will appreciate this . Its already starting to conform . I do n't like the super stiff bags I want them to be squishable and this one is . I did n't know about the shoulder pads at first but I 'm a fan now . They are nice and displace the weight pretty well . Overall I 'm a fan and would highly recommend this for anyone .
 I was a little disappointed that there was less storage than my last backpack , but i like the way it looks and it feels alright , but it works as needed .
 The best backpacks ever ! And they are warrantied to last . Wo n't buy any other brand .
 It was my first semester in College , well only this summer . The backpack is great in all aspect . well if i 'd say the negative , it would be the straps , kinda too bad . but it 's ok still .
 I love this bag . It is the right size and not over the top with the pockets . The audio player pocket is not too ergonomic but this is a small minor problem compared to pros of the bag . When i went to school the next day i noticed that 3 other classmates have the same bag in different colors . Now i wish i had gotten the navy one . Everyone was in agreement . They each love the bag .
 Great backpack for work . lots of room and very durable . The material isvery heavy and will hold up for years .
 I bought this to take on a trip abroad which included daily use , hiking , and luggage carry-on . It worked great for all applications . It 's very comfortable , even with heavy loads , and has so many pockets I ca n't remember where I put everything ! It held up great too . I really like the small pocket for MP3 player at the top , and the mesh on the side for a water bottle . I used both of these a lot !
 The backpack is very nice and seems to be resistant . I tought it was completely black , because I could n't see the back side of the product in the picture.The only bad thing , is that it was sent in a huge box , and as I live outside the U.S. the shipping cost increased significantly , even more expensive than the product itself
 I 've purchased the Wasabi backpack for a two weeks trip around the United States . The backpack is great , lots of storage , nice and cool design , and it is made to last . If you 're putting too much weight on it and carry the bag for along time , you 'll start having a pain in the your shoulders though , due to the curved design of the straps . But overall , I am satisfied with this backpack .
 The backpack , first of all , is very comfortable , it distributes the weight of the load just about perfectly . I carry 2 15 '' MacBook Pros to work about twice a week and I do n't even feel the weight , just the slight pull on my shoulders . And the straps are padded nicely to help with that pesky gravitational pull . Each pocketed section is rather spacious as well . I give this backpack a perfect score for my needs .
 I 'm changing my review
 This is a very comfortable and roomy backpack . It is not heavy and has plenty of storage and a clean look to it . Easily worth the purchase !
 Just too good . Simple and yet handy bag pack . Require number of compartments . Side pocket for water bottle . This does not have padding for laptop and a padded base which can support food container straight . However , rest of the features are very good .
 I bought this to carry around a few things when i have to walk . Its nice comfortable backpack that holds pretty much all my stuff . My only complaint is that it does n't have a laptop sleeve but otherwise its perfect . Great for using on a day trip . It holds up pretty well even though i have dumped a lot of stuff into it at times .
 This bookbag is nothing short of amazing . Bought one for my sophomore year of high school and lasted me until summer of my senior year ! I used and abused this bookbag by carrying daily loads of 3 large textbooks at a time , sometimes more if I could n't make it to my locker and it finally tore a hole in the seam after 3 years . I like having the waterbottle holder , pockets for a phone , ipod , pens , pencils , a lanyard to put my car keys on and it has SO MUCH ROOM . I can fit my 15.6 '' laptop in the main compartment with room left over for books . I 'm buying a new one for college , I 'm positive it will last me until I graduate .
 This is a cool bag , serves my purpose well and is stylish . The bag would be too big to carry small items though . It serves the purpose of an average user well .

 I bought this tank almost 5 years ago and wear it religiously throughout the year . It is still in prime shape . It cools me in the summer and gives me a good base in the winter . It is slightly see through , so I would recommend wearing a thin sportsbra underneath if you will be in public . -LRB- It has a built-in one so you will be double protected ! -RRB-
 I love this style , in fact I prefer it over the usual UA fabric . Its a great layer for cycling but it is not supportive enough for any impact sports . Good for cycling , rowing , spinning and for a warm stylish layer . -LRB- not for B 's and above -RRB- Us small breasted women do great in this . Its flattering .

 I got it on size 32 because I usually get my pants on size 32 . The bathing suit was too tight . I 'll get in on size 34 next time .
 This suit is exactly what I ordered -- small enough for training/racing but not as small as a `` traditional '' Speedo suit .
 Hey they work for me . Shipping was timely and they have n't fallen off yet . What more do u need in a training suit ?

 This is a heavy/thick robe , I expect it would fit a man 6 ' tall perfectly . I am 5 ' 8 '' and the sleeves are only slightly to long but , I do n't even notice now . The comfort level is amazing , this is so incredibly soft and warm you will put it on as soon as you get home and take it off when you go to bed . I cant speak on durability as I 've only had it for a month or so but , you most likely will not be dissapointed with the feel . I got the brown color and I love it , I feel like grisly adams in this thing ...
 Received this as Christmas present from my son and it is the most wonderful robe I have every had . It is so light weight , but warm and the softness is just great . Good choice for a bath robe
 I received this bathrobe for my birthday last year . -LRB- I had placed it on my wishlist . -RRB- Warm and absorbent , the robe 's soft cotton cuddles a wet , showered body . Its touch is sensuous.So why only four stars ? I washed it . The softness remains , but its out-of-the-box appearance is diminished through -LRB- minor -RRB- pilling . Heavier , more absorbent robes can be bought for not much more money , but those are not this soft .
 I bought this for my husband and am so impressed . Nice and thick , and incredibly soft and huggable . I have not seen anything nicer when looking in department stores . The attention to detail that went into the packaging was also a complete and welcome surprise . Sturdy shipping box , and the inside was packaged nicely enough to present as a gift with no wrapping really required . There was even a hand-written thank you note included . I am more than satisfied .
 I 'm about 5 ' 10 '' and 210lbs . This fits well and it is heavy , warm and comfortable . I enjoy the solid feel of it . I washed it once and it handled that well ... Careful ! Wearing this may put you to sleep on the recliner .
 Was looking for a substantial robe that was not white . I drink coffee in the morning so I ordered it in `` Espresso '' . Had never dealt with them before and the robe seemed a bit expensive but Im not averse to spending a little more for quality . Be advised this robe is heavy and very warm , I 'd almost say too warm if thats possible.This robe is excellent and the service was above and beyond . Exactly as advertised , arrived gift wrapped without being asked or charged more . Good gift , good product good service .
 The megasoft bathrobe is pretty soft and thick relative to other bathrobes . It has a nice feel to it . The bathrobe is made of Japanese yarn and the yarn is made of cotton so the bathrobe is made of 100 % cotton . Cotton of course strinks in the wash but the strinkage is tolerable . I purchased the expresso color and after a few washes the color faded but that is to expected . Overall I am satisfied with this purchase and would purchase it over again if I had the choice to do so .
 Very warm . I 'm too messy for a light tan robe . The robe came through the wash perfectly , no stains or shrinking .
 This robe does not stint on material and at first I thought it might actually be a bit too much as it weighs considerably more than the robe it replaced , but the longer I have it the more I like it.It is very thick , plush and cozy and I like that I can close it right up to my chin when I want to.I am 5 ' 9 '' and the robe accomodates me well and I am very happy with this purchase.It is rare that I like something more the longer I own it , but this is one of those instances .
 This bathrobe is extremely soft and comfortable . It 's a little bit warm but if you keep your house cold like mine it wont be a problem .
 Very nice , comfortable , high quality . Perfect directly out of shower . It does run large .
 product as advertised and excellent presentation with wrap and card . robe is wide as people mentioned and big for a small frame woman
 This was another gift . The recipient was six footand it hits just below his knees . The material is soft and very nice to the touch prior to the first washing . After a tour through the washer and dryer some of the threads got a bit fuzzy , but to my knowledge none of the actual stitching has come loose or unraveled . The color did n't blead in the wash , which was nice since the one I ordered was a dark brown . The color depicted was true to the product received and to this day it 's still his preferred robe . It was a gift back in December of 2009 . It holds up pretty well , but for the price I 'd think one might be able to find a better deal .
 We ordered two robes on Saturday . Turkishtowels called from NJ to verify monograming on Monday . And the robes were received in IL by our son and his wife on Wednesday . They love them . Ca n't ask for anything more .
 Hanes is an excellent product , but there is a descrepancy between the description and what 's actually included . Once you place this item in your `` cart '' it says it contains 3 pairs . In fact there is only one pair . The price for one pair is comparable , so I kept them , not to mention they 're hard to find in certain sizes , and especially in white .
 I own the Austin Reed dartmouth blazer in every color in which they make it -- it is a staple of my business wardrobe . Well made , quality fabric , nicely tailored , classic lines , appropriate for a professional woman . -LRB- something that can be hard to find at times -RRB- It should be noted , however , that the periwinkle and raspberry colors are lovely , but the fabric and buttons are slightly different than the `` classic '' colors -LRB- lighter -RRB- and the linings and interfacings are not as substantial as the brown , navy , camel , red and ivory . It 's still a good value , particularly as these are colors appropriate to warmer seasons and climates , but I was a bit surprised .
 Had this for about 6 months . Soft , luxurious . Only problem is that with it 's large amount of fluffy cotton , it likes to shed a bit . And will shrink in the dryer if dried on high heat.Far and away the softest robe you will ever buy . Puts every other robe to shame .
 So soft and comfortable , I feel like I 've gone to one of those exclusive spas every time I wear it . Well worth the money . Get one .

 Love them . Great price , too . Pretty color.Most of all I love Earl Jeans .
 Levis 517 Boot Cut Jeans are just as advertized . Good fit and a perfect boot cut . I highly recommend them for anyone who needs boot cut jeans .
 It 's a very good pant for my husband . Nothing too special or fancy ; he is very satisfied because he got what he expected
 execelente producto muy buena calidad , el pantalon vino en un excelente empaque y llego super rapido deverdad no tengo quejas lo recomiendo
 He looks hot in them , thanks ! What more can I say ? They did n't stay on for very long ... ca n't share any more details .
 I was somewhat hesitant to order Levi 's online but I could n't be happier with this order ! The jeans are exactly as described and fit perfectly . They are genuine Levi 's and are of the highest quality - not seconds . I ca n't recommend this seller highly enough .
 They 're good sellers and the product is very good , I like so much this jean . Ellos son muy buenos vendedores , el producto llego rapido a mis manos y era el esperado , los recomiendo ampliamente .
 I wear Levi jeans every day . Levi 's are the only jeans I will wear.I have worn Levi jeans for the past twenty -LRB- 20 -RRB- years ... or longer.Levi jeans are great ... in fact , i 'm wearin 'em right now ...
 The jeans were a Christmas gift and a style regularly worn by the recipient . They were a perfect fit . They are hard to find locally so we ordered from the Internet . The red tag on the back pocket did not say `` Levis '' and I have never seen this before . Is it significant ?
 Wow . These are great blue jeans , and they come in 38 long which is what he wears . HE wanted the boot cut , and a 34 waist was large enough . Usually he wears a 36 , , but I ordered 34 and they fit just right . Great looking , great price .
 I bought two pairs in two orders - both were perfect - exactly as I expected . On time . Good buy at a decent price .
 These jeans are tough but good looking and fit well . Amazon 's price is great , they are a good value for the money , and we always get prompt delivery and easy return if size is not right .
 the product is excellente , but needs to be taggedcorrectly , I order 34x30 tag say so , but real size was36x32 try buying them from differet source , and same thing never can get athe right size until i took a mesuring tape to the store and mesure before buing them !!
 I love those Jeans . . nice shape and denim . I ordered different colors from this pant and I love them all . it is comfortable , and have a nice leg openning that falls around the boot .
 I have been wearing 517 's for as long as I can remember . They fit perfectly and have remained unchanged for years .
 These boot cut jeans by my favorite jeans maker are exactly what I needed.When I ordered my Harley Davidson boots , I needed pants for when I wear them and these ones are the only ones that fit on the outside where others ca n't . Shopping local yields nothing like these , just junk not worth the money.Quality is what I 've come to expect from Levi 's , outstanding with fit absolutely perfect.More orders coming soon for these.Shipping was prompt , making this buyer very happy.Thank you to everyone for helping this lonely guy that hardly can get out to shop by bringing them to me.Again , THANK YOU VERY MUCH !!
 I thought these were more on the casual side , but after putting them on , they can pull off a nice look . Very comfy , one day to break in . No frays , quality zipper . Dimensions were perfect . Overall color is a shade or two darker than in the picture . Awesome , new favorite pair .
 I love being able to find the 517 's on line and not having to run all over town for the style and size I need .
 If you promise not to tell anybody , I wear lined jeans from eddie bauer or llbean when it gets cooler . I wear these when it gets warmer . True to size , do n't shrink too much .
 These were a secret gift for my brother-in-law . He keeps complaining that he must do laundry every other day because he only has one pair of work pants , but then he just will not go get more or let anyone buy him any ! So , I got the size off of the one pair of jeans he owns -LRB- laundry is at my house -RRB- and I bought several other pairs that were similarly worn . I sneak in a new pair about once a week and so far he has n't noticed that he now has three pair of work pants . When I slip in the new ones , I put them in the dirty clothes hamper he uses . I wonder if he knows his pants are multiplying yet ?
 They arived bfore time , APO adress , in Afghanistan ,1 week took it to arive here , im suprised , and they fit good , i dont hawe no words
 36 &#34; inseam jeans at a reasonable price are hard to find . I really like the fit of these jeans just wish there were other kinds in the same length .
 Just what I expected . After soaking and drying , the fit and feel was as anticipated ... just like the good , old days !!! -LRB- I would estimate that length and waist both shrunk by about one inch ... as Mama warned , some 50 years ago -RRB-
 I am happy with the jeans and how they fit , but usually when I get 517 's , they are really stiff and then I get to break them in . This pair was already like pre-washed , just differnt than what I am used to , but I still like them and will wear them . Maybe I have to look into differnt types and find exactly what I am looking for next time . Thank you
 I 've been wearing 517 's for a good , long time now , and I love 'em ! The problem is that most of my local stores that sell them -- and very few of them do -- price them highly and also drastically limit the selection compared to the more popular 501 's and 550 's . Additionally , these jeans are often skipped over when it comes to the big sales . Well , shopping for them on Amazon is a decision I should have made long ago . The price here is hard to beat.As for the jeans themselves , they are of the rugged quality that Levi 's is known for . They fit like the product photo shows
 Have had these jeans for a few weeks now & am very satisfied.The flair from the knee down is discrete and does not look like the 70 's bell-bottoms . The fit on top was precisely as marked . The length seems about 1/2 inch longer than sized on the 501 's . Was formerly utilizing 501 slim fit jeans but found that could not place them over motorcyle boots . The 501s were great for rainy rides , but look too much like a cowboy , when tucked into the boots .
 As always , good shopping at amazon.com . Its always a problem finding the right length jeans for me . I found that in this levi 517 Boot cut jean , it feels good to finally find a jean that is not too short . A fact that i would have loved to know before i bought this jeans , is the leg opening size . This jean is very tight around the thigh area . I would just like a bit more details on the product a next time round . Other than that , it always a good shopping experience on Amazon .
 The length and waist were perfect . The quality of Levi jeans was the same as they had always been , good
 I always had to keep pulling up my previous pairs of Levi 's -LRB- any model -RRB- because they only had FIVE belt loops . A key ring and cell phone are not that heavy . I remember growing up with Levi 's having SEVEN belt loops and a heavier canvas . I was pleasantly surprised to see the ` new ' Levi 's 517 now have seven belt loops again . I started to buy a different model , but they still only have the five loops.I just bought a couple of these pairs from Amazon . I did check online at Kohls and their current batch of 517 's still show 5 loops . I will have to wait until I go to the store to see if their stock has been updated . Kohls prices are higher than Amazon , but I will recheck when they go on sale . I still check Amazon first for almost all my purchases.Overall , I like my new Levi 's jeans . I will compare them with older ones to see if the canvas really is slightly thinner . Outsourcing manufacturing almost always results in poorer quality and non-standard sizing . It has 100 % results in putting Americans out of work . I try to buy American whenever I can -- hopefully it will catch on.There is another issue appearing after I washed my new jeans with my old ones . It should n't have made a difference , but the new ones are now covered with fine fluffy hairs . I will have to use a lint brush when I take them out of the dryer for now . Although it may just be a ` break in -- first washings ' issue.Overall , I rate these jeans 4 stars . I will have to wait for a few machine washings to see how the color holds up . I may be old fashioned , but buying jeans looking like they are 1/2 wore out or have holes in them is ` less than optimal ' .
 I ran around town to find my husband Levi 517 's in size 35x32 for Christmas . In the stores , there were stacks of all different sorts of Levi 's to go through . Finally I came home and ordered them through Amazon and received exactly what he wanted . These Levi 's fit perfectly and look great . Very happy they come in off size waists . Thank you for making my job easier and receiving nice fitting jeans .
 I 've grown up wearing Levi 's and in particular 517 's in my adult life . I do like that Levi has added additional belt loops in the past year or so . Over the years Levi has cut some corners in manufacturing , but not enough to discourage me from continuing to buy their stonewashed 517 's . I like the stonewashed jeans since they are ready to wear , unlike the rigid indigo Levi 's that have to be washed several times to soften them up.I am buying more and more items from Amazon for the free shipping and competitive prices . It just saves a lot of time going to a retailer only to find out they do n't have my size or what I want . Even with Amazon collecting California sales tax , I figure the time and gas saved from having to go to a retailer is well worth it .
 Very high quality . Several pairs have consistent fit . Have bought and worn these 517 boot cut jeans for several years .
 My husband LOVES these jeans . They are a GREAT FIT , especially in the seat . The legs are n't too wide in the thighs and the bootcut bottom make a terrific silhouette . I like how he looks in them and he says they are REALLY COMFORTABLE . They look best in the darker color and are a good pair of `` dress jeans '' as well as versatile . We are ordering more . Ladies , get him these jeans !
 I 've worn Levi 's for over 50 years . From the days when you had to roll up the cuffs because they only had one length to super bells in the 70 's and now my favorite 517 's . They are always true to size and the workmanship is always excellent . The service at Amazon is always great too . What more can I say , I am one satisfied customer .
 These boot cut Levis have always been my favorite jeans . I had not had any in a while , so when my order arrived I immediately tried them on . I forgot how well they fit , and they are really stylish . Awesome . Will be ordering more .
 Authentic , just as described . Fast delivery . I am very satisfied with purchase . Smooth , one stop purchase . Husband will be very happy on Christmas day ! Thank you .
 My grandson loves these jeans , since he 's rather tall we were glad to find Levi 's makes great jeans in his size . Strange as it may seem , many brands of jeans do not come in a 34in length .
 As an active equestrian rider , and a woman of 59 years , I 'm ALWAYS looking for comfortable jeans that sit at my waist -- I do n't like women 's jeans at all - the fabric in women 's jeans seems flimsy , and the low-rise , hip-hugging jeans for riding or leisure wear feels uncomfortable . The men 's Levis and men 's Lee jeans are very comfortable , and they can handle my active life -- for me , men 's Levis 517 bootcut jeans have best variety for colors , and toughest quality in fabric .
 I 've been wearing these for years.They do tend to fade easily so wash them inside out and use a detergent product for black fabrics .
 I bought these as a gift for a friend who has worn this style for years . Good quality , good fit , good style .
 Great jeans.Classical style.Low price.Wearing only jeans , levis always loved.Happy New Year!Amazon Forever!I love it .
 This hard to find style arrived on time . These classic jeans fit just the way they should . Going back for more colors .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Slim Fit Jean is leg looks like so long , . . but lap so tight but leg looks like so long . .
 My husband like it . . although I have to cut the length a little bit . . He said he may buy more in the future . . Hopefully they have shorter length then .
 They are Levis what more needs to be said ? Theyre the only jeans im buying from now on . They fit great and last 2-5 times longer than any other jeans ive bought .
 I use to wear the Levis low boot cut , but they discontinue to sell the color I want . After I give this one a try , I like it so much .
 If you know your size they fit . I do n't understand the reviews that say the sizes are wrong . Will buy again .
 was just what i expected ... very pleased with purchase . I like the fact that you can get 29 inseam . You can not get that in the store . No need to get them hemmed !
 i got two pairs for my husband . levis are the only thing that fit him right . They make him look like he has a butt !
 I like this product because it fits very well and is comfortable . I recommend it to others . Good for those who like to wear boots .
 Finally found levis that were the correct size , if they are still available I will order more in the future
 Great pants . I wish there was a size 33 by 35 . I always have a hard time with pants size . I can get a length 34 , which shrink after a wash or a 36 that drags because there too long . But there is no length 35 in pants , so I do n't have much of choice .
 Excellent product the product I come very well and it is what was waiting of , I come in time , good
 I bought they for my boyfriend who had lost a bit of weight and all his pants were falling down , but these fit and stay up -LRB- Thank God -RRB-
 My husband loves the fit and the price.Great deal.You can dress them up or down!Look no further.Great looking jean , for the price .
 Bought these jeans for my husband . They fit very well and look nice . The shipment arrived on time . I was happy with my purchase .
 Great black on black bootcut jeans . They have even gone back to adding two additional belt loops a feature that went away several years ago .
 Fits well , my husband loves them , quality control met , consistent sizing , and look good on . Will order more as needed
 My son wears a 36 Waist x 36 lenght which is very hard to find . The Levi 's Men 's 517 are about the only jeans he likes and these fit him perfectly . They were shipped very quickly and the price was excellent . They were a birthday gift and he loves them .
 The jeans were pre washed and fit just like I wanted . They were really softer than I expected . I would buy this product again .
 I was so happy with the quality and fit ; I ordered 3 more pairs ! I will be good on jeans for awhile . The price was good too .
 Great quality and a lower price , for me is like a tailored jean , I 'm happy with this product . No more to say thanks to all
 After numerous failed attempts at the 527 's on amazon I finally got a clue and got these jeans . They are PERFECT ... great fit ... weight ... etc. ... just like the jeans I wore in high school 20 years ago ... . I 'm already thinking about a second pair . The light rancher is the perfect color ... . As for the 527 's MADE IN BANGLADESH ... amazing they could ever bear the levis name ... perhaps they were counterfeit . Thanks amazon for my true and needed exchange . The original pair of jeans I ordered ... yes the 527 ... was complete trash . These 517 's are real jeans for real cowboys ... and I 'm not one ... but I do wear a ton of boots ...
 Exellent product
 Ordered these for my boyfriend , they run extremely small , he regularly wears a 32/34 had to send back and get a 36/34 . Other than that they 're great jeans .
 Finally a pair of Levi 's not only affordable , but a pair that is the real deal . . not seconds or blemished . . but cut perfectly . . The best I have bought in years . . Thanks . . and `` I 'll be back for more ''
 They fit just perfectly and I am very happy to not only get the bestdeal around but beat the sales tax . Good old Levi 's rigid , bootcut jeans have been my all-time favorite jeans my whole life , andI just turned 60 . Got 'em within a week , free shipping faster thanexpected , so that was cool , too . Amazon rules !
 The pants are great . I can not seem to find them in stores like Kohls or Target where I usually shop . I 'm not skinny as far as a skinny person goes but I have thinner legs than a lot of guys . These seem to be not as loose in the butt and thighs . I usually get the 505 's but they are cut a little bigger assuming tree trunk size legs . I have runners legs and these work . If you have big footballer legs , forget about it .
 Finally jeans that fit like the old Levis , these are the old quality heavy denim stuff not that wimpy pre-wash thin as paper junk denim . I would highly recommend these jeans to anyone who 's familiar with real Levis .
 Very easy shopping . I 'm familiar with the pants so it 's just a matter of price and convenience.Sitting at the desk for a few second beats driving to the store , finding out they do n't have the 517 in my size and driving back home . I 've always had trouble just finding the 517 at stores and shopping online sure makes things easier . The pants themselves are everything they 've always been , good fitting and tough.It 's nice to add the stonewash to my collection of darker denim so I do n't look the same every day.I was upprised how fast they came and that 's a big plus too .
 These jeans fit to size perfectly -LRB- for me -RRB- , are comfortable to wear , and have adequate material to reach a guy 's waist ... not hip-huggers . I 'll buy more of these ! Not a deal-breaker by any means but I would prefer them to not have the size label outside ... it seems Levi 's always does this .
 Amazon did not mentioned in the description that this pair of jeans is a Shrink-to-Fit fabric . No question on the quality . . it 's still an amazing jeans , the great Levi 's jeans , never goes out of style ... Take 31 '' waistline x 30 '' inseam if your size is 30 x 30 .
 Levi 's are always the best jeans around . Levi 's Boot Cut are the only kind my husband will wear . Always a good fit .
 Good quality but I wish I had done more research on the colors . Ordered rigid because of the look online however the denim itself is rigid .
 Yes , these Levi 's are everything I had hoped they would be and More . Perfect fit , and I 'm very pleased tofinally have a BLACK pair ! Amazon 's got another winner !
 My wife thinks it 's funny that I rate my jeans with numbers , but , as a former 505 's man , I now prefer the 517 's 'cause ride my horses more and were my boots more ... plus , they just , plain feel good when they 're on me ...
 Who does n't love Levis ? These are great ! My son was happy on Christmas day and so were we . Happy Holidays !
 It is great to find the exact size , color , and fit you want in a Levi 's jean , and also get it on time .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean , Medium Stonewash , 38x29They fit perfectly . Will probably order more in a couple months .
 Needed a size that few brick & mortar stores keep in stock . Amazon had style I wanted in the size that I wanted at a good price !
 These blue jeans where a great color and a perfect fit . Glad I ordered them . They were a present for my son
 My husband has been wearing Levi 's since he was a teenager . They are the most durable jeans and he loves the boot cut .
 It 's very good ! 100 % cottonThe higher rise sits comfortably at the waist.A fit you want from a brand you trustFit width & length ; !
 non common size request was delivered promply before Christmas . My son was very happy with the fit and color .
 Great product ... my dad was very pleased . He had not been able to find the 517 .
 These were a birthday gift for my son and I had them sent directly to him at college . He loved them and they fit great ! Good quality for the price . He liked the fit of the boot cut .
 These are great jeans for us gals , too , especially if you like to wear a true black color . I dress them up with a feminine camisole and heels , and have got many compliments on them .
 Exactly what my hubby wants . It 's difficult to find his size in our local stores . Very happy Amazon now has Levi 's in his size .
 I love my new bootcuts . I received them quickly , They fit perfectly . Thank you .
 I 've grown frustrated by the lack of good quality/reasonably priced jeans in the market today . At some point , the Levis brand started to suffer in terms of quality/value for the dollar . Do n't remember exactly when that happened , but I started to buy my jeans from Banana Republic . Over time , they stopped making the style I grew to rely on . This created a 7-10 stretch where I could n't seem to find a good pair of jeans . Most recently , I purchased a pair of Lucky jeans - ridiculously over priced . When those began to fail , I tried Levis again and bought these . For a third of the price of Lucky Jeans , these Levis boot-cut jeans are really nice . They have a really substantial feel/weight to them and I could n't be happier with the purchase . I was so pleased , I ended up buying a second pair .
 Finally figured out what cut and size I like , but the only place I can find them is the internet . Great pants .
 These were ordered off Amazon when I could not find them locally . I found the pants and they are describer perfectly and fit exactly as I had wanted them to . I will buy more in the future because they were perfect .
 Completamente satisfecha con el producto , exactamente igual a lo que ofrecieron . LLego en el tiempo estimado que prometieron . Ninguna queja , volveria a comprar de nuevo .
 The Levi jeans were just like I expected . The fit was perfect and received them in just a few days . Thanks !!
 The quality of the denim is lighter , so the good fit disappears by the end of the day . Otherwise , I like 'em !
 Hubby dearest was so happy to find boot cut Levi jeans at Amazon as it seems most stores have quit carrying this style of jean . He likes to wear boot cut jeans and Levi jeans are his favorite brand.No complaints about the fit or wearability either . Ordered two more pairs of jeans today as he 's a happy camper.Recommend .
 Good deal on the jeans and speedy shipping . My first pair of boot cut jeans . My girl friend really likes them on me . I got the dark blue -LRB- rinse -RRB- . Fit good and comfortable .
 My skinny son is 54 years old and will not wear any other jeans - only 517 , boot cut Levi 's so I know what to buy for Christmas and Birthdays . I found a perfect fit for my skinny husband also .
 I ordered these jeansLevi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jeanfor a Christmas gift a short time before Christmas . I knew the size . I was somewhat concerned that I would not get them on time for Christmas The package came just before Christmas , and the jeans were exactly as pictured , nicely packaged -LRB- each pair separately enclosed in plastic bag -RRB- , the right size and color . I was very pleased , as was the recipient of the gift !
 i traveled 80 miles one day looking for the jeans i like with no luck , it did make for a nice bike ride though ! then i went online looking and i found what i was looking for at amozon these jeans are hard to get in my hometown!Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut JeansWhat a nice pair of rugged jeans . And I got them so FAST !! Thanks again.Roxann Hill
 Good product , on time and as shown in Amazon.But ... years ago , ordering the same # jean and the same size always brought the exact same fit and look . Lately , the same length , for instance , some times is a bit too long -LRB- can be fixed -RRB- or a bit too short -LRB- bad news -RRB- . The price to be paid for savings by manufacturing offshore . Lets see if with the crisis we return to the memorable `` MADE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ''
 What can I say ? They are Levis . Perfect fit , excellent quality , and the most impressive thing was the price . Unbelievable !
 a la medida , tabla de medidas excelente ...
 The only problem was I had was that I had to have them hemmed 2 &#34; so as not to walk on the cuff . I would have ordered them shorter but they were not offered in the waist size I needed . The waist fit perfect and having them hemmed was not that big of a deal . It coast me $ 12.00 to have them hemmed .
 These jeans come washed so they are soft , supple and ready to wear . They are pre-shrunk so order the size you wear . I choose boot-cut jeans because I wear 12 '' - shaft western boots . Levies are the only jeans I wear because they fit well , look good , and get better with age .
 These jeans are perfect for the guy who wants to wear boots and not look like a geek or a thug . Just the right combination of loose and fitted .
 This is my first pair of Levi 517 's and I have to say I am very impressed . They sit on my natural waist -LRB- not low-rise like the 527 's -RRB- , and are fitted in the seat and thigh , and then flare out below the knee to fall on the boot . I 'm 6 ' 3 '' 190lbs and have a 36 waist and 34 inseam and it fit perfectly . Hard to find jeans these days that sit on the waist ... I 'm not a fan of the low-rise look or feel , so these jeans were a great find .
 Came to Amazon to order these jeans for my husband since no one ever has his size , 36x36 . I was pleasantly surprised because I did order two of these in different colors , Rancher Light and Rinse , both of which were the perfect colors . Perfect light colored jean and perfect dark colored jean . My husband and I are very hard to fit in jeans and tops so when something works we often get multiples , the problem however is that sometimes we buy the exact same thing in a different color and they fit totally different . Not these ! These jeans were great and the same fit ! Some people might not be able to appreciate that as much as I , but I was very grateful . It was a risk I had to take since his size is so common , but with free returns I had to take advantage . The boot leg is also very subtle but incredibly flattering . He does wear boots but of course they are n't necessary . I would say they are very true to size and great quality . They are currently his `` good jeans '' ... . that is until he `` accidentally '' wears them to go work in the garage . But when that happens , because it will , I will be back to purchase more ! By the way he is just over 6 ' 3 '' about 230-240lbs .
 Fit well at the waist and look good . Last a lot longer than most most jeans and seem to get more and more comfortable the more you wear them .
 These are great jeans , they do tend to run a little big , both on length and waist . The color was a lot more bluer then it looks in the picture , so be weary of that it . It was too country , and I needed more rock and roll , if you know what I mean.Pros
 I was a bit concerned about this purchase . My husband likes the boot cut style and that was an excellent choice for my purchase . I have zero compliants other then I wish I 'd bought more !
 they were exactly what we were looking for . the orginal 517 , these are my hubby 's most favoritie , they also hold up better than the other styles seem to
 Will have to wash several times for them to fit . I buy this size all the time from other retailers and they are n't this big . Like the color and the style . They just run big I guess . Mainly in the length . Would buy again , just a smaller size .
 The fit is nice , the color is holding up through the wash . I am glad they have different sizes then the stores . Very hard to find 33 x 36 !
 I like the way these jeans fit.The are also comfortable.The ones I have purchased previously have been durable .
 d e m a r a v i l l a e s t e m o d e l o muy bueno
 Nice one . . Boot Cut with nice fit.Ordered the Jeans with 29L but got it 3inch longer . So I had to do alteration , usually I order my pants with 29L and it fits perfect on me .
 Levis 517 's fit me better than any other jeans that I 've bought . Gon na stick with them . I wear a 38 waist , 36 inseam . Have bought several pair over the past six months from various places and they all fit the same . Good quality control !
 BASTANTE BIEN . BUENA CALIDAD DEL PANTALON . ME QUEDO MUY BIEN . TANTO EL LARGO COMO EN CINTURA . EXCELENTE COMPRA A UDS . GRACIAS .
 The jeans are a good deep color . Wish they were n't quite as thin as jean material seems to be getting , but seems they are all like that now . Overall a good pair of jeans.These are hard to find in 36x36 , so I 'm glad Amazon carries them .
 Perfect fit right out of the box . Started wearing immediately , stitches , pockets , zipper perfectly in place . Survived several washes good as new .
 Good price , perfect quality . Very good model for young and old-aged people . Gorgeous color . Classic zipper . I 'm satisfied ! I recommend to buy it .
 These jeans fit me very well and look good . One thing I noticed however is that the denim has a more coarse feeling compared to other Levi 's jeans . I would buy these again .
 IL TELL YOU I HAVE BEEN WEARING LEVI 'S FOR YEARS ON END AND THE BEST DEAL I GOT ON THESE GREAT JEANS WAS FROM MY FAVORITE STORE AMAZON
 his pants in overall line is still very good , sturdy , feels soft to the touch on the skin , the profile legendary cutting adds a touch of elegance , and even after several washings the fabric remains the same and does not shrink , the only thing I did not like the pants is that they have deteriorated the quality of the clips and metal buttons , formerly of copper and bronze , and now this are of aluminum and does not look good , however I recommend buying them are very good at the price .
 These came a little long , maybe an inch or two . Seeing as many others have noticed this is a problem with this fit , I suggest going one inseam size lower . I ordered a 30 '' and they fit more like a 31-32 '' . Other than the sizing , they are great jeans , and still look great on me . The boot cut allows the extra length to bunch up a little around the shoes , so you do n't really notice it . It actually looks good.I wish they sold these in a low rise version , as I do n't like hiking them up to where you might put dress pants or khakis . They stopped selling the 517 in a low rise though , so I 'm happy to wear them as is , great fit .
 I have always appreciated the fit and quality of Levi jeans . The boot cut has a closer fit around the knee with comfortable room in the hips and waist . What Levi Strauss needs to understand is that there is a huge population of men out there that has a 31 inch inseam . Men between 5 ' 9 &#34; and 6 ' fall into this size range . My growth did not stop at 30 &#34; inseam , and did not make it to 32 &#34; . So I either buy high water jeans that show my socks , or I let the cuffs drag the floor which signicantly reduces the life of the jeans . I liked the fit enough that I spent an additional $ 10 to get them hemmed to 31 .
 product arrived as expected on time , the product was as expected and the quality was as you 'd expect to find in a brick & mortar store .
 Great fitting . I usually buy the 527 style but they did n't have black in that style . Ordered a 517 instead and love the fitting .
 The fit and look are great and I saved a few dollars . Will purchase more when the price is right
 love this jeans , the fabric is really good and the cut is impecable . it is original and the communication was really easy , i recieved really fast .
 These are the first jeans in a while that actually fit my waist size , inseam and the leg openings are perfect .
 These jeans fit well but the denim seems less hefty than the denim of the same 517s from 5 years ago .
 I received my pants very quickly . I was concerned that my size would be too short for boots . I was pleasantly surprised that the designer was thoughtful about the shape and length for this item &#34; after &#34; several washings . Pants are about 1/2 inch longer than the average pants which make them perfect for cowboy boots . Pants are also very comfortable . JCD
 Noticed that they even have an extra pair of belt loops compared to my previous order . They are sturdy & dependable .
 The jeans were great ! The price was right , they were delivered in a timely fashion , and I lost a few lbs to get in them and I look good . lol . I recommend this company .
 These are the only jeans my son likes . He is tall and I have trouble finding his size in local stores and I could not find a better price .
 The jean came very quickly . They were the proper color , size , and cut . The packaging was excellent , and so was the quality of the jeans .
 Perfect price and fit for my husband . I would recommend this jean to any &#34; baby boomer &#34; who loves boot cut jeans.The jean has not changed at all good quality material and the right color . Thank you .
 This pair of Levi 's fits perfectly and the indigo color is the same as the Levi 's I wore back in the day !
 I gave these Jeans to my daughter 's friend for Christmas and he really likes them.He is real thin and wears motorcycle boots.He likes how they fit and loves the boot cut.He especially likes the rugged material .
 Sent me what I wanted . 15 more 12 more 11 more 9 more 7 more 5 more 3 more done
 This is a very good price for this product , it 's the second one I 've ordered for my son .
 If you have a problem with jeans bagging in the rear , then these jeans are for you ! They are a great fit and very comfortable ! My husband loves them !
 Well , its a good jean , everybody know the levi 's quality , the item arive in perfect conditions . . so nothing more to say . .
 Perfect fit , every time . 517 's are difficult for me to find locally , but buying on line thru Amazon is best for me .
 These are like they used to make them ! More belt loops , great fabric - love them ! Ca n't wait to order more of these !
 I was having a really hard time finding the boot cut Levis - no one seems to carry them anymore . These are just what I wanted . They look and fit good .
 Bought these for my husband and they fit true to size , maybe a little bit long but not so much that he wo n't wear them . He love them , they look good so I love them ! Great Pants !
 I ordered these jeans for my 16yo son & he really liked them . The only thing he would have preferred was a lower rise , but he 's wearing them without complaints . : -RRB-
 I bought 2 of these and man they are nice . I 'll admit the guy wearing the jean in the picture sold me . Like I went and look for all the style of Levi 's , and these attracted me the most . Although I would n't tuck in my shirt like that . But they sure look good with some chucks and or casual boots and a dress shirt , with a silver wrist watch , and a pair of shades . They are heavy , and for me kinda tight even though jean of a different brand and style with the same size , fit me perfectly . I do n't know I guess it the way they are made . But for the look , I 'll take the pain any day , yes these jean are so tight mostly in my thigh area and waist , that I do get a little discomfort pain in my lower back . I guess it the way they are design and the heaviness of the jean . Of course I am in the process of getting in shape again . So with time , these will be perfect . I do like to sag a little , but as of right now I ca n't with these . Until I lose some of that belly fat I accumulated over the years .
 These are the jeans I always buy , they are a great comfortable fit . It is also great that Amazon stocks the size I need , it 's impossible to get from the shops .
 My body was made for Levi 's brand jeans , and I 'd worn through a couple of pairs . I bought duplicate black 517s - soft but not washed out , dark , with a predictable fit . They are my new favorites . The process went smoothly . Who knew I 'd be buying clothes online ?
 I ordered these for Christmas for my 6 ' 2 '' grandson who had grown out of all his pants after checking stores and finding his size is almost impossible to find . They were perfect and he loved them .
 The Levi 's 517 Boot Cut were purchused as a replacement of the wrong ones bought at a local store , These ordered & delivered ; I was told fit greatly before & after ; washThe price for my buying , totaled out a nuff less even with shipping to come fromamazon , rather than a store , even on sale after my tax & shipping ; -LRB- as a late gift -RRB- Theonly guestion I got was about , they did not have the Levi 's cardboard shelf tagswe see on Jean 's in store .
 I love my levis . I was unaware they came in black . I bought a blue pair and black pair , Ilove them
 Just as described ! Fit & look exactly what he needed and wanted . And he said I could n't find this product ... LOLThanks !!! The Wife wrote the review ...
 These jeans fit great . The boot cut gives a good look without being sloppy . My husband looks hot in them .
 Got these as a gift for my brother , and they are the true blue classic with a great slim shape . Perfect `` date night '' jeans .
 These are the only jeans my husband will wear and we could not find them ANYWHERE . When i found them here i was happily suprised with the discount price and they look great . Would buy again from this seller .
 Excellent transaction on hard to find size and style Levi Jeans.Reasonable price and quick shipping.I 'm very pleased with this purchase !
 jeans were shipped quick , arrived in good shape the medium stonewash has that worn look most people want , I am pleased with the purchase .
 I ordered these jeans an exrta size longer becaause I wanted a high cuff . Got exactally that . Perfect !!! Now I 'm looking for a white pair
 Well , they 're Levi 's . There you go . Best jeans on the market . Last forever and fit great . The black does fade to gray quicker than I would like , but that 's probably because I wear only black , all the time . So ...
 I have worn Levi jenas for the last 16years , i am relatively tall guy and seldom get my size in the store , Amazon provides me my size and then quality as well .
 Purchased two pairs of Levi 's Boot Cut Jeans for my husband , the Jeans are very hard to find in the stores . Since my husband is tall , it is hard to find 36x36 .
 These pants are very well put together and I am a big fan of Levi 's pants durability which is what prompted me to purchase these .
 I am a woman but men 's jeans fit me better . These are very comfortable . My jeans do NOT get hung up on my boots as they do with jeans that are not boot cut .
 todo salio perfecto , tanto el envio como el paquete recibido , estan esplendidas , la hora de llegada fue la establecida por el vendedor
 Quality jeans , but not made in the USA.Arrived quickly and each pair were individually bagged in plastic.Good fit , for me .
 I like this style and they are getting very hard to find . The price here was the best I found , got in a timely manner . I 'm happy with my purchase .
 Purchased these jeans for my husband . They have a nice fit and look very good on . No baggy butt like the relaxed fit jeans .
 I usually have a hard time finding good bootcut jeans with the right fit in the retail stores . If the color/wash/fabric is right , the size isnt . If the size is right , the fit is too loose at the seat and thighs . Now that my favorite pair of jeans is past its prime , I started looking for a new pair to replace it . After hunting all stores in and around my area and trying all available bootcuts in my size , I was very disappointed . That is , until I found a pair of Levi 's 517 Blue Ox in the local Macy 's store . This was the first bootcut I found in the last 3 years that fit me perfectly . Since I already had a pair of jeans that was of a very similar color , I came online and started looking for the correct color in that fit . Unfortunately , it wasnt that easy finding one online . Kohls , Dillards and others had Levi 's 517s , but they werent the same ones I saw in the store . Apart from Macys and Amazon , no other site -LRB- including Levi 's own site -RRB- had the same fit in Rancher Light color I was looking for . I could have ordered at Macys website , but my past experience with Amazon was stellar and so it my first choice . Even then I was a little skeptical if the photos were close to how the jeans looked in reality . Since amazon had a free returns on this one , I went ahead with the order . The product , as always with Amazon , came 6 days ahead of their estimated delivery date . The jeans is , in fact , very close to the pictures on the website and the fit is PERFECT !! Thanks to Levi 's for the perfect color and fit and KUDOS to amazon for the perfect shopping experience !
 Finally Levi went back to 7 belt loops instead of the five . Makes a big difference for those of us that work for a living .
 I bought the 517 as I prefer this cut to any other one of the Levi 's catalog , I place it even above the so famous 501 . I 'm fully satisfied
 I love these jeans . The wash and fit are great . That being said , they did arrive with a hole in the seat and the seam is a little crooked on the inside left leg . I really do n't care though because they fit so good .
 It is hard to find male , black , slim fit , boot cut jeans . Believe me I searched many places both on-line and local retail outlets . Finally I found these on Amazon and they were just right . Great fit , looks good , and the price was reasonable . I highly recommend them .
 We will take these to alterations but they were about 5 inches too long . Otherwise they are very nice .
 True to size , did n't shrink , and minimal wrinkling . Love the variety of sizing - son is tall and thin , and hard to fit , but Levis 517 made it happen !
 I 've always wanted a ` black 527 ' but found out I could only get that in rigid black.I decided to try 517 n whao I might just decide to continue with 517 even with other colors.Just the perfect fit I love .
 Is exactly what i was looking for . . i being using this model for years , and this pair of pant are excellent
 I am a creature of habit . Being of slim build I have found the 517 Boot cut to be the perfect jean for me . I also know my size so the fit was great as received . This is not always the case when ordering over the Internet . Service was great delivered on time as expected .
 These are the best jeans Levis has to offer in my opinion . They are not light and flimsy like some jeans Levis are making these days . The medium stonewash is a great even color . They do n't look faded on the seat and thighs or dingly and dirty like so many jeans do . These jeans are rugged , comfortable and last a long , long time . On top of that they look great . These are the only jeans I will buy .
 These jeans are everything they say they are . We will definately order these jeans again when the time comes . Thanks !
 100 % recomended , i have no doubt that i am going to buy another , it is really regular fit and boot cut
 This is the only jean my husband wears . He has the hardest time finding 36x29 . This is a perfect fit for him . When he needs more I will return to amazon .
 I finally found a pear of jeans that my wife said they look good on me and after being washed still fits great
 Great fit for my long legs ! Hard to find jeans my size but Levi 's always comes through for me ! a
 My order arrived in a timely fashion , they fit good and look great ... I 'm gon na get a couple more pairs .
 Levi 's 517 ` sThese Levi 's were the perfect fit . I like the fact that they are pre rinsed , which makes the fabric softer .
 Many of us do n't want to wear our Levi 's half way up our bellies . 517s are the best answer for that !
 A well tried and true blue jean that I 've been wearing for decades . The fit , finish , and quality is a good as or better than ever .
 These seemed a bit darker in person than pictured but they were a great pair of jeans for my husband . This is his favorite style of jeans and he needed a new pair of &#34; dressy jeans . &#34; Same great jeans as in the past .
 All the Levi 's I purchased for my 16 year old son were ` made to fit ' ! From the straight to boot cut , they all were a perfect fit for his personal taste . They are well made and very stylish .
 Great jeans , great price , speedy delivery as promised ! Will definitely be ordering them again since my son is so tall and slim and this is one of the only places I can find his size .
 Great basic jeans in hard to find sizes . Not much to say otherwise . They have washed up well and held up well for my long and lanky teen .
 Jeans are a little tight in the thighs for my husband . It did n't come with packing slip so I 'm hoping I can return them !
 I love these jeans . For me they are perfect . Long enough to wear with or without boots and the fit is not too tight . How can you go wrong with Levi 's ?
 I got what I ordered promptly . I wish I had ordered a different color but -- my bad . No complaints . What else can I say ?
 The jeans was just perfect , the material , size and colour , nothing to complain about , and great timing too.They fit really well , and amazon 's size chart was very helpfull .
 Style & size stayed true since the last time I bought a pair , after gettingLevi 's Men 's 527 Low Rise Boot Cut Jeanthat are nothing like they used to be that 's all a shopper can ask .
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut . Black 42 waist / 30 length . If you are short , stocky and have a big butt . These pants are perfect . They wo n't bunch up at your fat knees and they will last a long time before the zipper explodes . I suggest you buy the next size up because they will shrink after 6 months of washing , drying and severe stretching in the seat area . Great pants .
 MY FAVORITE JEANS FOR 25 YEARS . I HAVE WORN MAINLY 501 MODEL , SO I READ MANY REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING THESE 517 JEANS.AFTER THINKING FOR A LONG TIME I DECIDED TO BUY ONE SIZE BIGGER THAN USUAL . IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE.THEY ARE JUST FINE , BLACK COLOR AND ZIPPER FLY WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DETAIL FOR ME !
 My husband 's body type includes slight pot belly and skinny hips and thighs . Almost impossible to find pants that fit well without being either too tight in the belly or looking baggy in the seat and thighs . He used to wear Levi 's Action Jeans which were boot cut jeans with slight stretch in fabric and a slight crease in the legs . These jeans always looked and fit great ; real snappy . Unfortunately they 're no longer available . Then went to wearing David Taylor Flexjeans from Sears which were almost as good . However , he now find that although Sears still sells jeans by this name , they are no longer the same . They are now made in China and are made from a crappy fabric and no longer fit the same . In desperation , he started looking thru available Levis products and found Levi 's 517 . Advertised as slim in seat and thighs . He did not expect much but was pleasantly surprised to find that they are indeed somewhat slim in the seat and thighs , even though the pants he bought had a waist size slightly larger than minimally necessary , thankfully allowing him to breathe . Bottom line was that he was very happy that these pants are not so tight in the waist that its hard to breathe , but still slim enough in the seat and thighs that they do n't look like old man 's jeans . Just wish they had the snappy look of the old Levi 's Action Jeans .
 I bought a pair of these in 29X34 and they are great . Fit perfect , really like the cut , lighter weight material but not too light , should hold up well . Just wish they would reduce the size of the internal tag -- I 've actually had to tuck it back into the pants a few times after putting them on !
 Son loves them with costume . Refused to eat because he did n't want to take off . They look nice , but the material was sometimes difficult getting on small fingers and took several minutes .
 These gloves are a nice addition to the Captain America childs costume . I highly recomend them . Dont waste your money on the matching boot covers .
 I bought this product to go with my son 's Captain America Costume . They were exactly as promised and worked great . There is n't much to say about them , they are small gloves that are lightweight and worked well for my 4 year-old son .
 The perfect superhero gloves ! Fits well , just the right length for my son who is 8 . Happy with my purchase . Super fast shipping . Item is as described
 My son loves superheroes , and is on a Cap kick right now . He loves these gloves . They 're pretty thin on the hand part and a bit cheesy . But for the price you really ca n't go wrong .
 Out five year old grandson is a newly minted superhero fan . He ask his grandmother to make him a Captain America costume . The only parts that she could n't make were the gloves . I found these on Amazon and the costume was complete .
 I purchased these for my 3 1/2 yo to complement his halloween costume . They are a bit big , but will do the trick . They match fine and also go perfectly with the boot covers . I would recommend these if you are using for a costume . I 'm not sure how well they would hold up to heavy play , but for what I need them for they are perfect .
 My son wanted to be Captain America ever since the Avengers movie came out . So we got the costume first , then the shield . Then he insisted on the gloves next . These gloves fit him with a little room for growth . He is 5 and they stay on and he is able to do things with his gloves on . They are standard red and match his costumeAvengers Captain America Classic Costumeperfectly .
 Bought these for a grandson to complete the Captain America &#34; look &#34; . They were a hit and fit his 5 year old hands well . I think the fit would work for younger children as well as older ones . The glove part is made of fabric and the sleeve is made of a rubbery material .
 Purchased not expecting much but the joy experienced by my nephew was worth every penny . Great value for the PRICELESS happiness of the recipient .
 These gloves completed my son 's costume and were a great price to boot ! The material is okay but with rough play , I do n't think they will last a long time .
 I purchased these as part of a dress up box I am putting together for my nephews for xmas . . it is exactly as described , thank you !
 I know I have reviewed this product before ... bought 2 pair of gloves by mistake and he plays with these everyday ... they are good quality and Capt. America loves them .
 Hanes is an excellent product , but there is a descrepancy between the description and what 's actually included . Once you place this item in your `` cart '' it says it contains 3 pairs . In fact there is only one pair . The price for one pair is comparable , so I kept them , not to mention they 're hard to find in certain sizes , and especially in white .
 This is a quality product from a reputable manufacturer . The value/price relationship on this particular item can not be matched or surpassed by any of the big-box retail outlets . This is good for any sanding , painting or insulation related applications . 3M produces serious and excellent products for the professional and building trades , they know what they are doing . Highly recommended .
 The image of a very cute Naruto in his ` relaxing ' or ` playful ' pose!Item is very soft - does n't scratch , itch , bind or pinch . Can be worn by an adult or child , -LRB- stretches smoothly -RRB- .

 Have n't taken it out on the dusty trail yet , but I am really happy with the first impression . The straps seem very comfortable and are designed with an elastic section -LRB- Loadspring shoulder strap technology -RRB- that will give under the weight of your pack up to a point where the non-stretchy part of the strap kicks in . This could be a really good thing . I 've posted a picture showing the navy-grey-black color choice . It is attractive and will better suit my needs -LRB- outdoor use -RRB- than the pink color shown .
 Comfort , style , and a great fit.Lee carpenter jeans fit and feel comfortableat work , not too tight or too baggy , just perfect .
 Very sturdy pair of jeans and extremely comfortable . The sizing is very accurate . Purchased other colors and am very satisfied .
 These are the only Jeans that i wear , They are triple stitched , and they last forever .
 Nice look ... extremely comfortable ... one draw back I have found with all Lee jeans is that they wear out sooner then I feel they should , but for the price that is something I can live with ...
 Would highly recommend the Lee Men 's Dungarees Carpenter Jeans , love the fit and the feel , very comfortable probably will order more .
 These jeans seem to run a bit smaller than comparable Levi 's carpenter jeans -LRB- which apparently Levis does n't make any more -RRB- . That said , they are well-made and comfortable and the price was a good value . They were delivered very quickly .
 I 've bought these before , through JC Penney , so I knew they were going to be what I wanted . The fabric is thinner than other jeans so they do n't wear real well but even for a skinny guy , the relaxed fit is very comfortable . Like other clothing I buy , the advertised measurements -LRB- 30W x 30L -RRB- seem pretty approximate , erring on the big side . I guess that 's in keeping with our &#34; expanding &#34; population . I will buy these in the future .
 Bought these for my son . He loves the fit . I buy them wherever I find them on sale , which is sometimes in stores . The ones in the stores have never run as much during the first washing as these did , so make sure you are washing only darks with these . Happy with my purchase !
 I purchased these just before a long trip . Unfortunately , the first time I pulled them down , the fabric tore near the zipper and made them unwearable . I 'm sure this was just an unusual weak point in the fabric . The fabric is n't as heavy as other brands of jeans . This keeps them from getting 5 stars . There are certainly times where lighter fabric is desirable , but I would n't wear them for actual carpenter work.For casual wear as pants , they are great . I carry all sorts of things in my pockets . The thigh pockets on the right leg are large enough for today 's smart phones - which is awesome . It 's my preferred place to carry my phone and so often carpenter pants or cargo pants do n't make those pockets big enough.The rest of the pockets are a generous size as well.Good fit , even if a little bit vanity-sized .
 These are really my favorite type of Jeans . Been wearing this brand nearly 12 years . They are loose fit and the pocket on the right side is perfect for my cell phone . being able to order these online is a bonus . They came right when then seller said they would . These pants are durable and fit great .
 Just bought two pairs to replace some jeans I had that were falling apart ; ended up deciding to get another two . Would definitely recommend . Seemed pretty true to size , seams are solid , fabric is weighty & will probably stand up to a fair deal of abuse , and they look great . Exactly what I wanted .
 Great jeans , comfortable and durable . The color is a great shade of blue , the fit is relaxed , and they were made to last .
 My wonderful husband looks pretty great in these pants . He loves them , so I do too . They wash great , wear for years . And this price was better than the major retailer that sells them too .
 i truly love these jeans . i have no complaints whatsoever . the fit is very relaxed and feel even better with repeated washings . tough jeans with a nice look.i have a few pair of levis left but have been buying the lee dungarees as the levis wear out.i have a rough physical job and these jeans have been lasting me a good 3 years compared to the other brand that would last 2 years at best.the stitching is sturdy and doesnt come undone at any spots . buttons never pull off and the hole the button goes thru is reinforced stitched very well . the leg fit is very comfortable , i have good sized thighs , and the bottoms sit very well over my slip on boots.excellent , excellent jeans that i will highly recommend for work , play or casual dress
 buena calidad y talla a la perfeccion . No me quejo , es de lo mejor y todo en un solo click
 While opinions of jeans will always come down to personal taste , the quality of these jeans will no disappoint . They are made with high quality denim and have excellent stitching . The color is a bit darker than in the picture but is not overly so . The comfort level is extremely high , with the material being soft from delivery and the jeans have plenty of room for their size .
 Great jeans , not available in the u.k. Great fit if you have larger than average thighs.Was worried about ordering from . com but it was an easy transaction.Super fast delivery too . Well done Amazon !!
 I 'm super peculiar when it comes to Jeans . I ca n't stand anything that 's skin-tight . Ca n't stand inseams that squeeze my ... gonads . But I 'm not into the ultra saggy , baggy look either . So , it 's pretty damn impossible for me to buy a pair of jeans . Recently I bought a similar model to this one at local retailer and was very much impressed with the look and fit . As soon as I realized that after so long I had found a pair of jeans that met my needs I came to amazon to buy these . Son , I 'm not disappoint . These jeans fit nicely . Very nice as a matter of fact . lots of leg room , nice inseam length , and nice fit from the waist to the end of your pockets . If you got yourself a small beer belly , I highly suggest buying one full size larger than you usually get . Otherwise , at least for me , these jeans are perfect .
 I ordered 3 pair . I love how they fit and feel . Only problem is 3 pair wears out in about 6-8 months wearing them every day .
 I bought these pants the correct W & L - but they are n't a true 32 in length . So , if you are ordering just know that they run longish . Otherwise they are constructed really well . They fit my husband perfectly and they seem to not shrink at all !

 I bought this in a 44G in Blush . It is simply the most beautiful and best fitting bra I have ever owned . Unfortunately it is discontinued by Le Mystere .
 Hands down , my favorite sports bra . Due to the adjustable straps -- a very important feature for someone who is tall or has a long torso -- this is the only sports bra I own that does n't cause my shoulders and upper back to ache . I also love that it is lightly padded . I engage in high impact activities and am small busted -LRB- 34 B -RRB- . I 'm not sure how this would hold up for someone bigger , but I most definitely recommend this sports bra to anyone with features similar to my own .
 Comfortable , holds you just fine . The 32 is a little tighter than others , but works very well.A good buy , seems durable and sturdy .
 This is the sports bra for you if you want to work out in style and still look like you have boobs ...
 I like these very much but wish the legs were a bit longer . You can still see the leg bands with tight clothing . But they do a great job at smoothing you out .
 Another great product from Spanx . This mid thigh shaper is made from silky smooth fabric , and are not a struggle to put on because they just slide over your skin . They make my buns look great with a gentle separation , and give them a rounder , more feminine look . Smooths hips and stomach and buns together nicely , and I wear these all day comfortably . I would definitely buy at least one pair !
 These are great for me , I 'm 5 ' 5 115 pounds . My body is slightly pear shaped and my butt tends to look flat and wide . I also have a little bit of bummer on me . These are great because they squeeze in my thighs and give my butt a lift and make it appear more round . It gives the appearance that my lower body would have if I worked out more often -LRB- which I know I should actually do instead of fake it -RRB- but hey who has time for that ?!? They are great for underneath white pants , or a thin material that shows everything . They are also great under a tight dress but only if it 's a little bit longer dress . I wanted to wear them with a short dress once so I cut a couple inches off the bottom . Bad idea ! I ruined a pair and they pinched me awkwardly . You ca n't really roll them up either or again they pinch awkwardly . I do also have a slight love handle and this flattens that out as well as pinch in my waistline to create a more hour glassed look . I do n't find them too annoying either . I mean it 's not like wearing comfy pajamas but 's it not too bad . They are great for when I have cramps or am bloated . The pressure and added insulation seems to relieve the cramps . If this sounds like your body type then these are for you !
 They work just like they advertise . They smooth out those saddlebags and make my hips and thighs look much better in my pants .
 Great Spanx . They hold everything in but does n't hug so tightly that you see lines . Worth the money to make many outfits look better !
 First , I never write reviews . Second , I do n't have much faith in pantyhose . That being said , these are great ! Over the weekend , I wore them with very uncomfortable shoes and I was having trouble keeping up with the group I was walking with . I finally decided to take my shoes off and planned to have to throw the pantyhose away when I was finished . Much to my surprise , after walking barefoot for about 6 city blocks , including alleys and cobblestones , these pantyhose were dirty , but there was not a single run , rip , hole or snag ! I was amazed . Plus , they feel very nice on , and the nude color makes it look like you 're not wearing hose and have perfect legs ! I 'd buy them again in a heartbeat !
 I was pretty skeptical about the pantyhose staying up without a waistband , but I was proven wrong . It really stays up . However , I feel like it runs smaller than most other pantyhose . I bought a size 1 and I usually wear XS or 0/2 in most clothing . And the size 1 was pretty tight . Not uncomfortably tight , but tighter than other pantyhose . I guess that 's how it stays up without a waistband ...
 Please understand I 'm 4 ' 11 '' and 160 lbs . Getting almost as wide as tall ' - -RRB- These Hue nylons fit great without sagging and having the crotch end up at my knees . The waist is n't too high and you do n't find yourself pulling and tugging on them over the time you are wearing them.They do n't run easily , either . I 'm very happy . I was at a wedding and a much taller friend borrowed pair of my Hue hose . She also found them comfortable . Nice .
 Gret idea - no waistband ? Who wants a waistband with a skirt or dress ? We strive for `` no-lines '' ! These are terrific !
 I love hosiery from Hue , very sheer , good fitting , good looking , and good value . I will continue to buy Hue hosiery in the future .
 This is a beautiful shirt ! Arrived well-packaged , & in plenty of time for a birthday . However , I did not heed their explicit warnings about sizing -- it was too big ! However , no problem ... I went to -LSB- . . -RSB- ; followed their instructions re
 Well made ... good looking ... very island like ... people comment on its good looks ... very comfortable . . well made ... washes in washing machine and drys in dryer ... use cold water and delicate dryer settings ...
 What a great shirt-it looks great , fits great and is of very good quality.I am going to purchase this same shirt in the black color as well!It really feels good to where this shirt !
 If you want a genuine Hawaiian Shirt that will make you the life of the party , pool or beach , this is it ! Now addmittedly Tom Selleck is no longer the Greek God of the 1970 's , but then he 's not Harry Truman or Elvis either , and they all wore Hawaiian Shirts . I liked this one so much , I bought one for my realestate agent , and he does n't drive a Ferrari -LRB- yet -RRB- , but I am sue he 's the life of the realtors parties !
 I wear this shirt as often as possible . Really lets people know that I mean business without having to make a big deal about it . Luxurious fit and very durable . It 's perfect for almost any occasion .
 Love this shirt ! Very high quality cotton , with wooden buttons . I bought it for my husband 's birthday - he 's a Hawaiian shirt kind of guy - he has a nice colection , but this is the best . Apparently , he 's wanted a ` jungle bird ' shirt for a long time , and he LOVES this one . It looks even nicer than in the photos .
 i was geting my homework out of this bag and guees what i found in the pocket ???! a crunch rap supreme i took it back to my desk with my homework and ate the crunch rap supreme cuz its supreme a little later it was lunch time and i found out i had no lunch
 One of the better purchases I 've made , in terms of satisfaction and value.The product is well-made and durable , which you come to expect from Columbia . It can be had for a good price and should last for a long time . Fits true to size , zipper works fine , and it does its job
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He finds them to be warm yet keeps his arms free at work . This Columbia vest is very nice and thick . Very nicely made and of good quality .
 Bought this for my husband , and he really liked it . The vest is generously cut and well sewn . It 's also very soft and the color is true and pleasing.Just right for those chilly nights when a long sleeved sweater would be `` too much . ''
 Ca n't beat this vest especially for the price ! I have purchased 3 of them !
 My son was very pleased with this vest . I liked the price for a name like Columbia Sportwear . I also liked how fast it was sent to me .
 The vest is comfortable and roomy , though not the very best of materials .
 This was a gift for someone . From what I saw , he was very pleased with it . The item arrived in a very timely manner .
 Purchased two of these for Christmas gifts . Was very impressed with the quality . Would definitely buy again !
 My experience with this Columbia vest made me feel it was spot on for size . The side pockets a bonus for a mid-layer piece . The vest itself let me wanting a little more . The collar is double the weight of the main body of the vest . It is a nice vest but thin for use as a mid-layer . I myself would have preferred if the body was equal to the collar in weight , but for the price I paid I 'd have to say it matches the quality . I guess I expected a little more from Columbia , as I own other products from them that always went beyond my expectations . Guess I 'll just have to be a little creative in my layering to get the best use out of this purchase . The style and color are nice , but I also got the `` bunching '' effect during active use , maybe better as a low activity use item , walking around town and such . It really comes down to what you 'll be using it for , activity level and quality of other layering items .
 Ordered the Large in Green color and was a great value . Quality was excellent as you would expect from Columbia .
 These vests are well made , stylish and fullfill their purpose exceptionally . They provide a little extra warmth at home when the thermostat is set down low to save energy . But being sleveless they do n't make you sweat . The sizes are exactly as specified . I normally wear large in shirts and jackets , and the large vest fits perfectly .
 Warm and made well and comfortable . Husband wears a large but had to order in medium size . He loves it but beware it runs large . Price was great too !
 Bought this at half the price to replace an old Columbia vest in which the zipper fell apart after a year . Wore it 5 days a week for work so I got my monies worth although I paid full price for that one .
 Columbia Men 's Cathedral Peak VestAmple sizing for stout waste . Soft , good feeling fabric with good zippers and warm comfort.Good color and value for a casual look.It can be worn most of the time for a light jacket or coat . Easy to maintain .
 Like the columbia fleece product they are soft . I got the same product from a discount store and it was cheaper even after tax . I have to rate it as 4 because of the product quality .
 This is my second Columbia vest and I really like them . I would recommend this vest to anyone . I like to wear it to work with my dress shirts and ties . Looks sharp .
 I have received this Vest , It is according the picture and it is beautiful , I like the color and I recommend to the people buy this product .
 This vest is the best value in a fleece vest that I 've found , hands down -- for quality , comfort , durability ... I travel constantly and I like the charcoal color because it shows no lint , hair etc. . I lost one of these and replaced it immediately . It 's perfect for layering in cool or cold weather ... but also for that little extra warmth I need in a refrigerated movie theater . -- When I replaced my lost vest I looked at other brands again and was reminded that this Columbia vest is the best thing out there for the money ... by far .
 What 's to review ? It is fleece , warm , I picked the color and got what I wanted . I did get a better price than I expected.Here is something review-worthy
 This is a good vest and I enjoy the heck out of mine . I actually own two in different colours , since I was given another one several years ago for my birthday . There are already a lot of reviews and opinions here so I will not be too redundant.The vest is Polartec fleece -LRB- 200 mid-weight -RRB- so it keeps the core warm and comfortable down to about 40 degrees F. Any colder and I must go to a higher tech solution . It works wet or dry , and drys pretty quickly if soaked.It 's a cozy piece of gear and I think a perfect gift item for a loved one since they will think of you in the comfort and warmth of it . I actually LIKE that short fuzzy fibres starts to clump and pill like a snuggly , familiar stuffed teddy bear after only a few washings . I often use it as a throw blanket or a pillow -LRB- esp on airline flights -RRB- . It is also very easy to maintain and as I have two , I often have one in the wash as I 'm wearing the other one.I like the roomy sizing as I use this for layering , and this is an intermediate layer . When zipped all the way up , it practically serves as it 's own Polartec scarf around the neck . Being a taller/larger human , I appreciate that this vest is available in extended sizes too.The design of the vest is simple with a stand up/fold down collar , 2 zippered side slash pockets at the waist , and the Columbia logo on the chest.Herein lies , my first minor criticism ... value . For a simple , unlined vest without any `` extras '' -LRB- like chest pocket , map pocket , interior pockets , drawstring at the bottom or the waist , throat abrasion guard , dbl access zipper , uppers shell , back hook loop , even zipper pulls with whistles , compasses and LED lights -RRB- I would expect a basic level price . If you shop around even online you should quickly get a feel for what the no frills model vs. the all the bells and whistles model are comparatively worth.The two pockets that it does have utilizes this elastized sateen material as the interior . Not only is this pocket lining not very warm , but I find that it snags uncomfortably on little dry skin flakes , hangnails , and tiny dry skin spurs on my hands . It might be just me , but it makes it unpleasant to put my hands in the pockets -LRB- for warmth -RRB- . On both of my Columbia vests , I have replaced the pocket liners with nice non-snagging flat mesh -LRB- like that found in luggage pockets -RRB- . Well the world is what you make of it , so of course I have made some heavy mods to my vests , which have made them my favourites and practically daily wear for me.Columbia makes consistently high quality products -LRB- overseas -RRB- geared toward the outdoor person , so paying a little bit extra for the brand name logo is not that painful I guess .
 This vest is very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear . Most of the time I wear it with short sleeved shirts . When zipped , it 's just right for those 45-50 degree days -LRB- as long as you 're not out in the chill for really long periods - but fine for car-to-store , or short walks -RRB- . It 's also great around the house when you want to drop the thermostat a few degrees to save a little on heating costs . My only disappointment is the main zipper . Sometimes it takes several tries to get it started , and it often sticks mid-zip -LRB- as if there was grit or something in it -RRB- . It always ends up working , but not always smoothly . I 'd definitely recommend the vest , and I suspect my zipper issue is not a design flaw , but rather a production glitch , which would not likely affect other buyers .
 I have purchased Columbia products I have liked in the past . So this was not a difficult choice form me . It is sized correctly for the big guys . I ordered a xxlt and it fits just the way it should . I nice way to add a bit of extra warmth under a jacket that need a little help . Good price and a quality product that was shipped fast .
 Ca n't beat the price , but the vest is larger than I thought a large would be - should 've got a medium .
 This Columbia vest is a quality product and is equipped with a durable zipper , style and feel .
 Columbia gear seems to be priced much lower than other companies like Patagonia and North Face but I feel like the quality of Columbia 's clothes stands up.This vest is exceptionally warm and comfortable .
 The most important factors for me when purchasing a vest were warmth and comfort . This vest is just what I wanted in both categories . It gives me just the right amount of warmth when I go for my morning run without getting too hot once I get warmed up . It 's also comfortable and soft . The pockets have zippers so I can put my keys etc in there and do n't have to worry about them falling out . The only fault I can find is the zippers jingle a bit as I move . Overall I 'm happy with my purchase .
 I got two of these , the blue and the Cattail , which is just brown . They are nice and warm . They look good . They run a little bit big . I got an XL , and I usually wear an XL in everything . I 'm probably right in between a L and an XL . I 'm 6 ' and 240 lbs , if that helps you order yours correctly .
 My son really loves this vest . We ordered two in different colors . It looked very nice on him and he wore it every other day with jeans . A great vest !
 Bought this for my dad for Christmas . He really llikes it . Fits really well and was just as promised and described .
 Perfect fit - this was purchased for an elderly person for indoor wear . It 's not black and it 's not grey - more like graphite . It is very lightweight and keeps him cozy and warm in these cold months .
 We 've been wearing our own Columbia vests for quite some time here in Wisconsin , but it only recently occurred to me that it was just the thing for my 93-year-old dad in Florida , who 's often cold , despite fairly warm temperatures . He loves the vest 's softness and is enjoying having something more youthful and &#34; cool &#34; to wear . I 'm happy to know that it 's easily machine wash and dryable .
 I picked this up to use as a stand-alone or extra layering depending on the temperature . This vest is great - it 's like wearing a soft fleece blanket.It fits easily under all my jackets or sweatshirts . A nice bonus is the zip pockets - they 're great for my phone or warming up my hands very fast .
 Wonderful vest at retail price , the Amazon has outdone itself.For $ 12 + tax , it seems like a steal to me.The material is very soft and of good craftmanship.thank you , Amazon and Columbia
 This product is a good value . Nothing spectacular , but a good deal . I use it as a good layer for skiing to provide warmth for my core without restricting shoulder and elbow movement . It more than adequately provides what I need .
 Every piece of Columbia clothing that I own is top quality and this is no different . It 's a lightweight , and yet warm vest perfect for those crisp fall days .
 Not a whole lot to say other than it 's well built , the fabric is very comfortable and strong feeling and the vest looks great . I 'd buy it again if I had the need .
 this is a very nice vest . looks good on and fabric is great . color stays true when washed as well
 Good light weight Vest.Material soft and flexible.Deep pockets . The fit was great . I wear mine in the office . I would recommend .
 This vest is similar to my Columbia Fleece jacket -- both are excellent and perform very well , especially at this price point . Fast delivery too .
 Was just what i was looking for . Brand new with tags and shipped very quickly . My husband loves it . Color looks exactly same as shown in the pic as well .
 I like Columbia garments for myself . So I bought one for My Dad for Christmas . It fits well in the XL and is nicely made.Washable too !!
 Quick service , good price and no complaints after wearing this for a month . Considering ordering another in a different color .
 Great vest for cool sunny days . Vest is a little on the thin side . It looks great and feels great . The only problem occurs is that it lets wind in and out very easily . I would recommend this to a friend , but do n't look for a whole lot of warmth from it .
 Awesome vest . Better than expected , well packed and arrived quickly ! I give it 2 thumbs up and my highest recommendation !
 A gift for my Grandson , quality and craftsmanship excellent , could not ask for a better product , or reliability . Thank you for a great fitting product , my Grandson absolutely loves it .
 I gave my husband this for Christmas and he is pleased , so I am too . Looks good , is comfortable . Have only had it less than 1 week .
 Honestly do n't know what 's all the hype about the North Face is . The good old Columbia looks great , feels comfortable and is well made . Navy color is very pleasant to the eye . I am very happy with the vest .
 My husband absolutely loved his vest I got him . We have even bought these in different colors . We would recommend this to anyone looking for a vest to wear as a casual attire or even a dressy attire .
 Fleece is fleece , but this vest is surprisingly well put-together . The only thing is it missing is a third pocket -LRB- the small vertical one near the left center that most other vests have -RRB- .
 I was very satisfied with the vest . I would get a size smaller than your usual size , they run big .
 Works for what I wanted . Something to wear while walking in cooler temps , where I did n't want a full coat .
 This product was first class -LRB- not a second -RRB- and was as ordered and on time . Ca n't get any better than that .
 This vest is soft yet rugged , true to size and just right for my son for Christmas .
 It 's hard for me to find some shirt with right size sleeve and collar . But that would be a problem for a vest , :-RRB- . I do n't like the zippers on the pockets , i never put any stuff in the pockets . Overall , this is a good vest for me , I wish it a little bit warmer .
 Columbia sizes are really big so just be a little conservative in ordering for sizes . Buy is for less than 20 bucks for getting value .
 I was satified with the product my only concern is that the color was off black insteadof black .
 very nice vest . light yet warm enough and not too hot during warmer days . the run a little big , I ordered a Large and had to exchange it for a M and I run on the larger side ... in all great buy I would recommend to a friend hands down ...
 I lost a vest that I previously owned , so I was looking for one to replace it . I am very satisfied with the fit and color of the one I purchased .
 Not the first vest of this type from Columbia that I 've purchased . Exactly what I wanted , soft , light weight but provides the warmth I want . Seems easy to mantian , wears good over time , easy to fold and carry if not needed . Satisfied .
 Have several different brands . . this is the best value of all ... fits great quality stitching and best price of all seen
 Extremely pleased with this purchase . After having ordered the wrong color by mistake , i quickly ordered again . Came exactly as described and within given time . No disappointments here !
 The vest is great -- second one I 've purchased ; however , the zipper , as the vest ages , has a tendency to pull apart at the bottom . The reason is the very short insert piece . Increase the depth of the insert and this vest would rate 5 stars . I bought my first vest at Mervins and when they went out of business I never found this make of vest again until I checked Amazon.com -- a great source and great products .
 I bought this vest for a casual look around the office and not at all disappointed . The sizing is about average , the look is great , and as it is Columbia , the material is of good quality . It will keep one warm in the winter months .
 This was a Christmas gift for my husband that he actually loved . Thanks for a great buy . Will be back !
 I 've had this vest for about a month now & I really do enjoy it.I 've had similar vests in the past , but I needed something newer to wear around the office and under my winter coat when a sweater or hoody just does n't work.The vest is very soft & does n't get caught on much . I bought the dark grey hoping that it would `` hide '' my dogs hair unlike the black vest . And it does . I have a beagle , and I can barely notice when -LRB- a few/decent amount -RRB- of his white & black hairs get on it . Some fleece seems to attract dog hair & never let go - this does NOT.The only negative I have about this vest , as others noted , is that there is n't a pull string around the waist . This has n't really bothered me , but I would like to tighten it up just a little bit.I work outdoors so this is perfect for helping me layer up but allowing me something to wear that wo n't bulk up & slow down my arm movement which happens if you wear too many sweaters or hoody 's . I plan on buying another in a few months so I do n't wear this one out too much . Awesome price too . I checked a couple of stores online and no one had the same price as Amazon .
 I just want to say that is the best way to keep you warm , high quality product and very comfortable .
 Absolutely a fine purchase . I really like this vest -- the fit , the breathability , the warmth . Excellent quality . I recommend it highly .
 My wife wanted one for Traveling , got it , Love 's it , She is very Happy and i am very Happy . Thanks
 We are very pleased with the Vest that we purchased and are looking forward to giving it to my Father in Law for the holiday . I am sure he will be happy . Sizing looks accurate as does fabric and style . It will be a great gift for him
 This is a great vest . I ordered a medium , I am a 38 &#34; in chest , yet the medium was too big for me really -LRB- if you want a close to the body fit -RRB- . I will get this vest again in a smaller size and other color .
 This vest is of decent quality , not quite as good as the previous Columbia fleece vest as it is thinner . The color is more of a faded black or dark grey than black . I think I would have been disappointed if I had paid full price but for $ 25 it is worth it . I would buy it again .
 everything in order , very good quality product , service stock.came charging according to the agreement.excellent , recommended to all users .
 I ordered this as something to layer underneath my work jackets . It fits well , so it should be comfortable when layering . Even if this just lasts through this winter , it was a great deal at this price.I have a lot of Colombia jackets -LRB- fleece , rain shell , omni-heat jacket , etc. -RRB- , and I have never been disappointed .
 This vest is just right when a jacket is too much , or when a less bulky additional layer is needed . It is true to size and is well constructed . I plan to add other colors to my collection .
 Quality is good , not as thin as some said . Fit is small than usual . I wear a medium usually but was glad I got a small .
 The vest is comfortable and is made well . The size is my only reason for giving 4 stars . The vest runs on the large side . If you want a tighter fit you will have to order at least one size smaller than what you normally wear . It would be better with an elastic draw string too .
 This was a great purchase for my husbands birthday . Very well cut and designed using quality materials that wear well . I purchsed the navy color and it is a very nice shade more of a navy/grey that goes well with everything . My husband wears a size 42 jacket so I purchased the large since the medium I bought him before fit a little too close for his liking , the large is a little roomier . Columbia is always a good product and the price was good too .
 This is a beautifully made vest and my husband loves the color -LRB- bark -RRB- . From another review I was tipped off that the vest runs large , so I got a size smaller than my husband 's usual size -LRB- XL to L -RRB- . It fits perfectly .
 I wear this nearly every day in the office to stay warm . It 's fleece is perfect , and I love the freedom to move my arms . Size is perfect . No complaints .
 Great extra layer to add during the winter months for a fair price . Looks great too around the office or at home .
 My son and my husband loved their new vests . They love the feel and fit and the colors . I will have to remember to get them some more .
 Very nicely made Vest.Columbia has great products.Like the texture of the material.Pictures on amazon page could be better .
 The fit is not too loose and the cypress color is a gray-green cross . Nice neutral color for men . This was purchased for use in winter time , but it 's rather thin to wear alone . It 's better suited for use in spring-time or under a jacket since it 's not bulky .
 Great ! The fabric felt very gentle , and it 's very light . My husband love it very much . I also introduced it to our friends , one of them placed an order , so I bought it again . The size is a little bit bigger .
 The product was made well . It looks good has a lining but I found that it was not as warm as a similar product purchased over 10 years ago . I did not return it as when the weather gets warmer or when I will wear it inside .
 He likes it . A basic black vest . Seems well made unlike some brands whose zippers are not the best quality . If you are not broad shouldered though the sleeve area in the large size is a bit &#34; wingy &#34; looking . My husband is tall but not bulky so it is a little too big in that respect .
 Second of the same type for me . Perfect for cool weather . Yes indeed . comfy warm not restrictive . All one could ask .
 Lightweight . I wear it mostly at night in my hammock to keep warm throughout the night . Layers well . Added a drawstring at the waist . Easy to do but would have preferred it was included .
 Although the product is great . It was not the exact color as published . It does not have a different color on the neck
 It was wright for what I was looking for . It arrived in good conditions but the coulor is a bit different that in the picture anyway it fits well , thanks .
 As it usually happens , Columbia makes the best and tis vest is not an exception . comfortable , nice and well made .
 All I wanted was a basic vest for cool summer days . Does the job perfectly . Will not stop the wind or keep you very warm - but if you are a guy needing pockets for your wallet - this works well .
 I have wide shoulders -LRB- 50 Regular suit jacket -RRB- , and the XL fit me perfect . I was especially pleased with the collar - which was shorter when popped than the previous Columbia vest I had owned . My previous fleece vest from Columbia lasted me about 2 years , so I have high hopes for this one as well . Very soft , great fit , extremely comfortable and versatile .
 Purchased this vest as a team vest for our local biathlon team . The fit was slightly large , but that is good for winter wear . The length was just below belt line . This is ideal for keeping the lower back warm while skiing and also shooting . Everyone that got a vest on our team was very pleased with the fit and the look . Great for training and looks good too !
 Dumb me , I ordered the wrong size . No problem with this purchase . It was easy to return and reorder the correct size . Credit came through for this purchase with days of me shipping wrong size back . This firm is `` On he Ball '' when it comes to handling a situation like this .
 While I do n't get too excited by clothing , and this is no exception , I do find this is a well made , comfortably warm vest , that I am glad I purchased .
 I wear this as an insulating layering or by itself over a shirt . It looks much better than my Columbia fleece which does n't have much shape . I like that it is super light and moderately warm .
 Bought this for my son in college after he asked for a black fleece vest for his birthday ... He thought it was perfect .
 Got my Columbia Cathedral Vest yesterday . Fits great and does it 's job perfectly.Paid 36 $ for it and its worth the money . It 's also much cheaper than similar products from North Face.Great for a run !
 First off - I am very happy with this purchase as it is exactly what I expected . And for the price , it 's hard to complain.The vest fits very nicely , i got the green large . I 'm a male 5 ' 11 '' and about 190 lbs . It fits me very nicely . Sometimes these vests bunch up around the gut looking dumpy but not this one.I have washed it a few times and it seems to be holding its colour , shape and stretch . It blocks the wind nicely and is perfect for cool autumn weather/early winter when it 's not too brutal but a t-shirt just does n't cut it.The collar is one it 's best features - it folds down nicely to keep your neck warm or you can turn it up to avoid the wind . The material is very soft and feels great on your skin.As for complaints , I find that i really miss having a breast pocket and I wish the pocket zippers went up to open as opposed to down.Since neither of these features were advertised , obviously i ca n't complain about their absence - i just prefer them and will be looking for both on my next vest purchase.One thing that I will knock off a star for is the depth of the pockets . They are quite shallow causing things to fall out easily - especially if you are sitting . If you are going to make a jacket with shallow pockets i think the pocket zips should go the other way ... Just make sure you remember to close the zips ! you can fit your entire hand in if you are trying to stay warm , but there is almost no downward angle to make a good pocket for holding your keys , phone or wallet.While we 're on the topic of zippers i will say that the quality of the zips on this jacket is top-notch . it will open or close from almost any angle and i would be very surprised if they stopped working.At $ 20 it 's hard to imagine a better purchase !
 Columbia fleece vests are the best I 've ever owned -LRB- it 's the third Columbia fleece I 've purchased -RRB- . They 're warm and very durable without being too bulky , making for a good fit and a nice appearance .
 My Significant Other needed something easy to get into because of shoulder surgery ... Perfect for him ! The warmth is wonderful ; the sizing worked out great . He did n't have a vest like this , but now he 's talking about getting another one , in another color . Pricing is perfect too . Ca n't think of any negative !
 Definitely get one size smaller than what you normally wear . I almost always wear an XL and when I tried this on it was baggy and roomy and with an item like this you want it to be snugger .
 I bought this for my husband last year , for Christmas . At this point in time , no complaints at all from him . Washes well and wears well , and its light color does n't show white dog hair , which was a must for a new vest !
 Quality is good but I need Longs and they dont seem to have many longs
 I ordered several of these in different colors . The quality is great and the sizing is true . Furthermore , they have come out of the washer & dryer looking like new each and every time . If additional colors become available , I wo n't hesitate to order more .
 Ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas . Beautiful red shade , and fits extremely well . He is very happy and I was pleased that it arrived so quickly and in perfect condition .
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He is very fussy and almost always finds something -LRB- even if it is really minor -RRB- wrong with anything he either buys or receives . He has worn this vest 3 times and has only had it for 6 days ! The fit was on target a large is a large . The craftsmanship above average . The price very good . This large fit nicely over a bit more belly than desired but would still fit well minus the extra pounds .
 I bought this vest for my husband for Christmas . It was perfect . He 's 6 ' 2 '' and about 220lbs and the XL fits him perfectly . He loves wearing it . It 's great for Southern winters were it does n't get too cold .
 This vest is very warm . It fits snug to your body keeping in your core body heat.The pockets are large . . perfect for someone who likes to carry a lot of things with them.The collar can be flipped up to cover more of your neck , or folded down when it 's not as cold.The fleece is very soft , and the vest overall is made well . I recommend this vest if you ` relooking to keep warm this winter . . either worn solo or as part of your winter layered clothing .
 I have been wearing this vest everyday since i got it . the color is great and the warmth is perfect . its not cold enough to wear heavy down jacket but this is just right for the cool days and nights here is S. Calif. thank you
 I ordered this one night , and had it in my hands within 3 business days - with regular shipping . It is a very good layer to add to any winter gear . It has two side zip-up pockets , and the collar zips all the way up if you need . It is super lightweight , and very warm -LRB- for a vest -RRB- . This vest does stop a tiny bit of wind , but not much . On a cool rainy day , wear this underneath a non-insulated rain jacket -LRB- shell -RRB- , and it 's perfect ! -- Very nice !
 This vest was exactly what I wanted . It has a furry texture -LRB- not all fleeces have that same texture -RRB- ; it has pockets that completely sewn into the garment -LRB- some sew it only on one edge -RRB- ; it has room in the pockets all the way to the side edge -LRB- and not just to the edge of the zipper -RRB- . The fit was good ; the sizes run large , so a L fits an XL person . I am very please and will probably purchase another .
 I bought this for my husband because he likes a fleece vest with a collar . He is very pleased and the vest looks great . The collar is big enough to really keep the wind off your neck .
 Its comfortable , warm , a little short in length but overall a really nice vest for me to wear in all types of weather . If I had to complain about one thing it would be that it is not fleece like I thought it would be so make sure you know what you 're buying . Other then that a nice product though !
 The vest fits well and is well made . If it had a zippered breast pocket it would be ideal and would get 5 stars . I would order it again .
 I had to replace a vest the job gave me because it was wearing out . I decided to order these vest in different colors . They go great with whatever I wear at the job . The quality is good for the money . I 'm known as the vest guy now .
 fits great , the blue is amazing , its warm but not too warm , I simply love this one . also got the black one and this a great product .
 I received just what I had ordered , which was the same brand I 've always worn and it was received very quickly before the expected date was even close to being up . I love my Columbia vests .
 Estoy muy contento de haber encargado &eacute;sta prenda . El color es muy suave y elegante . La prenda es muy c&oacute;moda .
 i liked this vest , , , the texture of the fabric is ideal for all season with style the thing is there is not enough pockets , , , , , , but it really serve my life style , , , , ill going to buy two more , , , i love it.i recommend this vest for all walks of life in style .
 Just the right weight to be outside in the Fall or Spring doing things . Keeps you warm without restricting mobility . Looks good and is very functional .
 I bought this as soon as the Winter cold hit NM and love it . The XL I first purchased was a bit short -LRB- I 'm 6 ' 5 &#34; -RRB- so I then bought an XLT which I put in the morning and wear till I retire at night . Excellent warmth and comfort . Excellent value for money .
 These vests are the most comfortable and great lookingAnd are very affordable and go great with any causual outfit
 My wife bought a couple of these first . I saw them and liked what I saw . Then I learned that she had bought a men 's vest , so I was pretty sure I could have one , too ! The zipper on the pockets is necessary , since the bottom of the opening is about even with the bottom of the pocket and things can fall out . I found one that fits my chest but it is loose at the waist . I will probably take a seam in a bit to correct that . The material is pleasingly soft and warm . They clean up in the washing machine.My wife 's two vests are the same size , but the waistband is larger on one than the other . They were manufactured in different countries .
 Great extra layer for the winter.Very good quality . Generous pockets.Extremely comfortable.Logo over the breast is pleasantly inconspicuous .
 Most of my winter gear is from Columbia and I 've never had any complaints about it . It 's about half the price of a comparable North Face garment and works just as well .
 Like all Columbia products , this item arrived true to fit and size . I purchased this item for my husband and he wears it all the time . It washes well and is very durable . We have had this product for two years and it still looks and feels brand new .
 I bought this to layer under my coat when the weather dips below freezing . It 's comfortable , soft , and keeps me warm . I also like the blue color . Dropped one star because it seems to be made for people with pot bellies . I 'm 6 ' 1 180 and the medium fits perfectly lengthwise and in the shoulder/chest area but there 's a lot of extra fabric in the middle .
 Nice color and Im wanting to buy another vest different color . I highly reccomend to buy , columbia has great cloths .
 Bought this vest for my brother and he loves it . I really liked the color of it because its so different .
 The fit , number of zippered pockets , and quality of fabric are all in keeping with a fleece vest that might have cost $ 15 or so more .
 Got this as a present for my dad . He loved it . Ordered an xl should have gone smaller product runs big
 Fits great and what a great price -- medium weight - true to size for mens large . Priced locally at $ 65 dollars
 love columbia products , it helps keep my chest warm so I can lower the heat in the house during the daytime .
 This vest is exactly what I wanted , lightweight yet warm , does n't hinder arm and shoulder motion ; very soft comfortable material .
 I chose thie vest because of the brand and color . It is good quality and stylish . Shipping was fast . I 'm happy , happy , happy !
 Fits just right , material is a nice weight . very warm . Columbia products are always nice . ca n't go wrong with this vest .
 Vest is a nice weight , not too heavy or too lightweight . Great over a long sleeve t-shirt or henley . The charcoal color is really nice . It holds up well through repeated washings . He got this vest last year for Christmas and recently lost it but he loves it so much he asked for a replacement . So if your husband is forgetful like mine you might want to get two . : -RRB-
 Hanes is an excellent product , but there is a descrepancy between the description and what 's actually included . Once you place this item in your `` cart '' it says it contains 3 pairs . In fact there is only one pair . The price for one pair is comparable , so I kept them , not to mention they 're hard to find in certain sizes , and especially in white .
 I bought two of these ten years ago , and they are the best . Still good after all these years . And I disagree that they are too roomy -- they have fit me perfectly .

 I was so pleased with this that I actually bought six of them in black and blue . I 've had them for about a year now , and the only thing I would complain about is that some of the seams are falling apart . Other than that , they 're comfortable !
 This shirt fits just as the image indicates . I 'm not sure why it 's called a `` muscle shirt '' when it fits far too loosely to show off anything other than your exposed arms , but as I said , it matches the picture . It looks much nicer than the cheap cotton sleeveless tees I usually work out in . In fact , an attractive woman in the gym started putting herself in front of me repeatedly to get noticed after ignoring me previously . You ca n't get a better indicator than that . It feels nice , gives me complete freedom of movement , and despite being polyester I did n't get warmer in it than cotton . In my own experience , the claim about it resisting moisture is laughable . My back and the back of the shirt were soaked half way through my workout , and the gym has good air conditioning . In fact I had to hang it up to dry before putting it in the hamper , just like my cotton shirts.Had there been no claim made about this item resisting moisture , I 'd give it 5 stars , but I do n't think anything that fails to live up to its advertising should get a `` perfect '' rating . I like it enough that I will buy several more . It 's a very good item , just do n't expect it to stay dry .
 This item is very comfortable and cool . Was originally purchased to use as a car work uniform , but this is too nice to oil it up . For the price paid , I was surprised at this . Very Cool and moisture absorbent design , I 'm speechless , and totally surprised . I hope this response wo n't drive the price up .
 When you 're doing mail-order , you 're never really sure of what you 're getting . With this one , I got lucky . It 's good-looking and is an ace at wicking away moisture during sweaty workouts . The material also means it does n't wrinkle . I 've gotten a lot of compliments on it , and this is my go-to shirt for hot-weather workouts . I bought it in black , but think I 'll get some more in other colors .
 It 's a good shirt . Holds up well in the laundry . Light weight and an overall good workout shirt .
 Great shirts for working out , playing basketball or any other sweat inducing activity . Not flashy but definitely comfortable and dries quickly.Price was very good as well .
 I use this shirt as an undershirt while officiating basketball and it 's excellent when it comes to dissipating away moisture while running up and down the court . It also does n't shrink unless of course you put the dry cycle on extra hot . Do n't too that or you 'll end up with a shirt 2 sizes smaller . Believe me I 've done that by accident .
 I have finally found a shirt that is comfortable and does not soak in the sweat and become heavy ! Great for running in the gym and outside . I have used these shirts for all of my races and at the gym and have no complaints . It drys failry quick if you are running a long time outside . Just do n't put this shirt in the dryer it will eventually start to shrink in odd ways ! Definetly will buy a lot more of these shirts before they stop selling them !
 I 'm 6 foot 3 and I would prefer the length of this shirt to be longer but its acceptable on me . I like the feel and fit while working out but I 'm not sure how durable this shirt will be after a few washes.I would order this product again if needed . Item was received as ordered in a timely manner .
 The quality of this shirt is good however the color is more of a maroon , and not a cardinal red . but nice shirt just a darker red/maroon
 I use this shirt for weight-bearing workouts . I also have Russell whisking shirts with sleeves , but this one has a perk that the others do n't
 Will get more . Comfortable under uniforms etc. . easy wash and dry fast . Color stays w/o fade . Great true fitDurable
 Great Tennis shirt at an even better price . This shirt was a present for my brother in law and he loved it .
 I have been wearing these for a number of years and they are the best . All colors look good but I prefer the black as it covers up sweat from a tough workout the best . That is one of my big issues with the cotton workout shirts is after a workout they look terrible . These are also made very well and if taken care of will last a long time , a few years for sure . I think these are simply the best workout shirt for the money on the market . I am a bit disappointed today in that they do not have any in stock to order , bummer .
 This shirt is just what I wanted . A sleeveless shirt that wicks . My girlfriend tried to help me and washed my biking clothes . When I put it on the next day I noticed all the stitching around the sleeves was coming apart . I asked her if she ran it through the dryer and she said yes . This would probably have happened anyway , but the dryer definitely sped up the process . This is a cheap shirt that comfortably does the job .
 Feels great and keeps me cool on runs . No complaints about this shirt . I think I 'll order a couple more . Plus it 's a lot lower cost than most other similar shirts .
 First thing 's first . The lenses of these glasses are purple , not black . I ordered these thinking they were all black like in the picture but was surprised to find that although the rim is black , the lenses are a dark purple . I love purple though so it 's fine , but it might be an issue for those that want a pair of all-black glasses . I ca n't comment on their durability since I only just received them , but they feel really sturdy . I tend to treat glasses very poorly so I guess we 'll see how they hold up to my personal strength test in the next days . : -RRB- As for the size and shape , they 're not too big or too small . I have a larger-than-average head and these were not small on my face like most sunglasses yet they 're not overly huge . I can see these being big on some girls and scrawny guys . As for the shape , they look exactly like the ones on the picture.Overall , for $ 3 , these are awesome .
 For the price I 'm really happy with this glasses , just a little big the shape of the lens.Great service too .
 I bought these in both white and black . I saw a couple reviews and pictures showing damaged lenses/frames upon arrival , but mine were in perfect condition . As for the size , I have a fairly large head but these fit just fine - no annoying squeezing . The lens size is perfect , IMHO , just barely larger than my eye sockets -LRB- sorry , no ruler to measure them -RRB- . The one thing to keep in mind is that these are ~ $ 5 sunglasses and you can easily tell that just by handling them . They feel pretty light and delicate , but for what they cost , I 'm very happy with them .
 got them before the days that was given by Amazon . great glasses i wear them all the time and i am going to buy more .
 ... they are inexpensive , have UV protection , but they are a little snug on my head . Maybe my head is just wide .
 I really love these shades . I 've already bought two pair unfortunately due to the first pair breaking from being roughly handled in the front compartment of a jet ski and the other pair from my hungry dog . These are worth buying again and again .
 I love it great product A + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +
 Do they look like Ray Bans ? Ish . Are they comfortable ? Ish . Are the affordable ? Yes ! It 's nice having the `` Ray Bans '' look without having to pay the Ray Bans price . I never have to worry that these will get scratched or broken because if they are , I can just get new ones for practically nothing .
 Purchased the item online and when item was received , I was pleased to see that the quality was good and image on online site was a good pick of the real thing ... thanks for the listing .
 Cotton is the way to go and the shrinking was expected but now the comfort is well worth it and looks nice .
 I bought two of these ten years ago , and they are the best . Still good after all these years . And I disagree that they are too roomy -- they have fit me perfectly .

 I own the Austin Reed dartmouth blazer in every color in which they make it -- it is a staple of my business wardrobe . Well made , quality fabric , nicely tailored , classic lines , appropriate for a professional woman . -LRB- something that can be hard to find at times -RRB- It should be noted , however , that the periwinkle and raspberry colors are lovely , but the fabric and buttons are slightly different than the `` classic '' colors -LRB- lighter -RRB- and the linings and interfacings are not as substantial as the brown , navy , camel , red and ivory . It 's still a good value , particularly as these are colors appropriate to warmer seasons and climates , but I was a bit surprised .

 Fits just right , material is a nice weight . very warm . Columbia products are always nice . ca n't go wrong with this vest .

 Absolutely a fine purchase . I really like this vest -- the fit , the breathability , the warmth . Excellent quality . I recommend it highly .
 My wife wanted one for Traveling , got it , Love 's it , She is very Happy and i am very Happy . Thanks
 We are very pleased with the Vest that we purchased and are looking forward to giving it to my Father in Law for the holiday . I am sure he will be happy . Sizing looks accurate as does fabric and style . It will be a great gift for him
 This is a great vest . I ordered a medium , I am a 38 &#34; in chest , yet the medium was too big for me really -LRB- if you want a close to the body fit -RRB- . I will get this vest again in a smaller size and other color .
 This vest is of decent quality , not quite as good as the previous Columbia fleece vest as it is thinner . The color is more of a faded black or dark grey than black . I think I would have been disappointed if I had paid full price but for $ 25 it is worth it . I would buy it again .
 everything in order , very good quality product , service stock.came charging according to the agreement.excellent , recommended to all users .
 I ordered this as something to layer underneath my work jackets . It fits well , so it should be comfortable when layering . Even if this just lasts through this winter , it was a great deal at this price.I have a lot of Colombia jackets -LRB- fleece , rain shell , omni-heat jacket , etc. -RRB- , and I have never been disappointed .
 I bought this to layer under my coat when the weather dips below freezing . It 's comfortable , soft , and keeps me warm . I also like the blue color . Dropped one star because it seems to be made for people with pot bellies . I 'm 6 ' 1 180 and the medium fits perfectly lengthwise and in the shoulder/chest area but there 's a lot of extra fabric in the middle .
 Nice color and Im wanting to buy another vest different color . I highly reccomend to buy , columbia has great cloths .
 I wear this nearly every day in the office to stay warm . It 's fleece is perfect , and I love the freedom to move my arms . Size is perfect . No complaints .
 Great extra layer to add during the winter months for a fair price . Looks great too around the office or at home .
 My son and my husband loved their new vests . They love the feel and fit and the colors . I will have to remember to get them some more .
 Very nicely made Vest.Columbia has great products.Like the texture of the material.Pictures on amazon page could be better .
 The fit is not too loose and the cypress color is a gray-green cross . Nice neutral color for men . This was purchased for use in winter time , but it 's rather thin to wear alone . It 's better suited for use in spring-time or under a jacket since it 's not bulky .
 Great ! The fabric felt very gentle , and it 's very light . My husband love it very much . I also introduced it to our friends , one of them placed an order , so I bought it again . The size is a little bit bigger .
 The product was made well . It looks good has a lining but I found that it was not as warm as a similar product purchased over 10 years ago . I did not return it as when the weather gets warmer or when I will wear it inside .
 I have been wearing this vest everyday since i got it . the color is great and the warmth is perfect . its not cold enough to wear heavy down jacket but this is just right for the cool days and nights here is S. Calif. thank you
 I ordered this one night , and had it in my hands within 3 business days - with regular shipping . It is a very good layer to add to any winter gear . It has two side zip-up pockets , and the collar zips all the way up if you need . It is super lightweight , and very warm -LRB- for a vest -RRB- . This vest does stop a tiny bit of wind , but not much . On a cool rainy day , wear this underneath a non-insulated rain jacket -LRB- shell -RRB- , and it 's perfect ! -- Very nice !
 This vest was exactly what I wanted . It has a furry texture -LRB- not all fleeces have that same texture -RRB- ; it has pockets that completely sewn into the garment -LRB- some sew it only on one edge -RRB- ; it has room in the pockets all the way to the side edge -LRB- and not just to the edge of the zipper -RRB- . The fit was good ; the sizes run large , so a L fits an XL person . I am very please and will probably purchase another .
 Fleece is fleece , but this vest is surprisingly well put-together . The only thing is it missing is a third pocket -LRB- the small vertical one near the left center that most other vests have -RRB- .
 I was very satisfied with the vest . I would get a size smaller than your usual size , they run big .
 Works for what I wanted . Something to wear while walking in cooler temps , where I did n't want a full coat .
 This product was first class -LRB- not a second -RRB- and was as ordered and on time . Ca n't get any better than that .
 This vest is soft yet rugged , true to size and just right for my son for Christmas .
 Estoy muy contento de haber encargado &eacute;sta prenda . El color es muy suave y elegante . La prenda es muy c&oacute;moda .
 i liked this vest , , , the texture of the fabric is ideal for all season with style the thing is there is not enough pockets , , , , , , but it really serve my life style , , , , ill going to buy two more , , , i love it.i recommend this vest for all walks of life in style .
 Just the right weight to be outside in the Fall or Spring doing things . Keeps you warm without restricting mobility . Looks good and is very functional .
 very nice vest . light yet warm enough and not too hot during warmer days . the run a little big , I ordered a Large and had to exchange it for a M and I run on the larger side ... in all great buy I would recommend to a friend hands down ...
 I lost a vest that I previously owned , so I was looking for one to replace it . I am very satisfied with the fit and color of the one I purchased .
 Not the first vest of this type from Columbia that I 've purchased . Exactly what I wanted , soft , light weight but provides the warmth I want . Seems easy to mantian , wears good over time , easy to fold and carry if not needed . Satisfied .
 Have several different brands . . this is the best value of all ... fits great quality stitching and best price of all seen
 Extremely pleased with this purchase . After having ordered the wrong color by mistake , i quickly ordered again . Came exactly as described and within given time . No disappointments here !
 The vest is great -- second one I 've purchased ; however , the zipper , as the vest ages , has a tendency to pull apart at the bottom . The reason is the very short insert piece . Increase the depth of the insert and this vest would rate 5 stars . I bought my first vest at Mervins and when they went out of business I never found this make of vest again until I checked Amazon.com -- a great source and great products .
 I bought this vest for a casual look around the office and not at all disappointed . The sizing is about average , the look is great , and as it is Columbia , the material is of good quality . It will keep one warm in the winter months .
 He likes it . A basic black vest . Seems well made unlike some brands whose zippers are not the best quality . If you are not broad shouldered though the sleeve area in the large size is a bit &#34; wingy &#34; looking . My husband is tall but not bulky so it is a little too big in that respect .
 Second of the same type for me . Perfect for cool weather . Yes indeed . comfy warm not restrictive . All one could ask .
 Columbia gear seems to be priced much lower than other companies like Patagonia and North Face but I feel like the quality of Columbia 's clothes stands up.This vest is exceptionally warm and comfortable .
 The most important factors for me when purchasing a vest were warmth and comfort . This vest is just what I wanted in both categories . It gives me just the right amount of warmth when I go for my morning run without getting too hot once I get warmed up . It 's also comfortable and soft . The pockets have zippers so I can put my keys etc in there and do n't have to worry about them falling out . The only fault I can find is the zippers jingle a bit as I move . Overall I 'm happy with my purchase .
 I got two of these , the blue and the Cattail , which is just brown . They are nice and warm . They look good . They run a little bit big . I got an XL , and I usually wear an XL in everything . I 'm probably right in between a L and an XL . I 'm 6 ' and 240 lbs , if that helps you order yours correctly .
 My son really loves this vest . We ordered two in different colors . It looked very nice on him and he wore it every other day with jeans . A great vest !
 Bought this for my dad for Christmas . He really llikes it . Fits really well and was just as promised and described .
 Perfect fit - this was purchased for an elderly person for indoor wear . It 's not black and it 's not grey - more like graphite . It is very lightweight and keeps him cozy and warm in these cold months .
 This was a great purchase for my husbands birthday . Very well cut and designed using quality materials that wear well . I purchsed the navy color and it is a very nice shade more of a navy/grey that goes well with everything . My husband wears a size 42 jacket so I purchased the large since the medium I bought him before fit a little too close for his liking , the large is a little roomier . Columbia is always a good product and the price was good too .
 This is a beautifully made vest and my husband loves the color -LRB- bark -RRB- . From another review I was tipped off that the vest runs large , so I got a size smaller than my husband 's usual size -LRB- XL to L -RRB- . It fits perfectly .
 This vest is just right when a jacket is too much , or when a less bulky additional layer is needed . It is true to size and is well constructed . I plan to add other colors to my collection .
 Quality is good , not as thin as some said . Fit is small than usual . I wear a medium usually but was glad I got a small .
 The vest is comfortable and is made well . The size is my only reason for giving 4 stars . The vest runs on the large side . If you want a tighter fit you will have to order at least one size smaller than what you normally wear . It would be better with an elastic draw string too .
 Bought this for my son in college after he asked for a black fleece vest for his birthday ... He thought it was perfect .
 Got my Columbia Cathedral Vest yesterday . Fits great and does it 's job perfectly.Paid 36 $ for it and its worth the money . It 's also much cheaper than similar products from North Face.Great for a run !
 First off - I am very happy with this purchase as it is exactly what I expected . And for the price , it 's hard to complain.The vest fits very nicely , i got the green large . I 'm a male 5 ' 11 '' and about 190 lbs . It fits me very nicely . Sometimes these vests bunch up around the gut looking dumpy but not this one.I have washed it a few times and it seems to be holding its colour , shape and stretch . It blocks the wind nicely and is perfect for cool autumn weather/early winter when it 's not too brutal but a t-shirt just does n't cut it.The collar is one it 's best features - it folds down nicely to keep your neck warm or you can turn it up to avoid the wind . The material is very soft and feels great on your skin.As for complaints , I find that i really miss having a breast pocket and I wish the pocket zippers went up to open as opposed to down.Since neither of these features were advertised , obviously i ca n't complain about their absence - i just prefer them and will be looking for both on my next vest purchase.One thing that I will knock off a star for is the depth of the pockets . They are quite shallow causing things to fall out easily - especially if you are sitting . If you are going to make a jacket with shallow pockets i think the pocket zips should go the other way ... Just make sure you remember to close the zips ! you can fit your entire hand in if you are trying to stay warm , but there is almost no downward angle to make a good pocket for holding your keys , phone or wallet.While we 're on the topic of zippers i will say that the quality of the zips on this jacket is top-notch . it will open or close from almost any angle and i would be very surprised if they stopped working.At $ 20 it 's hard to imagine a better purchase !
 Columbia fleece vests are the best I 've ever owned -LRB- it 's the third Columbia fleece I 've purchased -RRB- . They 're warm and very durable without being too bulky , making for a good fit and a nice appearance .
 My Significant Other needed something easy to get into because of shoulder surgery ... Perfect for him ! The warmth is wonderful ; the sizing worked out great . He did n't have a vest like this , but now he 's talking about getting another one , in another color . Pricing is perfect too . Ca n't think of any negative !
 Dumb me , I ordered the wrong size . No problem with this purchase . It was easy to return and reorder the correct size . Credit came through for this purchase with days of me shipping wrong size back . This firm is `` On he Ball '' when it comes to handling a situation like this .
 While I do n't get too excited by clothing , and this is no exception , I do find this is a well made , comfortably warm vest , that I am glad I purchased .
 I wear this as an insulating layering or by itself over a shirt . It looks much better than my Columbia fleece which does n't have much shape . I like that it is super light and moderately warm .
 I ordered several of these in different colors . The quality is great and the sizing is true . Furthermore , they have come out of the washer & dryer looking like new each and every time . If additional colors become available , I wo n't hesitate to order more .
 Ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas . Beautiful red shade , and fits extremely well . He is very happy and I was pleased that it arrived so quickly and in perfect condition .
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He is very fussy and almost always finds something -LRB- even if it is really minor -RRB- wrong with anything he either buys or receives . He has worn this vest 3 times and has only had it for 6 days ! The fit was on target a large is a large . The craftsmanship above average . The price very good . This large fit nicely over a bit more belly than desired but would still fit well minus the extra pounds .
 I bought this vest for my husband for Christmas . It was perfect . He 's 6 ' 2 '' and about 220lbs and the XL fits him perfectly . He loves wearing it . It 's great for Southern winters were it does n't get too cold .
 This vest is very warm . It fits snug to your body keeping in your core body heat.The pockets are large . . perfect for someone who likes to carry a lot of things with them.The collar can be flipped up to cover more of your neck , or folded down when it 's not as cold.The fleece is very soft , and the vest overall is made well . I recommend this vest if you ` relooking to keep warm this winter . . either worn solo or as part of your winter layered clothing .
 Definitely get one size smaller than what you normally wear . I almost always wear an XL and when I tried this on it was baggy and roomy and with an item like this you want it to be snugger .
 I bought this for my husband because he likes a fleece vest with a collar . He is very pleased and the vest looks great . The collar is big enough to really keep the wind off your neck .
 Its comfortable , warm , a little short in length but overall a really nice vest for me to wear in all types of weather . If I had to complain about one thing it would be that it is not fleece like I thought it would be so make sure you know what you 're buying . Other then that a nice product though !
 The vest fits well and is well made . If it had a zippered breast pocket it would be ideal and would get 5 stars . I would order it again .
 I had to replace a vest the job gave me because it was wearing out . I decided to order these vest in different colors . They go great with whatever I wear at the job . The quality is good for the money . I 'm known as the vest guy now .
 fits great , the blue is amazing , its warm but not too warm , I simply love this one . also got the black one and this a great product .
 I received just what I had ordered , which was the same brand I 've always worn and it was received very quickly before the expected date was even close to being up . I love my Columbia vests .
 I gave my husband this for Christmas and he is pleased , so I am too . Looks good , is comfortable . Have only had it less than 1 week .
 Honestly do n't know what 's all the hype about the North Face is . The good old Columbia looks great , feels comfortable and is well made . Navy color is very pleasant to the eye . I am very happy with the vest .
 My husband absolutely loved his vest I got him . We have even bought these in different colors . We would recommend this to anyone looking for a vest to wear as a casual attire or even a dressy attire .
 Bought this vest for my brother and he loves it . I really liked the color of it because its so different .
 The fit , number of zippered pockets , and quality of fabric are all in keeping with a fleece vest that might have cost $ 15 or so more .
 Got this as a present for my dad . He loved it . Ordered an xl should have gone smaller product runs big
 Fits great and what a great price -- medium weight - true to size for mens large . Priced locally at $ 65 dollars
 love columbia products , it helps keep my chest warm so I can lower the heat in the house during the daytime .
 This vest is exactly what I wanted , lightweight yet warm , does n't hinder arm and shoulder motion ; very soft comfortable material .
 I chose thie vest because of the brand and color . It is good quality and stylish . Shipping was fast . I 'm happy , happy , happy !
 Wonderful vest at retail price , the Amazon has outdone itself.For $ 12 + tax , it seems like a steal to me.The material is very soft and of good craftmanship.thank you , Amazon and Columbia
 This product is a good value . Nothing spectacular , but a good deal . I use it as a good layer for skiing to provide warmth for my core without restricting shoulder and elbow movement . It more than adequately provides what I need .
 Every piece of Columbia clothing that I own is top quality and this is no different . It 's a lightweight , and yet warm vest perfect for those crisp fall days .
 I bought this as soon as the Winter cold hit NM and love it . The XL I first purchased was a bit short -LRB- I 'm 6 ' 5 &#34; -RRB- so I then bought an XLT which I put in the morning and wear till I retire at night . Excellent warmth and comfort . Excellent value for money .
 These vests are the most comfortable and great lookingAnd are very affordable and go great with any causual outfit
 My wife bought a couple of these first . I saw them and liked what I saw . Then I learned that she had bought a men 's vest , so I was pretty sure I could have one , too ! The zipper on the pockets is necessary , since the bottom of the opening is about even with the bottom of the pocket and things can fall out . I found one that fits my chest but it is loose at the waist . I will probably take a seam in a bit to correct that . The material is pleasingly soft and warm . They clean up in the washing machine.My wife 's two vests are the same size , but the waistband is larger on one than the other . They were manufactured in different countries .
 Great extra layer for the winter.Very good quality . Generous pockets.Extremely comfortable.Logo over the breast is pleasantly inconspicuous .
 Most of my winter gear is from Columbia and I 've never had any complaints about it . It 's about half the price of a comparable North Face garment and works just as well .
 Like all Columbia products , this item arrived true to fit and size . I purchased this item for my husband and he wears it all the time . It washes well and is very durable . We have had this product for two years and it still looks and feels brand new .
 It 's hard for me to find some shirt with right size sleeve and collar . But that would be a problem for a vest , :-RRB- . I do n't like the zippers on the pockets , i never put any stuff in the pockets . Overall , this is a good vest for me , I wish it a little bit warmer .
 Columbia sizes are really big so just be a little conservative in ordering for sizes . Buy is for less than 20 bucks for getting value .
 I was satified with the product my only concern is that the color was off black insteadof black .
 One of the better purchases I 've made , in terms of satisfaction and value.The product is well-made and durable , which you come to expect from Columbia . It can be had for a good price and should last for a long time . Fits true to size , zipper works fine , and it does its job
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He finds them to be warm yet keeps his arms free at work . This Columbia vest is very nice and thick . Very nicely made and of good quality .
 Bought this for my husband , and he really liked it . The vest is generously cut and well sewn . It 's also very soft and the color is true and pleasing.Just right for those chilly nights when a long sleeved sweater would be `` too much . ''
 Ca n't beat this vest especially for the price ! I have purchased 3 of them !
 My son was very pleased with this vest . I liked the price for a name like Columbia Sportwear . I also liked how fast it was sent to me .
 The vest is comfortable and roomy , though not the very best of materials .
 This was a gift for someone . From what I saw , he was very pleased with it . The item arrived in a very timely manner .
 This was a Christmas gift for my husband that he actually loved . Thanks for a great buy . Will be back !
 I 've had this vest for about a month now & I really do enjoy it.I 've had similar vests in the past , but I needed something newer to wear around the office and under my winter coat when a sweater or hoody just does n't work.The vest is very soft & does n't get caught on much . I bought the dark grey hoping that it would `` hide '' my dogs hair unlike the black vest . And it does . I have a beagle , and I can barely notice when -LRB- a few/decent amount -RRB- of his white & black hairs get on it . Some fleece seems to attract dog hair & never let go - this does NOT.The only negative I have about this vest , as others noted , is that there is n't a pull string around the waist . This has n't really bothered me , but I would like to tighten it up just a little bit.I work outdoors so this is perfect for helping me layer up but allowing me something to wear that wo n't bulk up & slow down my arm movement which happens if you wear too many sweaters or hoody 's . I plan on buying another in a few months so I do n't wear this one out too much . Awesome price too . I checked a couple of stores online and no one had the same price as Amazon .
 I just want to say that is the best way to keep you warm , high quality product and very comfortable .
 My experience with this Columbia vest made me feel it was spot on for size . The side pockets a bonus for a mid-layer piece . The vest itself let me wanting a little more . The collar is double the weight of the main body of the vest . It is a nice vest but thin for use as a mid-layer . I myself would have preferred if the body was equal to the collar in weight , but for the price I paid I 'd have to say it matches the quality . I guess I expected a little more from Columbia , as I own other products from them that always went beyond my expectations . Guess I 'll just have to be a little creative in my layering to get the best use out of this purchase . The style and color are nice , but I also got the `` bunching '' effect during active use , maybe better as a low activity use item , walking around town and such . It really comes down to what you 'll be using it for , activity level and quality of other layering items .
 Ordered the Large in Green color and was a great value . Quality was excellent as you would expect from Columbia .
 These vests are well made , stylish and fullfill their purpose exceptionally . They provide a little extra warmth at home when the thermostat is set down low to save energy . But being sleveless they do n't make you sweat . The sizes are exactly as specified . I normally wear large in shirts and jackets , and the large vest fits perfectly .
 Warm and made well and comfortable . Husband wears a large but had to order in medium size . He loves it but beware it runs large . Price was great too !
 Bought this at half the price to replace an old Columbia vest in which the zipper fell apart after a year . Wore it 5 days a week for work so I got my monies worth although I paid full price for that one .
 Columbia Men 's Cathedral Peak VestAmple sizing for stout waste . Soft , good feeling fabric with good zippers and warm comfort.Good color and value for a casual look.It can be worn most of the time for a light jacket or coat . Easy to maintain .
 Like the columbia fleece product they are soft . I got the same product from a discount store and it was cheaper even after tax . I have to rate it as 4 because of the product quality .
 We 've been wearing our own Columbia vests for quite some time here in Wisconsin , but it only recently occurred to me that it was just the thing for my 93-year-old dad in Florida , who 's often cold , despite fairly warm temperatures . He loves the vest 's softness and is enjoying having something more youthful and &#34; cool &#34; to wear . I 'm happy to know that it 's easily machine wash and dryable .
 I picked this up to use as a stand-alone or extra layering depending on the temperature . This vest is great - it 's like wearing a soft fleece blanket.It fits easily under all my jackets or sweatshirts . A nice bonus is the zip pockets - they 're great for my phone or warming up my hands very fast .
 I like Columbia garments for myself . So I bought one for My Dad for Christmas . It fits well in the XL and is nicely made.Washable too !!
 Quick service , good price and no complaints after wearing this for a month . Considering ordering another in a different color .
 Great vest for cool sunny days . Vest is a little on the thin side . It looks great and feels great . The only problem occurs is that it lets wind in and out very easily . I would recommend this to a friend , but do n't look for a whole lot of warmth from it .
 Awesome vest . Better than expected , well packed and arrived quickly ! I give it 2 thumbs up and my highest recommendation !
 A gift for my Grandson , quality and craftsmanship excellent , could not ask for a better product , or reliability . Thank you for a great fitting product , my Grandson absolutely loves it .
 What 's to review ? It is fleece , warm , I picked the color and got what I wanted . I did get a better price than I expected.Here is something review-worthy
 This is a good vest and I enjoy the heck out of mine . I actually own two in different colours , since I was given another one several years ago for my birthday . There are already a lot of reviews and opinions here so I will not be too redundant.The vest is Polartec fleece -LRB- 200 mid-weight -RRB- so it keeps the core warm and comfortable down to about 40 degrees F. Any colder and I must go to a higher tech solution . It works wet or dry , and drys pretty quickly if soaked.It 's a cozy piece of gear and I think a perfect gift item for a loved one since they will think of you in the comfort and warmth of it . I actually LIKE that short fuzzy fibres starts to clump and pill like a snuggly , familiar stuffed teddy bear after only a few washings . I often use it as a throw blanket or a pillow -LRB- esp on airline flights -RRB- . It is also very easy to maintain and as I have two , I often have one in the wash as I 'm wearing the other one.I like the roomy sizing as I use this for layering , and this is an intermediate layer . When zipped all the way up , it practically serves as it 's own Polartec scarf around the neck . Being a taller/larger human , I appreciate that this vest is available in extended sizes too.The design of the vest is simple with a stand up/fold down collar , 2 zippered side slash pockets at the waist , and the Columbia logo on the chest.Herein lies , my first minor criticism ... value . For a simple , unlined vest without any `` extras '' -LRB- like chest pocket , map pocket , interior pockets , drawstring at the bottom or the waist , throat abrasion guard , dbl access zipper , uppers shell , back hook loop , even zipper pulls with whistles , compasses and LED lights -RRB- I would expect a basic level price . If you shop around even online you should quickly get a feel for what the no frills model vs. the all the bells and whistles model are comparatively worth.The two pockets that it does have utilizes this elastized sateen material as the interior . Not only is this pocket lining not very warm , but I find that it snags uncomfortably on little dry skin flakes , hangnails , and tiny dry skin spurs on my hands . It might be just me , but it makes it unpleasant to put my hands in the pockets -LRB- for warmth -RRB- . On both of my Columbia vests , I have replaced the pocket liners with nice non-snagging flat mesh -LRB- like that found in luggage pockets -RRB- . Well the world is what you make of it , so of course I have made some heavy mods to my vests , which have made them my favourites and practically daily wear for me.Columbia makes consistently high quality products -LRB- overseas -RRB- geared toward the outdoor person , so paying a little bit extra for the brand name logo is not that painful I guess .
 This vest is very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear . Most of the time I wear it with short sleeved shirts . When zipped , it 's just right for those 45-50 degree days -LRB- as long as you 're not out in the chill for really long periods - but fine for car-to-store , or short walks -RRB- . It 's also great around the house when you want to drop the thermostat a few degrees to save a little on heating costs . My only disappointment is the main zipper . Sometimes it takes several tries to get it started , and it often sticks mid-zip -LRB- as if there was grit or something in it -RRB- . It always ends up working , but not always smoothly . I 'd definitely recommend the vest , and I suspect my zipper issue is not a design flaw , but rather a production glitch , which would not likely affect other buyers .
 I have purchased Columbia products I have liked in the past . So this was not a difficult choice form me . It is sized correctly for the big guys . I ordered a xxlt and it fits just the way it should . I nice way to add a bit of extra warmth under a jacket that need a little help . Good price and a quality product that was shipped fast .
 Ca n't beat the price , but the vest is larger than I thought a large would be - should 've got a medium .
 This Columbia vest is a quality product and is equipped with a durable zipper , style and feel .
 Purchased two of these for Christmas gifts . Was very impressed with the quality . Would definitely buy again !
 I bought this for my husband last year , for Christmas . At this point in time , no complaints at all from him . Washes well and wears well , and its light color does n't show white dog hair , which was a must for a new vest !
 Quality is good but I need Longs and they dont seem to have many longs
 This is my second Columbia vest and I really like them . I would recommend this vest to anyone . I like to wear it to work with my dress shirts and ties . Looks sharp .
 I have received this Vest , It is according the picture and it is beautiful , I like the color and I recommend to the people buy this product .
 This vest is the best value in a fleece vest that I 've found , hands down -- for quality , comfort , durability ... I travel constantly and I like the charcoal color because it shows no lint , hair etc. . I lost one of these and replaced it immediately . It 's perfect for layering in cool or cold weather ... but also for that little extra warmth I need in a refrigerated movie theater . -- When I replaced my lost vest I looked at other brands again and was reminded that this Columbia vest is the best thing out there for the money ... by far .
 Lightweight . I wear it mostly at night in my hammock to keep warm throughout the night . Layers well . Added a drawstring at the waist . Easy to do but would have preferred it was included .
 Although the product is great . It was not the exact color as published . It does not have a different color on the neck
 It was wright for what I was looking for . It arrived in good conditions but the coulor is a bit different that in the picture anyway it fits well , thanks .
 As it usually happens , Columbia makes the best and tis vest is not an exception . comfortable , nice and well made .
 All I wanted was a basic vest for cool summer days . Does the job perfectly . Will not stop the wind or keep you very warm - but if you are a guy needing pockets for your wallet - this works well .
 I have wide shoulders -LRB- 50 Regular suit jacket -RRB- , and the XL fit me perfect . I was especially pleased with the collar - which was shorter when popped than the previous Columbia vest I had owned . My previous fleece vest from Columbia lasted me about 2 years , so I have high hopes for this one as well . Very soft , great fit , extremely comfortable and versatile .
 Purchased this vest as a team vest for our local biathlon team . The fit was slightly large , but that is good for winter wear . The length was just below belt line . This is ideal for keeping the lower back warm while skiing and also shooting . Everyone that got a vest on our team was very pleased with the fit and the look . Great for training and looks good too !
 I love these , they are so silky ! I wish there were more than two . I had no problems with them . I even got them caught on something and they did not snag !
 I bought two of these ten years ago , and they are the best . Still good after all these years . And I disagree that they are too roomy -- they have fit me perfectly .
 This is a really nice shirt . I thought the fit was excellent . Looks good after washing several times . Getting 2 more for gifts.I really like the slightly longer placket with 4 buttons.When I wore the first one for the first time , 3 people in my group for dinner made nice comments about how they liked my shirt .
 Thanks Amazon for introducing a new American Cottons style.The mini houndstooth check is really very nice . Good colors and wash very well .
 excelent quality - true to size and quick delivery - how could you ask for more . Shirts are long but I am tall so I LOVED it
 Nice shirt for the price !
 These are great shirts . I say that they run big.These are 100 percent cotton . If you live on the coast these are great shirts . The colors and the shirt looks better in person . I purchased five of these myself . The good thing is they do not shrink in the dryer
 It 's worth for the price . It will be nice , if there is one packet .
 I was afraid to order these online being hesitant of fake or second hand products . I received my Ray-Bans in good condition as the description stated and love wearing them daily . Comfortable product . Will definitely shop at AMAZON again .
 Great jeans.Classical style.Low price.Wearing only jeans , levis always loved.Happy New Year!Amazon Forever!I love it .
 This hard to find style arrived on time . These classic jeans fit just the way they should . Going back for more colors .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Slim Fit Jean is leg looks like so long , . . but lap so tight but leg looks like so long . .
 My husband like it . . although I have to cut the length a little bit . . He said he may buy more in the future . . Hopefully they have shorter length then .
 They are Levis what more needs to be said ? Theyre the only jeans im buying from now on . They fit great and last 2-5 times longer than any other jeans ive bought .
 I use to wear the Levis low boot cut , but they discontinue to sell the color I want . After I give this one a try , I like it so much .
 If you know your size they fit . I do n't understand the reviews that say the sizes are wrong . Will buy again .
 was just what i expected ... very pleased with purchase . I like the fact that you can get 29 inseam . You can not get that in the store . No need to get them hemmed !
 his pants in overall line is still very good , sturdy , feels soft to the touch on the skin , the profile legendary cutting adds a touch of elegance , and even after several washings the fabric remains the same and does not shrink , the only thing I did not like the pants is that they have deteriorated the quality of the clips and metal buttons , formerly of copper and bronze , and now this are of aluminum and does not look good , however I recommend buying them are very good at the price .
 These came a little long , maybe an inch or two . Seeing as many others have noticed this is a problem with this fit , I suggest going one inseam size lower . I ordered a 30 '' and they fit more like a 31-32 '' . Other than the sizing , they are great jeans , and still look great on me . The boot cut allows the extra length to bunch up a little around the shoes , so you do n't really notice it . It actually looks good.I wish they sold these in a low rise version , as I do n't like hiking them up to where you might put dress pants or khakis . They stopped selling the 517 in a low rise though , so I 'm happy to wear them as is , great fit .
 My husband LOVES these jeans . They are a GREAT FIT , especially in the seat . The legs are n't too wide in the thighs and the bootcut bottom make a terrific silhouette . I like how he looks in them and he says they are REALLY COMFORTABLE . They look best in the darker color and are a good pair of `` dress jeans '' as well as versatile . We are ordering more . Ladies , get him these jeans !
 I 've worn Levi 's for over 50 years . From the days when you had to roll up the cuffs because they only had one length to super bells in the 70 's and now my favorite 517 's . They are always true to size and the workmanship is always excellent . The service at Amazon is always great too . What more can I say , I am one satisfied customer .
 These boot cut Levis have always been my favorite jeans . I had not had any in a while , so when my order arrived I immediately tried them on . I forgot how well they fit , and they are really stylish . Awesome . Will be ordering more .
 Authentic , just as described . Fast delivery . I am very satisfied with purchase . Smooth , one stop purchase . Husband will be very happy on Christmas day ! Thank you .
 My grandson loves these jeans , since he 's rather tall we were glad to find Levi 's makes great jeans in his size . Strange as it may seem , many brands of jeans do not come in a 34in length .
 As an active equestrian rider , and a woman of 59 years , I 'm ALWAYS looking for comfortable jeans that sit at my waist -- I do n't like women 's jeans at all - the fabric in women 's jeans seems flimsy , and the low-rise , hip-hugging jeans for riding or leisure wear feels uncomfortable . The men 's Levis and men 's Lee jeans are very comfortable , and they can handle my active life -- for me , men 's Levis 517 bootcut jeans have best variety for colors , and toughest quality in fabric .
 Nice one . . Boot Cut with nice fit.Ordered the Jeans with 29L but got it 3inch longer . So I had to do alteration , usually I order my pants with 29L and it fits perfect on me .
 Levis 517 's fit me better than any other jeans that I 've bought . Gon na stick with them . I wear a 38 waist , 36 inseam . Have bought several pair over the past six months from various places and they all fit the same . Good quality control !
 Well , they 're Levi 's . There you go . Best jeans on the market . Last forever and fit great . The black does fade to gray quicker than I would like , but that 's probably because I wear only black , all the time . So ...
 I have worn Levi jenas for the last 16years , i am relatively tall guy and seldom get my size in the store , Amazon provides me my size and then quality as well .
 Purchased two pairs of Levi 's Boot Cut Jeans for my husband , the Jeans are very hard to find in the stores . Since my husband is tall , it is hard to find 36x36 .
 These pants are very well put together and I am a big fan of Levi 's pants durability which is what prompted me to purchase these .
 I am a woman but men 's jeans fit me better . These are very comfortable . My jeans do NOT get hung up on my boots as they do with jeans that are not boot cut .
 todo salio perfecto , tanto el envio como el paquete recibido , estan esplendidas , la hora de llegada fue la establecida por el vendedor
 Quality jeans , but not made in the USA.Arrived quickly and each pair were individually bagged in plastic.Good fit , for me .
 Fit well at the waist and look good . Last a lot longer than most most jeans and seem to get more and more comfortable the more you wear them .
 I like this style and they are getting very hard to find . The price here was the best I found , got in a timely manner . I 'm happy with my purchase .
 Purchased these jeans for my husband . They have a nice fit and look very good on . No baggy butt like the relaxed fit jeans .
 I usually have a hard time finding good bootcut jeans with the right fit in the retail stores . If the color/wash/fabric is right , the size isnt . If the size is right , the fit is too loose at the seat and thighs . Now that my favorite pair of jeans is past its prime , I started looking for a new pair to replace it . After hunting all stores in and around my area and trying all available bootcuts in my size , I was very disappointed . That is , until I found a pair of Levi 's 517 Blue Ox in the local Macy 's store . This was the first bootcut I found in the last 3 years that fit me perfectly . Since I already had a pair of jeans that was of a very similar color , I came online and started looking for the correct color in that fit . Unfortunately , it wasnt that easy finding one online . Kohls , Dillards and others had Levi 's 517s , but they werent the same ones I saw in the store . Apart from Macys and Amazon , no other site -LRB- including Levi 's own site -RRB- had the same fit in Rancher Light color I was looking for . I could have ordered at Macys website , but my past experience with Amazon was stellar and so it my first choice . Even then I was a little skeptical if the photos were close to how the jeans looked in reality . Since amazon had a free returns on this one , I went ahead with the order . The product , as always with Amazon , came 6 days ahead of their estimated delivery date . The jeans is , in fact , very close to the pictures on the website and the fit is PERFECT !! Thanks to Levi 's for the perfect color and fit and KUDOS to amazon for the perfect shopping experience !
 Finally Levi went back to 7 belt loops instead of the five . Makes a big difference for those of us that work for a living .
 I bought the 517 as I prefer this cut to any other one of the Levi 's catalog , I place it even above the so famous 501 . I 'm fully satisfied
 I love these jeans . The wash and fit are great . That being said , they did arrive with a hole in the seat and the seam is a little crooked on the inside left leg . I really do n't care though because they fit so good .
 It is hard to find male , black , slim fit , boot cut jeans . Believe me I searched many places both on-line and local retail outlets . Finally I found these on Amazon and they were just right . Great fit , looks good , and the price was reasonable . I highly recommend them .
 We will take these to alterations but they were about 5 inches too long . Otherwise they are very nice .
 True to size , did n't shrink , and minimal wrinkling . Love the variety of sizing - son is tall and thin , and hard to fit , but Levis 517 made it happen !
 I bought two pairs in two orders - both were perfect - exactly as I expected . On time . Good buy at a decent price .
 These jeans are tough but good looking and fit well . Amazon 's price is great , they are a good value for the money , and we always get prompt delivery and easy return if size is not right .
 the product is excellente , but needs to be taggedcorrectly , I order 34x30 tag say so , but real size was36x32 try buying them from differet source , and same thing never can get athe right size until i took a mesuring tape to the store and mesure before buing them !!
 I love those Jeans . . nice shape and denim . I ordered different colors from this pant and I love them all . it is comfortable , and have a nice leg openning that falls around the boot .
 I have been wearing 517 's for as long as I can remember . They fit perfectly and have remained unchanged for years .
 These boot cut jeans by my favorite jeans maker are exactly what I needed.When I ordered my Harley Davidson boots , I needed pants for when I wear them and these ones are the only ones that fit on the outside where others ca n't . Shopping local yields nothing like these , just junk not worth the money.Quality is what I 've come to expect from Levi 's , outstanding with fit absolutely perfect.More orders coming soon for these.Shipping was prompt , making this buyer very happy.Thank you to everyone for helping this lonely guy that hardly can get out to shop by bringing them to me.Again , THANK YOU VERY MUCH !!
 I thought these were more on the casual side , but after putting them on , they can pull off a nice look . Very comfy , one day to break in . No frays , quality zipper . Dimensions were perfect . Overall color is a shade or two darker than in the picture . Awesome , new favorite pair .
 If you have a problem with jeans bagging in the rear , then these jeans are for you ! They are a great fit and very comfortable ! My husband loves them !
 It 's a very good pant for my husband . Nothing too special or fancy ; he is very satisfied because he got what he expected
 execelente producto muy buena calidad , el pantalon vino en un excelente empaque y llego super rapido deverdad no tengo quejas lo recomiendo
 He looks hot in them , thanks ! What more can I say ? They did n't stay on for very long ... ca n't share any more details .
 I was somewhat hesitant to order Levi 's online but I could n't be happier with this order ! The jeans are exactly as described and fit perfectly . They are genuine Levi 's and are of the highest quality - not seconds . I ca n't recommend this seller highly enough .
 They 're good sellers and the product is very good , I like so much this jean . Ellos son muy buenos vendedores , el producto llego rapido a mis manos y era el esperado , los recomiendo ampliamente .
 I wear Levi jeans every day . Levi 's are the only jeans I will wear.I have worn Levi jeans for the past twenty -LRB- 20 -RRB- years ... or longer.Levi jeans are great ... in fact , i 'm wearin 'em right now ...
 Sent me what I wanted . 15 more 12 more 11 more 9 more 7 more 5 more 3 more done
 These jeans come washed so they are soft , supple and ready to wear . They are pre-shrunk so order the size you wear . I choose boot-cut jeans because I wear 12 '' - shaft western boots . Levies are the only jeans I wear because they fit well , look good , and get better with age .
 These jeans are perfect for the guy who wants to wear boots and not look like a geek or a thug . Just the right combination of loose and fitted .
 This is my first pair of Levi 517 's and I have to say I am very impressed . They sit on my natural waist -LRB- not low-rise like the 527 's -RRB- , and are fitted in the seat and thigh , and then flare out below the knee to fall on the boot . I 'm 6 ' 3 '' 190lbs and have a 36 waist and 34 inseam and it fit perfectly . Hard to find jeans these days that sit on the waist ... I 'm not a fan of the low-rise look or feel , so these jeans were a great find .
 Came to Amazon to order these jeans for my husband since no one ever has his size , 36x36 . I was pleasantly surprised because I did order two of these in different colors , Rancher Light and Rinse , both of which were the perfect colors . Perfect light colored jean and perfect dark colored jean . My husband and I are very hard to fit in jeans and tops so when something works we often get multiples , the problem however is that sometimes we buy the exact same thing in a different color and they fit totally different . Not these ! These jeans were great and the same fit ! Some people might not be able to appreciate that as much as I , but I was very grateful . It was a risk I had to take since his size is so common , but with free returns I had to take advantage . The boot leg is also very subtle but incredibly flattering . He does wear boots but of course they are n't necessary . I would say they are very true to size and great quality . They are currently his `` good jeans '' ... . that is until he `` accidentally '' wears them to go work in the garage . But when that happens , because it will , I will be back to purchase more ! By the way he is just over 6 ' 3 '' about 230-240lbs .
 i traveled 80 miles one day looking for the jeans i like with no luck , it did make for a nice bike ride though ! then i went online looking and i found what i was looking for at amozon these jeans are hard to get in my hometown!Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut JeansWhat a nice pair of rugged jeans . And I got them so FAST !! Thanks again.Roxann Hill
 Good product , on time and as shown in Amazon.But ... years ago , ordering the same # jean and the same size always brought the exact same fit and look . Lately , the same length , for instance , some times is a bit too long -LRB- can be fixed -RRB- or a bit too short -LRB- bad news -RRB- . The price to be paid for savings by manufacturing offshore . Lets see if with the crisis we return to the memorable `` MADE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ''
 What can I say ? They are Levis . Perfect fit , excellent quality , and the most impressive thing was the price . Unbelievable !
 The only problem was I had was that I had to have them hemmed 2 &#34; so as not to walk on the cuff . I would have ordered them shorter but they were not offered in the waist size I needed . The waist fit perfect and having them hemmed was not that big of a deal . It coast me $ 12.00 to have them hemmed .
 I love being able to find the 517 's on line and not having to run all over town for the style and size I need .
 If you promise not to tell anybody , I wear lined jeans from eddie bauer or llbean when it gets cooler . I wear these when it gets warmer . True to size , do n't shrink too much .
 These are great jeans , they do tend to run a little big , both on length and waist . The color was a lot more bluer then it looks in the picture , so be weary of that it . It was too country , and I needed more rock and roll , if you know what I mean.Pros
 I was a bit concerned about this purchase . My husband likes the boot cut style and that was an excellent choice for my purchase . I have zero compliants other then I wish I 'd bought more !
 they were exactly what we were looking for . the orginal 517 , these are my hubby 's most favoritie , they also hold up better than the other styles seem to
 Will have to wash several times for them to fit . I buy this size all the time from other retailers and they are n't this big . Like the color and the style . They just run big I guess . Mainly in the length . Would buy again , just a smaller size .
 The fit is nice , the color is holding up through the wash . I am glad they have different sizes then the stores . Very hard to find 33 x 36 !
 I like the way these jeans fit.The are also comfortable.The ones I have purchased previously have been durable .
 d e m a r a v i l l a e s t e m o d e l o muy bueno
 These are the first jeans in a while that actually fit my waist size , inseam and the leg openings are perfect .
 These jeans fit well but the denim seems less hefty than the denim of the same 517s from 5 years ago .
 These were ordered off Amazon when I could not find them locally . I found the pants and they are describer perfectly and fit exactly as I had wanted them to . I will buy more in the future because they were perfect .
 Completamente satisfecha con el producto , exactamente igual a lo que ofrecieron . LLego en el tiempo estimado que prometieron . Ninguna queja , volveria a comprar de nuevo .
 The Levi jeans were just like I expected . The fit was perfect and received them in just a few days . Thanks !!
 The quality of the denim is lighter , so the good fit disappears by the end of the day . Otherwise , I like 'em !
 Hubby dearest was so happy to find boot cut Levi jeans at Amazon as it seems most stores have quit carrying this style of jean . He likes to wear boot cut jeans and Levi jeans are his favorite brand.No complaints about the fit or wearability either . Ordered two more pairs of jeans today as he 's a happy camper.Recommend .
 Good deal on the jeans and speedy shipping . My first pair of boot cut jeans . My girl friend really likes them on me . I got the dark blue -LRB- rinse -RRB- . Fit good and comfortable .
 My skinny son is 54 years old and will not wear any other jeans - only 517 , boot cut Levi 's so I know what to buy for Christmas and Birthdays . I found a perfect fit for my skinny husband also .
 I ordered these jeansLevi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jeanfor a Christmas gift a short time before Christmas . I knew the size . I was somewhat concerned that I would not get them on time for Christmas The package came just before Christmas , and the jeans were exactly as pictured , nicely packaged -LRB- each pair separately enclosed in plastic bag -RRB- , the right size and color . I was very pleased , as was the recipient of the gift !
 The jeans were a Christmas gift and a style regularly worn by the recipient . They were a perfect fit . They are hard to find locally so we ordered from the Internet . The red tag on the back pocket did not say `` Levis '' and I have never seen this before . Is it significant ?
 Wow . These are great blue jeans , and they come in 38 long which is what he wears . HE wanted the boot cut , and a 34 waist was large enough . Usually he wears a 36 , , but I ordered 34 and they fit just right . Great looking , great price .
 Great product ... my dad was very pleased . He had not been able to find the 517 .
 These were a birthday gift for my son and I had them sent directly to him at college . He loved them and they fit great ! Good quality for the price . He liked the fit of the boot cut .
 These are great jeans for us gals , too , especially if you like to wear a true black color . I dress them up with a feminine camisole and heels , and have got many compliments on them .
 Exactly what my hubby wants . It 's difficult to find his size in our local stores . Very happy Amazon now has Levi 's in his size .
 I love my new bootcuts . I received them quickly , They fit perfectly . Thank you .
 I 've grown frustrated by the lack of good quality/reasonably priced jeans in the market today . At some point , the Levis brand started to suffer in terms of quality/value for the dollar . Do n't remember exactly when that happened , but I started to buy my jeans from Banana Republic . Over time , they stopped making the style I grew to rely on . This created a 7-10 stretch where I could n't seem to find a good pair of jeans . Most recently , I purchased a pair of Lucky jeans - ridiculously over priced . When those began to fail , I tried Levis again and bought these . For a third of the price of Lucky Jeans , these Levis boot-cut jeans are really nice . They have a really substantial feel/weight to them and I could n't be happier with the purchase . I was so pleased , I ended up buying a second pair .
 Levis 517 Boot Cut Jeans are just as advertized . Good fit and a perfect boot cut . I highly recommend them for anyone who needs boot cut jeans .
 My wife thinks it 's funny that I rate my jeans with numbers , but , as a former 505 's man , I now prefer the 517 's 'cause ride my horses more and were my boots more ... plus , they just , plain feel good when they 're on me ...
 Who does n't love Levis ? These are great ! My son was happy on Christmas day and so were we . Happy Holidays !
 It is great to find the exact size , color , and fit you want in a Levi 's jean , and also get it on time .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean , Medium Stonewash , 38x29They fit perfectly . Will probably order more in a couple months .
 Needed a size that few brick & mortar stores keep in stock . Amazon had style I wanted in the size that I wanted at a good price !
 These blue jeans where a great color and a perfect fit . Glad I ordered them . They were a present for my son
 My husband has been wearing Levi 's since he was a teenager . They are the most durable jeans and he loves the boot cut .
 I 've been wearing these for years.They do tend to fade easily so wash them inside out and use a detergent product for black fabrics .
 I bought these as a gift for a friend who has worn this style for years . Good quality , good fit , good style .
 They fit just perfectly and I am very happy to not only get the bestdeal around but beat the sales tax . Good old Levi 's rigid , bootcut jeans have been my all-time favorite jeans my whole life , andI just turned 60 . Got 'em within a week , free shipping faster thanexpected , so that was cool , too . Amazon rules !
 The pants are great . I can not seem to find them in stores like Kohls or Target where I usually shop . I 'm not skinny as far as a skinny person goes but I have thinner legs than a lot of guys . These seem to be not as loose in the butt and thighs . I usually get the 505 's but they are cut a little bigger assuming tree trunk size legs . I have runners legs and these work . If you have big footballer legs , forget about it .
 Finally jeans that fit like the old Levis , these are the old quality heavy denim stuff not that wimpy pre-wash thin as paper junk denim . I would highly recommend these jeans to anyone who 's familiar with real Levis .
 Very easy shopping . I 'm familiar with the pants so it 's just a matter of price and convenience.Sitting at the desk for a few second beats driving to the store , finding out they do n't have the 517 in my size and driving back home . I 've always had trouble just finding the 517 at stores and shopping online sure makes things easier . The pants themselves are everything they 've always been , good fitting and tough.It 's nice to add the stonewash to my collection of darker denim so I do n't look the same every day.I was upprised how fast they came and that 's a big plus too .
 These jeans fit to size perfectly -LRB- for me -RRB- , are comfortable to wear , and have adequate material to reach a guy 's waist ... not hip-huggers . I 'll buy more of these ! Not a deal-breaker by any means but I would prefer them to not have the size label outside ... it seems Levi 's always does this .
 Amazon did not mentioned in the description that this pair of jeans is a Shrink-to-Fit fabric . No question on the quality . . it 's still an amazing jeans , the great Levi 's jeans , never goes out of style ... Take 31 '' waistline x 30 '' inseam if your size is 30 x 30 .
 Levi 's are always the best jeans around . Levi 's Boot Cut are the only kind my husband will wear . Always a good fit .
 Very high quality . Several pairs have consistent fit . Have bought and worn these 517 boot cut jeans for several years .
 Great black on black bootcut jeans . They have even gone back to adding two additional belt loops a feature that went away several years ago .
 Fits well , my husband loves them , quality control met , consistent sizing , and look good on . Will order more as needed
 My son wears a 36 Waist x 36 lenght which is very hard to find . The Levi 's Men 's 517 are about the only jeans he likes and these fit him perfectly . They were shipped very quickly and the price was excellent . They were a birthday gift and he loves them .
 The jeans were pre washed and fit just like I wanted . They were really softer than I expected . I would buy this product again .
 I was so happy with the quality and fit ; I ordered 3 more pairs ! I will be good on jeans for awhile . The price was good too .
 Great quality and a lower price , for me is like a tailored jean , I 'm happy with this product . No more to say thanks to all
 After numerous failed attempts at the 527 's on amazon I finally got a clue and got these jeans . They are PERFECT ... great fit ... weight ... etc. ... just like the jeans I wore in high school 20 years ago ... . I 'm already thinking about a second pair . The light rancher is the perfect color ... . As for the 527 's MADE IN BANGLADESH ... amazing they could ever bear the levis name ... perhaps they were counterfeit . Thanks amazon for my true and needed exchange . The original pair of jeans I ordered ... yes the 527 ... was complete trash . These 517 's are real jeans for real cowboys ... and I 'm not one ... but I do wear a ton of boots ...
 Exellent product
 Finally found levis that were the correct size , if they are still available I will order more in the future
 Great pants . I wish there was a size 33 by 35 . I always have a hard time with pants size . I can get a length 34 , which shrink after a wash or a 36 that drags because there too long . But there is no length 35 in pants , so I do n't have much of choice .
 Excellent product the product I come very well and it is what was waiting of , I come in time , good
 I bought they for my boyfriend who had lost a bit of weight and all his pants were falling down , but these fit and stay up -LRB- Thank God -RRB-
 My husband loves the fit and the price.Great deal.You can dress them up or down!Look no further.Great looking jean , for the price .
 Bought these jeans for my husband . They fit very well and look nice . The shipment arrived on time . I was happy with my purchase .
 I ordered these jeans an exrta size longer becaause I wanted a high cuff . Got exactally that . Perfect !!! Now I 'm looking for a white pair
 Well , its a good jean , everybody know the levi 's quality , the item arive in perfect conditions . . so nothing more to say . .
 Perfect fit , every time . 517 's are difficult for me to find locally , but buying on line thru Amazon is best for me .
 These are like they used to make them ! More belt loops , great fabric - love them ! Ca n't wait to order more of these !
 I was having a really hard time finding the boot cut Levis - no one seems to carry them anymore . These are just what I wanted . They look and fit good .
 Bought these for my husband and they fit true to size , maybe a little bit long but not so much that he wo n't wear them . He love them , they look good so I love them ! Great Pants !
 I ordered these jeans for my 16yo son & he really liked them . The only thing he would have preferred was a lower rise , but he 's wearing them without complaints . : -RRB-
 I bought 2 of these and man they are nice . I 'll admit the guy wearing the jean in the picture sold me . Like I went and look for all the style of Levi 's , and these attracted me the most . Although I would n't tuck in my shirt like that . But they sure look good with some chucks and or casual boots and a dress shirt , with a silver wrist watch , and a pair of shades . They are heavy , and for me kinda tight even though jean of a different brand and style with the same size , fit me perfectly . I do n't know I guess it the way they are made . But for the look , I 'll take the pain any day , yes these jean are so tight mostly in my thigh area and waist , that I do get a little discomfort pain in my lower back . I guess it the way they are design and the heaviness of the jean . Of course I am in the process of getting in shape again . So with time , these will be perfect . I do like to sag a little , but as of right now I ca n't with these . Until I lose some of that belly fat I accumulated over the years .
 These are the jeans I always buy , they are a great comfortable fit . It is also great that Amazon stocks the size I need , it 's impossible to get from the shops .
 My body was made for Levi 's brand jeans , and I 'd worn through a couple of pairs . I bought duplicate black 517s - soft but not washed out , dark , with a predictable fit . They are my new favorites . The process went smoothly . Who knew I 'd be buying clothes online ?
 I ordered these for Christmas for my 6 ' 2 '' grandson who had grown out of all his pants after checking stores and finding his size is almost impossible to find . They were perfect and he loved them .
 This is a very good price for this product , it 's the second one I 've ordered for my son .
 I received my pants very quickly . I was concerned that my size would be too short for boots . I was pleasantly surprised that the designer was thoughtful about the shape and length for this item &#34; after &#34; several washings . Pants are about 1/2 inch longer than the average pants which make them perfect for cowboy boots . Pants are also very comfortable . JCD
 Noticed that they even have an extra pair of belt loops compared to my previous order . They are sturdy & dependable .
 The jeans were great ! The price was right , they were delivered in a timely fashion , and I lost a few lbs to get in them and I look good . lol . I recommend this company .
 These are the only jeans my son likes . He is tall and I have trouble finding his size in local stores and I could not find a better price .
 The jean came very quickly . They were the proper color , size , and cut . The packaging was excellent , and so was the quality of the jeans .
 Perfect price and fit for my husband . I would recommend this jean to any &#34; baby boomer &#34; who loves boot cut jeans.The jean has not changed at all good quality material and the right color . Thank you .
 This pair of Levi 's fits perfectly and the indigo color is the same as the Levi 's I wore back in the day !
 I gave these Jeans to my daughter 's friend for Christmas and he really likes them.He is real thin and wears motorcycle boots.He likes how they fit and loves the boot cut.He especially likes the rugged material .
 My order arrived in a timely fashion , they fit good and look great ... I 'm gon na get a couple more pairs .
 Levi 's 517 ` sThese Levi 's were the perfect fit . I like the fact that they are pre rinsed , which makes the fabric softer .
 I have always appreciated the fit and quality of Levi jeans . The boot cut has a closer fit around the knee with comfortable room in the hips and waist . What Levi Strauss needs to understand is that there is a huge population of men out there that has a 31 inch inseam . Men between 5 ' 9 &#34; and 6 ' fall into this size range . My growth did not stop at 30 &#34; inseam , and did not make it to 32 &#34; . So I either buy high water jeans that show my socks , or I let the cuffs drag the floor which signicantly reduces the life of the jeans . I liked the fit enough that I spent an additional $ 10 to get them hemmed to 31 .
 product arrived as expected on time , the product was as expected and the quality was as you 'd expect to find in a brick & mortar store .
 Great fitting . I usually buy the 527 style but they did n't have black in that style . Ordered a 517 instead and love the fitting .
 The fit and look are great and I saved a few dollars . Will purchase more when the price is right
 love this jeans , the fabric is really good and the cut is impecable . it is original and the communication was really easy , i recieved really fast .
 I 've always wanted a ` black 527 ' but found out I could only get that in rigid black.I decided to try 517 n whao I might just decide to continue with 517 even with other colors.Just the perfect fit I love .
 Is exactly what i was looking for . . i being using this model for years , and this pair of pant are excellent
 BASTANTE BIEN . BUENA CALIDAD DEL PANTALON . ME QUEDO MUY BIEN . TANTO EL LARGO COMO EN CINTURA . EXCELENTE COMPRA A UDS . GRACIAS .
 The jeans are a good deep color . Wish they were n't quite as thin as jean material seems to be getting , but seems they are all like that now . Overall a good pair of jeans.These are hard to find in 36x36 , so I 'm glad Amazon carries them .
 Perfect fit right out of the box . Started wearing immediately , stitches , pockets , zipper perfectly in place . Survived several washes good as new .
 Good price , perfect quality . Very good model for young and old-aged people . Gorgeous color . Classic zipper . I 'm satisfied ! I recommend to buy it .
 These jeans fit me very well and look good . One thing I noticed however is that the denim has a more coarse feeling compared to other Levi 's jeans . I would buy these again .
 IL TELL YOU I HAVE BEEN WEARING LEVI 'S FOR YEARS ON END AND THE BEST DEAL I GOT ON THESE GREAT JEANS WAS FROM MY FAVORITE STORE AMAZON
 I love these jeans . For me they are perfect . Long enough to wear with or without boots and the fit is not too tight . How can you go wrong with Levi 's ?
 I got what I ordered promptly . I wish I had ordered a different color but -- my bad . No complaints . What else can I say ?
 The jeans was just perfect , the material , size and colour , nothing to complain about , and great timing too.They fit really well , and amazon 's size chart was very helpfull .
 Style & size stayed true since the last time I bought a pair , after gettingLevi 's Men 's 527 Low Rise Boot Cut Jeanthat are nothing like they used to be that 's all a shopper can ask .
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut . Black 42 waist / 30 length . If you are short , stocky and have a big butt . These pants are perfect . They wo n't bunch up at your fat knees and they will last a long time before the zipper explodes . I suggest you buy the next size up because they will shrink after 6 months of washing , drying and severe stretching in the seat area . Great pants .
 MY FAVORITE JEANS FOR 25 YEARS . I HAVE WORN MAINLY 501 MODEL , SO I READ MANY REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING THESE 517 JEANS.AFTER THINKING FOR A LONG TIME I DECIDED TO BUY ONE SIZE BIGGER THAN USUAL . IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE.THEY ARE JUST FINE , BLACK COLOR AND ZIPPER FLY WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DETAIL FOR ME !
 My husband 's body type includes slight pot belly and skinny hips and thighs . Almost impossible to find pants that fit well without being either too tight in the belly or looking baggy in the seat and thighs . He used to wear Levi 's Action Jeans which were boot cut jeans with slight stretch in fabric and a slight crease in the legs . These jeans always looked and fit great ; real snappy . Unfortunately they 're no longer available . Then went to wearing David Taylor Flexjeans from Sears which were almost as good . However , he now find that although Sears still sells jeans by this name , they are no longer the same . They are now made in China and are made from a crappy fabric and no longer fit the same . In desperation , he started looking thru available Levis products and found Levi 's 517 . Advertised as slim in seat and thighs . He did not expect much but was pleasantly surprised to find that they are indeed somewhat slim in the seat and thighs , even though the pants he bought had a waist size slightly larger than minimally necessary , thankfully allowing him to breathe . Bottom line was that he was very happy that these pants are not so tight in the waist that its hard to breathe , but still slim enough in the seat and thighs that they do n't look like old man 's jeans . Just wish they had the snappy look of the old Levi 's Action Jeans .
 I bought a pair of these in 29X34 and they are great . Fit perfect , really like the cut , lighter weight material but not too light , should hold up well . Just wish they would reduce the size of the internal tag -- I 've actually had to tuck it back into the pants a few times after putting them on !
 Finally figured out what cut and size I like , but the only place I can find them is the internet . Great pants .
 Many of us do n't want to wear our Levi 's half way up our bellies . 517s are the best answer for that !
 A well tried and true blue jean that I 've been wearing for decades . The fit , finish , and quality is a good as or better than ever .
 These seemed a bit darker in person than pictured but they were a great pair of jeans for my husband . This is his favorite style of jeans and he needed a new pair of &#34; dressy jeans . &#34; Same great jeans as in the past .
 All the Levi 's I purchased for my 16 year old son were ` made to fit ' ! From the straight to boot cut , they all were a perfect fit for his personal taste . They are well made and very stylish .
 Great jeans , great price , speedy delivery as promised ! Will definitely be ordering them again since my son is so tall and slim and this is one of the only places I can find his size .
 Great basic jeans in hard to find sizes . Not much to say otherwise . They have washed up well and held up well for my long and lanky teen .
 Jeans are a little tight in the thighs for my husband . It did n't come with packing slip so I 'm hoping I can return them !
 Good quality but I wish I had done more research on the colors . Ordered rigid because of the look online however the denim itself is rigid .
 Yes , these Levi 's are everything I had hoped they would be and More . Perfect fit , and I 'm very pleased tofinally have a BLACK pair ! Amazon 's got another winner !
 I am a creature of habit . Being of slim build I have found the 517 Boot cut to be the perfect jean for me . I also know my size so the fit was great as received . This is not always the case when ordering over the Internet . Service was great delivered on time as expected .
 These are the best jeans Levis has to offer in my opinion . They are not light and flimsy like some jeans Levis are making these days . The medium stonewash is a great even color . They do n't look faded on the seat and thighs or dingly and dirty like so many jeans do . These jeans are rugged , comfortable and last a long , long time . On top of that they look great . These are the only jeans I will buy .
 These jeans are everything they say they are . We will definately order these jeans again when the time comes . Thanks !
 100 % recomended , i have no doubt that i am going to buy another , it is really regular fit and boot cut
 This is the only jean my husband wears . He has the hardest time finding 36x29 . This is a perfect fit for him . When he needs more I will return to amazon .
 I finally found a pear of jeans that my wife said they look good on me and after being washed still fits great
 Great fit for my long legs ! Hard to find jeans my size but Levi 's always comes through for me ! a
 Ordered these for my boyfriend , they run extremely small , he regularly wears a 32/34 had to send back and get a 36/34 . Other than that they 're great jeans .
 Finally a pair of Levi 's not only affordable , but a pair that is the real deal . . not seconds or blemished . . but cut perfectly . . The best I have bought in years . . Thanks . . and `` I 'll be back for more ''
 I am happy with the jeans and how they fit , but usually when I get 517 's , they are really stiff and then I get to break them in . This pair was already like pre-washed , just differnt than what I am used to , but I still like them and will wear them . Maybe I have to look into differnt types and find exactly what I am looking for next time . Thank you
 I 've been wearing 517 's for a good , long time now , and I love 'em ! The problem is that most of my local stores that sell them -- and very few of them do -- price them highly and also drastically limit the selection compared to the more popular 501 's and 550 's . Additionally , these jeans are often skipped over when it comes to the big sales . Well , shopping for them on Amazon is a decision I should have made long ago . The price here is hard to beat.As for the jeans themselves , they are of the rugged quality that Levi 's is known for . They fit like the product photo shows
 Have had these jeans for a few weeks now & am very satisfied.The flair from the knee down is discrete and does not look like the 70 's bell-bottoms . The fit on top was precisely as marked . The length seems about 1/2 inch longer than sized on the 501 's . Was formerly utilizing 501 slim fit jeans but found that could not place them over motorcyle boots . The 501s were great for rainy rides , but look too much like a cowboy , when tucked into the boots .
 As always , good shopping at amazon.com . Its always a problem finding the right length jeans for me . I found that in this levi 517 Boot cut jean , it feels good to finally find a jean that is not too short . A fact that i would have loved to know before i bought this jeans , is the leg opening size . This jean is very tight around the thigh area . I would just like a bit more details on the product a next time round . Other than that , it always a good shopping experience on Amazon .
 The length and waist were perfect . The quality of Levi jeans was the same as they had always been , good
 I always had to keep pulling up my previous pairs of Levi 's -LRB- any model -RRB- because they only had FIVE belt loops . A key ring and cell phone are not that heavy . I remember growing up with Levi 's having SEVEN belt loops and a heavier canvas . I was pleasantly surprised to see the ` new ' Levi 's 517 now have seven belt loops again . I started to buy a different model , but they still only have the five loops.I just bought a couple of these pairs from Amazon . I did check online at Kohls and their current batch of 517 's still show 5 loops . I will have to wait until I go to the store to see if their stock has been updated . Kohls prices are higher than Amazon , but I will recheck when they go on sale . I still check Amazon first for almost all my purchases.Overall , I like my new Levi 's jeans . I will compare them with older ones to see if the canvas really is slightly thinner . Outsourcing manufacturing almost always results in poorer quality and non-standard sizing . It has 100 % results in putting Americans out of work . I try to buy American whenever I can -- hopefully it will catch on.There is another issue appearing after I washed my new jeans with my old ones . It should n't have made a difference , but the new ones are now covered with fine fluffy hairs . I will have to use a lint brush when I take them out of the dryer for now . Although it may just be a ` break in -- first washings ' issue.Overall , I rate these jeans 4 stars . I will have to wait for a few machine washings to see how the color holds up . I may be old fashioned , but buying jeans looking like they are 1/2 wore out or have holes in them is ` less than optimal ' .
 I ran around town to find my husband Levi 517 's in size 35x32 for Christmas . In the stores , there were stacks of all different sorts of Levi 's to go through . Finally I came home and ordered them through Amazon and received exactly what he wanted . These Levi 's fit perfectly and look great . Very happy they come in off size waists . Thank you for making my job easier and receiving nice fitting jeans .
 I 've grown up wearing Levi 's and in particular 517 's in my adult life . I do like that Levi has added additional belt loops in the past year or so . Over the years Levi has cut some corners in manufacturing , but not enough to discourage me from continuing to buy their stonewashed 517 's . I like the stonewashed jeans since they are ready to wear , unlike the rigid indigo Levi 's that have to be washed several times to soften them up.I am buying more and more items from Amazon for the free shipping and competitive prices . It just saves a lot of time going to a retailer only to find out they do n't have my size or what I want . Even with Amazon collecting California sales tax , I figure the time and gas saved from having to go to a retailer is well worth it .
 These were a secret gift for my brother-in-law . He keeps complaining that he must do laundry every other day because he only has one pair of work pants , but then he just will not go get more or let anyone buy him any ! So , I got the size off of the one pair of jeans he owns -LRB- laundry is at my house -RRB- and I bought several other pairs that were similarly worn . I sneak in a new pair about once a week and so far he has n't noticed that he now has three pair of work pants . When I slip in the new ones , I put them in the dirty clothes hamper he uses . I wonder if he knows his pants are multiplying yet ?
 They arived bfore time , APO adress , in Afghanistan ,1 week took it to arive here , im suprised , and they fit good , i dont hawe no words
 36 &#34; inseam jeans at a reasonable price are hard to find . I really like the fit of these jeans just wish there were other kinds in the same length .
 Just what I expected . After soaking and drying , the fit and feel was as anticipated ... just like the good , old days !!! -LRB- I would estimate that length and waist both shrunk by about one inch ... as Mama warned , some 50 years ago -RRB-
 i got two pairs for my husband . levis are the only thing that fit him right . They make him look like he has a butt !
 I like this product because it fits very well and is comfortable . I recommend it to others . Good for those who like to wear boots .
 The Levi 's 517 Boot Cut were purchused as a replacement of the wrong ones bought at a local store , These ordered & delivered ; I was told fit greatly before & after ; washThe price for my buying , totaled out a nuff less even with shipping to come fromamazon , rather than a store , even on sale after my tax & shipping ; -LRB- as a late gift -RRB- Theonly guestion I got was about , they did not have the Levi 's cardboard shelf tagswe see on Jean 's in store .
 I love my levis . I was unaware they came in black . I bought a blue pair and black pair , Ilove them
 Just as described ! Fit & look exactly what he needed and wanted . And he said I could n't find this product ... LOLThanks !!! The Wife wrote the review ...
 These jeans fit great . The boot cut gives a good look without being sloppy . My husband looks hot in them .
 Got these as a gift for my brother , and they are the true blue classic with a great slim shape . Perfect `` date night '' jeans .
 These are the only jeans my husband will wear and we could not find them ANYWHERE . When i found them here i was happily suprised with the discount price and they look great . Would buy again from this seller .
 Excellent transaction on hard to find size and style Levi Jeans.Reasonable price and quick shipping.I 'm very pleased with this purchase !
 jeans were shipped quick , arrived in good shape the medium stonewash has that worn look most people want , I am pleased with the purchase .
 It 's very good ! 100 % cottonThe higher rise sits comfortably at the waist.A fit you want from a brand you trustFit width & length ; !
 non common size request was delivered promply before Christmas . My son was very happy with the fit and color .
 I bought two of these ten years ago , and they are the best . Still good after all these years . And I disagree that they are too roomy -- they have fit me perfectly .
 LOVE this tote . Beware it is very LARGE ! I have the smaller tote and have used it as a work bag for the last five years ... still looks new ! The company is very professional , customer service is awesome ! Get the bag , you wo n't regret it !!!!
 I was looking for a headpiece for my wedding that would not be as showy as a big tiara but still elegant enough to give me that simple , classic , sparkly look . I was very happy that this item achieved that look quite perfectly . The quality of the material is very good and it fit my head very well .
 I have been using this bag fot over a month now everyday and there have been no signs of ware . Truely an excellent bag .
 This was a great purchase for my husbands birthday . Very well cut and designed using quality materials that wear well . I purchsed the navy color and it is a very nice shade more of a navy/grey that goes well with everything . My husband wears a size 42 jacket so I purchased the large since the medium I bought him before fit a little too close for his liking , the large is a little roomier . Columbia is always a good product and the price was good too .
 This is a beautifully made vest and my husband loves the color -LRB- bark -RRB- . From another review I was tipped off that the vest runs large , so I got a size smaller than my husband 's usual size -LRB- XL to L -RRB- . It fits perfectly .
 I wear this nearly every day in the office to stay warm . It 's fleece is perfect , and I love the freedom to move my arms . Size is perfect . No complaints .
 Great extra layer to add during the winter months for a fair price . Looks great too around the office or at home .
 My son and my husband loved their new vests . They love the feel and fit and the colors . I will have to remember to get them some more .
 Very nicely made Vest.Columbia has great products.Like the texture of the material.Pictures on amazon page could be better .
 The fit is not too loose and the cypress color is a gray-green cross . Nice neutral color for men . This was purchased for use in winter time , but it 's rather thin to wear alone . It 's better suited for use in spring-time or under a jacket since it 's not bulky .
 Great ! The fabric felt very gentle , and it 's very light . My husband love it very much . I also introduced it to our friends , one of them placed an order , so I bought it again . The size is a little bit bigger .
 The product was made well . It looks good has a lining but I found that it was not as warm as a similar product purchased over 10 years ago . I did not return it as when the weather gets warmer or when I will wear it inside .
 He likes it . A basic black vest . Seems well made unlike some brands whose zippers are not the best quality . If you are not broad shouldered though the sleeve area in the large size is a bit &#34; wingy &#34; looking . My husband is tall but not bulky so it is a little too big in that respect .
 Second of the same type for me . Perfect for cool weather . Yes indeed . comfy warm not restrictive . All one could ask .
 Absolutely a fine purchase . I really like this vest -- the fit , the breathability , the warmth . Excellent quality . I recommend it highly .
 My wife wanted one for Traveling , got it , Love 's it , She is very Happy and i am very Happy . Thanks
 We are very pleased with the Vest that we purchased and are looking forward to giving it to my Father in Law for the holiday . I am sure he will be happy . Sizing looks accurate as does fabric and style . It will be a great gift for him
 This is a great vest . I ordered a medium , I am a 38 &#34; in chest , yet the medium was too big for me really -LRB- if you want a close to the body fit -RRB- . I will get this vest again in a smaller size and other color .
 This vest is of decent quality , not quite as good as the previous Columbia fleece vest as it is thinner . The color is more of a faded black or dark grey than black . I think I would have been disappointed if I had paid full price but for $ 25 it is worth it . I would buy it again .
 everything in order , very good quality product , service stock.came charging according to the agreement.excellent , recommended to all users .
 I ordered this as something to layer underneath my work jackets . It fits well , so it should be comfortable when layering . Even if this just lasts through this winter , it was a great deal at this price.I have a lot of Colombia jackets -LRB- fleece , rain shell , omni-heat jacket , etc. -RRB- , and I have never been disappointed .
 This vest is just right when a jacket is too much , or when a less bulky additional layer is needed . It is true to size and is well constructed . I plan to add other colors to my collection .
 Quality is good , not as thin as some said . Fit is small than usual . I wear a medium usually but was glad I got a small .
 The vest is comfortable and is made well . The size is my only reason for giving 4 stars . The vest runs on the large side . If you want a tighter fit you will have to order at least one size smaller than what you normally wear . It would be better with an elastic draw string too .
 Fleece is fleece , but this vest is surprisingly well put-together . The only thing is it missing is a third pocket -LRB- the small vertical one near the left center that most other vests have -RRB- .
 I was very satisfied with the vest . I would get a size smaller than your usual size , they run big .
 Works for what I wanted . Something to wear while walking in cooler temps , where I did n't want a full coat .
 This product was first class -LRB- not a second -RRB- and was as ordered and on time . Ca n't get any better than that .
 This vest is soft yet rugged , true to size and just right for my son for Christmas .
 It 's hard for me to find some shirt with right size sleeve and collar . But that would be a problem for a vest , :-RRB- . I do n't like the zippers on the pockets , i never put any stuff in the pockets . Overall , this is a good vest for me , I wish it a little bit warmer .
 Columbia sizes are really big so just be a little conservative in ordering for sizes . Buy is for less than 20 bucks for getting value .
 I was satified with the product my only concern is that the color was off black insteadof black .
 very nice vest . light yet warm enough and not too hot during warmer days . the run a little big , I ordered a Large and had to exchange it for a M and I run on the larger side ... in all great buy I would recommend to a friend hands down ...
 I lost a vest that I previously owned , so I was looking for one to replace it . I am very satisfied with the fit and color of the one I purchased .
 Not the first vest of this type from Columbia that I 've purchased . Exactly what I wanted , soft , light weight but provides the warmth I want . Seems easy to mantian , wears good over time , easy to fold and carry if not needed . Satisfied .
 Have several different brands . . this is the best value of all ... fits great quality stitching and best price of all seen
 Extremely pleased with this purchase . After having ordered the wrong color by mistake , i quickly ordered again . Came exactly as described and within given time . No disappointments here !
 The vest is great -- second one I 've purchased ; however , the zipper , as the vest ages , has a tendency to pull apart at the bottom . The reason is the very short insert piece . Increase the depth of the insert and this vest would rate 5 stars . I bought my first vest at Mervins and when they went out of business I never found this make of vest again until I checked Amazon.com -- a great source and great products .
 I bought this vest for a casual look around the office and not at all disappointed . The sizing is about average , the look is great , and as it is Columbia , the material is of good quality . It will keep one warm in the winter months .
 This was a Christmas gift for my husband that he actually loved . Thanks for a great buy . Will be back !
 I 've had this vest for about a month now & I really do enjoy it.I 've had similar vests in the past , but I needed something newer to wear around the office and under my winter coat when a sweater or hoody just does n't work.The vest is very soft & does n't get caught on much . I bought the dark grey hoping that it would `` hide '' my dogs hair unlike the black vest . And it does . I have a beagle , and I can barely notice when -LRB- a few/decent amount -RRB- of his white & black hairs get on it . Some fleece seems to attract dog hair & never let go - this does NOT.The only negative I have about this vest , as others noted , is that there is n't a pull string around the waist . This has n't really bothered me , but I would like to tighten it up just a little bit.I work outdoors so this is perfect for helping me layer up but allowing me something to wear that wo n't bulk up & slow down my arm movement which happens if you wear too many sweaters or hoody 's . I plan on buying another in a few months so I do n't wear this one out too much . Awesome price too . I checked a couple of stores online and no one had the same price as Amazon .
 I just want to say that is the best way to keep you warm , high quality product and very comfortable .
 One of the better purchases I 've made , in terms of satisfaction and value.The product is well-made and durable , which you come to expect from Columbia . It can be had for a good price and should last for a long time . Fits true to size , zipper works fine , and it does its job
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He finds them to be warm yet keeps his arms free at work . This Columbia vest is very nice and thick . Very nicely made and of good quality .
 Bought this for my husband , and he really liked it . The vest is generously cut and well sewn . It 's also very soft and the color is true and pleasing.Just right for those chilly nights when a long sleeved sweater would be `` too much . ''
 Ca n't beat this vest especially for the price ! I have purchased 3 of them !
 My son was very pleased with this vest . I liked the price for a name like Columbia Sportwear . I also liked how fast it was sent to me .
 The vest is comfortable and roomy , though not the very best of materials .
 This was a gift for someone . From what I saw , he was very pleased with it . The item arrived in a very timely manner .
 Purchased two of these for Christmas gifts . Was very impressed with the quality . Would definitely buy again !
 My experience with this Columbia vest made me feel it was spot on for size . The side pockets a bonus for a mid-layer piece . The vest itself let me wanting a little more . The collar is double the weight of the main body of the vest . It is a nice vest but thin for use as a mid-layer . I myself would have preferred if the body was equal to the collar in weight , but for the price I paid I 'd have to say it matches the quality . I guess I expected a little more from Columbia , as I own other products from them that always went beyond my expectations . Guess I 'll just have to be a little creative in my layering to get the best use out of this purchase . The style and color are nice , but I also got the `` bunching '' effect during active use , maybe better as a low activity use item , walking around town and such . It really comes down to what you 'll be using it for , activity level and quality of other layering items .
 Ordered the Large in Green color and was a great value . Quality was excellent as you would expect from Columbia .
 These vests are well made , stylish and fullfill their purpose exceptionally . They provide a little extra warmth at home when the thermostat is set down low to save energy . But being sleveless they do n't make you sweat . The sizes are exactly as specified . I normally wear large in shirts and jackets , and the large vest fits perfectly .
 Warm and made well and comfortable . Husband wears a large but had to order in medium size . He loves it but beware it runs large . Price was great too !
 Bought this at half the price to replace an old Columbia vest in which the zipper fell apart after a year . Wore it 5 days a week for work so I got my monies worth although I paid full price for that one .
 Columbia Men 's Cathedral Peak VestAmple sizing for stout waste . Soft , good feeling fabric with good zippers and warm comfort.Good color and value for a casual look.It can be worn most of the time for a light jacket or coat . Easy to maintain .
 Like the columbia fleece product they are soft . I got the same product from a discount store and it was cheaper even after tax . I have to rate it as 4 because of the product quality .
 This is my second Columbia vest and I really like them . I would recommend this vest to anyone . I like to wear it to work with my dress shirts and ties . Looks sharp .
 I have received this Vest , It is according the picture and it is beautiful , I like the color and I recommend to the people buy this product .
 This vest is the best value in a fleece vest that I 've found , hands down -- for quality , comfort , durability ... I travel constantly and I like the charcoal color because it shows no lint , hair etc. . I lost one of these and replaced it immediately . It 's perfect for layering in cool or cold weather ... but also for that little extra warmth I need in a refrigerated movie theater . -- When I replaced my lost vest I looked at other brands again and was reminded that this Columbia vest is the best thing out there for the money ... by far .
 Bought this vest for my brother and he loves it . I really liked the color of it because its so different .
 The fit , number of zippered pockets , and quality of fabric are all in keeping with a fleece vest that might have cost $ 15 or so more .
 Got this as a present for my dad . He loved it . Ordered an xl should have gone smaller product runs big
 Fits great and what a great price -- medium weight - true to size for mens large . Priced locally at $ 65 dollars
 love columbia products , it helps keep my chest warm so I can lower the heat in the house during the daytime .
 This vest is exactly what I wanted , lightweight yet warm , does n't hinder arm and shoulder motion ; very soft comfortable material .
 I chose thie vest because of the brand and color . It is good quality and stylish . Shipping was fast . I 'm happy , happy , happy !
 Fits just right , material is a nice weight . very warm . Columbia products are always nice . ca n't go wrong with this vest .
 Vest is a nice weight , not too heavy or too lightweight . Great over a long sleeve t-shirt or henley . The charcoal color is really nice . It holds up well through repeated washings . He got this vest last year for Christmas and recently lost it but he loves it so much he asked for a replacement . So if your husband is forgetful like mine you might want to get two . : -RRB-
 I bought this as soon as the Winter cold hit NM and love it . The XL I first purchased was a bit short -LRB- I 'm 6 ' 5 &#34; -RRB- so I then bought an XLT which I put in the morning and wear till I retire at night . Excellent warmth and comfort . Excellent value for money .
 These vests are the most comfortable and great lookingAnd are very affordable and go great with any causual outfit
 My wife bought a couple of these first . I saw them and liked what I saw . Then I learned that she had bought a men 's vest , so I was pretty sure I could have one , too ! The zipper on the pockets is necessary , since the bottom of the opening is about even with the bottom of the pocket and things can fall out . I found one that fits my chest but it is loose at the waist . I will probably take a seam in a bit to correct that . The material is pleasingly soft and warm . They clean up in the washing machine.My wife 's two vests are the same size , but the waistband is larger on one than the other . They were manufactured in different countries .
 Great extra layer for the winter.Very good quality . Generous pockets.Extremely comfortable.Logo over the breast is pleasantly inconspicuous .
 Most of my winter gear is from Columbia and I 've never had any complaints about it . It 's about half the price of a comparable North Face garment and works just as well .
 Like all Columbia products , this item arrived true to fit and size . I purchased this item for my husband and he wears it all the time . It washes well and is very durable . We have had this product for two years and it still looks and feels brand new .
 I bought this to layer under my coat when the weather dips below freezing . It 's comfortable , soft , and keeps me warm . I also like the blue color . Dropped one star because it seems to be made for people with pot bellies . I 'm 6 ' 1 180 and the medium fits perfectly lengthwise and in the shoulder/chest area but there 's a lot of extra fabric in the middle .
 Nice color and Im wanting to buy another vest different color . I highly reccomend to buy , columbia has great cloths .
 I ordered several of these in different colors . The quality is great and the sizing is true . Furthermore , they have come out of the washer & dryer looking like new each and every time . If additional colors become available , I wo n't hesitate to order more .
 Ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas . Beautiful red shade , and fits extremely well . He is very happy and I was pleased that it arrived so quickly and in perfect condition .
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He is very fussy and almost always finds something -LRB- even if it is really minor -RRB- wrong with anything he either buys or receives . He has worn this vest 3 times and has only had it for 6 days ! The fit was on target a large is a large . The craftsmanship above average . The price very good . This large fit nicely over a bit more belly than desired but would still fit well minus the extra pounds .
 I bought this vest for my husband for Christmas . It was perfect . He 's 6 ' 2 '' and about 220lbs and the XL fits him perfectly . He loves wearing it . It 's great for Southern winters were it does n't get too cold .
 This vest is very warm . It fits snug to your body keeping in your core body heat.The pockets are large . . perfect for someone who likes to carry a lot of things with them.The collar can be flipped up to cover more of your neck , or folded down when it 's not as cold.The fleece is very soft , and the vest overall is made well . I recommend this vest if you ` relooking to keep warm this winter . . either worn solo or as part of your winter layered clothing .
 I have been wearing this vest everyday since i got it . the color is great and the warmth is perfect . its not cold enough to wear heavy down jacket but this is just right for the cool days and nights here is S. Calif. thank you
 I ordered this one night , and had it in my hands within 3 business days - with regular shipping . It is a very good layer to add to any winter gear . It has two side zip-up pockets , and the collar zips all the way up if you need . It is super lightweight , and very warm -LRB- for a vest -RRB- . This vest does stop a tiny bit of wind , but not much . On a cool rainy day , wear this underneath a non-insulated rain jacket -LRB- shell -RRB- , and it 's perfect ! -- Very nice !
 This vest was exactly what I wanted . It has a furry texture -LRB- not all fleeces have that same texture -RRB- ; it has pockets that completely sewn into the garment -LRB- some sew it only on one edge -RRB- ; it has room in the pockets all the way to the side edge -LRB- and not just to the edge of the zipper -RRB- . The fit was good ; the sizes run large , so a L fits an XL person . I am very please and will probably purchase another .
 I bought this for my husband because he likes a fleece vest with a collar . He is very pleased and the vest looks great . The collar is big enough to really keep the wind off your neck .
 Its comfortable , warm , a little short in length but overall a really nice vest for me to wear in all types of weather . If I had to complain about one thing it would be that it is not fleece like I thought it would be so make sure you know what you 're buying . Other then that a nice product though !
 The vest fits well and is well made . If it had a zippered breast pocket it would be ideal and would get 5 stars . I would order it again .
 I had to replace a vest the job gave me because it was wearing out . I decided to order these vest in different colors . They go great with whatever I wear at the job . The quality is good for the money . I 'm known as the vest guy now .
 fits great , the blue is amazing , its warm but not too warm , I simply love this one . also got the black one and this a great product .
 I received just what I had ordered , which was the same brand I 've always worn and it was received very quickly before the expected date was even close to being up . I love my Columbia vests .
 Estoy muy contento de haber encargado &eacute;sta prenda . El color es muy suave y elegante . La prenda es muy c&oacute;moda .
 i liked this vest , , , the texture of the fabric is ideal for all season with style the thing is there is not enough pockets , , , , , , but it really serve my life style , , , , ill going to buy two more , , , i love it.i recommend this vest for all walks of life in style .
 Just the right weight to be outside in the Fall or Spring doing things . Keeps you warm without restricting mobility . Looks good and is very functional .
 What 's to review ? It is fleece , warm , I picked the color and got what I wanted . I did get a better price than I expected.Here is something review-worthy
 This is a good vest and I enjoy the heck out of mine . I actually own two in different colours , since I was given another one several years ago for my birthday . There are already a lot of reviews and opinions here so I will not be too redundant.The vest is Polartec fleece -LRB- 200 mid-weight -RRB- so it keeps the core warm and comfortable down to about 40 degrees F. Any colder and I must go to a higher tech solution . It works wet or dry , and drys pretty quickly if soaked.It 's a cozy piece of gear and I think a perfect gift item for a loved one since they will think of you in the comfort and warmth of it . I actually LIKE that short fuzzy fibres starts to clump and pill like a snuggly , familiar stuffed teddy bear after only a few washings . I often use it as a throw blanket or a pillow -LRB- esp on airline flights -RRB- . It is also very easy to maintain and as I have two , I often have one in the wash as I 'm wearing the other one.I like the roomy sizing as I use this for layering , and this is an intermediate layer . When zipped all the way up , it practically serves as it 's own Polartec scarf around the neck . Being a taller/larger human , I appreciate that this vest is available in extended sizes too.The design of the vest is simple with a stand up/fold down collar , 2 zippered side slash pockets at the waist , and the Columbia logo on the chest.Herein lies , my first minor criticism ... value . For a simple , unlined vest without any `` extras '' -LRB- like chest pocket , map pocket , interior pockets , drawstring at the bottom or the waist , throat abrasion guard , dbl access zipper , uppers shell , back hook loop , even zipper pulls with whistles , compasses and LED lights -RRB- I would expect a basic level price . If you shop around even online you should quickly get a feel for what the no frills model vs. the all the bells and whistles model are comparatively worth.The two pockets that it does have utilizes this elastized sateen material as the interior . Not only is this pocket lining not very warm , but I find that it snags uncomfortably on little dry skin flakes , hangnails , and tiny dry skin spurs on my hands . It might be just me , but it makes it unpleasant to put my hands in the pockets -LRB- for warmth -RRB- . On both of my Columbia vests , I have replaced the pocket liners with nice non-snagging flat mesh -LRB- like that found in luggage pockets -RRB- . Well the world is what you make of it , so of course I have made some heavy mods to my vests , which have made them my favourites and practically daily wear for me.Columbia makes consistently high quality products -LRB- overseas -RRB- geared toward the outdoor person , so paying a little bit extra for the brand name logo is not that painful I guess .
 This vest is very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear . Most of the time I wear it with short sleeved shirts . When zipped , it 's just right for those 45-50 degree days -LRB- as long as you 're not out in the chill for really long periods - but fine for car-to-store , or short walks -RRB- . It 's also great around the house when you want to drop the thermostat a few degrees to save a little on heating costs . My only disappointment is the main zipper . Sometimes it takes several tries to get it started , and it often sticks mid-zip -LRB- as if there was grit or something in it -RRB- . It always ends up working , but not always smoothly . I 'd definitely recommend the vest , and I suspect my zipper issue is not a design flaw , but rather a production glitch , which would not likely affect other buyers .
 I have purchased Columbia products I have liked in the past . So this was not a difficult choice form me . It is sized correctly for the big guys . I ordered a xxlt and it fits just the way it should . I nice way to add a bit of extra warmth under a jacket that need a little help . Good price and a quality product that was shipped fast .
 Ca n't beat the price , but the vest is larger than I thought a large would be - should 've got a medium .
 This Columbia vest is a quality product and is equipped with a durable zipper , style and feel .
 Columbia gear seems to be priced much lower than other companies like Patagonia and North Face but I feel like the quality of Columbia 's clothes stands up.This vest is exceptionally warm and comfortable .
 The most important factors for me when purchasing a vest were warmth and comfort . This vest is just what I wanted in both categories . It gives me just the right amount of warmth when I go for my morning run without getting too hot once I get warmed up . It 's also comfortable and soft . The pockets have zippers so I can put my keys etc in there and do n't have to worry about them falling out . The only fault I can find is the zippers jingle a bit as I move . Overall I 'm happy with my purchase .
 I got two of these , the blue and the Cattail , which is just brown . They are nice and warm . They look good . They run a little bit big . I got an XL , and I usually wear an XL in everything . I 'm probably right in between a L and an XL . I 'm 6 ' and 240 lbs , if that helps you order yours correctly .
 My son really loves this vest . We ordered two in different colors . It looked very nice on him and he wore it every other day with jeans . A great vest !
 Bought this for my dad for Christmas . He really llikes it . Fits really well and was just as promised and described .
 Perfect fit - this was purchased for an elderly person for indoor wear . It 's not black and it 's not grey - more like graphite . It is very lightweight and keeps him cozy and warm in these cold months .
 We 've been wearing our own Columbia vests for quite some time here in Wisconsin , but it only recently occurred to me that it was just the thing for my 93-year-old dad in Florida , who 's often cold , despite fairly warm temperatures . He loves the vest 's softness and is enjoying having something more youthful and &#34; cool &#34; to wear . I 'm happy to know that it 's easily machine wash and dryable .
 I picked this up to use as a stand-alone or extra layering depending on the temperature . This vest is great - it 's like wearing a soft fleece blanket.It fits easily under all my jackets or sweatshirts . A nice bonus is the zip pockets - they 're great for my phone or warming up my hands very fast .
 Wonderful vest at retail price , the Amazon has outdone itself.For $ 12 + tax , it seems like a steal to me.The material is very soft and of good craftmanship.thank you , Amazon and Columbia
 This product is a good value . Nothing spectacular , but a good deal . I use it as a good layer for skiing to provide warmth for my core without restricting shoulder and elbow movement . It more than adequately provides what I need .
 Every piece of Columbia clothing that I own is top quality and this is no different . It 's a lightweight , and yet warm vest perfect for those crisp fall days .
 Not a whole lot to say other than it 's well built , the fabric is very comfortable and strong feeling and the vest looks great . I 'd buy it again if I had the need .
 this is a very nice vest . looks good on and fabric is great . color stays true when washed as well
 Good light weight Vest.Material soft and flexible.Deep pockets . The fit was great . I wear mine in the office . I would recommend .
 This vest is similar to my Columbia Fleece jacket -- both are excellent and perform very well , especially at this price point . Fast delivery too .
 Was just what i was looking for . Brand new with tags and shipped very quickly . My husband loves it . Color looks exactly same as shown in the pic as well .
 I like Columbia garments for myself . So I bought one for My Dad for Christmas . It fits well in the XL and is nicely made.Washable too !!
 Quick service , good price and no complaints after wearing this for a month . Considering ordering another in a different color .
 Great vest for cool sunny days . Vest is a little on the thin side . It looks great and feels great . The only problem occurs is that it lets wind in and out very easily . I would recommend this to a friend , but do n't look for a whole lot of warmth from it .
 Awesome vest . Better than expected , well packed and arrived quickly ! I give it 2 thumbs up and my highest recommendation !
 A gift for my Grandson , quality and craftsmanship excellent , could not ask for a better product , or reliability . Thank you for a great fitting product , my Grandson absolutely loves it .
 I gave my husband this for Christmas and he is pleased , so I am too . Looks good , is comfortable . Have only had it less than 1 week .
 Honestly do n't know what 's all the hype about the North Face is . The good old Columbia looks great , feels comfortable and is well made . Navy color is very pleasant to the eye . I am very happy with the vest .
 My husband absolutely loved his vest I got him . We have even bought these in different colors . We would recommend this to anyone looking for a vest to wear as a casual attire or even a dressy attire .
 I bought this for my husband last year , for Christmas . At this point in time , no complaints at all from him . Washes well and wears well , and its light color does n't show white dog hair , which was a must for a new vest !
 Quality is good but I need Longs and they dont seem to have many longs
 Lightweight . I wear it mostly at night in my hammock to keep warm throughout the night . Layers well . Added a drawstring at the waist . Easy to do but would have preferred it was included .
 Although the product is great . It was not the exact color as published . It does not have a different color on the neck
 It was wright for what I was looking for . It arrived in good conditions but the coulor is a bit different that in the picture anyway it fits well , thanks .
 As it usually happens , Columbia makes the best and tis vest is not an exception . comfortable , nice and well made .
 All I wanted was a basic vest for cool summer days . Does the job perfectly . Will not stop the wind or keep you very warm - but if you are a guy needing pockets for your wallet - this works well .
 I have wide shoulders -LRB- 50 Regular suit jacket -RRB- , and the XL fit me perfect . I was especially pleased with the collar - which was shorter when popped than the previous Columbia vest I had owned . My previous fleece vest from Columbia lasted me about 2 years , so I have high hopes for this one as well . Very soft , great fit , extremely comfortable and versatile .
 Purchased this vest as a team vest for our local biathlon team . The fit was slightly large , but that is good for winter wear . The length was just below belt line . This is ideal for keeping the lower back warm while skiing and also shooting . Everyone that got a vest on our team was very pleased with the fit and the look . Great for training and looks good too !
 Dumb me , I ordered the wrong size . No problem with this purchase . It was easy to return and reorder the correct size . Credit came through for this purchase with days of me shipping wrong size back . This firm is `` On he Ball '' when it comes to handling a situation like this .
 While I do n't get too excited by clothing , and this is no exception , I do find this is a well made , comfortably warm vest , that I am glad I purchased .
 I wear this as an insulating layering or by itself over a shirt . It looks much better than my Columbia fleece which does n't have much shape . I like that it is super light and moderately warm .
 Bought this for my son in college after he asked for a black fleece vest for his birthday ... He thought it was perfect .
 Got my Columbia Cathedral Vest yesterday . Fits great and does it 's job perfectly.Paid 36 $ for it and its worth the money . It 's also much cheaper than similar products from North Face.Great for a run !
 First off - I am very happy with this purchase as it is exactly what I expected . And for the price , it 's hard to complain.The vest fits very nicely , i got the green large . I 'm a male 5 ' 11 '' and about 190 lbs . It fits me very nicely . Sometimes these vests bunch up around the gut looking dumpy but not this one.I have washed it a few times and it seems to be holding its colour , shape and stretch . It blocks the wind nicely and is perfect for cool autumn weather/early winter when it 's not too brutal but a t-shirt just does n't cut it.The collar is one it 's best features - it folds down nicely to keep your neck warm or you can turn it up to avoid the wind . The material is very soft and feels great on your skin.As for complaints , I find that i really miss having a breast pocket and I wish the pocket zippers went up to open as opposed to down.Since neither of these features were advertised , obviously i ca n't complain about their absence - i just prefer them and will be looking for both on my next vest purchase.One thing that I will knock off a star for is the depth of the pockets . They are quite shallow causing things to fall out easily - especially if you are sitting . If you are going to make a jacket with shallow pockets i think the pocket zips should go the other way ... Just make sure you remember to close the zips ! you can fit your entire hand in if you are trying to stay warm , but there is almost no downward angle to make a good pocket for holding your keys , phone or wallet.While we 're on the topic of zippers i will say that the quality of the zips on this jacket is top-notch . it will open or close from almost any angle and i would be very surprised if they stopped working.At $ 20 it 's hard to imagine a better purchase !
 Columbia fleece vests are the best I 've ever owned -LRB- it 's the third Columbia fleece I 've purchased -RRB- . They 're warm and very durable without being too bulky , making for a good fit and a nice appearance .
 My Significant Other needed something easy to get into because of shoulder surgery ... Perfect for him ! The warmth is wonderful ; the sizing worked out great . He did n't have a vest like this , but now he 's talking about getting another one , in another color . Pricing is perfect too . Ca n't think of any negative !
 Definitely get one size smaller than what you normally wear . I almost always wear an XL and when I tried this on it was baggy and roomy and with an item like this you want it to be snugger .
 I bought two of these ten years ago , and they are the best . Still good after all these years . And I disagree that they are too roomy -- they have fit me perfectly .

 Its good for what I wanted it for , I just wish it was a bit thicker material . The rim is kind of light .
 Light and well designed , this carry-on is perfect for either flight or car travel . The main storage is spacious , and the additional pockets allow one to store important items separately for easy access . Although light , it is sturdy . The retractable handle and rollers work very well . My wife and I recommend this item highly .
 I bought two of these uprights for $ 62.00 a piece . I ordered them in blue , but when I was contacted by Luggage Pros , they told me that they only had them in black . Because of this , I was given the newer model . For the money , these are absolutely great . They handle well , they are light weight , have many pockets for storage and are very durable . My last American Tourister is still going strong after 10 years and lots of usage . I will definitely be buying this brand again .

 My 21 '' Ilite -LRB- available for under $ 90.00 -RRB- has crossed the Atlantic twice -LRB- along with multiple trips IAD-Honolulu , IAD-LAX , IAD-ORD -RRB- . This carry-on iLite functioned well -LRB- spacious ; wheels rolled smoothly ; the iLite has several handles which provided grips for lifting into overhead compartment -RRB- . On several flights , I chose to check in the luggage , and the iLite 's blue shell provided much easier identification in a sea of black luggages . When scuff marks on the blue iLite showed , soapy water and a toothbrush provided the clean-up solution . This iLite is holding its own and has more miles to fly .
 Love this bag . Had more than enough room for a 4 day trip , with the two front compartments perfectly fitting my liquids , reading material , and my 15.4 '' screen laptop .
 Really good construction for a really good price . Have not used it very many times yet but so far after two trips it is holding up great and everything seems very sturdy and durable . It looks good , too .
 This is a great carry-on luggage that can hold a lot . I used it for a week long vacation and was surprised how much I was able to pack . It fits well in the overhead bins of major airlines . This bag is durable , and I look forward to using it again for future trips . It was nice not to have to pay a luggage surcharge .
 I bought the black bod , red lines with prints on the side style at Tilly 's clearance , last pair for only like $ 20 . It looked pretty cool , though because it 's made in china , I did n't really expect it to last too long . However , it 's been almost a year now and the shoe is still great , comfy and I get people telling me how cool it looks.So far I love it and almost wear it every day .
 Sick design on the side of the shoe . Looks great , feels great . What more can a shoe do ?
 I was looking for skate shoes when i came across theseI already had them for -LRB- 3 -RRB- months and still not even a little ripskateablegood gripBAD thing is when u sit on the floor and the side of the foot is directly on the floor and a little pressure it kinda hurts the side of your foot
 Saw these shoes for a steal -LRB- $ 16 -RRB- and had to have them . They are the most comfortable tennis/skate shoe I have ever worn . The laces are a bit long , but not a big issue in the scheme of things .
 hard to find a size 14 in stores . found it on amazon for 19 bucks and it was delivered for free ! i bought 5 different pairs of various shoes because they were so cheap . im happy with them . this is for real !
 the shoes are great they arrived in a matter of no time i am very pleasedwith the shoes .
 I think it is a good product with respect to its price . Feeling good whenever wearing that . Thanks amazon .
 Ca n't say or want much more . My son loves em . Good fit . Seems to be well made and a quality product . Nice look . He 's happy . I 'm happy .
 They 're good sellers and the product is very good , I like so much this jean . Ellos son muy buenos vendedores , el producto llego rapido a mis manos y era el esperado , los recomiendo ampliamente .
 I wear Levi jeans every day . Levi 's are the only jeans I will wear.I have worn Levi jeans for the past twenty -LRB- 20 -RRB- years ... or longer.Levi jeans are great ... in fact , i 'm wearin 'em right now ...
 Sent me what I wanted . 15 more 12 more 11 more 9 more 7 more 5 more 3 more done
 This is a very good price for this product , it 's the second one I 've ordered for my son .
 These boot cut jeans by my favorite jeans maker are exactly what I needed.When I ordered my Harley Davidson boots , I needed pants for when I wear them and these ones are the only ones that fit on the outside where others ca n't . Shopping local yields nothing like these , just junk not worth the money.Quality is what I 've come to expect from Levi 's , outstanding with fit absolutely perfect.More orders coming soon for these.Shipping was prompt , making this buyer very happy.Thank you to everyone for helping this lonely guy that hardly can get out to shop by bringing them to me.Again , THANK YOU VERY MUCH !!
 I thought these were more on the casual side , but after putting them on , they can pull off a nice look . Very comfy , one day to break in . No frays , quality zipper . Dimensions were perfect . Overall color is a shade or two darker than in the picture . Awesome , new favorite pair .
 If you have a problem with jeans bagging in the rear , then these jeans are for you ! They are a great fit and very comfortable ! My husband loves them !
 Well , its a good jean , everybody know the levi 's quality , the item arive in perfect conditions . . so nothing more to say . .
 Perfect fit , every time . 517 's are difficult for me to find locally , but buying on line thru Amazon is best for me .
 These are like they used to make them ! More belt loops , great fabric - love them ! Ca n't wait to order more of these !
 I was having a really hard time finding the boot cut Levis - no one seems to carry them anymore . These are just what I wanted . They look and fit good .
 Bought these for my husband and they fit true to size , maybe a little bit long but not so much that he wo n't wear them . He love them , they look good so I love them ! Great Pants !
 I ordered these jeans for my 16yo son & he really liked them . The only thing he would have preferred was a lower rise , but he 's wearing them without complaints . : -RRB-
 Nice one . . Boot Cut with nice fit.Ordered the Jeans with 29L but got it 3inch longer . So I had to do alteration , usually I order my pants with 29L and it fits perfect on me .
 Levis 517 's fit me better than any other jeans that I 've bought . Gon na stick with them . I wear a 38 waist , 36 inseam . Have bought several pair over the past six months from various places and they all fit the same . Good quality control !
 BASTANTE BIEN . BUENA CALIDAD DEL PANTALON . ME QUEDO MUY BIEN . TANTO EL LARGO COMO EN CINTURA . EXCELENTE COMPRA A UDS . GRACIAS .
 The jeans are a good deep color . Wish they were n't quite as thin as jean material seems to be getting , but seems they are all like that now . Overall a good pair of jeans.These are hard to find in 36x36 , so I 'm glad Amazon carries them .
 Perfect fit right out of the box . Started wearing immediately , stitches , pockets , zipper perfectly in place . Survived several washes good as new .
 Good price , perfect quality . Very good model for young and old-aged people . Gorgeous color . Classic zipper . I 'm satisfied ! I recommend to buy it .
 These jeans fit me very well and look good . One thing I noticed however is that the denim has a more coarse feeling compared to other Levi 's jeans . I would buy these again .
 IL TELL YOU I HAVE BEEN WEARING LEVI 'S FOR YEARS ON END AND THE BEST DEAL I GOT ON THESE GREAT JEANS WAS FROM MY FAVORITE STORE AMAZON
 If you know your size they fit . I do n't understand the reviews that say the sizes are wrong . Will buy again .
 was just what i expected ... very pleased with purchase . I like the fact that you can get 29 inseam . You can not get that in the store . No need to get them hemmed !
 his pants in overall line is still very good , sturdy , feels soft to the touch on the skin , the profile legendary cutting adds a touch of elegance , and even after several washings the fabric remains the same and does not shrink , the only thing I did not like the pants is that they have deteriorated the quality of the clips and metal buttons , formerly of copper and bronze , and now this are of aluminum and does not look good , however I recommend buying them are very good at the price .
 These came a little long , maybe an inch or two . Seeing as many others have noticed this is a problem with this fit , I suggest going one inseam size lower . I ordered a 30 '' and they fit more like a 31-32 '' . Other than the sizing , they are great jeans , and still look great on me . The boot cut allows the extra length to bunch up a little around the shoes , so you do n't really notice it . It actually looks good.I wish they sold these in a low rise version , as I do n't like hiking them up to where you might put dress pants or khakis . They stopped selling the 517 in a low rise though , so I 'm happy to wear them as is , great fit .
 I have always appreciated the fit and quality of Levi jeans . The boot cut has a closer fit around the knee with comfortable room in the hips and waist . What Levi Strauss needs to understand is that there is a huge population of men out there that has a 31 inch inseam . Men between 5 ' 9 &#34; and 6 ' fall into this size range . My growth did not stop at 30 &#34; inseam , and did not make it to 32 &#34; . So I either buy high water jeans that show my socks , or I let the cuffs drag the floor which signicantly reduces the life of the jeans . I liked the fit enough that I spent an additional $ 10 to get them hemmed to 31 .
 product arrived as expected on time , the product was as expected and the quality was as you 'd expect to find in a brick & mortar store .
 Great fitting . I usually buy the 527 style but they did n't have black in that style . Ordered a 517 instead and love the fitting .
 d e m a r a v i l l a e s t e m o d e l o muy bueno
 These are the first jeans in a while that actually fit my waist size , inseam and the leg openings are perfect .
 These jeans fit well but the denim seems less hefty than the denim of the same 517s from 5 years ago .
 I received my pants very quickly . I was concerned that my size would be too short for boots . I was pleasantly surprised that the designer was thoughtful about the shape and length for this item &#34; after &#34; several washings . Pants are about 1/2 inch longer than the average pants which make them perfect for cowboy boots . Pants are also very comfortable . JCD
 Noticed that they even have an extra pair of belt loops compared to my previous order . They are sturdy & dependable .
 The jeans were great ! The price was right , they were delivered in a timely fashion , and I lost a few lbs to get in them and I look good . lol . I recommend this company .
 These are the only jeans my son likes . He is tall and I have trouble finding his size in local stores and I could not find a better price .
 The jean came very quickly . They were the proper color , size , and cut . The packaging was excellent , and so was the quality of the jeans .
 Perfect price and fit for my husband . I would recommend this jean to any &#34; baby boomer &#34; who loves boot cut jeans.The jean has not changed at all good quality material and the right color . Thank you .
 I am happy with the jeans and how they fit , but usually when I get 517 's , they are really stiff and then I get to break them in . This pair was already like pre-washed , just differnt than what I am used to , but I still like them and will wear them . Maybe I have to look into differnt types and find exactly what I am looking for next time . Thank you
 I 've been wearing 517 's for a good , long time now , and I love 'em ! The problem is that most of my local stores that sell them -- and very few of them do -- price them highly and also drastically limit the selection compared to the more popular 501 's and 550 's . Additionally , these jeans are often skipped over when it comes to the big sales . Well , shopping for them on Amazon is a decision I should have made long ago . The price here is hard to beat.As for the jeans themselves , they are of the rugged quality that Levi 's is known for . They fit like the product photo shows
 Have had these jeans for a few weeks now & am very satisfied.The flair from the knee down is discrete and does not look like the 70 's bell-bottoms . The fit on top was precisely as marked . The length seems about 1/2 inch longer than sized on the 501 's . Was formerly utilizing 501 slim fit jeans but found that could not place them over motorcyle boots . The 501s were great for rainy rides , but look too much like a cowboy , when tucked into the boots .
 As always , good shopping at amazon.com . Its always a problem finding the right length jeans for me . I found that in this levi 517 Boot cut jean , it feels good to finally find a jean that is not too short . A fact that i would have loved to know before i bought this jeans , is the leg opening size . This jean is very tight around the thigh area . I would just like a bit more details on the product a next time round . Other than that , it always a good shopping experience on Amazon .
 The length and waist were perfect . The quality of Levi jeans was the same as they had always been , good
 I always had to keep pulling up my previous pairs of Levi 's -LRB- any model -RRB- because they only had FIVE belt loops . A key ring and cell phone are not that heavy . I remember growing up with Levi 's having SEVEN belt loops and a heavier canvas . I was pleasantly surprised to see the ` new ' Levi 's 517 now have seven belt loops again . I started to buy a different model , but they still only have the five loops.I just bought a couple of these pairs from Amazon . I did check online at Kohls and their current batch of 517 's still show 5 loops . I will have to wait until I go to the store to see if their stock has been updated . Kohls prices are higher than Amazon , but I will recheck when they go on sale . I still check Amazon first for almost all my purchases.Overall , I like my new Levi 's jeans . I will compare them with older ones to see if the canvas really is slightly thinner . Outsourcing manufacturing almost always results in poorer quality and non-standard sizing . It has 100 % results in putting Americans out of work . I try to buy American whenever I can -- hopefully it will catch on.There is another issue appearing after I washed my new jeans with my old ones . It should n't have made a difference , but the new ones are now covered with fine fluffy hairs . I will have to use a lint brush when I take them out of the dryer for now . Although it may just be a ` break in -- first washings ' issue.Overall , I rate these jeans 4 stars . I will have to wait for a few machine washings to see how the color holds up . I may be old fashioned , but buying jeans looking like they are 1/2 wore out or have holes in them is ` less than optimal ' .
 I ran around town to find my husband Levi 517 's in size 35x32 for Christmas . In the stores , there were stacks of all different sorts of Levi 's to go through . Finally I came home and ordered them through Amazon and received exactly what he wanted . These Levi 's fit perfectly and look great . Very happy they come in off size waists . Thank you for making my job easier and receiving nice fitting jeans .
 I 've grown up wearing Levi 's and in particular 517 's in my adult life . I do like that Levi has added additional belt loops in the past year or so . Over the years Levi has cut some corners in manufacturing , but not enough to discourage me from continuing to buy their stonewashed 517 's . I like the stonewashed jeans since they are ready to wear , unlike the rigid indigo Levi 's that have to be washed several times to soften them up.I am buying more and more items from Amazon for the free shipping and competitive prices . It just saves a lot of time going to a retailer only to find out they do n't have my size or what I want . Even with Amazon collecting California sales tax , I figure the time and gas saved from having to go to a retailer is well worth it .
 The only problem was I had was that I had to have them hemmed 2 &#34; so as not to walk on the cuff . I would have ordered them shorter but they were not offered in the waist size I needed . The waist fit perfect and having them hemmed was not that big of a deal . It coast me $ 12.00 to have them hemmed .
 I love being able to find the 517 's on line and not having to run all over town for the style and size I need .
 If you promise not to tell anybody , I wear lined jeans from eddie bauer or llbean when it gets cooler . I wear these when it gets warmer . True to size , do n't shrink too much .
 These were a secret gift for my brother-in-law . He keeps complaining that he must do laundry every other day because he only has one pair of work pants , but then he just will not go get more or let anyone buy him any ! So , I got the size off of the one pair of jeans he owns -LRB- laundry is at my house -RRB- and I bought several other pairs that were similarly worn . I sneak in a new pair about once a week and so far he has n't noticed that he now has three pair of work pants . When I slip in the new ones , I put them in the dirty clothes hamper he uses . I wonder if he knows his pants are multiplying yet ?
 They arived bfore time , APO adress , in Afghanistan ,1 week took it to arive here , im suprised , and they fit good , i dont hawe no words
 I 've always wanted a ` black 527 ' but found out I could only get that in rigid black.I decided to try 517 n whao I might just decide to continue with 517 even with other colors.Just the perfect fit I love .
 Is exactly what i was looking for . . i being using this model for years , and this pair of pant are excellent
 I am a creature of habit . Being of slim build I have found the 517 Boot cut to be the perfect jean for me . I also know my size so the fit was great as received . This is not always the case when ordering over the Internet . Service was great delivered on time as expected .
 These are the best jeans Levis has to offer in my opinion . They are not light and flimsy like some jeans Levis are making these days . The medium stonewash is a great even color . They do n't look faded on the seat and thighs or dingly and dirty like so many jeans do . These jeans are rugged , comfortable and last a long , long time . On top of that they look great . These are the only jeans I will buy .
 These jeans are everything they say they are . We will definately order these jeans again when the time comes . Thanks !
 100 % recomended , i have no doubt that i am going to buy another , it is really regular fit and boot cut
 This is the only jean my husband wears . He has the hardest time finding 36x29 . This is a perfect fit for him . When he needs more I will return to amazon .
 I finally found a pear of jeans that my wife said they look good on me and after being washed still fits great
 Great fit for my long legs ! Hard to find jeans my size but Levi 's always comes through for me ! a
 My order arrived in a timely fashion , they fit good and look great ... I 'm gon na get a couple more pairs .
 Levi 's 517 ` sThese Levi 's were the perfect fit . I like the fact that they are pre rinsed , which makes the fabric softer .
 Many of us do n't want to wear our Levi 's half way up our bellies . 517s are the best answer for that !
 A well tried and true blue jean that I 've been wearing for decades . The fit , finish , and quality is a good as or better than ever .
 These seemed a bit darker in person than pictured but they were a great pair of jeans for my husband . This is his favorite style of jeans and he needed a new pair of &#34; dressy jeans . &#34; Same great jeans as in the past .
 All the Levi 's I purchased for my 16 year old son were ` made to fit ' ! From the straight to boot cut , they all were a perfect fit for his personal taste . They are well made and very stylish .
 Great jeans , great price , speedy delivery as promised ! Will definitely be ordering them again since my son is so tall and slim and this is one of the only places I can find his size .
 Great basic jeans in hard to find sizes . Not much to say otherwise . They have washed up well and held up well for my long and lanky teen .
 Jeans are a little tight in the thighs for my husband . It did n't come with packing slip so I 'm hoping I can return them !
 I love these jeans . For me they are perfect . Long enough to wear with or without boots and the fit is not too tight . How can you go wrong with Levi 's ?
 I got what I ordered promptly . I wish I had ordered a different color but -- my bad . No complaints . What else can I say ?
 The jeans was just perfect , the material , size and colour , nothing to complain about , and great timing too.They fit really well , and amazon 's size chart was very helpfull .
 Style & size stayed true since the last time I bought a pair , after gettingLevi 's Men 's 527 Low Rise Boot Cut Jeanthat are nothing like they used to be that 's all a shopper can ask .
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut . Black 42 waist / 30 length . If you are short , stocky and have a big butt . These pants are perfect . They wo n't bunch up at your fat knees and they will last a long time before the zipper explodes . I suggest you buy the next size up because they will shrink after 6 months of washing , drying and severe stretching in the seat area . Great pants .
 MY FAVORITE JEANS FOR 25 YEARS . I HAVE WORN MAINLY 501 MODEL , SO I READ MANY REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING THESE 517 JEANS.AFTER THINKING FOR A LONG TIME I DECIDED TO BUY ONE SIZE BIGGER THAN USUAL . IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE.THEY ARE JUST FINE , BLACK COLOR AND ZIPPER FLY WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DETAIL FOR ME !
 My husband 's body type includes slight pot belly and skinny hips and thighs . Almost impossible to find pants that fit well without being either too tight in the belly or looking baggy in the seat and thighs . He used to wear Levi 's Action Jeans which were boot cut jeans with slight stretch in fabric and a slight crease in the legs . These jeans always looked and fit great ; real snappy . Unfortunately they 're no longer available . Then went to wearing David Taylor Flexjeans from Sears which were almost as good . However , he now find that although Sears still sells jeans by this name , they are no longer the same . They are now made in China and are made from a crappy fabric and no longer fit the same . In desperation , he started looking thru available Levis products and found Levi 's 517 . Advertised as slim in seat and thighs . He did not expect much but was pleasantly surprised to find that they are indeed somewhat slim in the seat and thighs , even though the pants he bought had a waist size slightly larger than minimally necessary , thankfully allowing him to breathe . Bottom line was that he was very happy that these pants are not so tight in the waist that its hard to breathe , but still slim enough in the seat and thighs that they do n't look like old man 's jeans . Just wish they had the snappy look of the old Levi 's Action Jeans .
 I bought a pair of these in 29X34 and they are great . Fit perfect , really like the cut , lighter weight material but not too light , should hold up well . Just wish they would reduce the size of the internal tag -- I 've actually had to tuck it back into the pants a few times after putting them on !
 Great black on black bootcut jeans . They have even gone back to adding two additional belt loops a feature that went away several years ago .
 Fits well , my husband loves them , quality control met , consistent sizing , and look good on . Will order more as needed
 My son wears a 36 Waist x 36 lenght which is very hard to find . The Levi 's Men 's 517 are about the only jeans he likes and these fit him perfectly . They were shipped very quickly and the price was excellent . They were a birthday gift and he loves them .
 The jeans were pre washed and fit just like I wanted . They were really softer than I expected . I would buy this product again .
 I was so happy with the quality and fit ; I ordered 3 more pairs ! I will be good on jeans for awhile . The price was good too .
 Great quality and a lower price , for me is like a tailored jean , I 'm happy with this product . No more to say thanks to all
 After numerous failed attempts at the 527 's on amazon I finally got a clue and got these jeans . They are PERFECT ... great fit ... weight ... etc. ... just like the jeans I wore in high school 20 years ago ... . I 'm already thinking about a second pair . The light rancher is the perfect color ... . As for the 527 's MADE IN BANGLADESH ... amazing they could ever bear the levis name ... perhaps they were counterfeit . Thanks amazon for my true and needed exchange . The original pair of jeans I ordered ... yes the 527 ... was complete trash . These 517 's are real jeans for real cowboys ... and I 'm not one ... but I do wear a ton of boots ...
 Exellent product
 i got two pairs for my husband . levis are the only thing that fit him right . They make him look like he has a butt !
 I like this product because it fits very well and is comfortable . I recommend it to others . Good for those who like to wear boots .
 Finally found levis that were the correct size , if they are still available I will order more in the future
 Great pants . I wish there was a size 33 by 35 . I always have a hard time with pants size . I can get a length 34 , which shrink after a wash or a 36 that drags because there too long . But there is no length 35 in pants , so I do n't have much of choice .
 Excellent product the product I come very well and it is what was waiting of , I come in time , good
 I bought they for my boyfriend who had lost a bit of weight and all his pants were falling down , but these fit and stay up -LRB- Thank God -RRB-
 My husband loves the fit and the price.Great deal.You can dress them up or down!Look no further.Great looking jean , for the price .
 Bought these jeans for my husband . They fit very well and look nice . The shipment arrived on time . I was happy with my purchase .
 My body was made for Levi 's brand jeans , and I 'd worn through a couple of pairs . I bought duplicate black 517s - soft but not washed out , dark , with a predictable fit . They are my new favorites . The process went smoothly . Who knew I 'd be buying clothes online ?
 I ordered these for Christmas for my 6 ' 2 '' grandson who had grown out of all his pants after checking stores and finding his size is almost impossible to find . They were perfect and he loved them .
 The Levi 's 517 Boot Cut were purchused as a replacement of the wrong ones bought at a local store , These ordered & delivered ; I was told fit greatly before & after ; washThe price for my buying , totaled out a nuff less even with shipping to come fromamazon , rather than a store , even on sale after my tax & shipping ; -LRB- as a late gift -RRB- Theonly guestion I got was about , they did not have the Levi 's cardboard shelf tagswe see on Jean 's in store .
 I love my levis . I was unaware they came in black . I bought a blue pair and black pair , Ilove them
 Just as described ! Fit & look exactly what he needed and wanted . And he said I could n't find this product ... LOLThanks !!! The Wife wrote the review ...
 These jeans fit great . The boot cut gives a good look without being sloppy . My husband looks hot in them .
 Got these as a gift for my brother , and they are the true blue classic with a great slim shape . Perfect `` date night '' jeans .
 These are the only jeans my husband will wear and we could not find them ANYWHERE . When i found them here i was happily suprised with the discount price and they look great . Would buy again from this seller .
 Excellent transaction on hard to find size and style Levi Jeans.Reasonable price and quick shipping.I 'm very pleased with this purchase !
 jeans were shipped quick , arrived in good shape the medium stonewash has that worn look most people want , I am pleased with the purchase .
 Levi 's are always the best jeans around . Levi 's Boot Cut are the only kind my husband will wear . Always a good fit .
 Very high quality . Several pairs have consistent fit . Have bought and worn these 517 boot cut jeans for several years .
 My husband LOVES these jeans . They are a GREAT FIT , especially in the seat . The legs are n't too wide in the thighs and the bootcut bottom make a terrific silhouette . I like how he looks in them and he says they are REALLY COMFORTABLE . They look best in the darker color and are a good pair of `` dress jeans '' as well as versatile . We are ordering more . Ladies , get him these jeans !
 I 've worn Levi 's for over 50 years . From the days when you had to roll up the cuffs because they only had one length to super bells in the 70 's and now my favorite 517 's . They are always true to size and the workmanship is always excellent . The service at Amazon is always great too . What more can I say , I am one satisfied customer .
 These boot cut Levis have always been my favorite jeans . I had not had any in a while , so when my order arrived I immediately tried them on . I forgot how well they fit , and they are really stylish . Awesome . Will be ordering more .
 Authentic , just as described . Fast delivery . I am very satisfied with purchase . Smooth , one stop purchase . Husband will be very happy on Christmas day ! Thank you .
 My husband has been wearing Levi 's since he was a teenager . They are the most durable jeans and he loves the boot cut .
 I 've been wearing these for years.They do tend to fade easily so wash them inside out and use a detergent product for black fabrics .
 I bought these as a gift for a friend who has worn this style for years . Good quality , good fit , good style .
 Great jeans.Classical style.Low price.Wearing only jeans , levis always loved.Happy New Year!Amazon Forever!I love it .
 This hard to find style arrived on time . These classic jeans fit just the way they should . Going back for more colors .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Slim Fit Jean is leg looks like so long , . . but lap so tight but leg looks like so long . .
 My husband like it . . although I have to cut the length a little bit . . He said he may buy more in the future . . Hopefully they have shorter length then .
 They are Levis what more needs to be said ? Theyre the only jeans im buying from now on . They fit great and last 2-5 times longer than any other jeans ive bought .
 I use to wear the Levis low boot cut , but they discontinue to sell the color I want . After I give this one a try , I like it so much .
 Fit well at the waist and look good . Last a lot longer than most most jeans and seem to get more and more comfortable the more you wear them .
 These are great jeans , they do tend to run a little big , both on length and waist . The color was a lot more bluer then it looks in the picture , so be weary of that it . It was too country , and I needed more rock and roll , if you know what I mean.Pros
 I was a bit concerned about this purchase . My husband likes the boot cut style and that was an excellent choice for my purchase . I have zero compliants other then I wish I 'd bought more !
 they were exactly what we were looking for . the orginal 517 , these are my hubby 's most favoritie , they also hold up better than the other styles seem to
 Will have to wash several times for them to fit . I buy this size all the time from other retailers and they are n't this big . Like the color and the style . They just run big I guess . Mainly in the length . Would buy again , just a smaller size .
 The fit is nice , the color is holding up through the wash . I am glad they have different sizes then the stores . Very hard to find 33 x 36 !
 I like the way these jeans fit.The are also comfortable.The ones I have purchased previously have been durable .
 d e m a r a v i l l a e s t e m o d e l o muy bueno
 These jeans come washed so they are soft , supple and ready to wear . They are pre-shrunk so order the size you wear . I choose boot-cut jeans because I wear 12 '' - shaft western boots . Levies are the only jeans I wear because they fit well , look good , and get better with age .
 These jeans are perfect for the guy who wants to wear boots and not look like a geek or a thug . Just the right combination of loose and fitted .
 This is my first pair of Levi 517 's and I have to say I am very impressed . They sit on my natural waist -LRB- not low-rise like the 527 's -RRB- , and are fitted in the seat and thigh , and then flare out below the knee to fall on the boot . I 'm 6 ' 3 '' 190lbs and have a 36 waist and 34 inseam and it fit perfectly . Hard to find jeans these days that sit on the waist ... I 'm not a fan of the low-rise look or feel , so these jeans were a great find .
 Came to Amazon to order these jeans for my husband since no one ever has his size , 36x36 . I was pleasantly surprised because I did order two of these in different colors , Rancher Light and Rinse , both of which were the perfect colors . Perfect light colored jean and perfect dark colored jean . My husband and I are very hard to fit in jeans and tops so when something works we often get multiples , the problem however is that sometimes we buy the exact same thing in a different color and they fit totally different . Not these ! These jeans were great and the same fit ! Some people might not be able to appreciate that as much as I , but I was very grateful . It was a risk I had to take since his size is so common , but with free returns I had to take advantage . The boot leg is also very subtle but incredibly flattering . He does wear boots but of course they are n't necessary . I would say they are very true to size and great quality . They are currently his `` good jeans '' ... . that is until he `` accidentally '' wears them to go work in the garage . But when that happens , because it will , I will be back to purchase more ! By the way he is just over 6 ' 3 '' about 230-240lbs .
 i traveled 80 miles one day looking for the jeans i like with no luck , it did make for a nice bike ride though ! then i went online looking and i found what i was looking for at amozon these jeans are hard to get in my hometown!Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut JeansWhat a nice pair of rugged jeans . And I got them so FAST !! Thanks again.Roxann Hill
 Good product , on time and as shown in Amazon.But ... years ago , ordering the same # jean and the same size always brought the exact same fit and look . Lately , the same length , for instance , some times is a bit too long -LRB- can be fixed -RRB- or a bit too short -LRB- bad news -RRB- . The price to be paid for savings by manufacturing offshore . Lets see if with the crisis we return to the memorable `` MADE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ''
 What can I say ? They are Levis . Perfect fit , excellent quality , and the most impressive thing was the price . Unbelievable !
 517 's are the best fit for me -LRB- I 'm a bit older and looking for just a little more comfort -RRB- . I wear boots most of the time , and these do a great job of dropping over the boot and still maintaining a nice line on the leg . Plus , the little red tag says you are a real Texan and not one of those $ 150.00 / pair wannabe 's .
 a la medida , tabla de medidas excelente ...
 Levis 517 Boot Cut Jeans are just as advertized . Good fit and a perfect boot cut . I highly recommend them for anyone who needs boot cut jeans .
 It 's a very good pant for my husband . Nothing too special or fancy ; he is very satisfied because he got what he expected
 execelente producto muy buena calidad , el pantalon vino en un excelente empaque y llego super rapido deverdad no tengo quejas lo recomiendo
 He looks hot in them , thanks ! What more can I say ? They did n't stay on for very long ... ca n't share any more details .
 I was somewhat hesitant to order Levi 's online but I could n't be happier with this order ! The jeans are exactly as described and fit perfectly . They are genuine Levi 's and are of the highest quality - not seconds . I ca n't recommend this seller highly enough .
 They 're good sellers and the product is very good , I like so much this jean . Ellos son muy buenos vendedores , el producto llego rapido a mis manos y era el esperado , los recomiendo ampliamente .
 I wear Levi jeans every day . Levi 's are the only jeans I will wear.I have worn Levi jeans for the past twenty -LRB- 20 -RRB- years ... or longer.Levi jeans are great ... in fact , i 'm wearin 'em right now ...
 My skinny son is 54 years old and will not wear any other jeans - only 517 , boot cut Levi 's so I know what to buy for Christmas and Birthdays . I found a perfect fit for my skinny husband also .
 I ordered these jeansLevi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jeanfor a Christmas gift a short time before Christmas . I knew the size . I was somewhat concerned that I would not get them on time for Christmas The package came just before Christmas , and the jeans were exactly as pictured , nicely packaged -LRB- each pair separately enclosed in plastic bag -RRB- , the right size and color . I was very pleased , as was the recipient of the gift !
 The jeans were a Christmas gift and a style regularly worn by the recipient . They were a perfect fit . They are hard to find locally so we ordered from the Internet . The red tag on the back pocket did not say `` Levis '' and I have never seen this before . Is it significant ?
 Wow . These are great blue jeans , and they come in 38 long which is what he wears . HE wanted the boot cut , and a 34 waist was large enough . Usually he wears a 36 , , but I ordered 34 and they fit just right . Great looking , great price .
 I bought two pairs in two orders - both were perfect - exactly as I expected . On time . Good buy at a decent price .
 These jeans are tough but good looking and fit well . Amazon 's price is great , they are a good value for the money , and we always get prompt delivery and easy return if size is not right .
 the product is excellente , but needs to be taggedcorrectly , I order 34x30 tag say so , but real size was36x32 try buying them from differet source , and same thing never can get athe right size until i took a mesuring tape to the store and mesure before buing them !!
 I love those Jeans . . nice shape and denim . I ordered different colors from this pant and I love them all . it is comfortable , and have a nice leg openning that falls around the boot .
 I have been wearing 517 's for as long as I can remember . They fit perfectly and have remained unchanged for years .
 Excellent transaction on hard to find size and style Levi Jeans.Reasonable price and quick shipping.I 'm very pleased with this purchase !
 jeans were shipped quick , arrived in good shape the medium stonewash has that worn look most people want , I am pleased with the purchase .
 It 's very good ! 100 % cottonThe higher rise sits comfortably at the waist.A fit you want from a brand you trustFit width & length ; !
 non common size request was delivered promply before Christmas . My son was very happy with the fit and color .
 Great product ... my dad was very pleased . He had not been able to find the 517 .
 These were a birthday gift for my son and I had them sent directly to him at college . He loved them and they fit great ! Good quality for the price . He liked the fit of the boot cut .
 These are great jeans for us gals , too , especially if you like to wear a true black color . I dress them up with a feminine camisole and heels , and have got many compliments on them .
 Exactly what my hubby wants . It 's difficult to find his size in our local stores . Very happy Amazon now has Levi 's in his size .
 I love my new bootcuts . I received them quickly , They fit perfectly . Thank you .
 Finally figured out what cut and size I like , but the only place I can find them is the internet . Great pants .
 These were ordered off Amazon when I could not find them locally . I found the pants and they are describer perfectly and fit exactly as I had wanted them to . I will buy more in the future because they were perfect .
 Completamente satisfecha con el producto , exactamente igual a lo que ofrecieron . LLego en el tiempo estimado que prometieron . Ninguna queja , volveria a comprar de nuevo .
 The Levi jeans were just like I expected . The fit was perfect and received them in just a few days . Thanks !!
 The quality of the denim is lighter , so the good fit disappears by the end of the day . Otherwise , I like 'em !
 Hubby dearest was so happy to find boot cut Levi jeans at Amazon as it seems most stores have quit carrying this style of jean . He likes to wear boot cut jeans and Levi jeans are his favorite brand.No complaints about the fit or wearability either . Ordered two more pairs of jeans today as he 's a happy camper.Recommend .
 Good deal on the jeans and speedy shipping . My first pair of boot cut jeans . My girl friend really likes them on me . I got the dark blue -LRB- rinse -RRB- . Fit good and comfortable .
 My skinny son is 54 years old and will not wear any other jeans - only 517 , boot cut Levi 's so I know what to buy for Christmas and Birthdays . I found a perfect fit for my skinny husband also .
 I ordered these jeansLevi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jeanfor a Christmas gift a short time before Christmas . I knew the size . I was somewhat concerned that I would not get them on time for Christmas The package came just before Christmas , and the jeans were exactly as pictured , nicely packaged -LRB- each pair separately enclosed in plastic bag -RRB- , the right size and color . I was very pleased , as was the recipient of the gift !
 Ordered these for my boyfriend , they run extremely small , he regularly wears a 32/34 had to send back and get a 36/34 . Other than that they 're great jeans .
 Finally a pair of Levi 's not only affordable , but a pair that is the real deal . . not seconds or blemished . . but cut perfectly . . The best I have bought in years . . Thanks . . and `` I 'll be back for more ''
 They fit just perfectly and I am very happy to not only get the bestdeal around but beat the sales tax . Good old Levi 's rigid , bootcut jeans have been my all-time favorite jeans my whole life , andI just turned 60 . Got 'em within a week , free shipping faster thanexpected , so that was cool , too . Amazon rules !
 The pants are great . I can not seem to find them in stores like Kohls or Target where I usually shop . I 'm not skinny as far as a skinny person goes but I have thinner legs than a lot of guys . These seem to be not as loose in the butt and thighs . I usually get the 505 's but they are cut a little bigger assuming tree trunk size legs . I have runners legs and these work . If you have big footballer legs , forget about it .
 Finally jeans that fit like the old Levis , these are the old quality heavy denim stuff not that wimpy pre-wash thin as paper junk denim . I would highly recommend these jeans to anyone who 's familiar with real Levis .
 Very easy shopping . I 'm familiar with the pants so it 's just a matter of price and convenience.Sitting at the desk for a few second beats driving to the store , finding out they do n't have the 517 in my size and driving back home . I 've always had trouble just finding the 517 at stores and shopping online sure makes things easier . The pants themselves are everything they 've always been , good fitting and tough.It 's nice to add the stonewash to my collection of darker denim so I do n't look the same every day.I was upprised how fast they came and that 's a big plus too .
 These jeans fit to size perfectly -LRB- for me -RRB- , are comfortable to wear , and have adequate material to reach a guy 's waist ... not hip-huggers . I 'll buy more of these ! Not a deal-breaker by any means but I would prefer them to not have the size label outside ... it seems Levi 's always does this .
 Amazon did not mentioned in the description that this pair of jeans is a Shrink-to-Fit fabric . No question on the quality . . it 's still an amazing jeans , the great Levi 's jeans , never goes out of style ... Take 31 '' waistline x 30 '' inseam if your size is 30 x 30 .
 Levi 's are always the best jeans around . Levi 's Boot Cut are the only kind my husband will wear . Always a good fit .
 Good quality but I wish I had done more research on the colors . Ordered rigid because of the look online however the denim itself is rigid .
 Yes , these Levi 's are everything I had hoped they would be and More . Perfect fit , and I 'm very pleased tofinally have a BLACK pair ! Amazon 's got another winner !
 My wife thinks it 's funny that I rate my jeans with numbers , but , as a former 505 's man , I now prefer the 517 's 'cause ride my horses more and were my boots more ... plus , they just , plain feel good when they 're on me ...
 Who does n't love Levis ? These are great ! My son was happy on Christmas day and so were we . Happy Holidays !
 It is great to find the exact size , color , and fit you want in a Levi 's jean , and also get it on time .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean , Medium Stonewash , 38x29They fit perfectly . Will probably order more in a couple months .
 Needed a size that few brick & mortar stores keep in stock . Amazon had style I wanted in the size that I wanted at a good price !
 These blue jeans where a great color and a perfect fit . Glad I ordered them . They were a present for my son
 My husband has been wearing Levi 's since he was a teenager . They are the most durable jeans and he loves the boot cut .
 I like this style and they are getting very hard to find . The price here was the best I found , got in a timely manner . I 'm happy with my purchase .
 Purchased these jeans for my husband . They have a nice fit and look very good on . No baggy butt like the relaxed fit jeans .
 I usually have a hard time finding good bootcut jeans with the right fit in the retail stores . If the color/wash/fabric is right , the size isnt . If the size is right , the fit is too loose at the seat and thighs . Now that my favorite pair of jeans is past its prime , I started looking for a new pair to replace it . After hunting all stores in and around my area and trying all available bootcuts in my size , I was very disappointed . That is , until I found a pair of Levi 's 517 Blue Ox in the local Macy 's store . This was the first bootcut I found in the last 3 years that fit me perfectly . Since I already had a pair of jeans that was of a very similar color , I came online and started looking for the correct color in that fit . Unfortunately , it wasnt that easy finding one online . Kohls , Dillards and others had Levi 's 517s , but they werent the same ones I saw in the store . Apart from Macys and Amazon , no other site -LRB- including Levi 's own site -RRB- had the same fit in Rancher Light color I was looking for . I could have ordered at Macys website , but my past experience with Amazon was stellar and so it my first choice . Even then I was a little skeptical if the photos were close to how the jeans looked in reality . Since amazon had a free returns on this one , I went ahead with the order . The product , as always with Amazon , came 6 days ahead of their estimated delivery date . The jeans is , in fact , very close to the pictures on the website and the fit is PERFECT !! Thanks to Levi 's for the perfect color and fit and KUDOS to amazon for the perfect shopping experience !
 Finally Levi went back to 7 belt loops instead of the five . Makes a big difference for those of us that work for a living .
 I bought the 517 as I prefer this cut to any other one of the Levi 's catalog , I place it even above the so famous 501 . I 'm fully satisfied
 I love these jeans . The wash and fit are great . That being said , they did arrive with a hole in the seat and the seam is a little crooked on the inside left leg . I really do n't care though because they fit so good .
 It is hard to find male , black , slim fit , boot cut jeans . Believe me I searched many places both on-line and local retail outlets . Finally I found these on Amazon and they were just right . Great fit , looks good , and the price was reasonable . I highly recommend them .
 We will take these to alterations but they were about 5 inches too long . Otherwise they are very nice .
 True to size , did n't shrink , and minimal wrinkling . Love the variety of sizing - son is tall and thin , and hard to fit , but Levis 517 made it happen !
 I ordered these jeans an exrta size longer becaause I wanted a high cuff . Got exactally that . Perfect !!! Now I 'm looking for a white pair
 Well , they 're Levi 's . There you go . Best jeans on the market . Last forever and fit great . The black does fade to gray quicker than I would like , but that 's probably because I wear only black , all the time . So ...
 I have worn Levi jenas for the last 16years , i am relatively tall guy and seldom get my size in the store , Amazon provides me my size and then quality as well .
 Purchased two pairs of Levi 's Boot Cut Jeans for my husband , the Jeans are very hard to find in the stores . Since my husband is tall , it is hard to find 36x36 .
 These pants are very well put together and I am a big fan of Levi 's pants durability which is what prompted me to purchase these .
 I am a woman but men 's jeans fit me better . These are very comfortable . My jeans do NOT get hung up on my boots as they do with jeans that are not boot cut .
 todo salio perfecto , tanto el envio como el paquete recibido , estan esplendidas , la hora de llegada fue la establecida por el vendedor
 Quality jeans , but not made in the USA.Arrived quickly and each pair were individually bagged in plastic.Good fit , for me .
 How cute are these spit cloths ? Ca n't imagine ever actually using them as they are too pretty . Perfectly functional double sided cloths , but will probably use the cheaper muslin squares for regular use . Have other babylicious products in same design which are lovely too .
 These glasses are simply the best . I bought two pair and used them extensively in Kuwait and Iraq . Believe me , the sun is a killer there . Further , these glasses helped to keep out sand during sand storms . I highly recomend this product as they are the only sun glasses I will ever wear again .
 I own the Austin Reed dartmouth blazer in every color in which they make it -- it is a staple of my business wardrobe . Well made , quality fabric , nicely tailored , classic lines , appropriate for a professional woman . -LRB- something that can be hard to find at times -RRB- It should be noted , however , that the periwinkle and raspberry colors are lovely , but the fabric and buttons are slightly different than the `` classic '' colors -LRB- lighter -RRB- and the linings and interfacings are not as substantial as the brown , navy , camel , red and ivory . It 's still a good value , particularly as these are colors appropriate to warmer seasons and climates , but I was a bit surprised .
 My husband bought one of these shirts last year to try it out . I was very skeptical of the `` no ironing '' claim . I could n't believe my eyes when I took it out of the dryer the first time -- not a wrinkle to be seen . The material is truly miraculous . We both love this product and plan to buy more . Thank you , Jos. Banks !
 I own three of these shirts and they are great . I get my shirts cleaned and pressed and here is an example of what great shirts they are
 I own two of these Traveler non-wrinkle shirts and they are absolutely the best shirts I have ever owned . They are of high quality material and the size I bought was right on the money . The colors offered are very versatile with just about anything a person would own and can be worn formally or casually . I am going to stick with buying more of these shirts .
 I bought 2 to begin with and now own seven and I ca n't see myself buying other dress shirts
 I received this shirt as a gift over Christmas . Since then I have bought two more . The fit is outstanding and I have never felt a finer material in a dress shirt - it is soft yet sturdy and always appears pressed . The iron free is for real . I hate ironing and will pay the extra 20 dollars per shirt to never have to dry clean or iron again . I will never buy another shirt and I almost want to throw away my non-iron free dress shirts . I highly recommend this shirt . You will enjoy it and probably buy more of them .
 These dress shirts are the best ! Wrinkle-Free , Breathable , Durable Material , Plus lots of styles , sizes and color options . Compare side-by-side to other dress shirts and you 'll see and feel the difference .
 Please note that this rashguard becomes completely sheer once it 's wet !!! Your Moobs will definitely show through it !!! That is my only caveat - if I had known about the sheer-factor , I would have gotten one with a color to it ; perhaps blue.Otherwise , the product fits and works as advertised . It has been great for my swimming workouts . It also arrived in two days , which was faster than expected .
 Loved it ... kept me warm in the pool ... I suggest you do not wash in washing machine ... will stretch out . . hand wash in cold water .
 Very quick transaction . Great to do busniess with ... would ALWAYS buy from this seller .
 ESTA CAMISA AL IGUAL QUE OTRA CAMISA QUE ME LAS TRAJE , SON CHEVERISIMAS , COLORES LINDOS , PRECIOS BUENOS , IGUAL LOS PUEDES UTILIZAR CON UNOS JEANS O CON UNA ROPA FORMAL . . RECOMENDADA . .
 I bought two of these ten years ago , and they are the best . Still good after all these years . And I disagree that they are too roomy -- they have fit me perfectly .
 The seller was very fast with delivery and the product was exactly like the picture ! I got the costume within 4 days of ordering . The costume is light weight and easy to put on and wear around . Can be difficult to use the bathroom without pulling down the whole costume . I have no complaints for this product .
 it was for a play . . My brother looked so cute with it . Everyone love it , and were asking were we purchased . . We will continue recommending this vendor .
 This costume is so cute & comfortable , I love it ! I ca n't wait to wear it for Halloween this year . It is roomy and soft , and as realistic as a cow costume gets , LOL . The price was a great deal , and the seller was great . I highly recommend this costume . Happy Halloween !
 It 's the best bargain . Of course it 's not as well made as some of the other , more expensive , costumes but it gets the job done . It 's cute and fits a variety of sizes .

 These are the first jeans in a while that actually fit my waist size , inseam and the leg openings are perfect .
 These jeans fit well but the denim seems less hefty than the denim of the same 517s from 5 years ago .

 What can I say ? They are Levis . Perfect fit , excellent quality , and the most impressive thing was the price . Unbelievable !
 The only problem was I had was that I had to have them hemmed 2 &#34; so as not to walk on the cuff . I would have ordered them shorter but they were not offered in the waist size I needed . The waist fit perfect and having them hemmed was not that big of a deal . It coast me $ 12.00 to have them hemmed .
 I love being able to find the 517 's on line and not having to run all over town for the style and size I need .
 If you promise not to tell anybody , I wear lined jeans from eddie bauer or llbean when it gets cooler . I wear these when it gets warmer . True to size , do n't shrink too much .
 BASTANTE BIEN . BUENA CALIDAD DEL PANTALON . ME QUEDO MUY BIEN . TANTO EL LARGO COMO EN CINTURA . EXCELENTE COMPRA A UDS . GRACIAS .
 The jeans are a good deep color . Wish they were n't quite as thin as jean material seems to be getting , but seems they are all like that now . Overall a good pair of jeans.These are hard to find in 36x36 , so I 'm glad Amazon carries them .
 Perfect fit right out of the box . Started wearing immediately , stitches , pockets , zipper perfectly in place . Survived several washes good as new .
 Good price , perfect quality . Very good model for young and old-aged people . Gorgeous color . Classic zipper . I 'm satisfied ! I recommend to buy it .
 These jeans fit me very well and look good . One thing I noticed however is that the denim has a more coarse feeling compared to other Levi 's jeans . I would buy these again .
 IL TELL YOU I HAVE BEEN WEARING LEVI 'S FOR YEARS ON END AND THE BEST DEAL I GOT ON THESE GREAT JEANS WAS FROM MY FAVORITE STORE AMAZON
 I love these jeans . For me they are perfect . Long enough to wear with or without boots and the fit is not too tight . How can you go wrong with Levi 's ?
 I have always appreciated the fit and quality of Levi jeans . The boot cut has a closer fit around the knee with comfortable room in the hips and waist . What Levi Strauss needs to understand is that there is a huge population of men out there that has a 31 inch inseam . Men between 5 ' 9 &#34; and 6 ' fall into this size range . My growth did not stop at 30 &#34; inseam , and did not make it to 32 &#34; . So I either buy high water jeans that show my socks , or I let the cuffs drag the floor which signicantly reduces the life of the jeans . I liked the fit enough that I spent an additional $ 10 to get them hemmed to 31 .
 product arrived as expected on time , the product was as expected and the quality was as you 'd expect to find in a brick & mortar store .
 Great fitting . I usually buy the 527 style but they did n't have black in that style . Ordered a 517 instead and love the fitting .
 The fit and look are great and I saved a few dollars . Will purchase more when the price is right
 love this jeans , the fabric is really good and the cut is impecable . it is original and the communication was really easy , i recieved really fast .
 I 've always wanted a ` black 527 ' but found out I could only get that in rigid black.I decided to try 517 n whao I might just decide to continue with 517 even with other colors.Just the perfect fit I love .
 Is exactly what i was looking for . . i being using this model for years , and this pair of pant are excellent
 I received my pants very quickly . I was concerned that my size would be too short for boots . I was pleasantly surprised that the designer was thoughtful about the shape and length for this item &#34; after &#34; several washings . Pants are about 1/2 inch longer than the average pants which make them perfect for cowboy boots . Pants are also very comfortable . JCD
 Noticed that they even have an extra pair of belt loops compared to my previous order . They are sturdy & dependable .
 The jeans were great ! The price was right , they were delivered in a timely fashion , and I lost a few lbs to get in them and I look good . lol . I recommend this company .
 These are the only jeans my son likes . He is tall and I have trouble finding his size in local stores and I could not find a better price .
 The jean came very quickly . They were the proper color , size , and cut . The packaging was excellent , and so was the quality of the jeans .
 Perfect price and fit for my husband . I would recommend this jean to any &#34; baby boomer &#34; who loves boot cut jeans.The jean has not changed at all good quality material and the right color . Thank you .
 This pair of Levi 's fits perfectly and the indigo color is the same as the Levi 's I wore back in the day !
 I gave these Jeans to my daughter 's friend for Christmas and he really likes them.He is real thin and wears motorcycle boots.He likes how they fit and loves the boot cut.He especially likes the rugged material .
 My order arrived in a timely fashion , they fit good and look great ... I 'm gon na get a couple more pairs .
 Levi 's 517 ` sThese Levi 's were the perfect fit . I like the fact that they are pre rinsed , which makes the fabric softer .
 This is a very good price for this product , it 's the second one I 've ordered for my son .
 Well , its a good jean , everybody know the levi 's quality , the item arive in perfect conditions . . so nothing more to say . .
 Perfect fit , every time . 517 's are difficult for me to find locally , but buying on line thru Amazon is best for me .
 These are like they used to make them ! More belt loops , great fabric - love them ! Ca n't wait to order more of these !
 I was having a really hard time finding the boot cut Levis - no one seems to carry them anymore . These are just what I wanted . They look and fit good .
 Bought these for my husband and they fit true to size , maybe a little bit long but not so much that he wo n't wear them . He love them , they look good so I love them ! Great Pants !
 I ordered these jeans for my 16yo son & he really liked them . The only thing he would have preferred was a lower rise , but he 's wearing them without complaints . : -RRB-
 I bought 2 of these and man they are nice . I 'll admit the guy wearing the jean in the picture sold me . Like I went and look for all the style of Levi 's , and these attracted me the most . Although I would n't tuck in my shirt like that . But they sure look good with some chucks and or casual boots and a dress shirt , with a silver wrist watch , and a pair of shades . They are heavy , and for me kinda tight even though jean of a different brand and style with the same size , fit me perfectly . I do n't know I guess it the way they are made . But for the look , I 'll take the pain any day , yes these jean are so tight mostly in my thigh area and waist , that I do get a little discomfort pain in my lower back . I guess it the way they are design and the heaviness of the jean . Of course I am in the process of getting in shape again . So with time , these will be perfect . I do like to sag a little , but as of right now I ca n't with these . Until I lose some of that belly fat I accumulated over the years .
 These are the jeans I always buy , they are a great comfortable fit . It is also great that Amazon stocks the size I need , it 's impossible to get from the shops .
 My body was made for Levi 's brand jeans , and I 'd worn through a couple of pairs . I bought duplicate black 517s - soft but not washed out , dark , with a predictable fit . They are my new favorites . The process went smoothly . Who knew I 'd be buying clothes online ?
 I ordered these for Christmas for my 6 ' 2 '' grandson who had grown out of all his pants after checking stores and finding his size is almost impossible to find . They were perfect and he loved them .
 The Levi 's 517 Boot Cut were purchused as a replacement of the wrong ones bought at a local store , These ordered & delivered ; I was told fit greatly before & after ; washThe price for my buying , totaled out a nuff less even with shipping to come fromamazon , rather than a store , even on sale after my tax & shipping ; -LRB- as a late gift -RRB- Theonly guestion I got was about , they did not have the Levi 's cardboard shelf tagswe see on Jean 's in store .
 I love my levis . I was unaware they came in black . I bought a blue pair and black pair , Ilove them
 Just as described ! Fit & look exactly what he needed and wanted . And he said I could n't find this product ... LOLThanks !!! The Wife wrote the review ...
 These jeans fit great . The boot cut gives a good look without being sloppy . My husband looks hot in them .
 Got these as a gift for my brother , and they are the true blue classic with a great slim shape . Perfect `` date night '' jeans .
 These are the only jeans my husband will wear and we could not find them ANYWHERE . When i found them here i was happily suprised with the discount price and they look great . Would buy again from this seller .
 Excellent transaction on hard to find size and style Levi Jeans.Reasonable price and quick shipping.I 'm very pleased with this purchase !
 jeans were shipped quick , arrived in good shape the medium stonewash has that worn look most people want , I am pleased with the purchase .
 It 's very good ! 100 % cottonThe higher rise sits comfortably at the waist.A fit you want from a brand you trustFit width & length ; !
 non common size request was delivered promply before Christmas . My son was very happy with the fit and color .
 I like this style and they are getting very hard to find . The price here was the best I found , got in a timely manner . I 'm happy with my purchase .
 Purchased these jeans for my husband . They have a nice fit and look very good on . No baggy butt like the relaxed fit jeans .
 I usually have a hard time finding good bootcut jeans with the right fit in the retail stores . If the color/wash/fabric is right , the size isnt . If the size is right , the fit is too loose at the seat and thighs . Now that my favorite pair of jeans is past its prime , I started looking for a new pair to replace it . After hunting all stores in and around my area and trying all available bootcuts in my size , I was very disappointed . That is , until I found a pair of Levi 's 517 Blue Ox in the local Macy 's store . This was the first bootcut I found in the last 3 years that fit me perfectly . Since I already had a pair of jeans that was of a very similar color , I came online and started looking for the correct color in that fit . Unfortunately , it wasnt that easy finding one online . Kohls , Dillards and others had Levi 's 517s , but they werent the same ones I saw in the store . Apart from Macys and Amazon , no other site -LRB- including Levi 's own site -RRB- had the same fit in Rancher Light color I was looking for . I could have ordered at Macys website , but my past experience with Amazon was stellar and so it my first choice . Even then I was a little skeptical if the photos were close to how the jeans looked in reality . Since amazon had a free returns on this one , I went ahead with the order . The product , as always with Amazon , came 6 days ahead of their estimated delivery date . The jeans is , in fact , very close to the pictures on the website and the fit is PERFECT !! Thanks to Levi 's for the perfect color and fit and KUDOS to amazon for the perfect shopping experience !
 Finally Levi went back to 7 belt loops instead of the five . Makes a big difference for those of us that work for a living .
 I bought the 517 as I prefer this cut to any other one of the Levi 's catalog , I place it even above the so famous 501 . I 'm fully satisfied
 I love these jeans . The wash and fit are great . That being said , they did arrive with a hole in the seat and the seam is a little crooked on the inside left leg . I really do n't care though because they fit so good .
 It is hard to find male , black , slim fit , boot cut jeans . Believe me I searched many places both on-line and local retail outlets . Finally I found these on Amazon and they were just right . Great fit , looks good , and the price was reasonable . I highly recommend them .
 We will take these to alterations but they were about 5 inches too long . Otherwise they are very nice .
 True to size , did n't shrink , and minimal wrinkling . Love the variety of sizing - son is tall and thin , and hard to fit , but Levis 517 made it happen !
 Well , they 're Levi 's . There you go . Best jeans on the market . Last forever and fit great . The black does fade to gray quicker than I would like , but that 's probably because I wear only black , all the time . So ...
 I have worn Levi jenas for the last 16years , i am relatively tall guy and seldom get my size in the store , Amazon provides me my size and then quality as well .
 Purchased two pairs of Levi 's Boot Cut Jeans for my husband , the Jeans are very hard to find in the stores . Since my husband is tall , it is hard to find 36x36 .
 These pants are very well put together and I am a big fan of Levi 's pants durability which is what prompted me to purchase these .
 I am a woman but men 's jeans fit me better . These are very comfortable . My jeans do NOT get hung up on my boots as they do with jeans that are not boot cut .
 todo salio perfecto , tanto el envio como el paquete recibido , estan esplendidas , la hora de llegada fue la establecida por el vendedor
 Quality jeans , but not made in the USA.Arrived quickly and each pair were individually bagged in plastic.Good fit , for me .
 Fit well at the waist and look good . Last a lot longer than most most jeans and seem to get more and more comfortable the more you wear them .
 I am a creature of habit . Being of slim build I have found the 517 Boot cut to be the perfect jean for me . I also know my size so the fit was great as received . This is not always the case when ordering over the Internet . Service was great delivered on time as expected .
 These are the best jeans Levis has to offer in my opinion . They are not light and flimsy like some jeans Levis are making these days . The medium stonewash is a great even color . They do n't look faded on the seat and thighs or dingly and dirty like so many jeans do . These jeans are rugged , comfortable and last a long , long time . On top of that they look great . These are the only jeans I will buy .
 These jeans are everything they say they are . We will definately order these jeans again when the time comes . Thanks !
 100 % recomended , i have no doubt that i am going to buy another , it is really regular fit and boot cut
 This is the only jean my husband wears . He has the hardest time finding 36x29 . This is a perfect fit for him . When he needs more I will return to amazon .
 I finally found a pear of jeans that my wife said they look good on me and after being washed still fits great
 Great fit for my long legs ! Hard to find jeans my size but Levi 's always comes through for me ! a
 Ordered these for my boyfriend , they run extremely small , he regularly wears a 32/34 had to send back and get a 36/34 . Other than that they 're great jeans .
 Finally a pair of Levi 's not only affordable , but a pair that is the real deal . . not seconds or blemished . . but cut perfectly . . The best I have bought in years . . Thanks . . and `` I 'll be back for more ''
 Many of us do n't want to wear our Levi 's half way up our bellies . 517s are the best answer for that !
 A well tried and true blue jean that I 've been wearing for decades . The fit , finish , and quality is a good as or better than ever .
 These seemed a bit darker in person than pictured but they were a great pair of jeans for my husband . This is his favorite style of jeans and he needed a new pair of &#34; dressy jeans . &#34; Same great jeans as in the past .
 All the Levi 's I purchased for my 16 year old son were ` made to fit ' ! From the straight to boot cut , they all were a perfect fit for his personal taste . They are well made and very stylish .
 Great jeans , great price , speedy delivery as promised ! Will definitely be ordering them again since my son is so tall and slim and this is one of the only places I can find his size .
 Great basic jeans in hard to find sizes . Not much to say otherwise . They have washed up well and held up well for my long and lanky teen .
 Jeans are a little tight in the thighs for my husband . It did n't come with packing slip so I 'm hoping I can return them !
 Good quality but I wish I had done more research on the colors . Ordered rigid because of the look online however the denim itself is rigid .
 Yes , these Levi 's are everything I had hoped they would be and More . Perfect fit , and I 'm very pleased tofinally have a BLACK pair ! Amazon 's got another winner !
 I got what I ordered promptly . I wish I had ordered a different color but -- my bad . No complaints . What else can I say ?
 The jeans was just perfect , the material , size and colour , nothing to complain about , and great timing too.They fit really well , and amazon 's size chart was very helpfull .
 Style & size stayed true since the last time I bought a pair , after gettingLevi 's Men 's 527 Low Rise Boot Cut Jeanthat are nothing like they used to be that 's all a shopper can ask .
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut . Black 42 waist / 30 length . If you are short , stocky and have a big butt . These pants are perfect . They wo n't bunch up at your fat knees and they will last a long time before the zipper explodes . I suggest you buy the next size up because they will shrink after 6 months of washing , drying and severe stretching in the seat area . Great pants .
 MY FAVORITE JEANS FOR 25 YEARS . I HAVE WORN MAINLY 501 MODEL , SO I READ MANY REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING THESE 517 JEANS.AFTER THINKING FOR A LONG TIME I DECIDED TO BUY ONE SIZE BIGGER THAN USUAL . IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE.THEY ARE JUST FINE , BLACK COLOR AND ZIPPER FLY WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DETAIL FOR ME !
 My husband 's body type includes slight pot belly and skinny hips and thighs . Almost impossible to find pants that fit well without being either too tight in the belly or looking baggy in the seat and thighs . He used to wear Levi 's Action Jeans which were boot cut jeans with slight stretch in fabric and a slight crease in the legs . These jeans always looked and fit great ; real snappy . Unfortunately they 're no longer available . Then went to wearing David Taylor Flexjeans from Sears which were almost as good . However , he now find that although Sears still sells jeans by this name , they are no longer the same . They are now made in China and are made from a crappy fabric and no longer fit the same . In desperation , he started looking thru available Levis products and found Levi 's 517 . Advertised as slim in seat and thighs . He did not expect much but was pleasantly surprised to find that they are indeed somewhat slim in the seat and thighs , even though the pants he bought had a waist size slightly larger than minimally necessary , thankfully allowing him to breathe . Bottom line was that he was very happy that these pants are not so tight in the waist that its hard to breathe , but still slim enough in the seat and thighs that they do n't look like old man 's jeans . Just wish they had the snappy look of the old Levi 's Action Jeans .
 I bought a pair of these in 29X34 and they are great . Fit perfect , really like the cut , lighter weight material but not too light , should hold up well . Just wish they would reduce the size of the internal tag -- I 've actually had to tuck it back into the pants a few times after putting them on !
 Finally figured out what cut and size I like , but the only place I can find them is the internet . Great pants .
 It 's a very good pant for my husband . Nothing too special or fancy ; he is very satisfied because he got what he expected
 execelente producto muy buena calidad , el pantalon vino en un excelente empaque y llego super rapido deverdad no tengo quejas lo recomiendo
 He looks hot in them , thanks ! What more can I say ? They did n't stay on for very long ... ca n't share any more details .
 I was somewhat hesitant to order Levi 's online but I could n't be happier with this order ! The jeans are exactly as described and fit perfectly . They are genuine Levi 's and are of the highest quality - not seconds . I ca n't recommend this seller highly enough .
 They 're good sellers and the product is very good , I like so much this jean . Ellos son muy buenos vendedores , el producto llego rapido a mis manos y era el esperado , los recomiendo ampliamente .
 I wear Levi jeans every day . Levi 's are the only jeans I will wear.I have worn Levi jeans for the past twenty -LRB- 20 -RRB- years ... or longer.Levi jeans are great ... in fact , i 'm wearin 'em right now ...
 Sent me what I wanted . 15 more 12 more 11 more 9 more 7 more 5 more 3 more done
 I bought two pairs in two orders - both were perfect - exactly as I expected . On time . Good buy at a decent price .
 These jeans are tough but good looking and fit well . Amazon 's price is great , they are a good value for the money , and we always get prompt delivery and easy return if size is not right .
 the product is excellente , but needs to be taggedcorrectly , I order 34x30 tag say so , but real size was36x32 try buying them from differet source , and same thing never can get athe right size until i took a mesuring tape to the store and mesure before buing them !!
 I love those Jeans . . nice shape and denim . I ordered different colors from this pant and I love them all . it is comfortable , and have a nice leg openning that falls around the boot .
 I have been wearing 517 's for as long as I can remember . They fit perfectly and have remained unchanged for years .
 These boot cut jeans by my favorite jeans maker are exactly what I needed.When I ordered my Harley Davidson boots , I needed pants for when I wear them and these ones are the only ones that fit on the outside where others ca n't . Shopping local yields nothing like these , just junk not worth the money.Quality is what I 've come to expect from Levi 's , outstanding with fit absolutely perfect.More orders coming soon for these.Shipping was prompt , making this buyer very happy.Thank you to everyone for helping this lonely guy that hardly can get out to shop by bringing them to me.Again , THANK YOU VERY MUCH !!
 I thought these were more on the casual side , but after putting them on , they can pull off a nice look . Very comfy , one day to break in . No frays , quality zipper . Dimensions were perfect . Overall color is a shade or two darker than in the picture . Awesome , new favorite pair .
 If you have a problem with jeans bagging in the rear , then these jeans are for you ! They are a great fit and very comfortable ! My husband loves them !
 I am happy with the jeans and how they fit , but usually when I get 517 's , they are really stiff and then I get to break them in . This pair was already like pre-washed , just differnt than what I am used to , but I still like them and will wear them . Maybe I have to look into differnt types and find exactly what I am looking for next time . Thank you
 I 've been wearing 517 's for a good , long time now , and I love 'em ! The problem is that most of my local stores that sell them -- and very few of them do -- price them highly and also drastically limit the selection compared to the more popular 501 's and 550 's . Additionally , these jeans are often skipped over when it comes to the big sales . Well , shopping for them on Amazon is a decision I should have made long ago . The price here is hard to beat.As for the jeans themselves , they are of the rugged quality that Levi 's is known for . They fit like the product photo shows
 Have had these jeans for a few weeks now & am very satisfied.The flair from the knee down is discrete and does not look like the 70 's bell-bottoms . The fit on top was precisely as marked . The length seems about 1/2 inch longer than sized on the 501 's . Was formerly utilizing 501 slim fit jeans but found that could not place them over motorcyle boots . The 501s were great for rainy rides , but look too much like a cowboy , when tucked into the boots .
 As always , good shopping at amazon.com . Its always a problem finding the right length jeans for me . I found that in this levi 517 Boot cut jean , it feels good to finally find a jean that is not too short . A fact that i would have loved to know before i bought this jeans , is the leg opening size . This jean is very tight around the thigh area . I would just like a bit more details on the product a next time round . Other than that , it always a good shopping experience on Amazon .
 The length and waist were perfect . The quality of Levi jeans was the same as they had always been , good
 I always had to keep pulling up my previous pairs of Levi 's -LRB- any model -RRB- because they only had FIVE belt loops . A key ring and cell phone are not that heavy . I remember growing up with Levi 's having SEVEN belt loops and a heavier canvas . I was pleasantly surprised to see the ` new ' Levi 's 517 now have seven belt loops again . I started to buy a different model , but they still only have the five loops.I just bought a couple of these pairs from Amazon . I did check online at Kohls and their current batch of 517 's still show 5 loops . I will have to wait until I go to the store to see if their stock has been updated . Kohls prices are higher than Amazon , but I will recheck when they go on sale . I still check Amazon first for almost all my purchases.Overall , I like my new Levi 's jeans . I will compare them with older ones to see if the canvas really is slightly thinner . Outsourcing manufacturing almost always results in poorer quality and non-standard sizing . It has 100 % results in putting Americans out of work . I try to buy American whenever I can -- hopefully it will catch on.There is another issue appearing after I washed my new jeans with my old ones . It should n't have made a difference , but the new ones are now covered with fine fluffy hairs . I will have to use a lint brush when I take them out of the dryer for now . Although it may just be a ` break in -- first washings ' issue.Overall , I rate these jeans 4 stars . I will have to wait for a few machine washings to see how the color holds up . I may be old fashioned , but buying jeans looking like they are 1/2 wore out or have holes in them is ` less than optimal ' .
 I ran around town to find my husband Levi 517 's in size 35x32 for Christmas . In the stores , there were stacks of all different sorts of Levi 's to go through . Finally I came home and ordered them through Amazon and received exactly what he wanted . These Levi 's fit perfectly and look great . Very happy they come in off size waists . Thank you for making my job easier and receiving nice fitting jeans .
 I 've grown up wearing Levi 's and in particular 517 's in my adult life . I do like that Levi has added additional belt loops in the past year or so . Over the years Levi has cut some corners in manufacturing , but not enough to discourage me from continuing to buy their stonewashed 517 's . I like the stonewashed jeans since they are ready to wear , unlike the rigid indigo Levi 's that have to be washed several times to soften them up.I am buying more and more items from Amazon for the free shipping and competitive prices . It just saves a lot of time going to a retailer only to find out they do n't have my size or what I want . Even with Amazon collecting California sales tax , I figure the time and gas saved from having to go to a retailer is well worth it .
 These were a secret gift for my brother-in-law . He keeps complaining that he must do laundry every other day because he only has one pair of work pants , but then he just will not go get more or let anyone buy him any ! So , I got the size off of the one pair of jeans he owns -LRB- laundry is at my house -RRB- and I bought several other pairs that were similarly worn . I sneak in a new pair about once a week and so far he has n't noticed that he now has three pair of work pants . When I slip in the new ones , I put them in the dirty clothes hamper he uses . I wonder if he knows his pants are multiplying yet ?
 They arived bfore time , APO adress , in Afghanistan ,1 week took it to arive here , im suprised , and they fit good , i dont hawe no words
 36 &#34; inseam jeans at a reasonable price are hard to find . I really like the fit of these jeans just wish there were other kinds in the same length .
 Just what I expected . After soaking and drying , the fit and feel was as anticipated ... just like the good , old days !!! -LRB- I would estimate that length and waist both shrunk by about one inch ... as Mama warned , some 50 years ago -RRB-
 i got two pairs for my husband . levis are the only thing that fit him right . They make him look like he has a butt !
 I like this product because it fits very well and is comfortable . I recommend it to others . Good for those who like to wear boots .
 My husband LOVES these jeans . They are a GREAT FIT , especially in the seat . The legs are n't too wide in the thighs and the bootcut bottom make a terrific silhouette . I like how he looks in them and he says they are REALLY COMFORTABLE . They look best in the darker color and are a good pair of `` dress jeans '' as well as versatile . We are ordering more . Ladies , get him these jeans !
 I 've worn Levi 's for over 50 years . From the days when you had to roll up the cuffs because they only had one length to super bells in the 70 's and now my favorite 517 's . They are always true to size and the workmanship is always excellent . The service at Amazon is always great too . What more can I say , I am one satisfied customer .
 These boot cut Levis have always been my favorite jeans . I had not had any in a while , so when my order arrived I immediately tried them on . I forgot how well they fit , and they are really stylish . Awesome . Will be ordering more .
 Authentic , just as described . Fast delivery . I am very satisfied with purchase . Smooth , one stop purchase . Husband will be very happy on Christmas day ! Thank you .
 My grandson loves these jeans , since he 's rather tall we were glad to find Levi 's makes great jeans in his size . Strange as it may seem , many brands of jeans do not come in a 34in length .
 As an active equestrian rider , and a woman of 59 years , I 'm ALWAYS looking for comfortable jeans that sit at my waist -- I do n't like women 's jeans at all - the fabric in women 's jeans seems flimsy , and the low-rise , hip-hugging jeans for riding or leisure wear feels uncomfortable . The men 's Levis and men 's Lee jeans are very comfortable , and they can handle my active life -- for me , men 's Levis 517 bootcut jeans have best variety for colors , and toughest quality in fabric .
 Nice one . . Boot Cut with nice fit.Ordered the Jeans with 29L but got it 3inch longer . So I had to do alteration , usually I order my pants with 29L and it fits perfect on me .
 Levis 517 's fit me better than any other jeans that I 've bought . Gon na stick with them . I wear a 38 waist , 36 inseam . Have bought several pair over the past six months from various places and they all fit the same . Good quality control !
 Great jeans.Classical style.Low price.Wearing only jeans , levis always loved.Happy New Year!Amazon Forever!I love it .
 This hard to find style arrived on time . These classic jeans fit just the way they should . Going back for more colors .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Slim Fit Jean is leg looks like so long , . . but lap so tight but leg looks like so long . .
 My husband like it . . although I have to cut the length a little bit . . He said he may buy more in the future . . Hopefully they have shorter length then .
 They are Levis what more needs to be said ? Theyre the only jeans im buying from now on . They fit great and last 2-5 times longer than any other jeans ive bought .
 I use to wear the Levis low boot cut , but they discontinue to sell the color I want . After I give this one a try , I like it so much .
 If you know your size they fit . I do n't understand the reviews that say the sizes are wrong . Will buy again .
 was just what i expected ... very pleased with purchase . I like the fact that you can get 29 inseam . You can not get that in the store . No need to get them hemmed !
 his pants in overall line is still very good , sturdy , feels soft to the touch on the skin , the profile legendary cutting adds a touch of elegance , and even after several washings the fabric remains the same and does not shrink , the only thing I did not like the pants is that they have deteriorated the quality of the clips and metal buttons , formerly of copper and bronze , and now this are of aluminum and does not look good , however I recommend buying them are very good at the price .
 These came a little long , maybe an inch or two . Seeing as many others have noticed this is a problem with this fit , I suggest going one inseam size lower . I ordered a 30 '' and they fit more like a 31-32 '' . Other than the sizing , they are great jeans , and still look great on me . The boot cut allows the extra length to bunch up a little around the shoes , so you do n't really notice it . It actually looks good.I wish they sold these in a low rise version , as I do n't like hiking them up to where you might put dress pants or khakis . They stopped selling the 517 in a low rise though , so I 'm happy to wear them as is , great fit .
 Great black on black bootcut jeans . They have even gone back to adding two additional belt loops a feature that went away several years ago .
 Fits well , my husband loves them , quality control met , consistent sizing , and look good on . Will order more as needed
 My son wears a 36 Waist x 36 lenght which is very hard to find . The Levi 's Men 's 517 are about the only jeans he likes and these fit him perfectly . They were shipped very quickly and the price was excellent . They were a birthday gift and he loves them .
 The jeans were pre washed and fit just like I wanted . They were really softer than I expected . I would buy this product again .
 I was so happy with the quality and fit ; I ordered 3 more pairs ! I will be good on jeans for awhile . The price was good too .
 Great quality and a lower price , for me is like a tailored jean , I 'm happy with this product . No more to say thanks to all
 After numerous failed attempts at the 527 's on amazon I finally got a clue and got these jeans . They are PERFECT ... great fit ... weight ... etc. ... just like the jeans I wore in high school 20 years ago ... . I 'm already thinking about a second pair . The light rancher is the perfect color ... . As for the 527 's MADE IN BANGLADESH ... amazing they could ever bear the levis name ... perhaps they were counterfeit . Thanks amazon for my true and needed exchange . The original pair of jeans I ordered ... yes the 527 ... was complete trash . These 517 's are real jeans for real cowboys ... and I 'm not one ... but I do wear a ton of boots ...
 Exellent product
 Finally found levis that were the correct size , if they are still available I will order more in the future
 Great pants . I wish there was a size 33 by 35 . I always have a hard time with pants size . I can get a length 34 , which shrink after a wash or a 36 that drags because there too long . But there is no length 35 in pants , so I do n't have much of choice .
 Excellent product the product I come very well and it is what was waiting of , I come in time , good
 I bought they for my boyfriend who had lost a bit of weight and all his pants were falling down , but these fit and stay up -LRB- Thank God -RRB-
 My husband loves the fit and the price.Great deal.You can dress them up or down!Look no further.Great looking jean , for the price .
 Bought these jeans for my husband . They fit very well and look nice . The shipment arrived on time . I was happy with my purchase .
 I ordered these jeans an exrta size longer becaause I wanted a high cuff . Got exactally that . Perfect !!! Now I 'm looking for a white pair
 They fit just perfectly and I am very happy to not only get the bestdeal around but beat the sales tax . Good old Levi 's rigid , bootcut jeans have been my all-time favorite jeans my whole life , andI just turned 60 . Got 'em within a week , free shipping faster thanexpected , so that was cool , too . Amazon rules !
 The pants are great . I can not seem to find them in stores like Kohls or Target where I usually shop . I 'm not skinny as far as a skinny person goes but I have thinner legs than a lot of guys . These seem to be not as loose in the butt and thighs . I usually get the 505 's but they are cut a little bigger assuming tree trunk size legs . I have runners legs and these work . If you have big footballer legs , forget about it .
 Finally jeans that fit like the old Levis , these are the old quality heavy denim stuff not that wimpy pre-wash thin as paper junk denim . I would highly recommend these jeans to anyone who 's familiar with real Levis .
 Very easy shopping . I 'm familiar with the pants so it 's just a matter of price and convenience.Sitting at the desk for a few second beats driving to the store , finding out they do n't have the 517 in my size and driving back home . I 've always had trouble just finding the 517 at stores and shopping online sure makes things easier . The pants themselves are everything they 've always been , good fitting and tough.It 's nice to add the stonewash to my collection of darker denim so I do n't look the same every day.I was upprised how fast they came and that 's a big plus too .
 These jeans fit to size perfectly -LRB- for me -RRB- , are comfortable to wear , and have adequate material to reach a guy 's waist ... not hip-huggers . I 'll buy more of these ! Not a deal-breaker by any means but I would prefer them to not have the size label outside ... it seems Levi 's always does this .
 Amazon did not mentioned in the description that this pair of jeans is a Shrink-to-Fit fabric . No question on the quality . . it 's still an amazing jeans , the great Levi 's jeans , never goes out of style ... Take 31 '' waistline x 30 '' inseam if your size is 30 x 30 .
 Levi 's are always the best jeans around . Levi 's Boot Cut are the only kind my husband will wear . Always a good fit .
 Very high quality . Several pairs have consistent fit . Have bought and worn these 517 boot cut jeans for several years .
 My wife thinks it 's funny that I rate my jeans with numbers , but , as a former 505 's man , I now prefer the 517 's 'cause ride my horses more and were my boots more ... plus , they just , plain feel good when they 're on me ...
 Who does n't love Levis ? These are great ! My son was happy on Christmas day and so were we . Happy Holidays !
 It is great to find the exact size , color , and fit you want in a Levi 's jean , and also get it on time .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean , Medium Stonewash , 38x29They fit perfectly . Will probably order more in a couple months .
 Needed a size that few brick & mortar stores keep in stock . Amazon had style I wanted in the size that I wanted at a good price !
 These blue jeans where a great color and a perfect fit . Glad I ordered them . They were a present for my son
 My husband has been wearing Levi 's since he was a teenager . They are the most durable jeans and he loves the boot cut .
 I 've been wearing these for years.They do tend to fade easily so wash them inside out and use a detergent product for black fabrics .
 I bought these as a gift for a friend who has worn this style for years . Good quality , good fit , good style .
 Great product ... my dad was very pleased . He had not been able to find the 517 .
 These were a birthday gift for my son and I had them sent directly to him at college . He loved them and they fit great ! Good quality for the price . He liked the fit of the boot cut .
 These are great jeans for us gals , too , especially if you like to wear a true black color . I dress them up with a feminine camisole and heels , and have got many compliments on them .
 Exactly what my hubby wants . It 's difficult to find his size in our local stores . Very happy Amazon now has Levi 's in his size .
 I love my new bootcuts . I received them quickly , They fit perfectly . Thank you .
 I 've grown frustrated by the lack of good quality/reasonably priced jeans in the market today . At some point , the Levis brand started to suffer in terms of quality/value for the dollar . Do n't remember exactly when that happened , but I started to buy my jeans from Banana Republic . Over time , they stopped making the style I grew to rely on . This created a 7-10 stretch where I could n't seem to find a good pair of jeans . Most recently , I purchased a pair of Lucky jeans - ridiculously over priced . When those began to fail , I tried Levis again and bought these . For a third of the price of Lucky Jeans , these Levis boot-cut jeans are really nice . They have a really substantial feel/weight to them and I could n't be happier with the purchase . I was so pleased , I ended up buying a second pair .
 Levis 517 Boot Cut Jeans are just as advertized . Good fit and a perfect boot cut . I highly recommend them for anyone who needs boot cut jeans .
 These were ordered off Amazon when I could not find them locally . I found the pants and they are describer perfectly and fit exactly as I had wanted them to . I will buy more in the future because they were perfect .
 Completamente satisfecha con el producto , exactamente igual a lo que ofrecieron . LLego en el tiempo estimado que prometieron . Ninguna queja , volveria a comprar de nuevo .
 The Levi jeans were just like I expected . The fit was perfect and received them in just a few days . Thanks !!
 The quality of the denim is lighter , so the good fit disappears by the end of the day . Otherwise , I like 'em !
 Hubby dearest was so happy to find boot cut Levi jeans at Amazon as it seems most stores have quit carrying this style of jean . He likes to wear boot cut jeans and Levi jeans are his favorite brand.No complaints about the fit or wearability either . Ordered two more pairs of jeans today as he 's a happy camper.Recommend .
 Good deal on the jeans and speedy shipping . My first pair of boot cut jeans . My girl friend really likes them on me . I got the dark blue -LRB- rinse -RRB- . Fit good and comfortable .
 My skinny son is 54 years old and will not wear any other jeans - only 517 , boot cut Levi 's so I know what to buy for Christmas and Birthdays . I found a perfect fit for my skinny husband also .
 I ordered these jeansLevi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jeanfor a Christmas gift a short time before Christmas . I knew the size . I was somewhat concerned that I would not get them on time for Christmas The package came just before Christmas , and the jeans were exactly as pictured , nicely packaged -LRB- each pair separately enclosed in plastic bag -RRB- , the right size and color . I was very pleased , as was the recipient of the gift !
 The jeans were a Christmas gift and a style regularly worn by the recipient . They were a perfect fit . They are hard to find locally so we ordered from the Internet . The red tag on the back pocket did not say `` Levis '' and I have never seen this before . Is it significant ?
 Wow . These are great blue jeans , and they come in 38 long which is what he wears . HE wanted the boot cut , and a 34 waist was large enough . Usually he wears a 36 , , but I ordered 34 and they fit just right . Great looking , great price .
 I bought two of these ten years ago , and they are the best . Still good after all these years . And I disagree that they are too roomy -- they have fit me perfectly .
 Cute costume , reasonable price but be warned this costume runs smaller than other costumes offered by the manufacturer -LRB- Leg Avenue -RRB- The jacket has no give/stretch at all . I am 5 ' 5 '' 118 lbs -LRB- typically a size 2-4 or a size small -RRB- this costume is a very tight fit . Size small is supposed to fit sizes 0-6 . If you are bordering the end of the size range -LRB- a size 5 or 6 -RRB- I recommend ordering the next size up.The dress is sewn into the jacket -LRB- one piece -RRB- It 's very short so either buy a pair of ruffly underwear or buy a petticoat to complete the outfit .
 I love this costume , possibly my favorite one I have ever owned , I was going to buy a small until I read a review that this costume runs smaller . I am 5 ' 5 and 118lbs and the medium fits me perfect its a little longer than i anticipated , but if you buy the petticoat -LRB- highly recommended ! -RRB- than it looks amazing . I also bought the hat and leggings all together and saved a bit on shiping !
 Wonderful product ! With the elastic headband it fits perfectly on young children -LRB- 7-8 year olds -RRB- . The headdress came with all feathers perfectly intact . Highly recommend !
 These socks are just what I was looking for . They are VERY soft and warm . Even after washing they stayed soft .
 I have purchased many other similar type socks in the past , and these are by far my favorite . The turquoise color is just beautiful and makes me happy every time I look down at my feet . I wear size 9 1/2 -10 , and the large size here is plenty big , with just the right amount of elastic to stay up on my calf without leaving any marks from being too tight . They are really well-made , thicker and fuzzier than they look . And they 've held up well to many many washing/drying cycles too -LRB- a common complaint for me with other similar types of socks -RRB- . They are more expensive than the other pairs I 've bought in the past , but are well worth it in my opinion because these will last me a long time . They are my daily wear here in snowy SW Colorado .
 I love how soft and fuzzy these socks are . Very comfortable and fun to wear . My grandkids love wearing them too .
 Super soft , love the feel . Use them to keep my feet warm in bed . They tend to slide down , but still work well .
 Bought them for my wife for christmas . They are soft and warm like the description says . I would buy more for her .
 These are perfect for those with cold extremities ! In fact , they can even get a bit too warm in less than frigid weather .
 Wife says softest socks she has ever has but a little slippery on bare floors .
 These really are the softest socks in the universe , I feel like I 'm cheating on my cat with these socks .
 I bought these socks for a friend who spends long hours in a work environment with poor heating circulation . She absolutely loved them ! I liked them so much I requested a pair for myself for Christmas .
 this was exactly the product I hoped it would be and everything I wanted and expected . great , blah , bla , blah .
 I bought a pair of these socks for my girlfriend for Christmas . They are warm , very soft , and comfy ! She loves them !
 my girlfriend likes it warm , i like it cold . she as an abundance of super cozy fluffy warm clothing and these were the latest addition to the roster .
 Given as a gift . Recipient likes it . Shipped on time . I found them to be a little less than what I expected .
 My wife loves these socks . She said they 're warm , super soft , and comfy . She has hinted that `` it sure would be nice to have some more of these '' , with a big smile . They 're her favorite socks to grab as soon as she gets home after a long day of work . I will be buying more of these .
 These socks are really comfortable , soft and warm -- perfect for cold winter weather , and I like the silver-grey color , too !
 I really liked these socks , so soft and warm and the color -LRB- blue -RRB- was gr8 . I just wish the price would have been better , and wish that you could bundle the colors together for a savings .
 I bought several of these for Christmas presents . While more expensive than most , they are well worth the price . Great quality and seriously soft . My daughter gave a black pair to her boyfriend and they are by far his favorite down time socks . Wash and wear over and over , they just get softer !
 These are very soft and comfortable . They almost feel as though they are massageing your feet .
 Love these socks , for the first time I have socks that fit , soft and comfortable , instead of the short , tight ones I had been buying at the store . And , great service from the seller ! I bought a couple dozen all together .
 i will never buy cotton socKs againthese feel so nicelove iti wish they came in anKlets !!
 my wife LOVES these socks ... they are inexpensive and seem to be very good quality . . they even stay soft after being in the dier . . but I would n't dry them too hot . .
 I love the color of these and they are so soft ! I have tile floor . . so these keep my feet warm . I will buy more when I need them and would recommend them !
 Bought these for my fianc&eacute; as a stocking stuffer , she loves them and they are very comfortable . However , they slip off her feet rather easily . Other than that they are great ... She really enjoys her foot massages while wearing these .
 She loved them ! Very soft and comfortable . A little pricey , but seems worth it . That is all you need to know .
 There were a lot of reviews that said these were cheap and thin and got holes in them , but my mom loves them .
 I would definitely buy this again . it was exactly what i was looking for . except i hate theses rating surveys
 these were perfect for a christmas basket for my boyfriend 's mom . exactly what I was expecting , and arrived very fast . good quality and great price
 The socks were delivered on time . I was pleased to see that they met my expectations for the sock . They were warm and fuzzy and looked just like the picture . The color was the same too ! I purchased these socks for a gift to match a scarf , and I was surprised to find I loved both ! Definitely a worthy purchase .
 Super soft socks . I have n't had any problems with fuzzies , but I have n't washed them yet . The socks came in great condition and are exactly as pictured .
 I ordered thses for my 88 year old mother to go with a robe I ordered . I was told by my sister who is wrapping them for me they are very soft and she will love them .
 These are outrageously wonderful warm and wonderfully beautiful socks . Colors and textures far better than photograph can show . The smoke hue is incredible-a rich , warm charcoal . The turquoise is just brilliant and beautiful.Fit is generous , working for women with larger feet and ankles , including a real size 10 . Stretch is knit into the fabric , so these will never leave an elastic mark on your ankles . These socks truly cradle your skin.I have circulation problems in my feet and these warm fuzzy socks have earned the title `` new favorite '' . So comfortable , warm , and outrageously satisfying that I am going to order more right away.Recommended as a gift for women of all ages !
 excellent product . My 90 year old mom had poor circulation and very cold feet . She was able to wear this in bed and they were very soft and warm . After these were sent to her , she would not wear anything else .
 I ca n't believe how quickly the comfy spa socks arrived . I plan to buy more for Christmas stocking stuffers . The colors are extremely vibrant tho ... so I will stick with white or black next time . They are well worth the price .
 These socks are awesome . They are very soft and feel so good on your feet . The top does not make dents in your skin for those who have swelling in feet and legs . They do not fall off or move about . I love them . I want to get more . I got ivory , turquoise , smoke , and pink . LOVE them all . They are beautiful and better than any sock at a store .
 Bought these for my wife and here are some of the comments she 's made : Pros : Very comfortable super soft plush material and keeps your feet warm.The inside of the sock has remained soft after about a year of use and washing in the machine , and my wife still uses her first pair.Cons : Have a tendency to slip off your feet while sleeping and may end up down at the bottom of your bed under the covers.The bottom will eventually get hard on the outside from walking on carpet and where you step down on it . She has n't had any issue with slipping because she walks almost strictly on carpet.A little bit pricey for one pair of socks BUT they will last a long time before you ever need a replacement.Overall she highly recommends the socks to anyone looking for a soft , durable pair of socks even at the slightly high cost .
 Similar socks are available in almost ever store in the winter but not all socks hold up the same . I tend to wear these at night with my pj 's more than any other time . They do n't cause static under the covers , nor get pulled off when I sleep , they are n't tight around my ankles , yet they wash and wear well and hold their shape . Great product and purchase !
 I bought 6 pairs of these last year , and they have held up so well I just bought 3 more . They are rather oversized -LRB- I wear size 8 1/2 shoes -RRB- so when it 's really cold I wear them over slipper style sox for extra warmth . I do wish they went higher up on my leg , they go about 2 1/2 &#8221; up the ankle , but that 's a slight quibble , mostly I love them .
 Soft and Warm Microfiber Fuzzy Socks are the ideal choice for long winter , give as a gift for a friend and she like it .
 I love them . Bright cheerful , warm and fuzzy . Fit inside slip on shoes easily , gentle elasticity especially if your ankles or legs swell - leaves no mark or indentation .
 I love how soft and fuzzy these socks feel . They do n't slide off my feet and feel great ! Beautiful color too .
 I got these for my girlfriend , and let me tell you . These are the softest things my skin has ever had the privilege to touch . And they feel even better on your feet ! 10/10 would buy again .
 I just got these today and quickly opened a pack and put them on . I live in Alaska and it 's that time of year again to get the winter clothes out . I was simply amazed how warm soft the socks are and they go all the way to my calves ! I approve of these socks and recommend them to anyone .
 I do n't know why these pink fuzzy socks are so warm to sleep in but they are . And they machine wash and dry like a dream . I use them every night . I have small feet -LRB- size 7.5 -RRB- but I can see that they will cover many sizes . If you constantly have cold feet , this is a good way to start.UPDATE
 I defy any man to look at his wife walking around in a pair of fuzzy pink socks and not think that , despite all macho impulses fighting against it , they look damn cute on her . Also , she tells me they 're warm and comfy , so that 's nice too .
 Fuzzy colorful socks . Does the job
 They are perfect for lounging at home . They are so soft and comfortable . I ordered the pink socks and I am very pleased !
 I bought two of these ten years ago , and they are the best . Still good after all these years . And I disagree that they are too roomy -- they have fit me perfectly .

 Simply the best fishing glasses ever.I have tried them all but always return to Revo .
 I used this thing for the first 2 years of grad school and it was excellent . I hauled huge quantities of books and notes around all the time and the thing is like new . And it is really waterproof . When I got a new laptop this year , I ordered the laptop version and I love that too .
 This is the best investment in a bag I have ever made . It looks brand new and I have had it for almost 8 months . Its waterproof , durable , and I can fit a lot of heavy school books into it . The strap is thick and comfortable to strap around your body . I love having it on my bike rides to the grocery store , because you can fit so much into it and not have to put plastic bags on your handle bars and hope they do n't break on the way home!LOVE IT . I plan to get a smaller one for shopping and travel .
 I was a messenger in NY , NY before I joined the Army and I used a Timbuk2 purple and green bag then and loved it . Now that I 'm in the army purple and green are out of the question but this bag will due . It is the strongest easy to use multipurpose bag you will ever need . Just be careful how you pack it for maximum comfort . On the negative side the waist band is too short.Timbuk2 Classic Messenger BagTimbuk2 Strap Pad - Grip -LRB- Black -LRB- Grip -RRB- - one size -RRB-
 This bag really amazed me when I got it . It was the perfect size with a little extra room just in case . I 'm able to take it downtown when I commute and bring a textbook and change of shoes to work , as well as carry all my textbooks , notebooks , and binders to school . It is extremely versatile and I love that it 's waterproof and very durable . This bag will also be extremely useful when I 'm able to go away for the weekend . :-RRB- This was definitely the bag for me .
 This is a great bag . Lots of room . The small is bigger than I thought it would be . I also bought a medium sized Timbuk2 bag and it would be great for traveling . I like the bag so much I bought a few for friends and family . Nicely made with lots of compartments for cell phones and PDA 's .
 This bag is great . Sturdy . Stylish . I love the quality . Works great as a purse , diaper bag , or carry-all . Highly recommend it !
 This is an awesome bag . Works great for a laptop and is easy to carry .
 I 'm using this bag to hold my 15 '' MacBook Pro . It has the right amount of padding and convenient pockets . The strap , however , just hurt my shoulder and annoyed me ! No worries , I replaced it with the SKOOBA superbungee strap , and now it 's the perfect laptop bag !
 Timbuk2 bags are awesome and nearly indestructible just like the T2 . I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it . The only thing missing is a side pocket for a water bottle . But I suppose the bike messengers did n't have time for frilly extras like that . If you can take the time to visit the company 's website to custom design your own bag or check out the cool artist designed limited ones .
 I 've been using my medium timbuk2 messenger bag for the past 2 years . Frankly , I think large is way too big . Even medium is a bit much for my 5 ' 3 '' frame . Let me give you an idea of how much a medium bag can hold
 I got the small one.Pros1 -RRB- Heavy-Duty Construction2 -RRB- Lots of pockets inside3 -RRB- Detachable Reflectors4 -RRB- Detachable Cross StrapCons1 -RRB- The velcro can be disruptive in quiet situations2 -RRB- It might not be good for protecting things that get creased easily -LRB- e.g. loose sheets paper -RRB- , esp . when it 's relatively empty -LRB- as it has no structure -RRB- I use it every day . Looks like a good investment .
 I was tired of carrying a camera bag that screams out `` expensive equipment inside ! '' After seeing a link on the Internet of another photographer that took a Tenba messenger bag insert , and placed it inside of a Medium Timbuk2 Messenger Bag , I imitated his idea . I 've now been carrying my Timbuk2 for the past month , and am amazed by the amount of equipment I can comfortable carry inside of it . It has been through both a snowstorm and a rainstorm , and my equipment stayed dry.The quality craftsmanship of the Timbuk2 is one of the first things I noted upon receiving this bag , making it obvious why this cost a bit more than the run of the mill big box store messenger bag .
 As a grad student in computer science , I take my computer with me * everywhere * . I need bags that can take a light beating every day for a long time . When my old computer bag developed a large tear at the computer pocket , I wanted something that would be large enough for me to carry my computer , its accessories , a textbook , a notebook , and my digital camera , which is an oversized point-and-shoot that 's just a little too large to fit comfortably into any bag . Needless to say I also wanted something that would n't rip open or have the clip for the shoulder strap snap and drop my computer onto the sidewalk , both unpleasant experiences I 've had with other bags.I was a little wary of carrying the laptop in a sleeve that could rattle around inside a larger bag , but many of my friends do it that way and seem to have no problems . One of them introduced me to Timbuk2 's products , and after a lot of research and agonizing I ordered the Classic Messenger Bag and Timbuk2 ` sTimbuk2 Wiki Laptop Sleeve.The CMB is great , though it is basically `` just a bag '' with a few auxiliary pockets . The medium size -- which looks big and is actually a little bigger -- holds everything I need , with just a little room to spare , and if I ever want to carry other stuff -LRB- groceries , camping supplies -RRB- I can just take the computer out and have a pretty humongous bag . It 's comfortable , the lining is waterproof , the strap has a nifty quick-release length adjustment , and it feels very , very secure . My girlfriend admired mine so much that she asked her family for one , and I got my brother one as a Christmas gift , as he frequently bikes to work.Some caveats , all of which I consider minor points a buyer might want to be aware of , rather than real issues I have with the product : - It took me a couple days of fiddling with the length of the main strap and how the bag sat on my back before it was really comfortable . I could tell when I first put it on that it was well-built and would be comfortable ; I just had to spend some time and find the sweet spot . - The top does n't really close ; it 's just the main flap of the bag flipped across the opening . Things seem to sit so that the bag pinches shut at the top naturally , and there 's a safe margin of overhang , but I 've noticed that the main strap can pull the overhanging edge of the flap up , rather than down over the side of the bag . I 've never had an actual problem with this , and neither has the friend who showed me the bags in the first place , but it seems worth mentioning . - The cross strap -- yes , it can be a little confusing at first . However , it 's not outrageously difficult either . I got it backwards the first time I tried it , reversed it , and had no further issues . Once you 've got it it 's pretty obvious , and you do n't really need it unless you 're riding a bike or something similarly athletic . - The quick-release on the main strap seems prone to a little slippage unless you really clamp it down . I assume that 's why it has a kind of double-loop system that allows you to adjust the amount of slack strap available for extending at any given time but that 's a little tedious to work with . - There are a lot of auxiliary pockets inside and a couple outside . They 're all useful sizes and pretty much perfectly hold all my stuff , but the interior pockets are built of some much lighter material than the rest of the bag , and it seems to stretch and sag with use . I 'd had a lot of pens in the pen pockets for a couple weeks until I noticed they were getting loose and slightly misshapen . I would n't rely on them to hold a lot of stuff , despite the apparent size . - You ca n't really carry anything on the outside of this bag without buying some accessories from Timbuk2 . This does n't bother me , as I keep phones in holsters and keys in my pocket , but if you put everything in your bag it might be a hindrance . - Word of caution
 I got my first Timbuk2 -LRB- large classic messenger -RRB- back in college , and it 's about 3 years old now . Still going strong and getting better with age i.e less stiff , more seasoned look and feel . Timbuk2 makes amazing bags in a wide range of designs , and the classic messenger is , in my opinion , the best of the lot.I own a large sized classic messenger , and it carries everything I need to bring around -LRB- lots of junk -RRB- and more . The only thing that you have to be careful is not to be too happy tossing stuff in , only to realise that the bag is just wayyyy to heavy to lug around without causing sore shoulders/back . A strap pad is essential if you 're carrying anything larger than a medium-sized classic messenger.These bags are sturdy , practical -LRB- very well-designed pockets , slots , keyrings etc -RRB- and look good to boot . I 've also got a small classic messenger and a large cargo tote that I bought for my mom who complained about her other bags not having enough compartments -LRB- typical women 's purses -RRB- or being too small to hold all her stuff in an organized way.While Crumpler bags are also an alternative in a similar price range , Timbuk2 bags seem more suited for serious messenger bag users , while Crumpler bags are more like casual , fashion accessories.All in all , I seriously recommend Timbuk2 bags for their design and durability . Go Timbuk2 ! -- > Updated to add that I 've added a limited edition purple retro messenger to the Timbuk2 family here : -RRB-
 A great bag for birders :1 . It 's very comfortable and rugged and holds just what I need without becoming a brush-navigation hindrance .2 . The strap is very wide , which I was put off by at first glance , but the result is a very comfortable carry when the bag is full . Unlike other bags I tried on , the strap on this bag is plenty long -LRB- although , I 'm 5 ' 2 '' , so what does that mean ? -RRB- .3 . I can carry a midsize camera , field guides , small notebook , snacks , and water in the main compartment . The internal pockets hold a LOT of little stuff -LRB- ipod , pens , jots , bug juice , memory sticks , first-aid junk -RRB- without cluttering the bottom of the bag . All this gear is right at my fingertips ... no more flushing birds while shucking a backpack in the brush .4 . It does n't have TIMBUKTU plastered across the front . The attractive logo is visible , but it does n't turn me into a human billboard .5 . I bought it for birding , but it quickly replaced the pack I -LRB- as a good Pacific Northwesterner -RRB- have long used as an everyday bag.It loses a star because I hate velcro and this bag comes with two enormous strips of that noisy % # @ ! . My usual trick of covering the scritchy side with felt fixed that problem . The bag is well balanced when loaded -LRB- does n't tip and spill -RRB- , so eliminating the velcro has n't reduced it 's performance.This model would NOT be an adequate size for use as a book bag . Try the next size up or stick with a pack to save your back .
 awesome bag . I love Timbuk2 . This is my 2nd bag , and I basically bought this one to have a smaller bag to use at different times when I do n't want to lug my laptop around . It 's made well and looks cool ... what more could you want .
 The Timbuk2 class messenger bag is great . Holds quite a bit for it 's size . Very useful and good quality .
 I bought this bag 11 years ago when I was in college . It has more than withstood the test of time - I still use this bag on a daily basis with only some mild wear on the inside vinyl waterproof lining that has affected its waterproof-ness -LRB- though based on what I read on the company website , this is covered as part of their lifetime warranty ! -RRB- . Pick your colors carefully because you 'll never need to buy a new bag .
 This bag has made such a difference . It is comfortable , spacious , and organized so that I am not constantly digging around looking for things . It is great for everyday and if I get tired of carrying it , my husband does n't mind holding my `` purse '' for me . There have been a couple of instances where I was a little embarrassed by the loud velcro sound of opening my bag , but that is far outweighed by the benefits . I even got a complement on how nice it looked , but this is no fashion purse . Thanks Timbuk2 !
 I was worried this bag would be too small , but there are enough pockets for everything , one big space for lunch , books , fits a regular size folder or notebook . If I could afford it , I 'd get a few in different colors because it was hard to choose just one . The only thing I would change is to remove the Velcro from the front flap - just not a fan of the noise . Sometimes you just need to grab a mint in a quiet place .
 I Love Timbuk2 ! This is my second bag . I have the medium size which I put my laptop and my work essentials in . I recently purchased the extra small to use for day trips and to run errands . I ordered the small but had to return it as the size difference between the medium and the small where not that significant . These bags are durable and sturdy . The quality surpasses any messenger back that I have ever owned . Amazon was great ! I purchased many things through them and the delivery time is pretty accurate . I hope to buy more Timbuk2 's soon !
 The bag is O.k. . It seems to be durable and is water-proof from rain splatters . Im sure that on a bike in a rainstorm water would get in from the top corners . One thing I dont like about the bag is that it should have a zippered pocket along the back of the inside . It does have a small one in the front inside . I saw another Timbuk 2 classic messenger bag with the zip pocket on the back inside for files etc. . I would definatly of prefered that model . As far as the color goes all black is kind of plain and boring . I should of got one with some colors . I was thinking about all black being able to hide stains , which im sure after a few years of use ill be glad I got the all black . Overall the bag is good for what it is . I use it for college and it is working well . I will definatly be using it to go to the lake this summer and on my boat .
 I got this bag on sale for thirty dollars . It looks sharp , it is comfortable , it is the perfect size . I just do n't know what else I could ask for . I knew it was going to last me a looooooong time just from seeing the fabric it was made out of up close . The dudes at timbuk2 have obviously been at this for awhile and know a lot about what a good bag needs and what serious cyclists demand . Sure it might not be as hip as Chrome or other brands , but seriously , they make some slick colorways , and at prices like these it is an undeniable steal .
 I bought for my wife because she is starting grad school . The bag is made very well and has an easily adjustable strap for comfortable over the shoulder carrying . The key holder is great because , with a purse my wife would search for hours . There is a good amount of storage and many deep pockets that are not exposed to the world . Great bag .
 this bag is really nice for traveling . i used it in place of a purse . it held all of the things i bought plus all of my personal items . the only thing that i was disappointed about was that it was the xs size , and the over the shoulder strap could be a tad bit longer . when i was ordering it i was n't aware there were different sizes and could n't find anywhere that said what size this bag was , when i got it , the bag was the extra small size , which i was concerned about , but in the end it all worked out .
 I have the XS size and I love it . It fits my personal essentials , a bottle of water and a book . It 's also light enough that it does n't strain my shoulder . I can access my things easily by swinging it around vs using a backpack . I just wish it had a pocket on the back of the outside -LRB- for mail -RRB- , a big open pocket on the inside and a handle on the top . The padded strap that came along with it kept sliding around so I took it off . It worked much better for me that way . It retains it 's shape with a bottle or a book inside it unlike the bigger models .
 I was very pleased with my purchase . It was exactly what I ordered and wanted . Price was great too .
 I just took this bag out for the first time to a 2 week trip through Brazil and the bag was even better than expected . I bought the medium-sized bag and was able to fit more than I could possibly ever need out and about on the streets . The bag is well-constructed and heavy-duty and shows no use whatsoever after using it for 12 + hours everyday for 2 weeks . The weight distribution works really well and my back never tired even with carry a lot of weight in the bag . If you are looking at buying a bag , I would seriously check out each size , because the medium was even bigger than I anticipated . This bag would be great for any traveler or person on the go .
 Here 's the series of reactions I had when I opened the box containing my Timbuk2 : : : open box to find a ` medium ' sized Covert Timbuk2 : : I think to myself , `` WOW , this thing is massive '' : : unwrap plastic wrapping to reveal external fabric : : `` This bag is huge ! Nice `` covert '' fabric . Pretty cool . '' : : Open the Timbuk2 to see the inside of the bag . The velcro releases a loud `` belch '' and the plastic fabric crinkles : : `` Jesus , this thing is loud . So `` plasticy ! '' This is like a tarp sewn into a bag . But , look at how spacious this is , and there 's pockets for pens , my phone , and miscellaneous stuff . Pretty cool . '' : : Toss it onto my shoulder : : `` Feels like plastic too . A bit awkward on my shoulders without anything in it . '' ... I have n't had the chance to use it . The bag looks tremendously useful ; I could easily put my four cats into the bag and ride around town . Unfortunately , part of it 's usefullnes is that it 's made of 99.9 % plastic , which feels cheep .
 This is a awesome bag . It 's my second one and the size is perfect from commuting to work.Javapie3
 I got the large size at first , and once I realized that it was way too big . The material feels nice and durable . I do n't think that I 'll get any damage to this unless I do something excessive to it .
 My son is very particular about his possessions and this bag was one he requested for Christmas and he really loves it . He researchs important possessions he purchases and he undoubtly did the same in this case . Service was prompt ant this had the look and feel of a quality product .
 This bag is AWESOME ! I love it ! It is big enough to carry about 5 textbooks , or a computer with about 3 books . There are only a few slightly negative aspects -LRB- that really are n't that big of a deal , but a slight surprise nonetheless -RRB- ... the bag 's over the shoulder strap does not lengthen as far as some other messenger bags , meaning for those who like to have the bag trailing behind their ankles , I suggest another style of bag . Also , it has no padding in the inside . Absolutely none . The fabric is very durable , and that makes up for the lack of cushion . This is not a problem unless you need to use it to carry a laptop ... I just wrap my computer in a piece of fleece , which adds a little comfort and ease to my mind and computer , and it is fine
 Every feature of this bag is practical and efficient . While some bags and full of pockets and key rings and flaps that serve only to confuse , tangle and annoy , the Timbuk2 Messenger Bag was clearly designed by someone who actually USES this bag.The front flap is big enough to safely cover the contents , yet flexible enough to quickly retrieve something . The key ring is on a red cord , making it easy to find , and the cord is attached to the opening of the large zip pocket so you can keep it in or out of the pocket but always find and access your keys even when the bag is full . Pockets within pockets make for sensible organization , and there 's a great cell phone pocket and ID or security card pocket . The side of the bag with the pockets is the one that 's AWAY from your body as you wear the bag , which at first seems strange . You then realize it is far easier to get in the pockets when you can see them!I ca n't say enough about this great bag . Oh yes I can ... It looks great too !
 This review is for the medium , solid black , made in the Philippines Timbuk2 messenger bag . I have been using it for about a month now , mostly going back and forth to school.As the title states , I am left-handed . One of the great features of the Timbuk2 is its easily adjustable cam belt . If you have the money to spare , I highly , highly recommend spending the extra money and getting the lefty model if you plan on wearing this over your right shoulder . I have only seen the lefty model available directly from Timbuk2 , but it may be available elsewhere . However , if you are like me and want to save a few bucks by shopping through Amazon , the `` right-handed '' model works just fine over the right shoulder . It just means that you have to take the bag off or flip it around front to adjust the strap instead of adjusting it while it 's still on the shoulder.This is a messenger bag not only in name , but in practice . I only suggest getting it if you plan on using it on a bicycle , as this is where it excels . The cross-strap helps it stay in place even when pedaling hard or leaning over . It is pretty bare bones
 I 've only recently heard of the Timbuk2 brand , but I am quickly sold . Their messenger bags are top-quality products . Sturdy material , spacious compartments , and efficient design -LRB- e.g. the sturdy snap-on latches , secure velcro , etc -RRB- . And best of all , these messenger bags come in a wide array of sizes and design/colors . The only caveat I would give to first-time customers is to really LOOK at the dimensions -LRB- inches centimeters -RRB- of the bag before you choose a particular size . I purchased the `` extra small '' and trust me there is nothing smallish about it . It is surprisingly spacious for an item labeled as `` extra small '' . I can only imagine that the `` Small '' bag would be adequate for the majority of people . And the `` Medium '' and `` Large '' bags would be immensely roomy that you can probably store your 10-pound pet poodle there , with plenty of room to spare !
 I wanted a small , lightweight , strong , and moderately versatile bag in which to tote my thinkpad about , suitable for cycling , but not limited to that alone.just right for these requirements . do n't expect to store much more than your laptop , a kindle , and maybe a book . but hey , this bag makes you feel better looking!tlt -
 I bought this bag for a trip to Barcelona . I needed something that would carry my guide books , Spanish-English dictionary , water bottle , camera , and anything else that might come along . The bag did an excellent job . And it 's huge -- I bought the small one and I could fit my 17 inch laptop in there , with room for extra books . The bag is durable , practically indestructable , and is comfortable against your side as you carry it . When my trip is over , I will still carry this bag with me everywhere I go .
 I 've had this bag for about a year of daily use and I 'm very pleased with it . I just cleaned the inside with a damp sponge and except for a few pen-marks it looks like it is brand new.Large is very large . I recently put 16 hard-back books in it and it had room for a little more . If I were buying again , medium would be my choice .
 4 months ago I got the black and gray medium classic messenger bag.Though I gave it a 5 , its more like a 4.5 Thus far I have been very satisfied with it . It is very durable , quite spacious and looks good . I would warn against getting a larger bag , if you are planning to use this as any every day commuter item . It works really well while biking to work ; except when I have a large coat on , the chest strap is a little too short . Also , the Velcro is rather annoying when trying to open my bag quietly , the buckle latches are usually enough , to keep everything together . All together a great bag , but I got my marked down , and to me the starting price seems a little high .
 Great bag , great price since it was on sale . I was looking for a small messenger bag and had looked at the Chrome series but found that a little out of budget . The material of this bag is amazing , super heavy duty ballistic nylon and a waterproof lining that seems impervious to tears . I 'm only worried about water/snow being able to creep in through the sldes beacuse the top flap doesnt cover it most of the time , which wasnt a problem with the Chrome bags . But for the price , size and material , it does the job .
 This bag is great for so many uses . Bringing to work with files and such , bringing on a plane with personal belongings , a picnic with a packed lunch ! It 's just the right size ! Also , importantly for me , it 's perfect for riding a bike .
 I have had this bag for a few month 's now . I try not to go anywhere without it . The medium is perfect size for books and a laptop . I also use it for an overnight bag filled with clothes , alcohol , and still room for a netbook . Timbuk2 also has some cool accessories to go along with it like a bottle opener or an external pouch that goes on that strap that can hold most electronics .
 Got a bag in June of 2007 , use it for my gym gear and commute duties . Ride a motorcycle and the bag is great . I have a wide back and back packs do n't work very well , this bag perfect . After two years of hauling stuff back and forth from work and the gym , it still looks great.Would most definitely buy another one if something happened to this one . But at this point , the bag still looks new , except for some marks on the liner .
 This is definitely a solid versatile bag . I have 2 classic messenger bags and 1 commute laptop messenger bag . The large size classic messenger bag makes a perfect beach bag ; easily fits 2 large beach towels , a tarp for shade , sun screen , extra clothes , sandals , hat , frisbee etc. . . and is has those small pockets for your cell phone , wallet , and a key string ... and its water proof -LRB- so do n't have to worry about that big wave soaking all of your stuff when your not paying attention ! -RRB- . The medium size bag is great all around city bag ; on the bus , art fairs , concerts , college books etc. . . and the cross strap is perfect when your on your bike -LRB- that 's what this bag is made for . -RRB- The medium messenger bag easily fits everything you could ever need for a day in the city with room to spare.However , if you are looking to carry a laptop I would recommend going with the commute laptop messenger bag or any other timbuk2 bag that is laptop specific . The classic messenger bag has no structure as others reviewers have mentioned , and thus its not really made to hold a lap top . The commute laptop messenger bag is the way to go if your looking to haul your laptop and business papers ... it has a very nice protective laptop sleeve and more pockets for your school or business stuff .

 My son carries so many books and his binder and other stuff back and forth to school each day . It 's February and already I 've been through a backpack , another messenger bag , and a giant binder that is supposed to hold everything . First - three ring binders are a nightmare . I 'll never do that again . Second - a messenger bag or backpack you buy when all the school supplies are for sale in July and August just are n't going to cut it any more . The messenger bag worked but it was just too big . I did n't think it could be but his stuff just never `` fit '' and just moved around in that bag and it was just a mess . -LRB- NOTE
 I used to bike to work and this bag was great for that . It held my change of clothes -LRB- I biked hard -RRB- , my work laptop , and other various things . It also held up perfectly in the rain.Now I commute to work and the bag is great for that too . I keep my gym clothes and shoes in there and all my other normal work stuff . It 's kinda like a man purse ...
 Bag is quality ... you can tell it 's made well and with quality material . I only regret that I did n't go with a smaller size for my needs
 This bag is amazing . Yes , it 's definitely on the expensive side , but totally worth it to save the money . I doubt I will need to buy another bag of this type for a many , many years , if at all . I do n't use it for bike riding . I got it more because I live in the Seattle area and bus everywhere so I needed something that 's totally waterproof , can hold EVERYTHING -LRB- I got the medium size and yeah , it holds everything . As in , all my text books , a change of clothes for work , some food for work , and maybe toiletries if I decide to stay at my boyfriends that night -RRB- , and hold up to the wear and tear of life and heavy college text books . It does all of these things perfectly . I 've been using it everyday for the past month or so and have no gripes about it what-so-ever . I am a poor college kid but saving up for this bag was well worth it .
 WOW ! This bag was large . It was actually so large that I had to send it back . I later got the medium sized bag , and so far , it 's worked well for my uses .
 This is a great little purse . I loved it so much I ordered a second one . It holds everything I need including my cell phone and I like the security of a shoulder purse - but small , not those huge things . The leather is soft and the price was absolutely fantastic .
 I bought two of these ten years ago , and they are the best . Still good after all these years . And I disagree that they are too roomy -- they have fit me perfectly .

 Bought this for my Grandmother 's 100th Birthday . If I tell you that we all call her G-Ma does that make more sense now ? Was happy to find this costume bling available on Amazon . It went with G-Ma 's pink hoodie perfectly .
 My husband bought one of these shirts last year to try it out . I was very skeptical of the `` no ironing '' claim . I could n't believe my eyes when I took it out of the dryer the first time -- not a wrinkle to be seen . The material is truly miraculous . We both love this product and plan to buy more . Thank you , Jos. Banks !
 I own three of these shirts and they are great . I get my shirts cleaned and pressed and here is an example of what great shirts they are
 I own two of these Traveler non-wrinkle shirts and they are absolutely the best shirts I have ever owned . They are of high quality material and the size I bought was right on the money . The colors offered are very versatile with just about anything a person would own and can be worn formally or casually . I am going to stick with buying more of these shirts .
 I bought 2 to begin with and now own seven and I ca n't see myself buying other dress shirts
 I received this shirt as a gift over Christmas . Since then I have bought two more . The fit is outstanding and I have never felt a finer material in a dress shirt - it is soft yet sturdy and always appears pressed . The iron free is for real . I hate ironing and will pay the extra 20 dollars per shirt to never have to dry clean or iron again . I will never buy another shirt and I almost want to throw away my non-iron free dress shirts . I highly recommend this shirt . You will enjoy it and probably buy more of them .
 These dress shirts are the best ! Wrinkle-Free , Breathable , Durable Material , Plus lots of styles , sizes and color options . Compare side-by-side to other dress shirts and you 'll see and feel the difference .
 I bought 2 of these and man they are nice . I 'll admit the guy wearing the jean in the picture sold me . Like I went and look for all the style of Levi 's , and these attracted me the most . Although I would n't tuck in my shirt like that . But they sure look good with some chucks and or casual boots and a dress shirt , with a silver wrist watch , and a pair of shades . They are heavy , and for me kinda tight even though jean of a different brand and style with the same size , fit me perfectly . I do n't know I guess it the way they are made . But for the look , I 'll take the pain any day , yes these jean are so tight mostly in my thigh area and waist , that I do get a little discomfort pain in my lower back . I guess it the way they are design and the heaviness of the jean . Of course I am in the process of getting in shape again . So with time , these will be perfect . I do like to sag a little , but as of right now I ca n't with these . Until I lose some of that belly fat I accumulated over the years .
 These are the jeans I always buy , they are a great comfortable fit . It is also great that Amazon stocks the size I need , it 's impossible to get from the shops .
 My body was made for Levi 's brand jeans , and I 'd worn through a couple of pairs . I bought duplicate black 517s - soft but not washed out , dark , with a predictable fit . They are my new favorites . The process went smoothly . Who knew I 'd be buying clothes online ?
 I ordered these for Christmas for my 6 ' 2 '' grandson who had grown out of all his pants after checking stores and finding his size is almost impossible to find . They were perfect and he loved them .
 The Levi 's 517 Boot Cut were purchused as a replacement of the wrong ones bought at a local store , These ordered & delivered ; I was told fit greatly before & after ; washThe price for my buying , totaled out a nuff less even with shipping to come fromamazon , rather than a store , even on sale after my tax & shipping ; -LRB- as a late gift -RRB- Theonly guestion I got was about , they did not have the Levi 's cardboard shelf tagswe see on Jean 's in store .
 I love my levis . I was unaware they came in black . I bought a blue pair and black pair , Ilove them
 Just as described ! Fit & look exactly what he needed and wanted . And he said I could n't find this product ... LOLThanks !!! The Wife wrote the review ...
 These jeans fit great . The boot cut gives a good look without being sloppy . My husband looks hot in them .
 Got these as a gift for my brother , and they are the true blue classic with a great slim shape . Perfect `` date night '' jeans .
 These are the only jeans my husband will wear and we could not find them ANYWHERE . When i found them here i was happily suprised with the discount price and they look great . Would buy again from this seller .
 These jeans come washed so they are soft , supple and ready to wear . They are pre-shrunk so order the size you wear . I choose boot-cut jeans because I wear 12 '' - shaft western boots . Levies are the only jeans I wear because they fit well , look good , and get better with age .
 These jeans are perfect for the guy who wants to wear boots and not look like a geek or a thug . Just the right combination of loose and fitted .
 This is my first pair of Levi 517 's and I have to say I am very impressed . They sit on my natural waist -LRB- not low-rise like the 527 's -RRB- , and are fitted in the seat and thigh , and then flare out below the knee to fall on the boot . I 'm 6 ' 3 '' 190lbs and have a 36 waist and 34 inseam and it fit perfectly . Hard to find jeans these days that sit on the waist ... I 'm not a fan of the low-rise look or feel , so these jeans were a great find .
 Came to Amazon to order these jeans for my husband since no one ever has his size , 36x36 . I was pleasantly surprised because I did order two of these in different colors , Rancher Light and Rinse , both of which were the perfect colors . Perfect light colored jean and perfect dark colored jean . My husband and I are very hard to fit in jeans and tops so when something works we often get multiples , the problem however is that sometimes we buy the exact same thing in a different color and they fit totally different . Not these ! These jeans were great and the same fit ! Some people might not be able to appreciate that as much as I , but I was very grateful . It was a risk I had to take since his size is so common , but with free returns I had to take advantage . The boot leg is also very subtle but incredibly flattering . He does wear boots but of course they are n't necessary . I would say they are very true to size and great quality . They are currently his `` good jeans '' ... . that is until he `` accidentally '' wears them to go work in the garage . But when that happens , because it will , I will be back to purchase more ! By the way he is just over 6 ' 3 '' about 230-240lbs .
 i traveled 80 miles one day looking for the jeans i like with no luck , it did make for a nice bike ride though ! then i went online looking and i found what i was looking for at amozon these jeans are hard to get in my hometown!Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut JeansWhat a nice pair of rugged jeans . And I got them so FAST !! Thanks again.Roxann Hill
 Good product , on time and as shown in Amazon.But ... years ago , ordering the same # jean and the same size always brought the exact same fit and look . Lately , the same length , for instance , some times is a bit too long -LRB- can be fixed -RRB- or a bit too short -LRB- bad news -RRB- . The price to be paid for savings by manufacturing offshore . Lets see if with the crisis we return to the memorable `` MADE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ''
 What can I say ? They are Levis . Perfect fit , excellent quality , and the most impressive thing was the price . Unbelievable !
 517 's are the best fit for me -LRB- I 'm a bit older and looking for just a little more comfort -RRB- . I wear boots most of the time , and these do a great job of dropping over the boot and still maintaining a nice line on the leg . Plus , the little red tag says you are a real Texan and not one of those $ 150.00 / pair wannabe 's .
 a la medida , tabla de medidas excelente ...
 todo salio perfecto , tanto el envio como el paquete recibido , estan esplendidas , la hora de llegada fue la establecida por el vendedor
 Quality jeans , but not made in the USA.Arrived quickly and each pair were individually bagged in plastic.Good fit , for me .
 Fit well at the waist and look good . Last a lot longer than most most jeans and seem to get more and more comfortable the more you wear them .
 These are great jeans , they do tend to run a little big , both on length and waist . The color was a lot more bluer then it looks in the picture , so be weary of that it . It was too country , and I needed more rock and roll , if you know what I mean.Pros
 I was a bit concerned about this purchase . My husband likes the boot cut style and that was an excellent choice for my purchase . I have zero compliants other then I wish I 'd bought more !
 they were exactly what we were looking for . the orginal 517 , these are my hubby 's most favoritie , they also hold up better than the other styles seem to
 Will have to wash several times for them to fit . I buy this size all the time from other retailers and they are n't this big . Like the color and the style . They just run big I guess . Mainly in the length . Would buy again , just a smaller size .
 The fit is nice , the color is holding up through the wash . I am glad they have different sizes then the stores . Very hard to find 33 x 36 !
 I like the way these jeans fit.The are also comfortable.The ones I have purchased previously have been durable .
 These jeans fit me very well and look good . One thing I noticed however is that the denim has a more coarse feeling compared to other Levi 's jeans . I would buy these again .
 IL TELL YOU I HAVE BEEN WEARING LEVI 'S FOR YEARS ON END AND THE BEST DEAL I GOT ON THESE GREAT JEANS WAS FROM MY FAVORITE STORE AMAZON
 I love these jeans . For me they are perfect . Long enough to wear with or without boots and the fit is not too tight . How can you go wrong with Levi 's ?
 I got what I ordered promptly . I wish I had ordered a different color but -- my bad . No complaints . What else can I say ?
 The jeans was just perfect , the material , size and colour , nothing to complain about , and great timing too.They fit really well , and amazon 's size chart was very helpfull .
 Style & size stayed true since the last time I bought a pair , after gettingLevi 's Men 's 527 Low Rise Boot Cut Jeanthat are nothing like they used to be that 's all a shopper can ask .
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut . Black 42 waist / 30 length . If you are short , stocky and have a big butt . These pants are perfect . They wo n't bunch up at your fat knees and they will last a long time before the zipper explodes . I suggest you buy the next size up because they will shrink after 6 months of washing , drying and severe stretching in the seat area . Great pants .
 MY FAVORITE JEANS FOR 25 YEARS . I HAVE WORN MAINLY 501 MODEL , SO I READ MANY REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING THESE 517 JEANS.AFTER THINKING FOR A LONG TIME I DECIDED TO BUY ONE SIZE BIGGER THAN USUAL . IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE.THEY ARE JUST FINE , BLACK COLOR AND ZIPPER FLY WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DETAIL FOR ME !
 The fit and look are great and I saved a few dollars . Will purchase more when the price is right
 love this jeans , the fabric is really good and the cut is impecable . it is original and the communication was really easy , i recieved really fast .
 I 've always wanted a ` black 527 ' but found out I could only get that in rigid black.I decided to try 517 n whao I might just decide to continue with 517 even with other colors.Just the perfect fit I love .
 Is exactly what i was looking for . . i being using this model for years , and this pair of pant are excellent
 I am a creature of habit . Being of slim build I have found the 517 Boot cut to be the perfect jean for me . I also know my size so the fit was great as received . This is not always the case when ordering over the Internet . Service was great delivered on time as expected .
 These are the best jeans Levis has to offer in my opinion . They are not light and flimsy like some jeans Levis are making these days . The medium stonewash is a great even color . They do n't look faded on the seat and thighs or dingly and dirty like so many jeans do . These jeans are rugged , comfortable and last a long , long time . On top of that they look great . These are the only jeans I will buy .
 These jeans are everything they say they are . We will definately order these jeans again when the time comes . Thanks !
 100 % recomended , i have no doubt that i am going to buy another , it is really regular fit and boot cut
 This is the only jean my husband wears . He has the hardest time finding 36x29 . This is a perfect fit for him . When he needs more I will return to amazon .
 I finally found a pear of jeans that my wife said they look good on me and after being washed still fits great
 This pair of Levi 's fits perfectly and the indigo color is the same as the Levi 's I wore back in the day !
 I gave these Jeans to my daughter 's friend for Christmas and he really likes them.He is real thin and wears motorcycle boots.He likes how they fit and loves the boot cut.He especially likes the rugged material .
 My order arrived in a timely fashion , they fit good and look great ... I 'm gon na get a couple more pairs .
 Levi 's 517 ` sThese Levi 's were the perfect fit . I like the fact that they are pre rinsed , which makes the fabric softer .
 Many of us do n't want to wear our Levi 's half way up our bellies . 517s are the best answer for that !
 A well tried and true blue jean that I 've been wearing for decades . The fit , finish , and quality is a good as or better than ever .
 These seemed a bit darker in person than pictured but they were a great pair of jeans for my husband . This is his favorite style of jeans and he needed a new pair of &#34; dressy jeans . &#34; Same great jeans as in the past .
 All the Levi 's I purchased for my 16 year old son were ` made to fit ' ! From the straight to boot cut , they all were a perfect fit for his personal taste . They are well made and very stylish .
 Great jeans , great price , speedy delivery as promised ! Will definitely be ordering them again since my son is so tall and slim and this is one of the only places I can find his size .
 Great basic jeans in hard to find sizes . Not much to say otherwise . They have washed up well and held up well for my long and lanky teen .
 Bought these jeans for my husband . They fit very well and look nice . The shipment arrived on time . I was happy with my purchase .
 I ordered these jeans an exrta size longer becaause I wanted a high cuff . Got exactally that . Perfect !!! Now I 'm looking for a white pair
 Well , they 're Levi 's . There you go . Best jeans on the market . Last forever and fit great . The black does fade to gray quicker than I would like , but that 's probably because I wear only black , all the time . So ...
 I have worn Levi jenas for the last 16years , i am relatively tall guy and seldom get my size in the store , Amazon provides me my size and then quality as well .
 Purchased two pairs of Levi 's Boot Cut Jeans for my husband , the Jeans are very hard to find in the stores . Since my husband is tall , it is hard to find 36x36 .
 These pants are very well put together and I am a big fan of Levi 's pants durability which is what prompted me to purchase these .
 I am a woman but men 's jeans fit me better . These are very comfortable . My jeans do NOT get hung up on my boots as they do with jeans that are not boot cut .
 I like this style and they are getting very hard to find . The price here was the best I found , got in a timely manner . I 'm happy with my purchase .
 Purchased these jeans for my husband . They have a nice fit and look very good on . No baggy butt like the relaxed fit jeans .
 I usually have a hard time finding good bootcut jeans with the right fit in the retail stores . If the color/wash/fabric is right , the size isnt . If the size is right , the fit is too loose at the seat and thighs . Now that my favorite pair of jeans is past its prime , I started looking for a new pair to replace it . After hunting all stores in and around my area and trying all available bootcuts in my size , I was very disappointed . That is , until I found a pair of Levi 's 517 Blue Ox in the local Macy 's store . This was the first bootcut I found in the last 3 years that fit me perfectly . Since I already had a pair of jeans that was of a very similar color , I came online and started looking for the correct color in that fit . Unfortunately , it wasnt that easy finding one online . Kohls , Dillards and others had Levi 's 517s , but they werent the same ones I saw in the store . Apart from Macys and Amazon , no other site -LRB- including Levi 's own site -RRB- had the same fit in Rancher Light color I was looking for . I could have ordered at Macys website , but my past experience with Amazon was stellar and so it my first choice . Even then I was a little skeptical if the photos were close to how the jeans looked in reality . Since amazon had a free returns on this one , I went ahead with the order . The product , as always with Amazon , came 6 days ahead of their estimated delivery date . The jeans is , in fact , very close to the pictures on the website and the fit is PERFECT !! Thanks to Levi 's for the perfect color and fit and KUDOS to amazon for the perfect shopping experience !
 Finally Levi went back to 7 belt loops instead of the five . Makes a big difference for those of us that work for a living .
 I bought the 517 as I prefer this cut to any other one of the Levi 's catalog , I place it even above the so famous 501 . I 'm fully satisfied
 I love these jeans . The wash and fit are great . That being said , they did arrive with a hole in the seat and the seam is a little crooked on the inside left leg . I really do n't care though because they fit so good .
 It is hard to find male , black , slim fit , boot cut jeans . Believe me I searched many places both on-line and local retail outlets . Finally I found these on Amazon and they were just right . Great fit , looks good , and the price was reasonable . I highly recommend them .
 We will take these to alterations but they were about 5 inches too long . Otherwise they are very nice .
 True to size , did n't shrink , and minimal wrinkling . Love the variety of sizing - son is tall and thin , and hard to fit , but Levis 517 made it happen !
 If you know your size they fit . I do n't understand the reviews that say the sizes are wrong . Will buy again .
 was just what i expected ... very pleased with purchase . I like the fact that you can get 29 inseam . You can not get that in the store . No need to get them hemmed !
 his pants in overall line is still very good , sturdy , feels soft to the touch on the skin , the profile legendary cutting adds a touch of elegance , and even after several washings the fabric remains the same and does not shrink , the only thing I did not like the pants is that they have deteriorated the quality of the clips and metal buttons , formerly of copper and bronze , and now this are of aluminum and does not look good , however I recommend buying them are very good at the price .
 These came a little long , maybe an inch or two . Seeing as many others have noticed this is a problem with this fit , I suggest going one inseam size lower . I ordered a 30 '' and they fit more like a 31-32 '' . Other than the sizing , they are great jeans , and still look great on me . The boot cut allows the extra length to bunch up a little around the shoes , so you do n't really notice it . It actually looks good.I wish they sold these in a low rise version , as I do n't like hiking them up to where you might put dress pants or khakis . They stopped selling the 517 in a low rise though , so I 'm happy to wear them as is , great fit .
 I have always appreciated the fit and quality of Levi jeans . The boot cut has a closer fit around the knee with comfortable room in the hips and waist . What Levi Strauss needs to understand is that there is a huge population of men out there that has a 31 inch inseam . Men between 5 ' 9 &#34; and 6 ' fall into this size range . My growth did not stop at 30 &#34; inseam , and did not make it to 32 &#34; . So I either buy high water jeans that show my socks , or I let the cuffs drag the floor which signicantly reduces the life of the jeans . I liked the fit enough that I spent an additional $ 10 to get them hemmed to 31 .
 product arrived as expected on time , the product was as expected and the quality was as you 'd expect to find in a brick & mortar store .
 Great fitting . I usually buy the 527 style but they did n't have black in that style . Ordered a 517 instead and love the fitting .
 d e m a r a v i l l a e s t e m o d e l o muy bueno
 These are the first jeans in a while that actually fit my waist size , inseam and the leg openings are perfect .
 These jeans fit well but the denim seems less hefty than the denim of the same 517s from 5 years ago .
 I received my pants very quickly . I was concerned that my size would be too short for boots . I was pleasantly surprised that the designer was thoughtful about the shape and length for this item &#34; after &#34; several washings . Pants are about 1/2 inch longer than the average pants which make them perfect for cowboy boots . Pants are also very comfortable . JCD
 Noticed that they even have an extra pair of belt loops compared to my previous order . They are sturdy & dependable .
 The jeans were great ! The price was right , they were delivered in a timely fashion , and I lost a few lbs to get in them and I look good . lol . I recommend this company .
 These are the only jeans my son likes . He is tall and I have trouble finding his size in local stores and I could not find a better price .
 The jean came very quickly . They were the proper color , size , and cut . The packaging was excellent , and so was the quality of the jeans .
 Perfect price and fit for my husband . I would recommend this jean to any &#34; baby boomer &#34; who loves boot cut jeans.The jean has not changed at all good quality material and the right color . Thank you .
 My grandson loves these jeans , since he 's rather tall we were glad to find Levi 's makes great jeans in his size . Strange as it may seem , many brands of jeans do not come in a 34in length .
 As an active equestrian rider , and a woman of 59 years , I 'm ALWAYS looking for comfortable jeans that sit at my waist -- I do n't like women 's jeans at all - the fabric in women 's jeans seems flimsy , and the low-rise , hip-hugging jeans for riding or leisure wear feels uncomfortable . The men 's Levis and men 's Lee jeans are very comfortable , and they can handle my active life -- for me , men 's Levis 517 bootcut jeans have best variety for colors , and toughest quality in fabric .
 Nice one . . Boot Cut with nice fit.Ordered the Jeans with 29L but got it 3inch longer . So I had to do alteration , usually I order my pants with 29L and it fits perfect on me .
 Levis 517 's fit me better than any other jeans that I 've bought . Gon na stick with them . I wear a 38 waist , 36 inseam . Have bought several pair over the past six months from various places and they all fit the same . Good quality control !
 BASTANTE BIEN . BUENA CALIDAD DEL PANTALON . ME QUEDO MUY BIEN . TANTO EL LARGO COMO EN CINTURA . EXCELENTE COMPRA A UDS . GRACIAS .
 The jeans are a good deep color . Wish they were n't quite as thin as jean material seems to be getting , but seems they are all like that now . Overall a good pair of jeans.These are hard to find in 36x36 , so I 'm glad Amazon carries them .
 Perfect fit right out of the box . Started wearing immediately , stitches , pockets , zipper perfectly in place . Survived several washes good as new .
 Good price , perfect quality . Very good model for young and old-aged people . Gorgeous color . Classic zipper . I 'm satisfied ! I recommend to buy it .
 They 're good sellers and the product is very good , I like so much this jean . Ellos son muy buenos vendedores , el producto llego rapido a mis manos y era el esperado , los recomiendo ampliamente .
 I wear Levi jeans every day . Levi 's are the only jeans I will wear.I have worn Levi jeans for the past twenty -LRB- 20 -RRB- years ... or longer.Levi jeans are great ... in fact , i 'm wearin 'em right now ...
 Sent me what I wanted . 15 more 12 more 11 more 9 more 7 more 5 more 3 more done
 This is a very good price for this product , it 's the second one I 've ordered for my son .
 These boot cut jeans by my favorite jeans maker are exactly what I needed.When I ordered my Harley Davidson boots , I needed pants for when I wear them and these ones are the only ones that fit on the outside where others ca n't . Shopping local yields nothing like these , just junk not worth the money.Quality is what I 've come to expect from Levi 's , outstanding with fit absolutely perfect.More orders coming soon for these.Shipping was prompt , making this buyer very happy.Thank you to everyone for helping this lonely guy that hardly can get out to shop by bringing them to me.Again , THANK YOU VERY MUCH !!
 I thought these were more on the casual side , but after putting them on , they can pull off a nice look . Very comfy , one day to break in . No frays , quality zipper . Dimensions were perfect . Overall color is a shade or two darker than in the picture . Awesome , new favorite pair .
 If you have a problem with jeans bagging in the rear , then these jeans are for you ! They are a great fit and very comfortable ! My husband loves them !
 Well , its a good jean , everybody know the levi 's quality , the item arive in perfect conditions . . so nothing more to say . .
 Perfect fit , every time . 517 's are difficult for me to find locally , but buying on line thru Amazon is best for me .
 These are like they used to make them ! More belt loops , great fabric - love them ! Ca n't wait to order more of these !
 I was having a really hard time finding the boot cut Levis - no one seems to carry them anymore . These are just what I wanted . They look and fit good .
 Bought these for my husband and they fit true to size , maybe a little bit long but not so much that he wo n't wear them . He love them , they look good so I love them ! Great Pants !
 I ordered these jeans for my 16yo son & he really liked them . The only thing he would have preferred was a lower rise , but he 's wearing them without complaints . : -RRB-
 I am happy with the jeans and how they fit , but usually when I get 517 's , they are really stiff and then I get to break them in . This pair was already like pre-washed , just differnt than what I am used to , but I still like them and will wear them . Maybe I have to look into differnt types and find exactly what I am looking for next time . Thank you
 I 've been wearing 517 's for a good , long time now , and I love 'em ! The problem is that most of my local stores that sell them -- and very few of them do -- price them highly and also drastically limit the selection compared to the more popular 501 's and 550 's . Additionally , these jeans are often skipped over when it comes to the big sales . Well , shopping for them on Amazon is a decision I should have made long ago . The price here is hard to beat.As for the jeans themselves , they are of the rugged quality that Levi 's is known for . They fit like the product photo shows
 Have had these jeans for a few weeks now & am very satisfied.The flair from the knee down is discrete and does not look like the 70 's bell-bottoms . The fit on top was precisely as marked . The length seems about 1/2 inch longer than sized on the 501 's . Was formerly utilizing 501 slim fit jeans but found that could not place them over motorcyle boots . The 501s were great for rainy rides , but look too much like a cowboy , when tucked into the boots .
 As always , good shopping at amazon.com . Its always a problem finding the right length jeans for me . I found that in this levi 517 Boot cut jean , it feels good to finally find a jean that is not too short . A fact that i would have loved to know before i bought this jeans , is the leg opening size . This jean is very tight around the thigh area . I would just like a bit more details on the product a next time round . Other than that , it always a good shopping experience on Amazon .
 The length and waist were perfect . The quality of Levi jeans was the same as they had always been , good
 I always had to keep pulling up my previous pairs of Levi 's -LRB- any model -RRB- because they only had FIVE belt loops . A key ring and cell phone are not that heavy . I remember growing up with Levi 's having SEVEN belt loops and a heavier canvas . I was pleasantly surprised to see the ` new ' Levi 's 517 now have seven belt loops again . I started to buy a different model , but they still only have the five loops.I just bought a couple of these pairs from Amazon . I did check online at Kohls and their current batch of 517 's still show 5 loops . I will have to wait until I go to the store to see if their stock has been updated . Kohls prices are higher than Amazon , but I will recheck when they go on sale . I still check Amazon first for almost all my purchases.Overall , I like my new Levi 's jeans . I will compare them with older ones to see if the canvas really is slightly thinner . Outsourcing manufacturing almost always results in poorer quality and non-standard sizing . It has 100 % results in putting Americans out of work . I try to buy American whenever I can -- hopefully it will catch on.There is another issue appearing after I washed my new jeans with my old ones . It should n't have made a difference , but the new ones are now covered with fine fluffy hairs . I will have to use a lint brush when I take them out of the dryer for now . Although it may just be a ` break in -- first washings ' issue.Overall , I rate these jeans 4 stars . I will have to wait for a few machine washings to see how the color holds up . I may be old fashioned , but buying jeans looking like they are 1/2 wore out or have holes in them is ` less than optimal ' .
 I ran around town to find my husband Levi 517 's in size 35x32 for Christmas . In the stores , there were stacks of all different sorts of Levi 's to go through . Finally I came home and ordered them through Amazon and received exactly what he wanted . These Levi 's fit perfectly and look great . Very happy they come in off size waists . Thank you for making my job easier and receiving nice fitting jeans .
 I 've grown up wearing Levi 's and in particular 517 's in my adult life . I do like that Levi has added additional belt loops in the past year or so . Over the years Levi has cut some corners in manufacturing , but not enough to discourage me from continuing to buy their stonewashed 517 's . I like the stonewashed jeans since they are ready to wear , unlike the rigid indigo Levi 's that have to be washed several times to soften them up.I am buying more and more items from Amazon for the free shipping and competitive prices . It just saves a lot of time going to a retailer only to find out they do n't have my size or what I want . Even with Amazon collecting California sales tax , I figure the time and gas saved from having to go to a retailer is well worth it .
 The only problem was I had was that I had to have them hemmed 2 &#34; so as not to walk on the cuff . I would have ordered them shorter but they were not offered in the waist size I needed . The waist fit perfect and having them hemmed was not that big of a deal . It coast me $ 12.00 to have them hemmed .
 I love being able to find the 517 's on line and not having to run all over town for the style and size I need .
 If you promise not to tell anybody , I wear lined jeans from eddie bauer or llbean when it gets cooler . I wear these when it gets warmer . True to size , do n't shrink too much .
 These were a secret gift for my brother-in-law . He keeps complaining that he must do laundry every other day because he only has one pair of work pants , but then he just will not go get more or let anyone buy him any ! So , I got the size off of the one pair of jeans he owns -LRB- laundry is at my house -RRB- and I bought several other pairs that were similarly worn . I sneak in a new pair about once a week and so far he has n't noticed that he now has three pair of work pants . When I slip in the new ones , I put them in the dirty clothes hamper he uses . I wonder if he knows his pants are multiplying yet ?
 They arived bfore time , APO adress , in Afghanistan ,1 week took it to arive here , im suprised , and they fit good , i dont hawe no words
 Great fit for my long legs ! Hard to find jeans my size but Levi 's always comes through for me ! a
 Ordered these for my boyfriend , they run extremely small , he regularly wears a 32/34 had to send back and get a 36/34 . Other than that they 're great jeans .
 Finally a pair of Levi 's not only affordable , but a pair that is the real deal . . not seconds or blemished . . but cut perfectly . . The best I have bought in years . . Thanks . . and `` I 'll be back for more ''
 They fit just perfectly and I am very happy to not only get the bestdeal around but beat the sales tax . Good old Levi 's rigid , bootcut jeans have been my all-time favorite jeans my whole life , andI just turned 60 . Got 'em within a week , free shipping faster thanexpected , so that was cool , too . Amazon rules !
 The pants are great . I can not seem to find them in stores like Kohls or Target where I usually shop . I 'm not skinny as far as a skinny person goes but I have thinner legs than a lot of guys . These seem to be not as loose in the butt and thighs . I usually get the 505 's but they are cut a little bigger assuming tree trunk size legs . I have runners legs and these work . If you have big footballer legs , forget about it .
 Finally jeans that fit like the old Levis , these are the old quality heavy denim stuff not that wimpy pre-wash thin as paper junk denim . I would highly recommend these jeans to anyone who 's familiar with real Levis .
 Very easy shopping . I 'm familiar with the pants so it 's just a matter of price and convenience.Sitting at the desk for a few second beats driving to the store , finding out they do n't have the 517 in my size and driving back home . I 've always had trouble just finding the 517 at stores and shopping online sure makes things easier . The pants themselves are everything they 've always been , good fitting and tough.It 's nice to add the stonewash to my collection of darker denim so I do n't look the same every day.I was upprised how fast they came and that 's a big plus too .
 These jeans fit to size perfectly -LRB- for me -RRB- , are comfortable to wear , and have adequate material to reach a guy 's waist ... not hip-huggers . I 'll buy more of these ! Not a deal-breaker by any means but I would prefer them to not have the size label outside ... it seems Levi 's always does this .
 Amazon did not mentioned in the description that this pair of jeans is a Shrink-to-Fit fabric . No question on the quality . . it 's still an amazing jeans , the great Levi 's jeans , never goes out of style ... Take 31 '' waistline x 30 '' inseam if your size is 30 x 30 .
 Jeans are a little tight in the thighs for my husband . It did n't come with packing slip so I 'm hoping I can return them !
 Good quality but I wish I had done more research on the colors . Ordered rigid because of the look online however the denim itself is rigid .
 Yes , these Levi 's are everything I had hoped they would be and More . Perfect fit , and I 'm very pleased tofinally have a BLACK pair ! Amazon 's got another winner !
 My wife thinks it 's funny that I rate my jeans with numbers , but , as a former 505 's man , I now prefer the 517 's 'cause ride my horses more and were my boots more ... plus , they just , plain feel good when they 're on me ...
 Who does n't love Levis ? These are great ! My son was happy on Christmas day and so were we . Happy Holidays !
 It is great to find the exact size , color , and fit you want in a Levi 's jean , and also get it on time .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean , Medium Stonewash , 38x29They fit perfectly . Will probably order more in a couple months .
 Needed a size that few brick & mortar stores keep in stock . Amazon had style I wanted in the size that I wanted at a good price !
 These blue jeans where a great color and a perfect fit . Glad I ordered them . They were a present for my son
 Excellent transaction on hard to find size and style Levi Jeans.Reasonable price and quick shipping.I 'm very pleased with this purchase !
 jeans were shipped quick , arrived in good shape the medium stonewash has that worn look most people want , I am pleased with the purchase .
 It 's very good ! 100 % cottonThe higher rise sits comfortably at the waist.A fit you want from a brand you trustFit width & length ; !
 non common size request was delivered promply before Christmas . My son was very happy with the fit and color .
 Great product ... my dad was very pleased . He had not been able to find the 517 .
 These were a birthday gift for my son and I had them sent directly to him at college . He loved them and they fit great ! Good quality for the price . He liked the fit of the boot cut .
 These are great jeans for us gals , too , especially if you like to wear a true black color . I dress them up with a feminine camisole and heels , and have got many compliments on them .
 Exactly what my hubby wants . It 's difficult to find his size in our local stores . Very happy Amazon now has Levi 's in his size .
 I love my new bootcuts . I received them quickly , They fit perfectly . Thank you .
 My husband 's body type includes slight pot belly and skinny hips and thighs . Almost impossible to find pants that fit well without being either too tight in the belly or looking baggy in the seat and thighs . He used to wear Levi 's Action Jeans which were boot cut jeans with slight stretch in fabric and a slight crease in the legs . These jeans always looked and fit great ; real snappy . Unfortunately they 're no longer available . Then went to wearing David Taylor Flexjeans from Sears which were almost as good . However , he now find that although Sears still sells jeans by this name , they are no longer the same . They are now made in China and are made from a crappy fabric and no longer fit the same . In desperation , he started looking thru available Levis products and found Levi 's 517 . Advertised as slim in seat and thighs . He did not expect much but was pleasantly surprised to find that they are indeed somewhat slim in the seat and thighs , even though the pants he bought had a waist size slightly larger than minimally necessary , thankfully allowing him to breathe . Bottom line was that he was very happy that these pants are not so tight in the waist that its hard to breathe , but still slim enough in the seat and thighs that they do n't look like old man 's jeans . Just wish they had the snappy look of the old Levi 's Action Jeans .
 I bought a pair of these in 29X34 and they are great . Fit perfect , really like the cut , lighter weight material but not too light , should hold up well . Just wish they would reduce the size of the internal tag -- I 've actually had to tuck it back into the pants a few times after putting them on !
 Finally figured out what cut and size I like , but the only place I can find them is the internet . Great pants .
 These were ordered off Amazon when I could not find them locally . I found the pants and they are describer perfectly and fit exactly as I had wanted them to . I will buy more in the future because they were perfect .
 Completamente satisfecha con el producto , exactamente igual a lo que ofrecieron . LLego en el tiempo estimado que prometieron . Ninguna queja , volveria a comprar de nuevo .
 The Levi jeans were just like I expected . The fit was perfect and received them in just a few days . Thanks !!
 The quality of the denim is lighter , so the good fit disappears by the end of the day . Otherwise , I like 'em !
 Hubby dearest was so happy to find boot cut Levi jeans at Amazon as it seems most stores have quit carrying this style of jean . He likes to wear boot cut jeans and Levi jeans are his favorite brand.No complaints about the fit or wearability either . Ordered two more pairs of jeans today as he 's a happy camper.Recommend .
 Good deal on the jeans and speedy shipping . My first pair of boot cut jeans . My girl friend really likes them on me . I got the dark blue -LRB- rinse -RRB- . Fit good and comfortable .
 I 've grown frustrated by the lack of good quality/reasonably priced jeans in the market today . At some point , the Levis brand started to suffer in terms of quality/value for the dollar . Do n't remember exactly when that happened , but I started to buy my jeans from Banana Republic . Over time , they stopped making the style I grew to rely on . This created a 7-10 stretch where I could n't seem to find a good pair of jeans . Most recently , I purchased a pair of Lucky jeans - ridiculously over priced . When those began to fail , I tried Levis again and bought these . For a third of the price of Lucky Jeans , these Levis boot-cut jeans are really nice . They have a really substantial feel/weight to them and I could n't be happier with the purchase . I was so pleased , I ended up buying a second pair .
 Levis 517 Boot Cut Jeans are just as advertized . Good fit and a perfect boot cut . I highly recommend them for anyone who needs boot cut jeans .
 It 's a very good pant for my husband . Nothing too special or fancy ; he is very satisfied because he got what he expected
 execelente producto muy buena calidad , el pantalon vino en un excelente empaque y llego super rapido deverdad no tengo quejas lo recomiendo
 He looks hot in them , thanks ! What more can I say ? They did n't stay on for very long ... ca n't share any more details .
 I was somewhat hesitant to order Levi 's online but I could n't be happier with this order ! The jeans are exactly as described and fit perfectly . They are genuine Levi 's and are of the highest quality - not seconds . I ca n't recommend this seller highly enough .
 My skinny son is 54 years old and will not wear any other jeans - only 517 , boot cut Levi 's so I know what to buy for Christmas and Birthdays . I found a perfect fit for my skinny husband also .
 I ordered these jeansLevi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jeanfor a Christmas gift a short time before Christmas . I knew the size . I was somewhat concerned that I would not get them on time for Christmas The package came just before Christmas , and the jeans were exactly as pictured , nicely packaged -LRB- each pair separately enclosed in plastic bag -RRB- , the right size and color . I was very pleased , as was the recipient of the gift !
 The jeans were a Christmas gift and a style regularly worn by the recipient . They were a perfect fit . They are hard to find locally so we ordered from the Internet . The red tag on the back pocket did not say `` Levis '' and I have never seen this before . Is it significant ?
 Wow . These are great blue jeans , and they come in 38 long which is what he wears . HE wanted the boot cut , and a 34 waist was large enough . Usually he wears a 36 , , but I ordered 34 and they fit just right . Great looking , great price .
 I bought two pairs in two orders - both were perfect - exactly as I expected . On time . Good buy at a decent price .
 These jeans are tough but good looking and fit well . Amazon 's price is great , they are a good value for the money , and we always get prompt delivery and easy return if size is not right .
 the product is excellente , but needs to be taggedcorrectly , I order 34x30 tag say so , but real size was36x32 try buying them from differet source , and same thing never can get athe right size until i took a mesuring tape to the store and mesure before buing them !!
 I love those Jeans . . nice shape and denim . I ordered different colors from this pant and I love them all . it is comfortable , and have a nice leg openning that falls around the boot .
 I have been wearing 517 's for as long as I can remember . They fit perfectly and have remained unchanged for years .
 Great black on black bootcut jeans . They have even gone back to adding two additional belt loops a feature that went away several years ago .
 Fits well , my husband loves them , quality control met , consistent sizing , and look good on . Will order more as needed
 My son wears a 36 Waist x 36 lenght which is very hard to find . The Levi 's Men 's 517 are about the only jeans he likes and these fit him perfectly . They were shipped very quickly and the price was excellent . They were a birthday gift and he loves them .
 The jeans were pre washed and fit just like I wanted . They were really softer than I expected . I would buy this product again .
 I was so happy with the quality and fit ; I ordered 3 more pairs ! I will be good on jeans for awhile . The price was good too .
 Great quality and a lower price , for me is like a tailored jean , I 'm happy with this product . No more to say thanks to all
 After numerous failed attempts at the 527 's on amazon I finally got a clue and got these jeans . They are PERFECT ... great fit ... weight ... etc. ... just like the jeans I wore in high school 20 years ago ... . I 'm already thinking about a second pair . The light rancher is the perfect color ... . As for the 527 's MADE IN BANGLADESH ... amazing they could ever bear the levis name ... perhaps they were counterfeit . Thanks amazon for my true and needed exchange . The original pair of jeans I ordered ... yes the 527 ... was complete trash . These 517 's are real jeans for real cowboys ... and I 'm not one ... but I do wear a ton of boots ...
 Exellent product
 36 &#34; inseam jeans at a reasonable price are hard to find . I really like the fit of these jeans just wish there were other kinds in the same length .
 Just what I expected . After soaking and drying , the fit and feel was as anticipated ... just like the good , old days !!! -LRB- I would estimate that length and waist both shrunk by about one inch ... as Mama warned , some 50 years ago -RRB-
 i got two pairs for my husband . levis are the only thing that fit him right . They make him look like he has a butt !
 I like this product because it fits very well and is comfortable . I recommend it to others . Good for those who like to wear boots .
 Finally found levis that were the correct size , if they are still available I will order more in the future
 Great pants . I wish there was a size 33 by 35 . I always have a hard time with pants size . I can get a length 34 , which shrink after a wash or a 36 that drags because there too long . But there is no length 35 in pants , so I do n't have much of choice .
 Excellent product the product I come very well and it is what was waiting of , I come in time , good
 I bought they for my boyfriend who had lost a bit of weight and all his pants were falling down , but these fit and stay up -LRB- Thank God -RRB-
 My husband loves the fit and the price.Great deal.You can dress them up or down!Look no further.Great looking jean , for the price .
 Levi 's are always the best jeans around . Levi 's Boot Cut are the only kind my husband will wear . Always a good fit .
 Very high quality . Several pairs have consistent fit . Have bought and worn these 517 boot cut jeans for several years .
 My husband LOVES these jeans . They are a GREAT FIT , especially in the seat . The legs are n't too wide in the thighs and the bootcut bottom make a terrific silhouette . I like how he looks in them and he says they are REALLY COMFORTABLE . They look best in the darker color and are a good pair of `` dress jeans '' as well as versatile . We are ordering more . Ladies , get him these jeans !
 I 've worn Levi 's for over 50 years . From the days when you had to roll up the cuffs because they only had one length to super bells in the 70 's and now my favorite 517 's . They are always true to size and the workmanship is always excellent . The service at Amazon is always great too . What more can I say , I am one satisfied customer .
 These boot cut Levis have always been my favorite jeans . I had not had any in a while , so when my order arrived I immediately tried them on . I forgot how well they fit , and they are really stylish . Awesome . Will be ordering more .
 Authentic , just as described . Fast delivery . I am very satisfied with purchase . Smooth , one stop purchase . Husband will be very happy on Christmas day ! Thank you .
 My husband has been wearing Levi 's since he was a teenager . They are the most durable jeans and he loves the boot cut .
 I 've been wearing these for years.They do tend to fade easily so wash them inside out and use a detergent product for black fabrics .
 I bought these as a gift for a friend who has worn this style for years . Good quality , good fit , good style .
 Great jeans.Classical style.Low price.Wearing only jeans , levis always loved.Happy New Year!Amazon Forever!I love it .
 This hard to find style arrived on time . These classic jeans fit just the way they should . Going back for more colors .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Slim Fit Jean is leg looks like so long , . . but lap so tight but leg looks like so long . .
 My husband like it . . although I have to cut the length a little bit . . He said he may buy more in the future . . Hopefully they have shorter length then .
 They are Levis what more needs to be said ? Theyre the only jeans im buying from now on . They fit great and last 2-5 times longer than any other jeans ive bought .
 I use to wear the Levis low boot cut , but they discontinue to sell the color I want . After I give this one a try , I like it so much .
 My husband bought one of these shirts last year to try it out . I was very skeptical of the `` no ironing '' claim . I could n't believe my eyes when I took it out of the dryer the first time -- not a wrinkle to be seen . The material is truly miraculous . We both love this product and plan to buy more . Thank you , Jos. Banks !
 I own three of these shirts and they are great . I get my shirts cleaned and pressed and here is an example of what great shirts they are
 I own two of these Traveler non-wrinkle shirts and they are absolutely the best shirts I have ever owned . They are of high quality material and the size I bought was right on the money . The colors offered are very versatile with just about anything a person would own and can be worn formally or casually . I am going to stick with buying more of these shirts .
 I bought 2 to begin with and now own seven and I ca n't see myself buying other dress shirts
 I received this shirt as a gift over Christmas . Since then I have bought two more . The fit is outstanding and I have never felt a finer material in a dress shirt - it is soft yet sturdy and always appears pressed . The iron free is for real . I hate ironing and will pay the extra 20 dollars per shirt to never have to dry clean or iron again . I will never buy another shirt and I almost want to throw away my non-iron free dress shirts . I highly recommend this shirt . You will enjoy it and probably buy more of them .
 These dress shirts are the best ! Wrinkle-Free , Breathable , Durable Material , Plus lots of styles , sizes and color options . Compare side-by-side to other dress shirts and you 'll see and feel the difference .
 This is a great fit for a silk shirt . I thought it would not be a close fit being silk , but I was wrong . This item fits snug and looks great on . Both alone and layered . I would recommend this shirt to people that like the look of a tight tank .
 I love my Silk Tank Tops . I wear them to work under my dress shirts and the feel is very nice . Much more comfie than the Hanes cotton tanks . The quality is very good for the price . The initial fit was just a tad snug , but stretched out just a bit after a couple of washes/wears and is very comfortable now . I tried wearing one on a hike but i find the coolmax type active wear handles sweating much better than silk . But for casual wear , or sleeping at night I love them .
 I never tried or even heard of silk tank tops , but now I will never go back . It 's a great under shirt/workout shirt . I like the way it feels like im wearing nothing at all .
 I bought this top for my 18 year old son -- thought it looked comfortable to wear under shirts etc. . It is . He likes wearing it , but he says he would never wear it alone . It is a wee bit too ` feminine ' to wear on top . Would I buy another one ? I do n't know . I think for him , the basic cotton tank tops are more versatile .

 this is a nice shirt of good quality and the size seems true . The dogs were kinda colerful , but its fine .
 Shape , fit , numerous pockets and overall size made this bag efficient and comfortable . Colors on the bag
 i am not an adventurer , i am not a student , i am a stagehand and i believe that this is the perfect bag for the audio/lighting tech . i am able to hold all of my essential tech tools -LRB- crescent wrench , led light , multi-tool , headset , board tape , bag of various connectors and barrels -RRB- as well as a few testers -LRB- q-box , nl4/nl8 tester , voltpen , 12-3 tester -RRB- . my phone fits nicely in the strap pouch and i keep various sharpie 's , pen 's , gum , and my key 's in the mesh pouch . this bag is awesome !!! it 's not too big or small and it looks good . this bag is a/v chic at its ' finest !!!!!!
 I really like this bag it fits well and has enough pockets for all of my stuff that I carry to the office every day . My only real criticism is that I wish it had enough room in the main pocket to carry my laptop . It is just not big enough for that .
 Disclaimer
 As a news videographer , I need something that I can stuff my microphones , cables and other things into so I can grab it and go . I 've found that this bag fills the bill nicely . It 's got enough compartments that are easy to get to . It also is made off a tough material that looks like it will last . -LRB- Unlike some bags that seem to be designed to last for a school year -RRB- My only complaint is that it is a little bit smaller than I would like . -LRB- I carry a LOT of stuff -RRB- But it is more than worth the price .
 This backpack is so small but spacious and comfortable . I do everything with this backpack , I bike , I climb I camp but if you happen to go to a scool like mine that makes you carry ALOT of books its not going to work out so well . Its mostly -LRB- like it says -RRB- a adventurers day pack so you can do mostly anything -LRB- other than school -RRB- with this backpack dealing with outdoor rec .
 Nice price , shipping was fast . I have had this for about a year ?? Still in great shape . Good quality , color , and comfort . Just a tad small , and cell phone pocket is too small for most of today 's smart-phones .
 I bought this pack so I can look like the guy from Infamous , but this pack indeed is grey and not dark green like it looks in the picture . It is a very useful bag , however , and due to the way they put the zippers and pockets , you can sling the bag around to your chest and load/unload it with anything falling out . The strap seems secure , but I would n't overload this pack with weight . The cell phone pocket on the strap is not very big and wont hold most smart phones.In total , the bag holds my ipad , a book or two , and some small extra stuff . Its made to pack light and I like that because my regular backpack ends up getting heavy from being stuffed with junk.My only complaint is that the bag almost makes you look gay , but that may be a positive to some . I after trying it out though I do feel comfortable going out in pubic with it and I plan on using it everyday .
 I use it for my college ... i can carry few thin or one think book with one or two note books . I do n't have to carry loads of books everyday anyway . . sometime I use it for carrying laptop although I have a bag for laptop . .
 We bought this bag as a day pack for our 18 trip around Europe . We used it every single day , stuffed it to the max , threw it all over the place , hotels , trains , planes and automobiles -LRB- ha -RRB- . And it held up unbelievably well ! It 's comfortable to wear and it held a ton of stuff . Plus there are some `` hidden '' pockets to give you even more space ! I do n't know if those pockets are supposed to be `` hidden '' but we did n't see them until we 'd been using the pack for a few days . So it was like a little bonus ! LOL A great little pack . Worth the money , really sturdy .
 good quality cotton , the shirt arrived quickly and looked exactly like the photo . it would be nice if v-necks were offered too ... . but no complaints here , we are happy with our purchase .
 This product came quickly and was in great shape.The beanie was a Christmas gift for my daughterand she loves it . Thanks .
 I am very happy with my purchase of this beanie , it is very well made and fits great.This is a true visor beanie.You can pull it all the way down over your ears or like I wear mine about half way over my ears and leaves a good bit of room to stuff my hair under it.I wish I could find this beanie in different colors.I could not believe how cheap the price was.Excellant hat .
 This is an awesome hat . I love it ! I get alot of compliments on it too . The service was awesome and very fast .
 I bought two of these ten years ago , and they are the best . Still good after all these years . And I disagree that they are too roomy -- they have fit me perfectly .

 Excellent product the product I come very well and it is what was waiting of , I come in time , good
 I bought they for my boyfriend who had lost a bit of weight and all his pants were falling down , but these fit and stay up -LRB- Thank God -RRB-
 My husband loves the fit and the price.Great deal.You can dress them up or down!Look no further.Great looking jean , for the price .
 Bought these jeans for my husband . They fit very well and look nice . The shipment arrived on time . I was happy with my purchase .
 I ordered these jeans an exrta size longer becaause I wanted a high cuff . Got exactally that . Perfect !!! Now I 'm looking for a white pair
 Well , they 're Levi 's . There you go . Best jeans on the market . Last forever and fit great . The black does fade to gray quicker than I would like , but that 's probably because I wear only black , all the time . So ...
 Great black on black bootcut jeans . They have even gone back to adding two additional belt loops a feature that went away several years ago .
 Fits well , my husband loves them , quality control met , consistent sizing , and look good on . Will order more as needed
 My son wears a 36 Waist x 36 lenght which is very hard to find . The Levi 's Men 's 517 are about the only jeans he likes and these fit him perfectly . They were shipped very quickly and the price was excellent . They were a birthday gift and he loves them .
 The jeans were pre washed and fit just like I wanted . They were really softer than I expected . I would buy this product again .
 I was so happy with the quality and fit ; I ordered 3 more pairs ! I will be good on jeans for awhile . The price was good too .
 Great quality and a lower price , for me is like a tailored jean , I 'm happy with this product . No more to say thanks to all
 After numerous failed attempts at the 527 's on amazon I finally got a clue and got these jeans . They are PERFECT ... great fit ... weight ... etc. ... just like the jeans I wore in high school 20 years ago ... . I 'm already thinking about a second pair . The light rancher is the perfect color ... . As for the 527 's MADE IN BANGLADESH ... amazing they could ever bear the levis name ... perhaps they were counterfeit . Thanks amazon for my true and needed exchange . The original pair of jeans I ordered ... yes the 527 ... was complete trash . These 517 's are real jeans for real cowboys ... and I 'm not one ... but I do wear a ton of boots ...
 Exellent product
 The jeans were great ! The price was right , they were delivered in a timely fashion , and I lost a few lbs to get in them and I look good . lol . I recommend this company .
 These are the only jeans my son likes . He is tall and I have trouble finding his size in local stores and I could not find a better price .
 The jean came very quickly . They were the proper color , size , and cut . The packaging was excellent , and so was the quality of the jeans .
 Perfect price and fit for my husband . I would recommend this jean to any &#34; baby boomer &#34; who loves boot cut jeans.The jean has not changed at all good quality material and the right color . Thank you .
 This pair of Levi 's fits perfectly and the indigo color is the same as the Levi 's I wore back in the day !
 I gave these Jeans to my daughter 's friend for Christmas and he really likes them.He is real thin and wears motorcycle boots.He likes how they fit and loves the boot cut.He especially likes the rugged material .
 My order arrived in a timely fashion , they fit good and look great ... I 'm gon na get a couple more pairs .
 Levi 's 517 ` sThese Levi 's were the perfect fit . I like the fact that they are pre rinsed , which makes the fabric softer .
 Many of us do n't want to wear our Levi 's half way up our bellies . 517s are the best answer for that !
 A well tried and true blue jean that I 've been wearing for decades . The fit , finish , and quality is a good as or better than ever .
 product arrived as expected on time , the product was as expected and the quality was as you 'd expect to find in a brick & mortar store .
 Great fitting . I usually buy the 527 style but they did n't have black in that style . Ordered a 517 instead and love the fitting .
 The fit and look are great and I saved a few dollars . Will purchase more when the price is right
 love this jeans , the fabric is really good and the cut is impecable . it is original and the communication was really easy , i recieved really fast .
 I 've always wanted a ` black 527 ' but found out I could only get that in rigid black.I decided to try 517 n whao I might just decide to continue with 517 even with other colors.Just the perfect fit I love .
 Is exactly what i was looking for . . i being using this model for years , and this pair of pant are excellent
 I am a creature of habit . Being of slim build I have found the 517 Boot cut to be the perfect jean for me . I also know my size so the fit was great as received . This is not always the case when ordering over the Internet . Service was great delivered on time as expected .
 These are the best jeans Levis has to offer in my opinion . They are not light and flimsy like some jeans Levis are making these days . The medium stonewash is a great even color . They do n't look faded on the seat and thighs or dingly and dirty like so many jeans do . These jeans are rugged , comfortable and last a long , long time . On top of that they look great . These are the only jeans I will buy .
 Perfect fit right out of the box . Started wearing immediately , stitches , pockets , zipper perfectly in place . Survived several washes good as new .
 Good price , perfect quality . Very good model for young and old-aged people . Gorgeous color . Classic zipper . I 'm satisfied ! I recommend to buy it .
 These jeans fit me very well and look good . One thing I noticed however is that the denim has a more coarse feeling compared to other Levi 's jeans . I would buy these again .
 IL TELL YOU I HAVE BEEN WEARING LEVI 'S FOR YEARS ON END AND THE BEST DEAL I GOT ON THESE GREAT JEANS WAS FROM MY FAVORITE STORE AMAZON
 I love these jeans . For me they are perfect . Long enough to wear with or without boots and the fit is not too tight . How can you go wrong with Levi 's ?
 I got what I ordered promptly . I wish I had ordered a different color but -- my bad . No complaints . What else can I say ?
 The jeans was just perfect , the material , size and colour , nothing to complain about , and great timing too.They fit really well , and amazon 's size chart was very helpfull .
 These are like they used to make them ! More belt loops , great fabric - love them ! Ca n't wait to order more of these !
 I was having a really hard time finding the boot cut Levis - no one seems to carry them anymore . These are just what I wanted . They look and fit good .
 Bought these for my husband and they fit true to size , maybe a little bit long but not so much that he wo n't wear them . He love them , they look good so I love them ! Great Pants !
 I ordered these jeans for my 16yo son & he really liked them . The only thing he would have preferred was a lower rise , but he 's wearing them without complaints . : -RRB-
 I bought 2 of these and man they are nice . I 'll admit the guy wearing the jean in the picture sold me . Like I went and look for all the style of Levi 's , and these attracted me the most . Although I would n't tuck in my shirt like that . But they sure look good with some chucks and or casual boots and a dress shirt , with a silver wrist watch , and a pair of shades . They are heavy , and for me kinda tight even though jean of a different brand and style with the same size , fit me perfectly . I do n't know I guess it the way they are made . But for the look , I 'll take the pain any day , yes these jean are so tight mostly in my thigh area and waist , that I do get a little discomfort pain in my lower back . I guess it the way they are design and the heaviness of the jean . Of course I am in the process of getting in shape again . So with time , these will be perfect . I do like to sag a little , but as of right now I ca n't with these . Until I lose some of that belly fat I accumulated over the years .
 These are the jeans I always buy , they are a great comfortable fit . It is also great that Amazon stocks the size I need , it 's impossible to get from the shops .
 My body was made for Levi 's brand jeans , and I 'd worn through a couple of pairs . I bought duplicate black 517s - soft but not washed out , dark , with a predictable fit . They are my new favorites . The process went smoothly . Who knew I 'd be buying clothes online ?
 I ordered these for Christmas for my 6 ' 2 '' grandson who had grown out of all his pants after checking stores and finding his size is almost impossible to find . They were perfect and he loved them .
 The Levi 's 517 Boot Cut were purchused as a replacement of the wrong ones bought at a local store , These ordered & delivered ; I was told fit greatly before & after ; washThe price for my buying , totaled out a nuff less even with shipping to come fromamazon , rather than a store , even on sale after my tax & shipping ; -LRB- as a late gift -RRB- Theonly guestion I got was about , they did not have the Levi 's cardboard shelf tagswe see on Jean 's in store .
 I love my levis . I was unaware they came in black . I bought a blue pair and black pair , Ilove them
 Just as described ! Fit & look exactly what he needed and wanted . And he said I could n't find this product ... LOLThanks !!! The Wife wrote the review ...
 These jeans fit great . The boot cut gives a good look without being sloppy . My husband looks hot in them .
 Got these as a gift for my brother , and they are the true blue classic with a great slim shape . Perfect `` date night '' jeans .
 These are the only jeans my husband will wear and we could not find them ANYWHERE . When i found them here i was happily suprised with the discount price and they look great . Would buy again from this seller .
 Excellent transaction on hard to find size and style Levi Jeans.Reasonable price and quick shipping.I 'm very pleased with this purchase !
 jeans were shipped quick , arrived in good shape the medium stonewash has that worn look most people want , I am pleased with the purchase .
 It 's very good ! 100 % cottonThe higher rise sits comfortably at the waist.A fit you want from a brand you trustFit width & length ; !
 non common size request was delivered promply before Christmas . My son was very happy with the fit and color .
 Great product ... my dad was very pleased . He had not been able to find the 517 .
 These were a birthday gift for my son and I had them sent directly to him at college . He loved them and they fit great ! Good quality for the price . He liked the fit of the boot cut .
 These were a secret gift for my brother-in-law . He keeps complaining that he must do laundry every other day because he only has one pair of work pants , but then he just will not go get more or let anyone buy him any ! So , I got the size off of the one pair of jeans he owns -LRB- laundry is at my house -RRB- and I bought several other pairs that were similarly worn . I sneak in a new pair about once a week and so far he has n't noticed that he now has three pair of work pants . When I slip in the new ones , I put them in the dirty clothes hamper he uses . I wonder if he knows his pants are multiplying yet ?
 They arived bfore time , APO adress , in Afghanistan ,1 week took it to arive here , im suprised , and they fit good , i dont hawe no words
 36 &#34; inseam jeans at a reasonable price are hard to find . I really like the fit of these jeans just wish there were other kinds in the same length .
 Just what I expected . After soaking and drying , the fit and feel was as anticipated ... just like the good , old days !!! -LRB- I would estimate that length and waist both shrunk by about one inch ... as Mama warned , some 50 years ago -RRB-
 i got two pairs for my husband . levis are the only thing that fit him right . They make him look like he has a butt !
 I like this product because it fits very well and is comfortable . I recommend it to others . Good for those who like to wear boots .
 Finally found levis that were the correct size , if they are still available I will order more in the future
 Great pants . I wish there was a size 33 by 35 . I always have a hard time with pants size . I can get a length 34 , which shrink after a wash or a 36 that drags because there too long . But there is no length 35 in pants , so I do n't have much of choice .
 I am happy with the jeans and how they fit , but usually when I get 517 's , they are really stiff and then I get to break them in . This pair was already like pre-washed , just differnt than what I am used to , but I still like them and will wear them . Maybe I have to look into differnt types and find exactly what I am looking for next time . Thank you
 I 've been wearing 517 's for a good , long time now , and I love 'em ! The problem is that most of my local stores that sell them -- and very few of them do -- price them highly and also drastically limit the selection compared to the more popular 501 's and 550 's . Additionally , these jeans are often skipped over when it comes to the big sales . Well , shopping for them on Amazon is a decision I should have made long ago . The price here is hard to beat.As for the jeans themselves , they are of the rugged quality that Levi 's is known for . They fit like the product photo shows
 Have had these jeans for a few weeks now & am very satisfied.The flair from the knee down is discrete and does not look like the 70 's bell-bottoms . The fit on top was precisely as marked . The length seems about 1/2 inch longer than sized on the 501 's . Was formerly utilizing 501 slim fit jeans but found that could not place them over motorcyle boots . The 501s were great for rainy rides , but look too much like a cowboy , when tucked into the boots .
 As always , good shopping at amazon.com . Its always a problem finding the right length jeans for me . I found that in this levi 517 Boot cut jean , it feels good to finally find a jean that is not too short . A fact that i would have loved to know before i bought this jeans , is the leg opening size . This jean is very tight around the thigh area . I would just like a bit more details on the product a next time round . Other than that , it always a good shopping experience on Amazon .
 The length and waist were perfect . The quality of Levi jeans was the same as they had always been , good
 I always had to keep pulling up my previous pairs of Levi 's -LRB- any model -RRB- because they only had FIVE belt loops . A key ring and cell phone are not that heavy . I remember growing up with Levi 's having SEVEN belt loops and a heavier canvas . I was pleasantly surprised to see the ` new ' Levi 's 517 now have seven belt loops again . I started to buy a different model , but they still only have the five loops.I just bought a couple of these pairs from Amazon . I did check online at Kohls and their current batch of 517 's still show 5 loops . I will have to wait until I go to the store to see if their stock has been updated . Kohls prices are higher than Amazon , but I will recheck when they go on sale . I still check Amazon first for almost all my purchases.Overall , I like my new Levi 's jeans . I will compare them with older ones to see if the canvas really is slightly thinner . Outsourcing manufacturing almost always results in poorer quality and non-standard sizing . It has 100 % results in putting Americans out of work . I try to buy American whenever I can -- hopefully it will catch on.There is another issue appearing after I washed my new jeans with my old ones . It should n't have made a difference , but the new ones are now covered with fine fluffy hairs . I will have to use a lint brush when I take them out of the dryer for now . Although it may just be a ` break in -- first washings ' issue.Overall , I rate these jeans 4 stars . I will have to wait for a few machine washings to see how the color holds up . I may be old fashioned , but buying jeans looking like they are 1/2 wore out or have holes in them is ` less than optimal ' .
 I ran around town to find my husband Levi 517 's in size 35x32 for Christmas . In the stores , there were stacks of all different sorts of Levi 's to go through . Finally I came home and ordered them through Amazon and received exactly what he wanted . These Levi 's fit perfectly and look great . Very happy they come in off size waists . Thank you for making my job easier and receiving nice fitting jeans .
 I 've grown up wearing Levi 's and in particular 517 's in my adult life . I do like that Levi has added additional belt loops in the past year or so . Over the years Levi has cut some corners in manufacturing , but not enough to discourage me from continuing to buy their stonewashed 517 's . I like the stonewashed jeans since they are ready to wear , unlike the rigid indigo Levi 's that have to be washed several times to soften them up.I am buying more and more items from Amazon for the free shipping and competitive prices . It just saves a lot of time going to a retailer only to find out they do n't have my size or what I want . Even with Amazon collecting California sales tax , I figure the time and gas saved from having to go to a retailer is well worth it .
 Style & size stayed true since the last time I bought a pair , after gettingLevi 's Men 's 527 Low Rise Boot Cut Jeanthat are nothing like they used to be that 's all a shopper can ask .
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut . Black 42 waist / 30 length . If you are short , stocky and have a big butt . These pants are perfect . They wo n't bunch up at your fat knees and they will last a long time before the zipper explodes . I suggest you buy the next size up because they will shrink after 6 months of washing , drying and severe stretching in the seat area . Great pants .
 MY FAVORITE JEANS FOR 25 YEARS . I HAVE WORN MAINLY 501 MODEL , SO I READ MANY REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING THESE 517 JEANS.AFTER THINKING FOR A LONG TIME I DECIDED TO BUY ONE SIZE BIGGER THAN USUAL . IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE.THEY ARE JUST FINE , BLACK COLOR AND ZIPPER FLY WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DETAIL FOR ME !
 My husband 's body type includes slight pot belly and skinny hips and thighs . Almost impossible to find pants that fit well without being either too tight in the belly or looking baggy in the seat and thighs . He used to wear Levi 's Action Jeans which were boot cut jeans with slight stretch in fabric and a slight crease in the legs . These jeans always looked and fit great ; real snappy . Unfortunately they 're no longer available . Then went to wearing David Taylor Flexjeans from Sears which were almost as good . However , he now find that although Sears still sells jeans by this name , they are no longer the same . They are now made in China and are made from a crappy fabric and no longer fit the same . In desperation , he started looking thru available Levis products and found Levi 's 517 . Advertised as slim in seat and thighs . He did not expect much but was pleasantly surprised to find that they are indeed somewhat slim in the seat and thighs , even though the pants he bought had a waist size slightly larger than minimally necessary , thankfully allowing him to breathe . Bottom line was that he was very happy that these pants are not so tight in the waist that its hard to breathe , but still slim enough in the seat and thighs that they do n't look like old man 's jeans . Just wish they had the snappy look of the old Levi 's Action Jeans .
 I bought a pair of these in 29X34 and they are great . Fit perfect , really like the cut , lighter weight material but not too light , should hold up well . Just wish they would reduce the size of the internal tag -- I 've actually had to tuck it back into the pants a few times after putting them on !
 Finally figured out what cut and size I like , but the only place I can find them is the internet . Great pants .
 These were ordered off Amazon when I could not find them locally . I found the pants and they are describer perfectly and fit exactly as I had wanted them to . I will buy more in the future because they were perfect .
 Completamente satisfecha con el producto , exactamente igual a lo que ofrecieron . LLego en el tiempo estimado que prometieron . Ninguna queja , volveria a comprar de nuevo .
 These seemed a bit darker in person than pictured but they were a great pair of jeans for my husband . This is his favorite style of jeans and he needed a new pair of &#34; dressy jeans . &#34; Same great jeans as in the past .
 All the Levi 's I purchased for my 16 year old son were ` made to fit ' ! From the straight to boot cut , they all were a perfect fit for his personal taste . They are well made and very stylish .
 Great jeans , great price , speedy delivery as promised ! Will definitely be ordering them again since my son is so tall and slim and this is one of the only places I can find his size .
 Great basic jeans in hard to find sizes . Not much to say otherwise . They have washed up well and held up well for my long and lanky teen .
 Jeans are a little tight in the thighs for my husband . It did n't come with packing slip so I 'm hoping I can return them !
 Good quality but I wish I had done more research on the colors . Ordered rigid because of the look online however the denim itself is rigid .
 Yes , these Levi 's are everything I had hoped they would be and More . Perfect fit , and I 'm very pleased tofinally have a BLACK pair ! Amazon 's got another winner !
 My wife thinks it 's funny that I rate my jeans with numbers , but , as a former 505 's man , I now prefer the 517 's 'cause ride my horses more and were my boots more ... plus , they just , plain feel good when they 're on me ...
 Who does n't love Levis ? These are great ! My son was happy on Christmas day and so were we . Happy Holidays !
 These jeans are everything they say they are . We will definately order these jeans again when the time comes . Thanks !
 100 % recomended , i have no doubt that i am going to buy another , it is really regular fit and boot cut
 This is the only jean my husband wears . He has the hardest time finding 36x29 . This is a perfect fit for him . When he needs more I will return to amazon .
 I finally found a pear of jeans that my wife said they look good on me and after being washed still fits great
 Great fit for my long legs ! Hard to find jeans my size but Levi 's always comes through for me ! a
 Ordered these for my boyfriend , they run extremely small , he regularly wears a 32/34 had to send back and get a 36/34 . Other than that they 're great jeans .
 Finally a pair of Levi 's not only affordable , but a pair that is the real deal . . not seconds or blemished . . but cut perfectly . . The best I have bought in years . . Thanks . . and `` I 'll be back for more ''
 They fit just perfectly and I am very happy to not only get the bestdeal around but beat the sales tax . Good old Levi 's rigid , bootcut jeans have been my all-time favorite jeans my whole life , andI just turned 60 . Got 'em within a week , free shipping faster thanexpected , so that was cool , too . Amazon rules !
 The pants are great . I can not seem to find them in stores like Kohls or Target where I usually shop . I 'm not skinny as far as a skinny person goes but I have thinner legs than a lot of guys . These seem to be not as loose in the butt and thighs . I usually get the 505 's but they are cut a little bigger assuming tree trunk size legs . I have runners legs and these work . If you have big footballer legs , forget about it .
 the product is excellente , but needs to be taggedcorrectly , I order 34x30 tag say so , but real size was36x32 try buying them from differet source , and same thing never can get athe right size until i took a mesuring tape to the store and mesure before buing them !!
 I love those Jeans . . nice shape and denim . I ordered different colors from this pant and I love them all . it is comfortable , and have a nice leg openning that falls around the boot .
 I have been wearing 517 's for as long as I can remember . They fit perfectly and have remained unchanged for years .
 These boot cut jeans by my favorite jeans maker are exactly what I needed.When I ordered my Harley Davidson boots , I needed pants for when I wear them and these ones are the only ones that fit on the outside where others ca n't . Shopping local yields nothing like these , just junk not worth the money.Quality is what I 've come to expect from Levi 's , outstanding with fit absolutely perfect.More orders coming soon for these.Shipping was prompt , making this buyer very happy.Thank you to everyone for helping this lonely guy that hardly can get out to shop by bringing them to me.Again , THANK YOU VERY MUCH !!
 I thought these were more on the casual side , but after putting them on , they can pull off a nice look . Very comfy , one day to break in . No frays , quality zipper . Dimensions were perfect . Overall color is a shade or two darker than in the picture . Awesome , new favorite pair .
 If you have a problem with jeans bagging in the rear , then these jeans are for you ! They are a great fit and very comfortable ! My husband loves them !
 Well , its a good jean , everybody know the levi 's quality , the item arive in perfect conditions . . so nothing more to say . .
 Perfect fit , every time . 517 's are difficult for me to find locally , but buying on line thru Amazon is best for me .
 He looks hot in them , thanks ! What more can I say ? They did n't stay on for very long ... ca n't share any more details .
 I was somewhat hesitant to order Levi 's online but I could n't be happier with this order ! The jeans are exactly as described and fit perfectly . They are genuine Levi 's and are of the highest quality - not seconds . I ca n't recommend this seller highly enough .
 They 're good sellers and the product is very good , I like so much this jean . Ellos son muy buenos vendedores , el producto llego rapido a mis manos y era el esperado , los recomiendo ampliamente .
 I wear Levi jeans every day . Levi 's are the only jeans I will wear.I have worn Levi jeans for the past twenty -LRB- 20 -RRB- years ... or longer.Levi jeans are great ... in fact , i 'm wearin 'em right now ...
 Sent me what I wanted . 15 more 12 more 11 more 9 more 7 more 5 more 3 more done
 This is a very good price for this product , it 's the second one I 've ordered for my son .
 I like this style and they are getting very hard to find . The price here was the best I found , got in a timely manner . I 'm happy with my purchase .
 Purchased these jeans for my husband . They have a nice fit and look very good on . No baggy butt like the relaxed fit jeans .
 I usually have a hard time finding good bootcut jeans with the right fit in the retail stores . If the color/wash/fabric is right , the size isnt . If the size is right , the fit is too loose at the seat and thighs . Now that my favorite pair of jeans is past its prime , I started looking for a new pair to replace it . After hunting all stores in and around my area and trying all available bootcuts in my size , I was very disappointed . That is , until I found a pair of Levi 's 517 Blue Ox in the local Macy 's store . This was the first bootcut I found in the last 3 years that fit me perfectly . Since I already had a pair of jeans that was of a very similar color , I came online and started looking for the correct color in that fit . Unfortunately , it wasnt that easy finding one online . Kohls , Dillards and others had Levi 's 517s , but they werent the same ones I saw in the store . Apart from Macys and Amazon , no other site -LRB- including Levi 's own site -RRB- had the same fit in Rancher Light color I was looking for . I could have ordered at Macys website , but my past experience with Amazon was stellar and so it my first choice . Even then I was a little skeptical if the photos were close to how the jeans looked in reality . Since amazon had a free returns on this one , I went ahead with the order . The product , as always with Amazon , came 6 days ahead of their estimated delivery date . The jeans is , in fact , very close to the pictures on the website and the fit is PERFECT !! Thanks to Levi 's for the perfect color and fit and KUDOS to amazon for the perfect shopping experience !
 Finally Levi went back to 7 belt loops instead of the five . Makes a big difference for those of us that work for a living .
 I bought the 517 as I prefer this cut to any other one of the Levi 's catalog , I place it even above the so famous 501 . I 'm fully satisfied
 I love these jeans . The wash and fit are great . That being said , they did arrive with a hole in the seat and the seam is a little crooked on the inside left leg . I really do n't care though because they fit so good .
 It is hard to find male , black , slim fit , boot cut jeans . Believe me I searched many places both on-line and local retail outlets . Finally I found these on Amazon and they were just right . Great fit , looks good , and the price was reasonable . I highly recommend them .
 We will take these to alterations but they were about 5 inches too long . Otherwise they are very nice .
 True to size , did n't shrink , and minimal wrinkling . Love the variety of sizing - son is tall and thin , and hard to fit , but Levis 517 made it happen !
 I have worn Levi jenas for the last 16years , i am relatively tall guy and seldom get my size in the store , Amazon provides me my size and then quality as well .
 Purchased two pairs of Levi 's Boot Cut Jeans for my husband , the Jeans are very hard to find in the stores . Since my husband is tall , it is hard to find 36x36 .
 These pants are very well put together and I am a big fan of Levi 's pants durability which is what prompted me to purchase these .
 I am a woman but men 's jeans fit me better . These are very comfortable . My jeans do NOT get hung up on my boots as they do with jeans that are not boot cut .
 todo salio perfecto , tanto el envio como el paquete recibido , estan esplendidas , la hora de llegada fue la establecida por el vendedor
 Quality jeans , but not made in the USA.Arrived quickly and each pair were individually bagged in plastic.Good fit , for me .
 Fit well at the waist and look good . Last a lot longer than most most jeans and seem to get more and more comfortable the more you wear them .
 These are great jeans , they do tend to run a little big , both on length and waist . The color was a lot more bluer then it looks in the picture , so be weary of that it . It was too country , and I needed more rock and roll , if you know what I mean.Pros
 I was a bit concerned about this purchase . My husband likes the boot cut style and that was an excellent choice for my purchase . I have zero compliants other then I wish I 'd bought more !
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Slim Fit Jean is leg looks like so long , . . but lap so tight but leg looks like so long . .
 My husband like it . . although I have to cut the length a little bit . . He said he may buy more in the future . . Hopefully they have shorter length then .
 They are Levis what more needs to be said ? Theyre the only jeans im buying from now on . They fit great and last 2-5 times longer than any other jeans ive bought .
 I use to wear the Levis low boot cut , but they discontinue to sell the color I want . After I give this one a try , I like it so much .
 If you know your size they fit . I do n't understand the reviews that say the sizes are wrong . Will buy again .
 was just what i expected ... very pleased with purchase . I like the fact that you can get 29 inseam . You can not get that in the store . No need to get them hemmed !
 his pants in overall line is still very good , sturdy , feels soft to the touch on the skin , the profile legendary cutting adds a touch of elegance , and even after several washings the fabric remains the same and does not shrink , the only thing I did not like the pants is that they have deteriorated the quality of the clips and metal buttons , formerly of copper and bronze , and now this are of aluminum and does not look good , however I recommend buying them are very good at the price .
 These came a little long , maybe an inch or two . Seeing as many others have noticed this is a problem with this fit , I suggest going one inseam size lower . I ordered a 30 '' and they fit more like a 31-32 '' . Other than the sizing , they are great jeans , and still look great on me . The boot cut allows the extra length to bunch up a little around the shoes , so you do n't really notice it . It actually looks good.I wish they sold these in a low rise version , as I do n't like hiking them up to where you might put dress pants or khakis . They stopped selling the 517 in a low rise though , so I 'm happy to wear them as is , great fit .
 I have always appreciated the fit and quality of Levi jeans . The boot cut has a closer fit around the knee with comfortable room in the hips and waist . What Levi Strauss needs to understand is that there is a huge population of men out there that has a 31 inch inseam . Men between 5 ' 9 &#34; and 6 ' fall into this size range . My growth did not stop at 30 &#34; inseam , and did not make it to 32 &#34; . So I either buy high water jeans that show my socks , or I let the cuffs drag the floor which signicantly reduces the life of the jeans . I liked the fit enough that I spent an additional $ 10 to get them hemmed to 31 .
 I 've worn Levi 's for over 50 years . From the days when you had to roll up the cuffs because they only had one length to super bells in the 70 's and now my favorite 517 's . They are always true to size and the workmanship is always excellent . The service at Amazon is always great too . What more can I say , I am one satisfied customer .
 These boot cut Levis have always been my favorite jeans . I had not had any in a while , so when my order arrived I immediately tried them on . I forgot how well they fit , and they are really stylish . Awesome . Will be ordering more .
 Authentic , just as described . Fast delivery . I am very satisfied with purchase . Smooth , one stop purchase . Husband will be very happy on Christmas day ! Thank you .
 My grandson loves these jeans , since he 's rather tall we were glad to find Levi 's makes great jeans in his size . Strange as it may seem , many brands of jeans do not come in a 34in length .
 As an active equestrian rider , and a woman of 59 years , I 'm ALWAYS looking for comfortable jeans that sit at my waist -- I do n't like women 's jeans at all - the fabric in women 's jeans seems flimsy , and the low-rise , hip-hugging jeans for riding or leisure wear feels uncomfortable . The men 's Levis and men 's Lee jeans are very comfortable , and they can handle my active life -- for me , men 's Levis 517 bootcut jeans have best variety for colors , and toughest quality in fabric .
 Nice one . . Boot Cut with nice fit.Ordered the Jeans with 29L but got it 3inch longer . So I had to do alteration , usually I order my pants with 29L and it fits perfect on me .
 Levis 517 's fit me better than any other jeans that I 've bought . Gon na stick with them . I wear a 38 waist , 36 inseam . Have bought several pair over the past six months from various places and they all fit the same . Good quality control !
 BASTANTE BIEN . BUENA CALIDAD DEL PANTALON . ME QUEDO MUY BIEN . TANTO EL LARGO COMO EN CINTURA . EXCELENTE COMPRA A UDS . GRACIAS .
 The jeans are a good deep color . Wish they were n't quite as thin as jean material seems to be getting , but seems they are all like that now . Overall a good pair of jeans.These are hard to find in 36x36 , so I 'm glad Amazon carries them .
 they were exactly what we were looking for . the orginal 517 , these are my hubby 's most favoritie , they also hold up better than the other styles seem to
 Will have to wash several times for them to fit . I buy this size all the time from other retailers and they are n't this big . Like the color and the style . They just run big I guess . Mainly in the length . Would buy again , just a smaller size .
 The fit is nice , the color is holding up through the wash . I am glad they have different sizes then the stores . Very hard to find 33 x 36 !
 I like the way these jeans fit.The are also comfortable.The ones I have purchased previously have been durable .
 d e m a r a v i l l a e s t e m o d e l o muy bueno
 These are the first jeans in a while that actually fit my waist size , inseam and the leg openings are perfect .
 These jeans fit well but the denim seems less hefty than the denim of the same 517s from 5 years ago .
 I received my pants very quickly . I was concerned that my size would be too short for boots . I was pleasantly surprised that the designer was thoughtful about the shape and length for this item &#34; after &#34; several washings . Pants are about 1/2 inch longer than the average pants which make them perfect for cowboy boots . Pants are also very comfortable . JCD
 Noticed that they even have an extra pair of belt loops compared to my previous order . They are sturdy & dependable .
 i traveled 80 miles one day looking for the jeans i like with no luck , it did make for a nice bike ride though ! then i went online looking and i found what i was looking for at amozon these jeans are hard to get in my hometown!Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut JeansWhat a nice pair of rugged jeans . And I got them so FAST !! Thanks again.Roxann Hill
 Good product , on time and as shown in Amazon.But ... years ago , ordering the same # jean and the same size always brought the exact same fit and look . Lately , the same length , for instance , some times is a bit too long -LRB- can be fixed -RRB- or a bit too short -LRB- bad news -RRB- . The price to be paid for savings by manufacturing offshore . Lets see if with the crisis we return to the memorable `` MADE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ''
 What can I say ? They are Levis . Perfect fit , excellent quality , and the most impressive thing was the price . Unbelievable !
 If you promise not to tell anybody , I wear lined jeans from eddie bauer or llbean when it gets cooler . I wear these when it gets warmer . True to size , do n't shrink too much .
 These jeans come washed so they are soft , supple and ready to wear . They are pre-shrunk so order the size you wear . I choose boot-cut jeans because I wear 12 '' - shaft western boots . Levies are the only jeans I wear because they fit well , look good , and get better with age .
 These jeans are perfect for the guy who wants to wear boots and not look like a geek or a thug . Just the right combination of loose and fitted .
 This is my first pair of Levi 517 's and I have to say I am very impressed . They sit on my natural waist -LRB- not low-rise like the 527 's -RRB- , and are fitted in the seat and thigh , and then flare out below the knee to fall on the boot . I 'm 6 ' 3 '' 190lbs and have a 36 waist and 34 inseam and it fit perfectly . Hard to find jeans these days that sit on the waist ... I 'm not a fan of the low-rise look or feel , so these jeans were a great find .
 Came to Amazon to order these jeans for my husband since no one ever has his size , 36x36 . I was pleasantly surprised because I did order two of these in different colors , Rancher Light and Rinse , both of which were the perfect colors . Perfect light colored jean and perfect dark colored jean . My husband and I are very hard to fit in jeans and tops so when something works we often get multiples , the problem however is that sometimes we buy the exact same thing in a different color and they fit totally different . Not these ! These jeans were great and the same fit ! Some people might not be able to appreciate that as much as I , but I was very grateful . It was a risk I had to take since his size is so common , but with free returns I had to take advantage . The boot leg is also very subtle but incredibly flattering . He does wear boots but of course they are n't necessary . I would say they are very true to size and great quality . They are currently his `` good jeans '' ... . that is until he `` accidentally '' wears them to go work in the garage . But when that happens , because it will , I will be back to purchase more ! By the way he is just over 6 ' 3 '' about 230-240lbs .
 It is great to find the exact size , color , and fit you want in a Levi 's jean , and also get it on time .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean , Medium Stonewash , 38x29They fit perfectly . Will probably order more in a couple months .
 Needed a size that few brick & mortar stores keep in stock . Amazon had style I wanted in the size that I wanted at a good price !
 These blue jeans where a great color and a perfect fit . Glad I ordered them . They were a present for my son
 My husband has been wearing Levi 's since he was a teenager . They are the most durable jeans and he loves the boot cut .
 I 've been wearing these for years.They do tend to fade easily so wash them inside out and use a detergent product for black fabrics .
 I bought these as a gift for a friend who has worn this style for years . Good quality , good fit , good style .
 Great jeans.Classical style.Low price.Wearing only jeans , levis always loved.Happy New Year!Amazon Forever!I love it .
 This hard to find style arrived on time . These classic jeans fit just the way they should . Going back for more colors .
 Finally jeans that fit like the old Levis , these are the old quality heavy denim stuff not that wimpy pre-wash thin as paper junk denim . I would highly recommend these jeans to anyone who 's familiar with real Levis .
 Very easy shopping . I 'm familiar with the pants so it 's just a matter of price and convenience.Sitting at the desk for a few second beats driving to the store , finding out they do n't have the 517 in my size and driving back home . I 've always had trouble just finding the 517 at stores and shopping online sure makes things easier . The pants themselves are everything they 've always been , good fitting and tough.It 's nice to add the stonewash to my collection of darker denim so I do n't look the same every day.I was upprised how fast they came and that 's a big plus too .
 These jeans fit to size perfectly -LRB- for me -RRB- , are comfortable to wear , and have adequate material to reach a guy 's waist ... not hip-huggers . I 'll buy more of these ! Not a deal-breaker by any means but I would prefer them to not have the size label outside ... it seems Levi 's always does this .
 Amazon did not mentioned in the description that this pair of jeans is a Shrink-to-Fit fabric . No question on the quality . . it 's still an amazing jeans , the great Levi 's jeans , never goes out of style ... Take 31 '' waistline x 30 '' inseam if your size is 30 x 30 .
 Levi 's are always the best jeans around . Levi 's Boot Cut are the only kind my husband will wear . Always a good fit .
 Very high quality . Several pairs have consistent fit . Have bought and worn these 517 boot cut jeans for several years .
 My husband LOVES these jeans . They are a GREAT FIT , especially in the seat . The legs are n't too wide in the thighs and the bootcut bottom make a terrific silhouette . I like how he looks in them and he says they are REALLY COMFORTABLE . They look best in the darker color and are a good pair of `` dress jeans '' as well as versatile . We are ordering more . Ladies , get him these jeans !
 The Levi jeans were just like I expected . The fit was perfect and received them in just a few days . Thanks !!
 The quality of the denim is lighter , so the good fit disappears by the end of the day . Otherwise , I like 'em !
 Hubby dearest was so happy to find boot cut Levi jeans at Amazon as it seems most stores have quit carrying this style of jean . He likes to wear boot cut jeans and Levi jeans are his favorite brand.No complaints about the fit or wearability either . Ordered two more pairs of jeans today as he 's a happy camper.Recommend .
 Good deal on the jeans and speedy shipping . My first pair of boot cut jeans . My girl friend really likes them on me . I got the dark blue -LRB- rinse -RRB- . Fit good and comfortable .
 My skinny son is 54 years old and will not wear any other jeans - only 517 , boot cut Levi 's so I know what to buy for Christmas and Birthdays . I found a perfect fit for my skinny husband also .
 I ordered these jeansLevi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jeanfor a Christmas gift a short time before Christmas . I knew the size . I was somewhat concerned that I would not get them on time for Christmas The package came just before Christmas , and the jeans were exactly as pictured , nicely packaged -LRB- each pair separately enclosed in plastic bag -RRB- , the right size and color . I was very pleased , as was the recipient of the gift !
 The jeans were a Christmas gift and a style regularly worn by the recipient . They were a perfect fit . They are hard to find locally so we ordered from the Internet . The red tag on the back pocket did not say `` Levis '' and I have never seen this before . Is it significant ?
 Wow . These are great blue jeans , and they come in 38 long which is what he wears . HE wanted the boot cut , and a 34 waist was large enough . Usually he wears a 36 , , but I ordered 34 and they fit just right . Great looking , great price .
 I bought two pairs in two orders - both were perfect - exactly as I expected . On time . Good buy at a decent price .
 These jeans are tough but good looking and fit well . Amazon 's price is great , they are a good value for the money , and we always get prompt delivery and easy return if size is not right .
 These are great jeans for us gals , too , especially if you like to wear a true black color . I dress them up with a feminine camisole and heels , and have got many compliments on them .
 Exactly what my hubby wants . It 's difficult to find his size in our local stores . Very happy Amazon now has Levi 's in his size .
 I love my new bootcuts . I received them quickly , They fit perfectly . Thank you .
 I 've grown frustrated by the lack of good quality/reasonably priced jeans in the market today . At some point , the Levis brand started to suffer in terms of quality/value for the dollar . Do n't remember exactly when that happened , but I started to buy my jeans from Banana Republic . Over time , they stopped making the style I grew to rely on . This created a 7-10 stretch where I could n't seem to find a good pair of jeans . Most recently , I purchased a pair of Lucky jeans - ridiculously over priced . When those began to fail , I tried Levis again and bought these . For a third of the price of Lucky Jeans , these Levis boot-cut jeans are really nice . They have a really substantial feel/weight to them and I could n't be happier with the purchase . I was so pleased , I ended up buying a second pair .
 Levis 517 Boot Cut Jeans are just as advertized . Good fit and a perfect boot cut . I highly recommend them for anyone who needs boot cut jeans .
 It 's a very good pant for my husband . Nothing too special or fancy ; he is very satisfied because he got what he expected
 execelente producto muy buena calidad , el pantalon vino en un excelente empaque y llego super rapido deverdad no tengo quejas lo recomiendo
 This is a great fit for a silk shirt . I thought it would not be a close fit being silk , but I was wrong . This item fits snug and looks great on . Both alone and layered . I would recommend this shirt to people that like the look of a tight tank .
 I love my Silk Tank Tops . I wear them to work under my dress shirts and the feel is very nice . Much more comfie than the Hanes cotton tanks . The quality is very good for the price . The initial fit was just a tad snug , but stretched out just a bit after a couple of washes/wears and is very comfortable now . I tried wearing one on a hike but i find the coolmax type active wear handles sweating much better than silk . But for casual wear , or sleeping at night I love them .
 I never tried or even heard of silk tank tops , but now I will never go back . It 's a great under shirt/workout shirt . I like the way it feels like im wearing nothing at all .
 I bought this top for my 18 year old son -- thought it looked comfortable to wear under shirts etc. . It is . He likes wearing it , but he says he would never wear it alone . It is a wee bit too ` feminine ' to wear on top . Would I buy another one ? I do n't know . I think for him , the basic cotton tank tops are more versatile .
 I own the Austin Reed dartmouth blazer in every color in which they make it -- it is a staple of my business wardrobe . Well made , quality fabric , nicely tailored , classic lines , appropriate for a professional woman . -LRB- something that can be hard to find at times -RRB- It should be noted , however , that the periwinkle and raspberry colors are lovely , but the fabric and buttons are slightly different than the `` classic '' colors -LRB- lighter -RRB- and the linings and interfacings are not as substantial as the brown , navy , camel , red and ivory . It 's still a good value , particularly as these are colors appropriate to warmer seasons and climates , but I was a bit surprised .
 This costume was as expected . An inexpensive first costume for a baby that probably would not wear it more than 10mins anyways . If you are looking for high quality , you probably should look elsewhere but this is perfect to snap a few funny pictures in .
 I bought two of these ten years ago , and they are the best . Still good after all these years . And I disagree that they are too roomy -- they have fit me perfectly .
 I 've been using my medium timbuk2 messenger bag for the past 2 years . Frankly , I think large is way too big . Even medium is a bit much for my 5 ' 3 '' frame . Let me give you an idea of how much a medium bag can hold
 I got the small one.Pros1 -RRB- Heavy-Duty Construction2 -RRB- Lots of pockets inside3 -RRB- Detachable Reflectors4 -RRB- Detachable Cross StrapCons1 -RRB- The velcro can be disruptive in quiet situations2 -RRB- It might not be good for protecting things that get creased easily -LRB- e.g. loose sheets paper -RRB- , esp . when it 's relatively empty -LRB- as it has no structure -RRB- I use it every day . Looks like a good investment .
 I was tired of carrying a camera bag that screams out `` expensive equipment inside ! '' After seeing a link on the Internet of another photographer that took a Tenba messenger bag insert , and placed it inside of a Medium Timbuk2 Messenger Bag , I imitated his idea . I 've now been carrying my Timbuk2 for the past month , and am amazed by the amount of equipment I can comfortable carry inside of it . It has been through both a snowstorm and a rainstorm , and my equipment stayed dry.The quality craftsmanship of the Timbuk2 is one of the first things I noted upon receiving this bag , making it obvious why this cost a bit more than the run of the mill big box store messenger bag .
 As a grad student in computer science , I take my computer with me * everywhere * . I need bags that can take a light beating every day for a long time . When my old computer bag developed a large tear at the computer pocket , I wanted something that would be large enough for me to carry my computer , its accessories , a textbook , a notebook , and my digital camera , which is an oversized point-and-shoot that 's just a little too large to fit comfortably into any bag . Needless to say I also wanted something that would n't rip open or have the clip for the shoulder strap snap and drop my computer onto the sidewalk , both unpleasant experiences I 've had with other bags.I was a little wary of carrying the laptop in a sleeve that could rattle around inside a larger bag , but many of my friends do it that way and seem to have no problems . One of them introduced me to Timbuk2 's products , and after a lot of research and agonizing I ordered the Classic Messenger Bag and Timbuk2 ` sTimbuk2 Wiki Laptop Sleeve.The CMB is great , though it is basically `` just a bag '' with a few auxiliary pockets . The medium size -- which looks big and is actually a little bigger -- holds everything I need , with just a little room to spare , and if I ever want to carry other stuff -LRB- groceries , camping supplies -RRB- I can just take the computer out and have a pretty humongous bag . It 's comfortable , the lining is waterproof , the strap has a nifty quick-release length adjustment , and it feels very , very secure . My girlfriend admired mine so much that she asked her family for one , and I got my brother one as a Christmas gift , as he frequently bikes to work.Some caveats , all of which I consider minor points a buyer might want to be aware of , rather than real issues I have with the product : - It took me a couple days of fiddling with the length of the main strap and how the bag sat on my back before it was really comfortable . I could tell when I first put it on that it was well-built and would be comfortable ; I just had to spend some time and find the sweet spot . - The top does n't really close ; it 's just the main flap of the bag flipped across the opening . Things seem to sit so that the bag pinches shut at the top naturally , and there 's a safe margin of overhang , but I 've noticed that the main strap can pull the overhanging edge of the flap up , rather than down over the side of the bag . I 've never had an actual problem with this , and neither has the friend who showed me the bags in the first place , but it seems worth mentioning . - The cross strap -- yes , it can be a little confusing at first . However , it 's not outrageously difficult either . I got it backwards the first time I tried it , reversed it , and had no further issues . Once you 've got it it 's pretty obvious , and you do n't really need it unless you 're riding a bike or something similarly athletic . - The quick-release on the main strap seems prone to a little slippage unless you really clamp it down . I assume that 's why it has a kind of double-loop system that allows you to adjust the amount of slack strap available for extending at any given time but that 's a little tedious to work with . - There are a lot of auxiliary pockets inside and a couple outside . They 're all useful sizes and pretty much perfectly hold all my stuff , but the interior pockets are built of some much lighter material than the rest of the bag , and it seems to stretch and sag with use . I 'd had a lot of pens in the pen pockets for a couple weeks until I noticed they were getting loose and slightly misshapen . I would n't rely on them to hold a lot of stuff , despite the apparent size . - You ca n't really carry anything on the outside of this bag without buying some accessories from Timbuk2 . This does n't bother me , as I keep phones in holsters and keys in my pocket , but if you put everything in your bag it might be a hindrance . - Word of caution
 I got my first Timbuk2 -LRB- large classic messenger -RRB- back in college , and it 's about 3 years old now . Still going strong and getting better with age i.e less stiff , more seasoned look and feel . Timbuk2 makes amazing bags in a wide range of designs , and the classic messenger is , in my opinion , the best of the lot.I own a large sized classic messenger , and it carries everything I need to bring around -LRB- lots of junk -RRB- and more . The only thing that you have to be careful is not to be too happy tossing stuff in , only to realise that the bag is just wayyyy to heavy to lug around without causing sore shoulders/back . A strap pad is essential if you 're carrying anything larger than a medium-sized classic messenger.These bags are sturdy , practical -LRB- very well-designed pockets , slots , keyrings etc -RRB- and look good to boot . I 've also got a small classic messenger and a large cargo tote that I bought for my mom who complained about her other bags not having enough compartments -LRB- typical women 's purses -RRB- or being too small to hold all her stuff in an organized way.While Crumpler bags are also an alternative in a similar price range , Timbuk2 bags seem more suited for serious messenger bag users , while Crumpler bags are more like casual , fashion accessories.All in all , I seriously recommend Timbuk2 bags for their design and durability . Go Timbuk2 ! -- > Updated to add that I 've added a limited edition purple retro messenger to the Timbuk2 family here : -RRB-
 A great bag for birders :1 . It 's very comfortable and rugged and holds just what I need without becoming a brush-navigation hindrance .2 . The strap is very wide , which I was put off by at first glance , but the result is a very comfortable carry when the bag is full . Unlike other bags I tried on , the strap on this bag is plenty long -LRB- although , I 'm 5 ' 2 '' , so what does that mean ? -RRB- .3 . I can carry a midsize camera , field guides , small notebook , snacks , and water in the main compartment . The internal pockets hold a LOT of little stuff -LRB- ipod , pens , jots , bug juice , memory sticks , first-aid junk -RRB- without cluttering the bottom of the bag . All this gear is right at my fingertips ... no more flushing birds while shucking a backpack in the brush .4 . It does n't have TIMBUKTU plastered across the front . The attractive logo is visible , but it does n't turn me into a human billboard .5 . I bought it for birding , but it quickly replaced the pack I -LRB- as a good Pacific Northwesterner -RRB- have long used as an everyday bag.It loses a star because I hate velcro and this bag comes with two enormous strips of that noisy % # @ ! . My usual trick of covering the scritchy side with felt fixed that problem . The bag is well balanced when loaded -LRB- does n't tip and spill -RRB- , so eliminating the velcro has n't reduced it 's performance.This model would NOT be an adequate size for use as a book bag . Try the next size up or stick with a pack to save your back .
 awesome bag . I love Timbuk2 . This is my 2nd bag , and I basically bought this one to have a smaller bag to use at different times when I do n't want to lug my laptop around . It 's made well and looks cool ... what more could you want .
 The Timbuk2 class messenger bag is great . Holds quite a bit for it 's size . Very useful and good quality .
 I bought this bag 11 years ago when I was in college . It has more than withstood the test of time - I still use this bag on a daily basis with only some mild wear on the inside vinyl waterproof lining that has affected its waterproof-ness -LRB- though based on what I read on the company website , this is covered as part of their lifetime warranty ! -RRB- . Pick your colors carefully because you 'll never need to buy a new bag .
 I used this thing for the first 2 years of grad school and it was excellent . I hauled huge quantities of books and notes around all the time and the thing is like new . And it is really waterproof . When I got a new laptop this year , I ordered the laptop version and I love that too .
 This is the best investment in a bag I have ever made . It looks brand new and I have had it for almost 8 months . Its waterproof , durable , and I can fit a lot of heavy school books into it . The strap is thick and comfortable to strap around your body . I love having it on my bike rides to the grocery store , because you can fit so much into it and not have to put plastic bags on your handle bars and hope they do n't break on the way home!LOVE IT . I plan to get a smaller one for shopping and travel .
 I was a messenger in NY , NY before I joined the Army and I used a Timbuk2 purple and green bag then and loved it . Now that I 'm in the army purple and green are out of the question but this bag will due . It is the strongest easy to use multipurpose bag you will ever need . Just be careful how you pack it for maximum comfort . On the negative side the waist band is too short.Timbuk2 Classic Messenger BagTimbuk2 Strap Pad - Grip -LRB- Black -LRB- Grip -RRB- - one size -RRB-
 This bag really amazed me when I got it . It was the perfect size with a little extra room just in case . I 'm able to take it downtown when I commute and bring a textbook and change of shoes to work , as well as carry all my textbooks , notebooks , and binders to school . It is extremely versatile and I love that it 's waterproof and very durable . This bag will also be extremely useful when I 'm able to go away for the weekend . :-RRB- This was definitely the bag for me .
 This is a great bag . Lots of room . The small is bigger than I thought it would be . I also bought a medium sized Timbuk2 bag and it would be great for traveling . I like the bag so much I bought a few for friends and family . Nicely made with lots of compartments for cell phones and PDA 's .
 This bag is great . Sturdy . Stylish . I love the quality . Works great as a purse , diaper bag , or carry-all . Highly recommend it !
 This is an awesome bag . Works great for a laptop and is easy to carry .
 I 'm using this bag to hold my 15 '' MacBook Pro . It has the right amount of padding and convenient pockets . The strap , however , just hurt my shoulder and annoyed me ! No worries , I replaced it with the SKOOBA superbungee strap , and now it 's the perfect laptop bag !
 Timbuk2 bags are awesome and nearly indestructible just like the T2 . I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it . The only thing missing is a side pocket for a water bottle . But I suppose the bike messengers did n't have time for frilly extras like that . If you can take the time to visit the company 's website to custom design your own bag or check out the cool artist designed limited ones .
 This bag has made such a difference . It is comfortable , spacious , and organized so that I am not constantly digging around looking for things . It is great for everyday and if I get tired of carrying it , my husband does n't mind holding my `` purse '' for me . There have been a couple of instances where I was a little embarrassed by the loud velcro sound of opening my bag , but that is far outweighed by the benefits . I even got a complement on how nice it looked , but this is no fashion purse . Thanks Timbuk2 !
 I was worried this bag would be too small , but there are enough pockets for everything , one big space for lunch , books , fits a regular size folder or notebook . If I could afford it , I 'd get a few in different colors because it was hard to choose just one . The only thing I would change is to remove the Velcro from the front flap - just not a fan of the noise . Sometimes you just need to grab a mint in a quiet place .
 I Love Timbuk2 ! This is my second bag . I have the medium size which I put my laptop and my work essentials in . I recently purchased the extra small to use for day trips and to run errands . I ordered the small but had to return it as the size difference between the medium and the small where not that significant . These bags are durable and sturdy . The quality surpasses any messenger back that I have ever owned . Amazon was great ! I purchased many things through them and the delivery time is pretty accurate . I hope to buy more Timbuk2 's soon !
 The bag is O.k. . It seems to be durable and is water-proof from rain splatters . Im sure that on a bike in a rainstorm water would get in from the top corners . One thing I dont like about the bag is that it should have a zippered pocket along the back of the inside . It does have a small one in the front inside . I saw another Timbuk 2 classic messenger bag with the zip pocket on the back inside for files etc. . I would definatly of prefered that model . As far as the color goes all black is kind of plain and boring . I should of got one with some colors . I was thinking about all black being able to hide stains , which im sure after a few years of use ill be glad I got the all black . Overall the bag is good for what it is . I use it for college and it is working well . I will definatly be using it to go to the lake this summer and on my boat .
 I got this bag on sale for thirty dollars . It looks sharp , it is comfortable , it is the perfect size . I just do n't know what else I could ask for . I knew it was going to last me a looooooong time just from seeing the fabric it was made out of up close . The dudes at timbuk2 have obviously been at this for awhile and know a lot about what a good bag needs and what serious cyclists demand . Sure it might not be as hip as Chrome or other brands , but seriously , they make some slick colorways , and at prices like these it is an undeniable steal .
 I bought for my wife because she is starting grad school . The bag is made very well and has an easily adjustable strap for comfortable over the shoulder carrying . The key holder is great because , with a purse my wife would search for hours . There is a good amount of storage and many deep pockets that are not exposed to the world . Great bag .
 this bag is really nice for traveling . i used it in place of a purse . it held all of the things i bought plus all of my personal items . the only thing that i was disappointed about was that it was the xs size , and the over the shoulder strap could be a tad bit longer . when i was ordering it i was n't aware there were different sizes and could n't find anywhere that said what size this bag was , when i got it , the bag was the extra small size , which i was concerned about , but in the end it all worked out .
 I have the XS size and I love it . It fits my personal essentials , a bottle of water and a book . It 's also light enough that it does n't strain my shoulder . I can access my things easily by swinging it around vs using a backpack . I just wish it had a pocket on the back of the outside -LRB- for mail -RRB- , a big open pocket on the inside and a handle on the top . The padded strap that came along with it kept sliding around so I took it off . It worked much better for me that way . It retains it 's shape with a bottle or a book inside it unlike the bigger models .
 I was very pleased with my purchase . It was exactly what I ordered and wanted . Price was great too .
 I just took this bag out for the first time to a 2 week trip through Brazil and the bag was even better than expected . I bought the medium-sized bag and was able to fit more than I could possibly ever need out and about on the streets . The bag is well-constructed and heavy-duty and shows no use whatsoever after using it for 12 + hours everyday for 2 weeks . The weight distribution works really well and my back never tired even with carry a lot of weight in the bag . If you are looking at buying a bag , I would seriously check out each size , because the medium was even bigger than I anticipated . This bag would be great for any traveler or person on the go .
 This bag is AWESOME ! I love it ! It is big enough to carry about 5 textbooks , or a computer with about 3 books . There are only a few slightly negative aspects -LRB- that really are n't that big of a deal , but a slight surprise nonetheless -RRB- ... the bag 's over the shoulder strap does not lengthen as far as some other messenger bags , meaning for those who like to have the bag trailing behind their ankles , I suggest another style of bag . Also , it has no padding in the inside . Absolutely none . The fabric is very durable , and that makes up for the lack of cushion . This is not a problem unless you need to use it to carry a laptop ... I just wrap my computer in a piece of fleece , which adds a little comfort and ease to my mind and computer , and it is fine
 Every feature of this bag is practical and efficient . While some bags and full of pockets and key rings and flaps that serve only to confuse , tangle and annoy , the Timbuk2 Messenger Bag was clearly designed by someone who actually USES this bag.The front flap is big enough to safely cover the contents , yet flexible enough to quickly retrieve something . The key ring is on a red cord , making it easy to find , and the cord is attached to the opening of the large zip pocket so you can keep it in or out of the pocket but always find and access your keys even when the bag is full . Pockets within pockets make for sensible organization , and there 's a great cell phone pocket and ID or security card pocket . The side of the bag with the pockets is the one that 's AWAY from your body as you wear the bag , which at first seems strange . You then realize it is far easier to get in the pockets when you can see them!I ca n't say enough about this great bag . Oh yes I can ... It looks great too !
 This review is for the medium , solid black , made in the Philippines Timbuk2 messenger bag . I have been using it for about a month now , mostly going back and forth to school.As the title states , I am left-handed . One of the great features of the Timbuk2 is its easily adjustable cam belt . If you have the money to spare , I highly , highly recommend spending the extra money and getting the lefty model if you plan on wearing this over your right shoulder . I have only seen the lefty model available directly from Timbuk2 , but it may be available elsewhere . However , if you are like me and want to save a few bucks by shopping through Amazon , the `` right-handed '' model works just fine over the right shoulder . It just means that you have to take the bag off or flip it around front to adjust the strap instead of adjusting it while it 's still on the shoulder.This is a messenger bag not only in name , but in practice . I only suggest getting it if you plan on using it on a bicycle , as this is where it excels . The cross-strap helps it stay in place even when pedaling hard or leaning over . It is pretty bare bones
 I 've only recently heard of the Timbuk2 brand , but I am quickly sold . Their messenger bags are top-quality products . Sturdy material , spacious compartments , and efficient design -LRB- e.g. the sturdy snap-on latches , secure velcro , etc -RRB- . And best of all , these messenger bags come in a wide array of sizes and design/colors . The only caveat I would give to first-time customers is to really LOOK at the dimensions -LRB- inches centimeters -RRB- of the bag before you choose a particular size . I purchased the `` extra small '' and trust me there is nothing smallish about it . It is surprisingly spacious for an item labeled as `` extra small '' . I can only imagine that the `` Small '' bag would be adequate for the majority of people . And the `` Medium '' and `` Large '' bags would be immensely roomy that you can probably store your 10-pound pet poodle there , with plenty of room to spare !
 I wanted a small , lightweight , strong , and moderately versatile bag in which to tote my thinkpad about , suitable for cycling , but not limited to that alone.just right for these requirements . do n't expect to store much more than your laptop , a kindle , and maybe a book . but hey , this bag makes you feel better looking!tlt -
 I bought this bag for a trip to Barcelona . I needed something that would carry my guide books , Spanish-English dictionary , water bottle , camera , and anything else that might come along . The bag did an excellent job . And it 's huge -- I bought the small one and I could fit my 17 inch laptop in there , with room for extra books . The bag is durable , practically indestructable , and is comfortable against your side as you carry it . When my trip is over , I will still carry this bag with me everywhere I go .
 I 've had this bag for about a year of daily use and I 'm very pleased with it . I just cleaned the inside with a damp sponge and except for a few pen-marks it looks like it is brand new.Large is very large . I recently put 16 hard-back books in it and it had room for a little more . If I were buying again , medium would be my choice .
 4 months ago I got the black and gray medium classic messenger bag.Though I gave it a 5 , its more like a 4.5 Thus far I have been very satisfied with it . It is very durable , quite spacious and looks good . I would warn against getting a larger bag , if you are planning to use this as any every day commuter item . It works really well while biking to work ; except when I have a large coat on , the chest strap is a little too short . Also , the Velcro is rather annoying when trying to open my bag quietly , the buckle latches are usually enough , to keep everything together . All together a great bag , but I got my marked down , and to me the starting price seems a little high .
 Great bag , great price since it was on sale . I was looking for a small messenger bag and had looked at the Chrome series but found that a little out of budget . The material of this bag is amazing , super heavy duty ballistic nylon and a waterproof lining that seems impervious to tears . I 'm only worried about water/snow being able to creep in through the sldes beacuse the top flap doesnt cover it most of the time , which wasnt a problem with the Chrome bags . But for the price , size and material , it does the job .
 Here 's the series of reactions I had when I opened the box containing my Timbuk2 : : : open box to find a ` medium ' sized Covert Timbuk2 : : I think to myself , `` WOW , this thing is massive '' : : unwrap plastic wrapping to reveal external fabric : : `` This bag is huge ! Nice `` covert '' fabric . Pretty cool . '' : : Open the Timbuk2 to see the inside of the bag . The velcro releases a loud `` belch '' and the plastic fabric crinkles : : `` Jesus , this thing is loud . So `` plasticy ! '' This is like a tarp sewn into a bag . But , look at how spacious this is , and there 's pockets for pens , my phone , and miscellaneous stuff . Pretty cool . '' : : Toss it onto my shoulder : : `` Feels like plastic too . A bit awkward on my shoulders without anything in it . '' ... I have n't had the chance to use it . The bag looks tremendously useful ; I could easily put my four cats into the bag and ride around town . Unfortunately , part of it 's usefullnes is that it 's made of 99.9 % plastic , which feels cheep .
 This is a awesome bag . It 's my second one and the size is perfect from commuting to work.Javapie3
 I got the large size at first , and once I realized that it was way too big . The material feels nice and durable . I do n't think that I 'll get any damage to this unless I do something excessive to it .
 My son is very particular about his possessions and this bag was one he requested for Christmas and he really loves it . He researchs important possessions he purchases and he undoubtly did the same in this case . Service was prompt ant this had the look and feel of a quality product .
 This bag is great for so many uses . Bringing to work with files and such , bringing on a plane with personal belongings , a picnic with a packed lunch ! It 's just the right size ! Also , importantly for me , it 's perfect for riding a bike .
 I have had this bag for a few month 's now . I try not to go anywhere without it . The medium is perfect size for books and a laptop . I also use it for an overnight bag filled with clothes , alcohol , and still room for a netbook . Timbuk2 also has some cool accessories to go along with it like a bottle opener or an external pouch that goes on that strap that can hold most electronics .
 Got a bag in June of 2007 , use it for my gym gear and commute duties . Ride a motorcycle and the bag is great . I have a wide back and back packs do n't work very well , this bag perfect . After two years of hauling stuff back and forth from work and the gym , it still looks great.Would most definitely buy another one if something happened to this one . But at this point , the bag still looks new , except for some marks on the liner .
 This is definitely a solid versatile bag . I have 2 classic messenger bags and 1 commute laptop messenger bag . The large size classic messenger bag makes a perfect beach bag ; easily fits 2 large beach towels , a tarp for shade , sun screen , extra clothes , sandals , hat , frisbee etc. . . and is has those small pockets for your cell phone , wallet , and a key string ... and its water proof -LRB- so do n't have to worry about that big wave soaking all of your stuff when your not paying attention ! -RRB- . The medium size bag is great all around city bag ; on the bus , art fairs , concerts , college books etc. . . and the cross strap is perfect when your on your bike -LRB- that 's what this bag is made for . -RRB- The medium messenger bag easily fits everything you could ever need for a day in the city with room to spare.However , if you are looking to carry a laptop I would recommend going with the commute laptop messenger bag or any other timbuk2 bag that is laptop specific . The classic messenger bag has no structure as others reviewers have mentioned , and thus its not really made to hold a lap top . The commute laptop messenger bag is the way to go if your looking to haul your laptop and business papers ... it has a very nice protective laptop sleeve and more pockets for your school or business stuff .

 My son carries so many books and his binder and other stuff back and forth to school each day . It 's February and already I 've been through a backpack , another messenger bag , and a giant binder that is supposed to hold everything . First - three ring binders are a nightmare . I 'll never do that again . Second - a messenger bag or backpack you buy when all the school supplies are for sale in July and August just are n't going to cut it any more . The messenger bag worked but it was just too big . I did n't think it could be but his stuff just never `` fit '' and just moved around in that bag and it was just a mess . -LRB- NOTE
 I used to bike to work and this bag was great for that . It held my change of clothes -LRB- I biked hard -RRB- , my work laptop , and other various things . It also held up perfectly in the rain.Now I commute to work and the bag is great for that too . I keep my gym clothes and shoes in there and all my other normal work stuff . It 's kinda like a man purse ...
 Bag is quality ... you can tell it 's made well and with quality material . I only regret that I did n't go with a smaller size for my needs
 This bag is amazing . Yes , it 's definitely on the expensive side , but totally worth it to save the money . I doubt I will need to buy another bag of this type for a many , many years , if at all . I do n't use it for bike riding . I got it more because I live in the Seattle area and bus everywhere so I needed something that 's totally waterproof , can hold EVERYTHING -LRB- I got the medium size and yeah , it holds everything . As in , all my text books , a change of clothes for work , some food for work , and maybe toiletries if I decide to stay at my boyfriends that night -RRB- , and hold up to the wear and tear of life and heavy college text books . It does all of these things perfectly . I 've been using it everyday for the past month or so and have no gripes about it what-so-ever . I am a poor college kid but saving up for this bag was well worth it .
 WOW ! This bag was large . It was actually so large that I had to send it back . I later got the medium sized bag , and so far , it 's worked well for my uses .
 My husband bought one of these shirts last year to try it out . I was very skeptical of the `` no ironing '' claim . I could n't believe my eyes when I took it out of the dryer the first time -- not a wrinkle to be seen . The material is truly miraculous . We both love this product and plan to buy more . Thank you , Jos. Banks !
 I own three of these shirts and they are great . I get my shirts cleaned and pressed and here is an example of what great shirts they are
 I own two of these Traveler non-wrinkle shirts and they are absolutely the best shirts I have ever owned . They are of high quality material and the size I bought was right on the money . The colors offered are very versatile with just about anything a person would own and can be worn formally or casually . I am going to stick with buying more of these shirts .
 I bought 2 to begin with and now own seven and I ca n't see myself buying other dress shirts
 I received this shirt as a gift over Christmas . Since then I have bought two more . The fit is outstanding and I have never felt a finer material in a dress shirt - it is soft yet sturdy and always appears pressed . The iron free is for real . I hate ironing and will pay the extra 20 dollars per shirt to never have to dry clean or iron again . I will never buy another shirt and I almost want to throw away my non-iron free dress shirts . I highly recommend this shirt . You will enjoy it and probably buy more of them .
 These dress shirts are the best ! Wrinkle-Free , Breathable , Durable Material , Plus lots of styles , sizes and color options . Compare side-by-side to other dress shirts and you 'll see and feel the difference .
 This arrived at my home packaged nicely and it 's in great shape . It 's really good quality . We try to add a NY Yankees ornament every year -LRB- and pretty soon we 'll have a whole Yankee tree -RRB- . We added a few this year thanks to this nice ornament and a few others.Very nice ornament .
 Very nice , sturdy piece . Colors are as vibrant as shown . This is my hubby 's 1st Yankee ornament and he loved it !
 Was impressed to find a cheap NY Yankees ornament that was of good quality ! I would definately purchase more ! Great stocking stuffer too !
 I bought these for my 2 1/2 year-old grandson and they are wonderful for playing in the snow . They are warm but not too bulky in his boots . I have SmartWool socks myself and I really like them . They wash & dry without shrinking . I would buy them again .
 the product is good but the size is not accurate . consequently everything we received is too big .
 These socks are the only thing for cold winters in Maine ! My whole family wears nothing but smartwool socks in the winter . They 're warm , wash and wear well and we love them . The great price was an absolute steal !
 We live in the Northwest so warm socks are a must and these fit the bill . They do shrink if you put them in the dryer so hang dry if you want them to last !
 I got these for my toddler to wear with his snow boots . I got the XS and they fit my 18 month old with just a little room to grow and he normally wears a size 6 toddler shoe . I am very pleased with the quality and fast shipping . I wish I had bought another pair , I 'm sure we will misplace at least one of these socks before we even get any snow .
 These are nice socks . Very thick and seem nice and warm . A quality sock , however , they pill a lot after one wash .
 These are a popular brand in our cold weather state and the only cold weather sock I can find for a 1 1/2 year old . XS fits pretty well and they are a comfortable feeling material .
 Love these socks especially for winter boots -LRB- either galoshes or snow boots ! -RRB- Not sure what else to say about socks but I have to write at least 8 more words . : -RRB-
 Who does n't love Smartwool socks ?! I was born , raised and still live in New England . I am very well-versed in winter survival products . Cold feet will ruin any outside activity in the winter . A lot of socks get wet easily , make your feet sweat , are too warm , too cold , too thick , too thin ... not the case with Smartwool.These particular socks in an XS fit my toddler 's size 8-9 feet perfectly . I think he could wear them again next year as they do stretch a bit . The color is a very attractive taupe and they are really soft . He 's worn these all winter and has not once complained.Excellent purchase for my little guy !
 These socks are terrific ! Very nice material and they keep feet warm and toasty without them getting sweaty . Definitely recommend them . : -RRB-
 great socks perfect fit will buy more thank you for making great socks , we would like more colors though thanks
 These socks are perfect for my 5 year old . Super soft and stretchy so she can easily slip them on herself . Some wool and thermal socks are so tight you have to struggle to yank them on ! Not these . They 're also warm , not hot and sweaty , and very nice colors . A great buy .
 Loved these socks as they fitted my small feet perfectly , kept them toasty , and did n't cost a fortune either . I would recommend them to anyone who needs to keep themselves or their kids warm in the wintertime . : - -RRB-
 I already have several pairs of these socks and I love them . I wear them over my other socks when I wear boots , I give them 5 stars .
 perfect fit and keeps 3 yr old feet very warm - daughter loves them - true to size - recommended
 Howdy!We bought these for our 1 3/4 year old and he wore them every day while we were in Wales in 30-45 degree weather and still wears them now . They fit him a little big but it did n't matter since we could pull them up and he can still wear them now that he is 2 yr 1 month old . He should be able to wear them until he 's 3Cheers !
 SmartWool for everyone ! These are a little big for my 2 year old grand daughter but she loves the feel , and the color . She 'll grow into them .
 these were way too big for my kid so I gave them to someone else . They said they are extremely warm and comfortable . My only complaint is the blue pictured here is not what the socks look like
 I got these for my 4 yo who needed some warm socks for playing in the snow . He absolutely loves them ! He has worn them for 3 days straight . I guess its time to peel them off of him . I will have to get some more !
 My husband and I have SmartWool socks so we decided to get some for our son . He loves them and did not want to take them off ! I may be ordering more for him . Great product and really good price .
 Love the Socks ! My grandson is nice and warm and dry . Love the dry . His toes are happy ! I would buy them again . Thank you for providing these great products .
 Not much else to say - they work well for hiking . Have n't had them long enough to rate durability . They 're socks .
 These socks were a gift for my 3 yo granddaughter . My daughter reports they are great little socks!they keep her feet warm when playing outside or riding behind her Mama on a bicycle .
 I LOVE these socks ! My preschool-aged son had a pair last winter for sledding and outdoor fun , but we lost 1 sock . This year , I returned to purchase 2 more pairs to prepare for this year 's winter adventures ! These socks are super-warm and lightweight . They are not the bulky , heavy wool socks of our childhoods !
 I love these for my son on those cold nights and outdoors . Highly recommend and will be ordering future sizes .
 I love Smartwool products and was thrilled to find these toddler sized socks . -LRB- Our whole family wears Smartwool socks . -RRB- We had some baby Smartwool socks and those were great too . It is really hard to find toddler size thick wool socks . These have been perfect . They are well made and last . I 'll definitely be purchasing more .
 These soft wool socks are great for hiking and keeping feet dry even when they perspire . They are durable and thick enough to provide some cushion without being overly bulky . Goodbye cotton socks !
 I did n't have a problem purchasing these glasses from somthin ' `` Beauty '' . They delivered on time , like every Online Purchase should be . The glasses were new and everything was in the box , that I know of . Purchasing these online saved me about $ 40 - $ 50 .
 i traveled 80 miles one day looking for the jeans i like with no luck , it did make for a nice bike ride though ! then i went online looking and i found what i was looking for at amozon these jeans are hard to get in my hometown!Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut JeansWhat a nice pair of rugged jeans . And I got them so FAST !! Thanks again.Roxann Hill
 Good product , on time and as shown in Amazon.But ... years ago , ordering the same # jean and the same size always brought the exact same fit and look . Lately , the same length , for instance , some times is a bit too long -LRB- can be fixed -RRB- or a bit too short -LRB- bad news -RRB- . The price to be paid for savings by manufacturing offshore . Lets see if with the crisis we return to the memorable `` MADE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ''
 What can I say ? They are Levis . Perfect fit , excellent quality , and the most impressive thing was the price . Unbelievable !
 517 's are the best fit for me -LRB- I 'm a bit older and looking for just a little more comfort -RRB- . I wear boots most of the time , and these do a great job of dropping over the boot and still maintaining a nice line on the leg . Plus , the little red tag says you are a real Texan and not one of those $ 150.00 / pair wannabe 's .
 a la medida , tabla de medidas excelente ...
 These jeans come washed so they are soft , supple and ready to wear . They are pre-shrunk so order the size you wear . I choose boot-cut jeans because I wear 12 '' - shaft western boots . Levies are the only jeans I wear because they fit well , look good , and get better with age .
 These jeans are perfect for the guy who wants to wear boots and not look like a geek or a thug . Just the right combination of loose and fitted .
 This is my first pair of Levi 517 's and I have to say I am very impressed . They sit on my natural waist -LRB- not low-rise like the 527 's -RRB- , and are fitted in the seat and thigh , and then flare out below the knee to fall on the boot . I 'm 6 ' 3 '' 190lbs and have a 36 waist and 34 inseam and it fit perfectly . Hard to find jeans these days that sit on the waist ... I 'm not a fan of the low-rise look or feel , so these jeans were a great find .
 Came to Amazon to order these jeans for my husband since no one ever has his size , 36x36 . I was pleasantly surprised because I did order two of these in different colors , Rancher Light and Rinse , both of which were the perfect colors . Perfect light colored jean and perfect dark colored jean . My husband and I are very hard to fit in jeans and tops so when something works we often get multiples , the problem however is that sometimes we buy the exact same thing in a different color and they fit totally different . Not these ! These jeans were great and the same fit ! Some people might not be able to appreciate that as much as I , but I was very grateful . It was a risk I had to take since his size is so common , but with free returns I had to take advantage . The boot leg is also very subtle but incredibly flattering . He does wear boots but of course they are n't necessary . I would say they are very true to size and great quality . They are currently his `` good jeans '' ... . that is until he `` accidentally '' wears them to go work in the garage . But when that happens , because it will , I will be back to purchase more ! By the way he is just over 6 ' 3 '' about 230-240lbs .
 todo salio perfecto , tanto el envio como el paquete recibido , estan esplendidas , la hora de llegada fue la establecida por el vendedor
 Quality jeans , but not made in the USA.Arrived quickly and each pair were individually bagged in plastic.Good fit , for me .
 Fit well at the waist and look good . Last a lot longer than most most jeans and seem to get more and more comfortable the more you wear them .
 These are great jeans , they do tend to run a little big , both on length and waist . The color was a lot more bluer then it looks in the picture , so be weary of that it . It was too country , and I needed more rock and roll , if you know what I mean.Pros
 I was a bit concerned about this purchase . My husband likes the boot cut style and that was an excellent choice for my purchase . I have zero compliants other then I wish I 'd bought more !
 they were exactly what we were looking for . the orginal 517 , these are my hubby 's most favoritie , they also hold up better than the other styles seem to
 Will have to wash several times for them to fit . I buy this size all the time from other retailers and they are n't this big . Like the color and the style . They just run big I guess . Mainly in the length . Would buy again , just a smaller size .
 The fit is nice , the color is holding up through the wash . I am glad they have different sizes then the stores . Very hard to find 33 x 36 !
 I like the way these jeans fit.The are also comfortable.The ones I have purchased previously have been durable .
 Great fit for my long legs ! Hard to find jeans my size but Levi 's always comes through for me ! a
 Ordered these for my boyfriend , they run extremely small , he regularly wears a 32/34 had to send back and get a 36/34 . Other than that they 're great jeans .
 Finally a pair of Levi 's not only affordable , but a pair that is the real deal . . not seconds or blemished . . but cut perfectly . . The best I have bought in years . . Thanks . . and `` I 'll be back for more ''
 They fit just perfectly and I am very happy to not only get the bestdeal around but beat the sales tax . Good old Levi 's rigid , bootcut jeans have been my all-time favorite jeans my whole life , andI just turned 60 . Got 'em within a week , free shipping faster thanexpected , so that was cool , too . Amazon rules !
 The pants are great . I can not seem to find them in stores like Kohls or Target where I usually shop . I 'm not skinny as far as a skinny person goes but I have thinner legs than a lot of guys . These seem to be not as loose in the butt and thighs . I usually get the 505 's but they are cut a little bigger assuming tree trunk size legs . I have runners legs and these work . If you have big footballer legs , forget about it .
 Finally jeans that fit like the old Levis , these are the old quality heavy denim stuff not that wimpy pre-wash thin as paper junk denim . I would highly recommend these jeans to anyone who 's familiar with real Levis .
 Very easy shopping . I 'm familiar with the pants so it 's just a matter of price and convenience.Sitting at the desk for a few second beats driving to the store , finding out they do n't have the 517 in my size and driving back home . I 've always had trouble just finding the 517 at stores and shopping online sure makes things easier . The pants themselves are everything they 've always been , good fitting and tough.It 's nice to add the stonewash to my collection of darker denim so I do n't look the same every day.I was upprised how fast they came and that 's a big plus too .
 These jeans fit to size perfectly -LRB- for me -RRB- , are comfortable to wear , and have adequate material to reach a guy 's waist ... not hip-huggers . I 'll buy more of these ! Not a deal-breaker by any means but I would prefer them to not have the size label outside ... it seems Levi 's always does this .
 Amazon did not mentioned in the description that this pair of jeans is a Shrink-to-Fit fabric . No question on the quality . . it 's still an amazing jeans , the great Levi 's jeans , never goes out of style ... Take 31 '' waistline x 30 '' inseam if your size is 30 x 30 .
 Jeans are a little tight in the thighs for my husband . It did n't come with packing slip so I 'm hoping I can return them !
 Good quality but I wish I had done more research on the colors . Ordered rigid because of the look online however the denim itself is rigid .
 Yes , these Levi 's are everything I had hoped they would be and More . Perfect fit , and I 'm very pleased tofinally have a BLACK pair ! Amazon 's got another winner !
 My wife thinks it 's funny that I rate my jeans with numbers , but , as a former 505 's man , I now prefer the 517 's 'cause ride my horses more and were my boots more ... plus , they just , plain feel good when they 're on me ...
 Who does n't love Levis ? These are great ! My son was happy on Christmas day and so were we . Happy Holidays !
 It is great to find the exact size , color , and fit you want in a Levi 's jean , and also get it on time .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean , Medium Stonewash , 38x29They fit perfectly . Will probably order more in a couple months .
 Needed a size that few brick & mortar stores keep in stock . Amazon had style I wanted in the size that I wanted at a good price !
 These blue jeans where a great color and a perfect fit . Glad I ordered them . They were a present for my son
 Excellent transaction on hard to find size and style Levi Jeans.Reasonable price and quick shipping.I 'm very pleased with this purchase !
 jeans were shipped quick , arrived in good shape the medium stonewash has that worn look most people want , I am pleased with the purchase .
 It 's very good ! 100 % cottonThe higher rise sits comfortably at the waist.A fit you want from a brand you trustFit width & length ; !
 non common size request was delivered promply before Christmas . My son was very happy with the fit and color .
 Great product ... my dad was very pleased . He had not been able to find the 517 .
 These were a birthday gift for my son and I had them sent directly to him at college . He loved them and they fit great ! Good quality for the price . He liked the fit of the boot cut .
 These are great jeans for us gals , too , especially if you like to wear a true black color . I dress them up with a feminine camisole and heels , and have got many compliments on them .
 Exactly what my hubby wants . It 's difficult to find his size in our local stores . Very happy Amazon now has Levi 's in his size .
 I love my new bootcuts . I received them quickly , They fit perfectly . Thank you .
 My husband 's body type includes slight pot belly and skinny hips and thighs . Almost impossible to find pants that fit well without being either too tight in the belly or looking baggy in the seat and thighs . He used to wear Levi 's Action Jeans which were boot cut jeans with slight stretch in fabric and a slight crease in the legs . These jeans always looked and fit great ; real snappy . Unfortunately they 're no longer available . Then went to wearing David Taylor Flexjeans from Sears which were almost as good . However , he now find that although Sears still sells jeans by this name , they are no longer the same . They are now made in China and are made from a crappy fabric and no longer fit the same . In desperation , he started looking thru available Levis products and found Levi 's 517 . Advertised as slim in seat and thighs . He did not expect much but was pleasantly surprised to find that they are indeed somewhat slim in the seat and thighs , even though the pants he bought had a waist size slightly larger than minimally necessary , thankfully allowing him to breathe . Bottom line was that he was very happy that these pants are not so tight in the waist that its hard to breathe , but still slim enough in the seat and thighs that they do n't look like old man 's jeans . Just wish they had the snappy look of the old Levi 's Action Jeans .
 I bought a pair of these in 29X34 and they are great . Fit perfect , really like the cut , lighter weight material but not too light , should hold up well . Just wish they would reduce the size of the internal tag -- I 've actually had to tuck it back into the pants a few times after putting them on !
 Finally figured out what cut and size I like , but the only place I can find them is the internet . Great pants .
 These were ordered off Amazon when I could not find them locally . I found the pants and they are describer perfectly and fit exactly as I had wanted them to . I will buy more in the future because they were perfect .
 Completamente satisfecha con el producto , exactamente igual a lo que ofrecieron . LLego en el tiempo estimado que prometieron . Ninguna queja , volveria a comprar de nuevo .
 The Levi jeans were just like I expected . The fit was perfect and received them in just a few days . Thanks !!
 The quality of the denim is lighter , so the good fit disappears by the end of the day . Otherwise , I like 'em !
 Hubby dearest was so happy to find boot cut Levi jeans at Amazon as it seems most stores have quit carrying this style of jean . He likes to wear boot cut jeans and Levi jeans are his favorite brand.No complaints about the fit or wearability either . Ordered two more pairs of jeans today as he 's a happy camper.Recommend .
 Good deal on the jeans and speedy shipping . My first pair of boot cut jeans . My girl friend really likes them on me . I got the dark blue -LRB- rinse -RRB- . Fit good and comfortable .
 I 've grown frustrated by the lack of good quality/reasonably priced jeans in the market today . At some point , the Levis brand started to suffer in terms of quality/value for the dollar . Do n't remember exactly when that happened , but I started to buy my jeans from Banana Republic . Over time , they stopped making the style I grew to rely on . This created a 7-10 stretch where I could n't seem to find a good pair of jeans . Most recently , I purchased a pair of Lucky jeans - ridiculously over priced . When those began to fail , I tried Levis again and bought these . For a third of the price of Lucky Jeans , these Levis boot-cut jeans are really nice . They have a really substantial feel/weight to them and I could n't be happier with the purchase . I was so pleased , I ended up buying a second pair .
 Levis 517 Boot Cut Jeans are just as advertized . Good fit and a perfect boot cut . I highly recommend them for anyone who needs boot cut jeans .
 It 's a very good pant for my husband . Nothing too special or fancy ; he is very satisfied because he got what he expected
 execelente producto muy buena calidad , el pantalon vino en un excelente empaque y llego super rapido deverdad no tengo quejas lo recomiendo
 He looks hot in them , thanks ! What more can I say ? They did n't stay on for very long ... ca n't share any more details .
 I was somewhat hesitant to order Levi 's online but I could n't be happier with this order ! The jeans are exactly as described and fit perfectly . They are genuine Levi 's and are of the highest quality - not seconds . I ca n't recommend this seller highly enough .
 My skinny son is 54 years old and will not wear any other jeans - only 517 , boot cut Levi 's so I know what to buy for Christmas and Birthdays . I found a perfect fit for my skinny husband also .
 I ordered these jeansLevi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jeanfor a Christmas gift a short time before Christmas . I knew the size . I was somewhat concerned that I would not get them on time for Christmas The package came just before Christmas , and the jeans were exactly as pictured , nicely packaged -LRB- each pair separately enclosed in plastic bag -RRB- , the right size and color . I was very pleased , as was the recipient of the gift !
 The jeans were a Christmas gift and a style regularly worn by the recipient . They were a perfect fit . They are hard to find locally so we ordered from the Internet . The red tag on the back pocket did not say `` Levis '' and I have never seen this before . Is it significant ?
 Wow . These are great blue jeans , and they come in 38 long which is what he wears . HE wanted the boot cut , and a 34 waist was large enough . Usually he wears a 36 , , but I ordered 34 and they fit just right . Great looking , great price .
 I bought two pairs in two orders - both were perfect - exactly as I expected . On time . Good buy at a decent price .
 These jeans are tough but good looking and fit well . Amazon 's price is great , they are a good value for the money , and we always get prompt delivery and easy return if size is not right .
 the product is excellente , but needs to be taggedcorrectly , I order 34x30 tag say so , but real size was36x32 try buying them from differet source , and same thing never can get athe right size until i took a mesuring tape to the store and mesure before buing them !!
 I love those Jeans . . nice shape and denim . I ordered different colors from this pant and I love them all . it is comfortable , and have a nice leg openning that falls around the boot .
 I have been wearing 517 's for as long as I can remember . They fit perfectly and have remained unchanged for years .
 Bought these jeans for my husband . They fit very well and look nice . The shipment arrived on time . I was happy with my purchase .
 I ordered these jeans an exrta size longer becaause I wanted a high cuff . Got exactally that . Perfect !!! Now I 'm looking for a white pair
 Well , they 're Levi 's . There you go . Best jeans on the market . Last forever and fit great . The black does fade to gray quicker than I would like , but that 's probably because I wear only black , all the time . So ...
 I have worn Levi jenas for the last 16years , i am relatively tall guy and seldom get my size in the store , Amazon provides me my size and then quality as well .
 Purchased two pairs of Levi 's Boot Cut Jeans for my husband , the Jeans are very hard to find in the stores . Since my husband is tall , it is hard to find 36x36 .
 These pants are very well put together and I am a big fan of Levi 's pants durability which is what prompted me to purchase these .
 I am a woman but men 's jeans fit me better . These are very comfortable . My jeans do NOT get hung up on my boots as they do with jeans that are not boot cut .
 I like this style and they are getting very hard to find . The price here was the best I found , got in a timely manner . I 'm happy with my purchase .
 Purchased these jeans for my husband . They have a nice fit and look very good on . No baggy butt like the relaxed fit jeans .
 I usually have a hard time finding good bootcut jeans with the right fit in the retail stores . If the color/wash/fabric is right , the size isnt . If the size is right , the fit is too loose at the seat and thighs . Now that my favorite pair of jeans is past its prime , I started looking for a new pair to replace it . After hunting all stores in and around my area and trying all available bootcuts in my size , I was very disappointed . That is , until I found a pair of Levi 's 517 Blue Ox in the local Macy 's store . This was the first bootcut I found in the last 3 years that fit me perfectly . Since I already had a pair of jeans that was of a very similar color , I came online and started looking for the correct color in that fit . Unfortunately , it wasnt that easy finding one online . Kohls , Dillards and others had Levi 's 517s , but they werent the same ones I saw in the store . Apart from Macys and Amazon , no other site -LRB- including Levi 's own site -RRB- had the same fit in Rancher Light color I was looking for . I could have ordered at Macys website , but my past experience with Amazon was stellar and so it my first choice . Even then I was a little skeptical if the photos were close to how the jeans looked in reality . Since amazon had a free returns on this one , I went ahead with the order . The product , as always with Amazon , came 6 days ahead of their estimated delivery date . The jeans is , in fact , very close to the pictures on the website and the fit is PERFECT !! Thanks to Levi 's for the perfect color and fit and KUDOS to amazon for the perfect shopping experience !
 Finally Levi went back to 7 belt loops instead of the five . Makes a big difference for those of us that work for a living .
 I bought the 517 as I prefer this cut to any other one of the Levi 's catalog , I place it even above the so famous 501 . I 'm fully satisfied
 I love these jeans . The wash and fit are great . That being said , they did arrive with a hole in the seat and the seam is a little crooked on the inside left leg . I really do n't care though because they fit so good .
 It is hard to find male , black , slim fit , boot cut jeans . Believe me I searched many places both on-line and local retail outlets . Finally I found these on Amazon and they were just right . Great fit , looks good , and the price was reasonable . I highly recommend them .
 We will take these to alterations but they were about 5 inches too long . Otherwise they are very nice .
 True to size , did n't shrink , and minimal wrinkling . Love the variety of sizing - son is tall and thin , and hard to fit , but Levis 517 made it happen !
 Levi 's are always the best jeans around . Levi 's Boot Cut are the only kind my husband will wear . Always a good fit .
 Very high quality . Several pairs have consistent fit . Have bought and worn these 517 boot cut jeans for several years .
 My husband LOVES these jeans . They are a GREAT FIT , especially in the seat . The legs are n't too wide in the thighs and the bootcut bottom make a terrific silhouette . I like how he looks in them and he says they are REALLY COMFORTABLE . They look best in the darker color and are a good pair of `` dress jeans '' as well as versatile . We are ordering more . Ladies , get him these jeans !
 I 've worn Levi 's for over 50 years . From the days when you had to roll up the cuffs because they only had one length to super bells in the 70 's and now my favorite 517 's . They are always true to size and the workmanship is always excellent . The service at Amazon is always great too . What more can I say , I am one satisfied customer .
 These boot cut Levis have always been my favorite jeans . I had not had any in a while , so when my order arrived I immediately tried them on . I forgot how well they fit , and they are really stylish . Awesome . Will be ordering more .
 Authentic , just as described . Fast delivery . I am very satisfied with purchase . Smooth , one stop purchase . Husband will be very happy on Christmas day ! Thank you .
 My husband has been wearing Levi 's since he was a teenager . They are the most durable jeans and he loves the boot cut .
 I 've been wearing these for years.They do tend to fade easily so wash them inside out and use a detergent product for black fabrics .
 I bought these as a gift for a friend who has worn this style for years . Good quality , good fit , good style .
 Great jeans.Classical style.Low price.Wearing only jeans , levis always loved.Happy New Year!Amazon Forever!I love it .
 This hard to find style arrived on time . These classic jeans fit just the way they should . Going back for more colors .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Slim Fit Jean is leg looks like so long , . . but lap so tight but leg looks like so long . .
 My husband like it . . although I have to cut the length a little bit . . He said he may buy more in the future . . Hopefully they have shorter length then .
 They are Levis what more needs to be said ? Theyre the only jeans im buying from now on . They fit great and last 2-5 times longer than any other jeans ive bought .
 I use to wear the Levis low boot cut , but they discontinue to sell the color I want . After I give this one a try , I like it so much .
 I bought 2 of these and man they are nice . I 'll admit the guy wearing the jean in the picture sold me . Like I went and look for all the style of Levi 's , and these attracted me the most . Although I would n't tuck in my shirt like that . But they sure look good with some chucks and or casual boots and a dress shirt , with a silver wrist watch , and a pair of shades . They are heavy , and for me kinda tight even though jean of a different brand and style with the same size , fit me perfectly . I do n't know I guess it the way they are made . But for the look , I 'll take the pain any day , yes these jean are so tight mostly in my thigh area and waist , that I do get a little discomfort pain in my lower back . I guess it the way they are design and the heaviness of the jean . Of course I am in the process of getting in shape again . So with time , these will be perfect . I do like to sag a little , but as of right now I ca n't with these . Until I lose some of that belly fat I accumulated over the years .
 These are the jeans I always buy , they are a great comfortable fit . It is also great that Amazon stocks the size I need , it 's impossible to get from the shops .
 My body was made for Levi 's brand jeans , and I 'd worn through a couple of pairs . I bought duplicate black 517s - soft but not washed out , dark , with a predictable fit . They are my new favorites . The process went smoothly . Who knew I 'd be buying clothes online ?
 I ordered these for Christmas for my 6 ' 2 '' grandson who had grown out of all his pants after checking stores and finding his size is almost impossible to find . They were perfect and he loved them .
 The Levi 's 517 Boot Cut were purchused as a replacement of the wrong ones bought at a local store , These ordered & delivered ; I was told fit greatly before & after ; washThe price for my buying , totaled out a nuff less even with shipping to come fromamazon , rather than a store , even on sale after my tax & shipping ; -LRB- as a late gift -RRB- Theonly guestion I got was about , they did not have the Levi 's cardboard shelf tagswe see on Jean 's in store .
 I love my levis . I was unaware they came in black . I bought a blue pair and black pair , Ilove them
 Just as described ! Fit & look exactly what he needed and wanted . And he said I could n't find this product ... LOLThanks !!! The Wife wrote the review ...
 These jeans fit great . The boot cut gives a good look without being sloppy . My husband looks hot in them .
 Got these as a gift for my brother , and they are the true blue classic with a great slim shape . Perfect `` date night '' jeans .
 These are the only jeans my husband will wear and we could not find them ANYWHERE . When i found them here i was happily suprised with the discount price and they look great . Would buy again from this seller .
 The fit and look are great and I saved a few dollars . Will purchase more when the price is right
 love this jeans , the fabric is really good and the cut is impecable . it is original and the communication was really easy , i recieved really fast .
 I 've always wanted a ` black 527 ' but found out I could only get that in rigid black.I decided to try 517 n whao I might just decide to continue with 517 even with other colors.Just the perfect fit I love .
 Is exactly what i was looking for . . i being using this model for years , and this pair of pant are excellent
 I am a creature of habit . Being of slim build I have found the 517 Boot cut to be the perfect jean for me . I also know my size so the fit was great as received . This is not always the case when ordering over the Internet . Service was great delivered on time as expected .
 These are the best jeans Levis has to offer in my opinion . They are not light and flimsy like some jeans Levis are making these days . The medium stonewash is a great even color . They do n't look faded on the seat and thighs or dingly and dirty like so many jeans do . These jeans are rugged , comfortable and last a long , long time . On top of that they look great . These are the only jeans I will buy .
 These jeans are everything they say they are . We will definately order these jeans again when the time comes . Thanks !
 100 % recomended , i have no doubt that i am going to buy another , it is really regular fit and boot cut
 This is the only jean my husband wears . He has the hardest time finding 36x29 . This is a perfect fit for him . When he needs more I will return to amazon .
 I finally found a pear of jeans that my wife said they look good on me and after being washed still fits great
 This pair of Levi 's fits perfectly and the indigo color is the same as the Levi 's I wore back in the day !
 I gave these Jeans to my daughter 's friend for Christmas and he really likes them.He is real thin and wears motorcycle boots.He likes how they fit and loves the boot cut.He especially likes the rugged material .
 My order arrived in a timely fashion , they fit good and look great ... I 'm gon na get a couple more pairs .
 Levi 's 517 ` sThese Levi 's were the perfect fit . I like the fact that they are pre rinsed , which makes the fabric softer .
 Many of us do n't want to wear our Levi 's half way up our bellies . 517s are the best answer for that !
 A well tried and true blue jean that I 've been wearing for decades . The fit , finish , and quality is a good as or better than ever .
 These seemed a bit darker in person than pictured but they were a great pair of jeans for my husband . This is his favorite style of jeans and he needed a new pair of &#34; dressy jeans . &#34; Same great jeans as in the past .
 All the Levi 's I purchased for my 16 year old son were ` made to fit ' ! From the straight to boot cut , they all were a perfect fit for his personal taste . They are well made and very stylish .
 Great jeans , great price , speedy delivery as promised ! Will definitely be ordering them again since my son is so tall and slim and this is one of the only places I can find his size .
 Great basic jeans in hard to find sizes . Not much to say otherwise . They have washed up well and held up well for my long and lanky teen .
 These jeans fit me very well and look good . One thing I noticed however is that the denim has a more coarse feeling compared to other Levi 's jeans . I would buy these again .
 IL TELL YOU I HAVE BEEN WEARING LEVI 'S FOR YEARS ON END AND THE BEST DEAL I GOT ON THESE GREAT JEANS WAS FROM MY FAVORITE STORE AMAZON
 I love these jeans . For me they are perfect . Long enough to wear with or without boots and the fit is not too tight . How can you go wrong with Levi 's ?
 I got what I ordered promptly . I wish I had ordered a different color but -- my bad . No complaints . What else can I say ?
 The jeans was just perfect , the material , size and colour , nothing to complain about , and great timing too.They fit really well , and amazon 's size chart was very helpfull .
 Style & size stayed true since the last time I bought a pair , after gettingLevi 's Men 's 527 Low Rise Boot Cut Jeanthat are nothing like they used to be that 's all a shopper can ask .
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut . Black 42 waist / 30 length . If you are short , stocky and have a big butt . These pants are perfect . They wo n't bunch up at your fat knees and they will last a long time before the zipper explodes . I suggest you buy the next size up because they will shrink after 6 months of washing , drying and severe stretching in the seat area . Great pants .
 MY FAVORITE JEANS FOR 25 YEARS . I HAVE WORN MAINLY 501 MODEL , SO I READ MANY REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING THESE 517 JEANS.AFTER THINKING FOR A LONG TIME I DECIDED TO BUY ONE SIZE BIGGER THAN USUAL . IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE.THEY ARE JUST FINE , BLACK COLOR AND ZIPPER FLY WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DETAIL FOR ME !
 The only problem was I had was that I had to have them hemmed 2 &#34; so as not to walk on the cuff . I would have ordered them shorter but they were not offered in the waist size I needed . The waist fit perfect and having them hemmed was not that big of a deal . It coast me $ 12.00 to have them hemmed .
 I love being able to find the 517 's on line and not having to run all over town for the style and size I need .
 If you promise not to tell anybody , I wear lined jeans from eddie bauer or llbean when it gets cooler . I wear these when it gets warmer . True to size , do n't shrink too much .
 These were a secret gift for my brother-in-law . He keeps complaining that he must do laundry every other day because he only has one pair of work pants , but then he just will not go get more or let anyone buy him any ! So , I got the size off of the one pair of jeans he owns -LRB- laundry is at my house -RRB- and I bought several other pairs that were similarly worn . I sneak in a new pair about once a week and so far he has n't noticed that he now has three pair of work pants . When I slip in the new ones , I put them in the dirty clothes hamper he uses . I wonder if he knows his pants are multiplying yet ?
 They arived bfore time , APO adress , in Afghanistan ,1 week took it to arive here , im suprised , and they fit good , i dont hawe no words
 I am happy with the jeans and how they fit , but usually when I get 517 's , they are really stiff and then I get to break them in . This pair was already like pre-washed , just differnt than what I am used to , but I still like them and will wear them . Maybe I have to look into differnt types and find exactly what I am looking for next time . Thank you
 I 've been wearing 517 's for a good , long time now , and I love 'em ! The problem is that most of my local stores that sell them -- and very few of them do -- price them highly and also drastically limit the selection compared to the more popular 501 's and 550 's . Additionally , these jeans are often skipped over when it comes to the big sales . Well , shopping for them on Amazon is a decision I should have made long ago . The price here is hard to beat.As for the jeans themselves , they are of the rugged quality that Levi 's is known for . They fit like the product photo shows
 Have had these jeans for a few weeks now & am very satisfied.The flair from the knee down is discrete and does not look like the 70 's bell-bottoms . The fit on top was precisely as marked . The length seems about 1/2 inch longer than sized on the 501 's . Was formerly utilizing 501 slim fit jeans but found that could not place them over motorcyle boots . The 501s were great for rainy rides , but look too much like a cowboy , when tucked into the boots .
 As always , good shopping at amazon.com . Its always a problem finding the right length jeans for me . I found that in this levi 517 Boot cut jean , it feels good to finally find a jean that is not too short . A fact that i would have loved to know before i bought this jeans , is the leg opening size . This jean is very tight around the thigh area . I would just like a bit more details on the product a next time round . Other than that , it always a good shopping experience on Amazon .
 The length and waist were perfect . The quality of Levi jeans was the same as they had always been , good
 I always had to keep pulling up my previous pairs of Levi 's -LRB- any model -RRB- because they only had FIVE belt loops . A key ring and cell phone are not that heavy . I remember growing up with Levi 's having SEVEN belt loops and a heavier canvas . I was pleasantly surprised to see the ` new ' Levi 's 517 now have seven belt loops again . I started to buy a different model , but they still only have the five loops.I just bought a couple of these pairs from Amazon . I did check online at Kohls and their current batch of 517 's still show 5 loops . I will have to wait until I go to the store to see if their stock has been updated . Kohls prices are higher than Amazon , but I will recheck when they go on sale . I still check Amazon first for almost all my purchases.Overall , I like my new Levi 's jeans . I will compare them with older ones to see if the canvas really is slightly thinner . Outsourcing manufacturing almost always results in poorer quality and non-standard sizing . It has 100 % results in putting Americans out of work . I try to buy American whenever I can -- hopefully it will catch on.There is another issue appearing after I washed my new jeans with my old ones . It should n't have made a difference , but the new ones are now covered with fine fluffy hairs . I will have to use a lint brush when I take them out of the dryer for now . Although it may just be a ` break in -- first washings ' issue.Overall , I rate these jeans 4 stars . I will have to wait for a few machine washings to see how the color holds up . I may be old fashioned , but buying jeans looking like they are 1/2 wore out or have holes in them is ` less than optimal ' .
 I ran around town to find my husband Levi 517 's in size 35x32 for Christmas . In the stores , there were stacks of all different sorts of Levi 's to go through . Finally I came home and ordered them through Amazon and received exactly what he wanted . These Levi 's fit perfectly and look great . Very happy they come in off size waists . Thank you for making my job easier and receiving nice fitting jeans .
 I 've grown up wearing Levi 's and in particular 517 's in my adult life . I do like that Levi has added additional belt loops in the past year or so . Over the years Levi has cut some corners in manufacturing , but not enough to discourage me from continuing to buy their stonewashed 517 's . I like the stonewashed jeans since they are ready to wear , unlike the rigid indigo Levi 's that have to be washed several times to soften them up.I am buying more and more items from Amazon for the free shipping and competitive prices . It just saves a lot of time going to a retailer only to find out they do n't have my size or what I want . Even with Amazon collecting California sales tax , I figure the time and gas saved from having to go to a retailer is well worth it .
 My grandson loves these jeans , since he 's rather tall we were glad to find Levi 's makes great jeans in his size . Strange as it may seem , many brands of jeans do not come in a 34in length .
 As an active equestrian rider , and a woman of 59 years , I 'm ALWAYS looking for comfortable jeans that sit at my waist -- I do n't like women 's jeans at all - the fabric in women 's jeans seems flimsy , and the low-rise , hip-hugging jeans for riding or leisure wear feels uncomfortable . The men 's Levis and men 's Lee jeans are very comfortable , and they can handle my active life -- for me , men 's Levis 517 bootcut jeans have best variety for colors , and toughest quality in fabric .
 Nice one . . Boot Cut with nice fit.Ordered the Jeans with 29L but got it 3inch longer . So I had to do alteration , usually I order my pants with 29L and it fits perfect on me .
 Levis 517 's fit me better than any other jeans that I 've bought . Gon na stick with them . I wear a 38 waist , 36 inseam . Have bought several pair over the past six months from various places and they all fit the same . Good quality control !
 BASTANTE BIEN . BUENA CALIDAD DEL PANTALON . ME QUEDO MUY BIEN . TANTO EL LARGO COMO EN CINTURA . EXCELENTE COMPRA A UDS . GRACIAS .
 The jeans are a good deep color . Wish they were n't quite as thin as jean material seems to be getting , but seems they are all like that now . Overall a good pair of jeans.These are hard to find in 36x36 , so I 'm glad Amazon carries them .
 Perfect fit right out of the box . Started wearing immediately , stitches , pockets , zipper perfectly in place . Survived several washes good as new .
 Good price , perfect quality . Very good model for young and old-aged people . Gorgeous color . Classic zipper . I 'm satisfied ! I recommend to buy it .
 If you know your size they fit . I do n't understand the reviews that say the sizes are wrong . Will buy again .
 was just what i expected ... very pleased with purchase . I like the fact that you can get 29 inseam . You can not get that in the store . No need to get them hemmed !
 his pants in overall line is still very good , sturdy , feels soft to the touch on the skin , the profile legendary cutting adds a touch of elegance , and even after several washings the fabric remains the same and does not shrink , the only thing I did not like the pants is that they have deteriorated the quality of the clips and metal buttons , formerly of copper and bronze , and now this are of aluminum and does not look good , however I recommend buying them are very good at the price .
 These came a little long , maybe an inch or two . Seeing as many others have noticed this is a problem with this fit , I suggest going one inseam size lower . I ordered a 30 '' and they fit more like a 31-32 '' . Other than the sizing , they are great jeans , and still look great on me . The boot cut allows the extra length to bunch up a little around the shoes , so you do n't really notice it . It actually looks good.I wish they sold these in a low rise version , as I do n't like hiking them up to where you might put dress pants or khakis . They stopped selling the 517 in a low rise though , so I 'm happy to wear them as is , great fit .
 I have always appreciated the fit and quality of Levi jeans . The boot cut has a closer fit around the knee with comfortable room in the hips and waist . What Levi Strauss needs to understand is that there is a huge population of men out there that has a 31 inch inseam . Men between 5 ' 9 &#34; and 6 ' fall into this size range . My growth did not stop at 30 &#34; inseam , and did not make it to 32 &#34; . So I either buy high water jeans that show my socks , or I let the cuffs drag the floor which signicantly reduces the life of the jeans . I liked the fit enough that I spent an additional $ 10 to get them hemmed to 31 .
 product arrived as expected on time , the product was as expected and the quality was as you 'd expect to find in a brick & mortar store .
 Great fitting . I usually buy the 527 style but they did n't have black in that style . Ordered a 517 instead and love the fitting .
 d e m a r a v i l l a e s t e m o d e l o muy bueno
 These are the first jeans in a while that actually fit my waist size , inseam and the leg openings are perfect .
 These jeans fit well but the denim seems less hefty than the denim of the same 517s from 5 years ago .
 I received my pants very quickly . I was concerned that my size would be too short for boots . I was pleasantly surprised that the designer was thoughtful about the shape and length for this item &#34; after &#34; several washings . Pants are about 1/2 inch longer than the average pants which make them perfect for cowboy boots . Pants are also very comfortable . JCD
 Noticed that they even have an extra pair of belt loops compared to my previous order . They are sturdy & dependable .
 The jeans were great ! The price was right , they were delivered in a timely fashion , and I lost a few lbs to get in them and I look good . lol . I recommend this company .
 These are the only jeans my son likes . He is tall and I have trouble finding his size in local stores and I could not find a better price .
 The jean came very quickly . They were the proper color , size , and cut . The packaging was excellent , and so was the quality of the jeans .
 Perfect price and fit for my husband . I would recommend this jean to any &#34; baby boomer &#34; who loves boot cut jeans.The jean has not changed at all good quality material and the right color . Thank you .
 36 &#34; inseam jeans at a reasonable price are hard to find . I really like the fit of these jeans just wish there were other kinds in the same length .
 Just what I expected . After soaking and drying , the fit and feel was as anticipated ... just like the good , old days !!! -LRB- I would estimate that length and waist both shrunk by about one inch ... as Mama warned , some 50 years ago -RRB-
 i got two pairs for my husband . levis are the only thing that fit him right . They make him look like he has a butt !
 I like this product because it fits very well and is comfortable . I recommend it to others . Good for those who like to wear boots .
 Finally found levis that were the correct size , if they are still available I will order more in the future
 Great pants . I wish there was a size 33 by 35 . I always have a hard time with pants size . I can get a length 34 , which shrink after a wash or a 36 that drags because there too long . But there is no length 35 in pants , so I do n't have much of choice .
 Excellent product the product I come very well and it is what was waiting of , I come in time , good
 I bought they for my boyfriend who had lost a bit of weight and all his pants were falling down , but these fit and stay up -LRB- Thank God -RRB-
 My husband loves the fit and the price.Great deal.You can dress them up or down!Look no further.Great looking jean , for the price .
 Great black on black bootcut jeans . They have even gone back to adding two additional belt loops a feature that went away several years ago .
 Fits well , my husband loves them , quality control met , consistent sizing , and look good on . Will order more as needed
 My son wears a 36 Waist x 36 lenght which is very hard to find . The Levi 's Men 's 517 are about the only jeans he likes and these fit him perfectly . They were shipped very quickly and the price was excellent . They were a birthday gift and he loves them .
 The jeans were pre washed and fit just like I wanted . They were really softer than I expected . I would buy this product again .
 I was so happy with the quality and fit ; I ordered 3 more pairs ! I will be good on jeans for awhile . The price was good too .
 Great quality and a lower price , for me is like a tailored jean , I 'm happy with this product . No more to say thanks to all
 After numerous failed attempts at the 527 's on amazon I finally got a clue and got these jeans . They are PERFECT ... great fit ... weight ... etc. ... just like the jeans I wore in high school 20 years ago ... . I 'm already thinking about a second pair . The light rancher is the perfect color ... . As for the 527 's MADE IN BANGLADESH ... amazing they could ever bear the levis name ... perhaps they were counterfeit . Thanks amazon for my true and needed exchange . The original pair of jeans I ordered ... yes the 527 ... was complete trash . These 517 's are real jeans for real cowboys ... and I 'm not one ... but I do wear a ton of boots ...
 Exellent product
 They 're good sellers and the product is very good , I like so much this jean . Ellos son muy buenos vendedores , el producto llego rapido a mis manos y era el esperado , los recomiendo ampliamente .
 I wear Levi jeans every day . Levi 's are the only jeans I will wear.I have worn Levi jeans for the past twenty -LRB- 20 -RRB- years ... or longer.Levi jeans are great ... in fact , i 'm wearin 'em right now ...
 Sent me what I wanted . 15 more 12 more 11 more 9 more 7 more 5 more 3 more done
 This is a very good price for this product , it 's the second one I 've ordered for my son .
 These boot cut jeans by my favorite jeans maker are exactly what I needed.When I ordered my Harley Davidson boots , I needed pants for when I wear them and these ones are the only ones that fit on the outside where others ca n't . Shopping local yields nothing like these , just junk not worth the money.Quality is what I 've come to expect from Levi 's , outstanding with fit absolutely perfect.More orders coming soon for these.Shipping was prompt , making this buyer very happy.Thank you to everyone for helping this lonely guy that hardly can get out to shop by bringing them to me.Again , THANK YOU VERY MUCH !!
 I thought these were more on the casual side , but after putting them on , they can pull off a nice look . Very comfy , one day to break in . No frays , quality zipper . Dimensions were perfect . Overall color is a shade or two darker than in the picture . Awesome , new favorite pair .
 If you have a problem with jeans bagging in the rear , then these jeans are for you ! They are a great fit and very comfortable ! My husband loves them !
 Well , its a good jean , everybody know the levi 's quality , the item arive in perfect conditions . . so nothing more to say . .
 Perfect fit , every time . 517 's are difficult for me to find locally , but buying on line thru Amazon is best for me .
 These are like they used to make them ! More belt loops , great fabric - love them ! Ca n't wait to order more of these !
 I was having a really hard time finding the boot cut Levis - no one seems to carry them anymore . These are just what I wanted . They look and fit good .
 Bought these for my husband and they fit true to size , maybe a little bit long but not so much that he wo n't wear them . He love them , they look good so I love them ! Great Pants !
 I ordered these jeans for my 16yo son & he really liked them . The only thing he would have preferred was a lower rise , but he 's wearing them without complaints . : -RRB-
 My husband bought one of these shirts last year to try it out . I was very skeptical of the `` no ironing '' claim . I could n't believe my eyes when I took it out of the dryer the first time -- not a wrinkle to be seen . The material is truly miraculous . We both love this product and plan to buy more . Thank you , Jos. Banks !
 I own three of these shirts and they are great . I get my shirts cleaned and pressed and here is an example of what great shirts they are
 I own two of these Traveler non-wrinkle shirts and they are absolutely the best shirts I have ever owned . They are of high quality material and the size I bought was right on the money . The colors offered are very versatile with just about anything a person would own and can be worn formally or casually . I am going to stick with buying more of these shirts .
 I bought 2 to begin with and now own seven and I ca n't see myself buying other dress shirts
 I received this shirt as a gift over Christmas . Since then I have bought two more . The fit is outstanding and I have never felt a finer material in a dress shirt - it is soft yet sturdy and always appears pressed . The iron free is for real . I hate ironing and will pay the extra 20 dollars per shirt to never have to dry clean or iron again . I will never buy another shirt and I almost want to throw away my non-iron free dress shirts . I highly recommend this shirt . You will enjoy it and probably buy more of them .
 These dress shirts are the best ! Wrinkle-Free , Breathable , Durable Material , Plus lots of styles , sizes and color options . Compare side-by-side to other dress shirts and you 'll see and feel the difference .
 NICE ! Did n't expect to like the hat as much as I did . The quality was fair for the price I paid .
 The hat feels nice , but is smaler than I thought . Nonetheless , it works . Also , it has to be dry cleaned , which is a bummer .
 Got this during a Friday sale , and have n't regretted it . The hat is warm , comfortable , and is a subtly more stylish than the poly/wool blends you buy at twice the price in a mall.I have n't washed it yet , or dealt with any piling/longevity issues , but hopefully this hat will last at least till next winter .
 Very high quality . Several pairs have consistent fit . Have bought and worn these 517 boot cut jeans for several years .
 My husband LOVES these jeans . They are a GREAT FIT , especially in the seat . The legs are n't too wide in the thighs and the bootcut bottom make a terrific silhouette . I like how he looks in them and he says they are REALLY COMFORTABLE . They look best in the darker color and are a good pair of `` dress jeans '' as well as versatile . We are ordering more . Ladies , get him these jeans !
 I 've worn Levi 's for over 50 years . From the days when you had to roll up the cuffs because they only had one length to super bells in the 70 's and now my favorite 517 's . They are always true to size and the workmanship is always excellent . The service at Amazon is always great too . What more can I say , I am one satisfied customer .
 These boot cut Levis have always been my favorite jeans . I had not had any in a while , so when my order arrived I immediately tried them on . I forgot how well they fit , and they are really stylish . Awesome . Will be ordering more .
 Authentic , just as described . Fast delivery . I am very satisfied with purchase . Smooth , one stop purchase . Husband will be very happy on Christmas day ! Thank you .
 My grandson loves these jeans , since he 's rather tall we were glad to find Levi 's makes great jeans in his size . Strange as it may seem , many brands of jeans do not come in a 34in length .

 I 've been wearing these for years.They do tend to fade easily so wash them inside out and use a detergent product for black fabrics .
 I bought these as a gift for a friend who has worn this style for years . Good quality , good fit , good style .
 Great jeans.Classical style.Low price.Wearing only jeans , levis always loved.Happy New Year!Amazon Forever!I love it .
 This hard to find style arrived on time . These classic jeans fit just the way they should . Going back for more colors .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Slim Fit Jean is leg looks like so long , . . but lap so tight but leg looks like so long . .
 My husband like it . . although I have to cut the length a little bit . . He said he may buy more in the future . . Hopefully they have shorter length then .
 They are Levis what more needs to be said ? Theyre the only jeans im buying from now on . They fit great and last 2-5 times longer than any other jeans ive bought .
 I use to wear the Levis low boot cut , but they discontinue to sell the color I want . After I give this one a try , I like it so much .
 If you know your size they fit . I do n't understand the reviews that say the sizes are wrong . Will buy again .

 Levis 517 Boot Cut Jeans are just as advertized . Good fit and a perfect boot cut . I highly recommend them for anyone who needs boot cut jeans .
 It 's a very good pant for my husband . Nothing too special or fancy ; he is very satisfied because he got what he expected
 execelente producto muy buena calidad , el pantalon vino en un excelente empaque y llego super rapido deverdad no tengo quejas lo recomiendo
 He looks hot in them , thanks ! What more can I say ? They did n't stay on for very long ... ca n't share any more details .
 I was somewhat hesitant to order Levi 's online but I could n't be happier with this order ! The jeans are exactly as described and fit perfectly . They are genuine Levi 's and are of the highest quality - not seconds . I ca n't recommend this seller highly enough .
 They 're good sellers and the product is very good , I like so much this jean . Ellos son muy buenos vendedores , el producto llego rapido a mis manos y era el esperado , los recomiendo ampliamente .
 I wear Levi jeans every day . Levi 's are the only jeans I will wear.I have worn Levi jeans for the past twenty -LRB- 20 -RRB- years ... or longer.Levi jeans are great ... in fact , i 'm wearin 'em right now ...
 The jeans were a Christmas gift and a style regularly worn by the recipient . They were a perfect fit . They are hard to find locally so we ordered from the Internet . The red tag on the back pocket did not say `` Levis '' and I have never seen this before . Is it significant ?
 Wow . These are great blue jeans , and they come in 38 long which is what he wears . HE wanted the boot cut , and a 34 waist was large enough . Usually he wears a 36 , , but I ordered 34 and they fit just right . Great looking , great price .
 I bought two pairs in two orders - both were perfect - exactly as I expected . On time . Good buy at a decent price .
 These jeans are tough but good looking and fit well . Amazon 's price is great , they are a good value for the money , and we always get prompt delivery and easy return if size is not right .
 the product is excellente , but needs to be taggedcorrectly , I order 34x30 tag say so , but real size was36x32 try buying them from differet source , and same thing never can get athe right size until i took a mesuring tape to the store and mesure before buing them !!
 I love those Jeans . . nice shape and denim . I ordered different colors from this pant and I love them all . it is comfortable , and have a nice leg openning that falls around the boot .
 I have been wearing 517 's for as long as I can remember . They fit perfectly and have remained unchanged for years .

 It 's very good ! 100 % cottonThe higher rise sits comfortably at the waist.A fit you want from a brand you trustFit width & length ; !
 non common size request was delivered promply before Christmas . My son was very happy with the fit and color .
 Great product ... my dad was very pleased . He had not been able to find the 517 .
 These were a birthday gift for my son and I had them sent directly to him at college . He loved them and they fit great ! Good quality for the price . He liked the fit of the boot cut .
 These are great jeans for us gals , too , especially if you like to wear a true black color . I dress them up with a feminine camisole and heels , and have got many compliments on them .
 Exactly what my hubby wants . It 's difficult to find his size in our local stores . Very happy Amazon now has Levi 's in his size .
 I love my new bootcuts . I received them quickly , They fit perfectly . Thank you .
 I 've grown frustrated by the lack of good quality/reasonably priced jeans in the market today . At some point , the Levis brand started to suffer in terms of quality/value for the dollar . Do n't remember exactly when that happened , but I started to buy my jeans from Banana Republic . Over time , they stopped making the style I grew to rely on . This created a 7-10 stretch where I could n't seem to find a good pair of jeans . Most recently , I purchased a pair of Lucky jeans - ridiculously over priced . When those began to fail , I tried Levis again and bought these . For a third of the price of Lucky Jeans , these Levis boot-cut jeans are really nice . They have a really substantial feel/weight to them and I could n't be happier with the purchase . I was so pleased , I ended up buying a second pair .
 Finally figured out what cut and size I like , but the only place I can find them is the internet . Great pants .
 These were ordered off Amazon when I could not find them locally . I found the pants and they are describer perfectly and fit exactly as I had wanted them to . I will buy more in the future because they were perfect .
 Completamente satisfecha con el producto , exactamente igual a lo que ofrecieron . LLego en el tiempo estimado que prometieron . Ninguna queja , volveria a comprar de nuevo .
 The Levi jeans were just like I expected . The fit was perfect and received them in just a few days . Thanks !!
 The quality of the denim is lighter , so the good fit disappears by the end of the day . Otherwise , I like 'em !
 Hubby dearest was so happy to find boot cut Levi jeans at Amazon as it seems most stores have quit carrying this style of jean . He likes to wear boot cut jeans and Levi jeans are his favorite brand.No complaints about the fit or wearability either . Ordered two more pairs of jeans today as he 's a happy camper.Recommend .
 Good deal on the jeans and speedy shipping . My first pair of boot cut jeans . My girl friend really likes them on me . I got the dark blue -LRB- rinse -RRB- . Fit good and comfortable .
 My skinny son is 54 years old and will not wear any other jeans - only 517 , boot cut Levi 's so I know what to buy for Christmas and Birthdays . I found a perfect fit for my skinny husband also .
 I ordered these jeansLevi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jeanfor a Christmas gift a short time before Christmas . I knew the size . I was somewhat concerned that I would not get them on time for Christmas The package came just before Christmas , and the jeans were exactly as pictured , nicely packaged -LRB- each pair separately enclosed in plastic bag -RRB- , the right size and color . I was very pleased , as was the recipient of the gift !
 Ordered these for my boyfriend , they run extremely small , he regularly wears a 32/34 had to send back and get a 36/34 . Other than that they 're great jeans .
 Finally a pair of Levi 's not only affordable , but a pair that is the real deal . . not seconds or blemished . . but cut perfectly . . The best I have bought in years . . Thanks . . and `` I 'll be back for more ''
 They fit just perfectly and I am very happy to not only get the bestdeal around but beat the sales tax . Good old Levi 's rigid , bootcut jeans have been my all-time favorite jeans my whole life , andI just turned 60 . Got 'em within a week , free shipping faster thanexpected , so that was cool , too . Amazon rules !
 The pants are great . I can not seem to find them in stores like Kohls or Target where I usually shop . I 'm not skinny as far as a skinny person goes but I have thinner legs than a lot of guys . These seem to be not as loose in the butt and thighs . I usually get the 505 's but they are cut a little bigger assuming tree trunk size legs . I have runners legs and these work . If you have big footballer legs , forget about it .
 Finally jeans that fit like the old Levis , these are the old quality heavy denim stuff not that wimpy pre-wash thin as paper junk denim . I would highly recommend these jeans to anyone who 's familiar with real Levis .
 Very easy shopping . I 'm familiar with the pants so it 's just a matter of price and convenience.Sitting at the desk for a few second beats driving to the store , finding out they do n't have the 517 in my size and driving back home . I 've always had trouble just finding the 517 at stores and shopping online sure makes things easier . The pants themselves are everything they 've always been , good fitting and tough.It 's nice to add the stonewash to my collection of darker denim so I do n't look the same every day.I was upprised how fast they came and that 's a big plus too .
 These jeans fit to size perfectly -LRB- for me -RRB- , are comfortable to wear , and have adequate material to reach a guy 's waist ... not hip-huggers . I 'll buy more of these ! Not a deal-breaker by any means but I would prefer them to not have the size label outside ... it seems Levi 's always does this .
 Amazon did not mentioned in the description that this pair of jeans is a Shrink-to-Fit fabric . No question on the quality . . it 's still an amazing jeans , the great Levi 's jeans , never goes out of style ... Take 31 '' waistline x 30 '' inseam if your size is 30 x 30 .
 Levi 's are always the best jeans around . Levi 's Boot Cut are the only kind my husband will wear . Always a good fit .
 Good quality but I wish I had done more research on the colors . Ordered rigid because of the look online however the denim itself is rigid .
 Yes , these Levi 's are everything I had hoped they would be and More . Perfect fit , and I 'm very pleased tofinally have a BLACK pair ! Amazon 's got another winner !
 My wife thinks it 's funny that I rate my jeans with numbers , but , as a former 505 's man , I now prefer the 517 's 'cause ride my horses more and were my boots more ... plus , they just , plain feel good when they 're on me ...
 Who does n't love Levis ? These are great ! My son was happy on Christmas day and so were we . Happy Holidays !
 It is great to find the exact size , color , and fit you want in a Levi 's jean , and also get it on time .
 Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean , Medium Stonewash , 38x29They fit perfectly . Will probably order more in a couple months .
 Needed a size that few brick & mortar stores keep in stock . Amazon had style I wanted in the size that I wanted at a good price !
 These blue jeans where a great color and a perfect fit . Glad I ordered them . They were a present for my son
 My husband has been wearing Levi 's since he was a teenager . They are the most durable jeans and he loves the boot cut .
 i got two pairs for my husband . levis are the only thing that fit him right . They make him look like he has a butt !
 I like this product because it fits very well and is comfortable . I recommend it to others . Good for those who like to wear boots .
 Finally found levis that were the correct size , if they are still available I will order more in the future
 Great pants . I wish there was a size 33 by 35 . I always have a hard time with pants size . I can get a length 34 , which shrink after a wash or a 36 that drags because there too long . But there is no length 35 in pants , so I do n't have much of choice .
 Excellent product the product I come very well and it is what was waiting of , I come in time , good
 I bought they for my boyfriend who had lost a bit of weight and all his pants were falling down , but these fit and stay up -LRB- Thank God -RRB-
 My husband loves the fit and the price.Great deal.You can dress them up or down!Look no further.Great looking jean , for the price .
 Bought these jeans for my husband . They fit very well and look nice . The shipment arrived on time . I was happy with my purchase .
 Great black on black bootcut jeans . They have even gone back to adding two additional belt loops a feature that went away several years ago .
 Fits well , my husband loves them , quality control met , consistent sizing , and look good on . Will order more as needed
 My son wears a 36 Waist x 36 lenght which is very hard to find . The Levi 's Men 's 517 are about the only jeans he likes and these fit him perfectly . They were shipped very quickly and the price was excellent . They were a birthday gift and he loves them .
 The jeans were pre washed and fit just like I wanted . They were really softer than I expected . I would buy this product again .
 I was so happy with the quality and fit ; I ordered 3 more pairs ! I will be good on jeans for awhile . The price was good too .
 Great quality and a lower price , for me is like a tailored jean , I 'm happy with this product . No more to say thanks to all
 After numerous failed attempts at the 527 's on amazon I finally got a clue and got these jeans . They are PERFECT ... great fit ... weight ... etc. ... just like the jeans I wore in high school 20 years ago ... . I 'm already thinking about a second pair . The light rancher is the perfect color ... . As for the 527 's MADE IN BANGLADESH ... amazing they could ever bear the levis name ... perhaps they were counterfeit . Thanks amazon for my true and needed exchange . The original pair of jeans I ordered ... yes the 527 ... was complete trash . These 517 's are real jeans for real cowboys ... and I 'm not one ... but I do wear a ton of boots ...
 Exellent product
 Sent me what I wanted . 15 more 12 more 11 more 9 more 7 more 5 more 3 more done
 This is a very good price for this product , it 's the second one I 've ordered for my son .
 If you have a problem with jeans bagging in the rear , then these jeans are for you ! They are a great fit and very comfortable ! My husband loves them !
 Well , its a good jean , everybody know the levi 's quality , the item arive in perfect conditions . . so nothing more to say . .
 Perfect fit , every time . 517 's are difficult for me to find locally , but buying on line thru Amazon is best for me .
 These are like they used to make them ! More belt loops , great fabric - love them ! Ca n't wait to order more of these !
 I was having a really hard time finding the boot cut Levis - no one seems to carry them anymore . These are just what I wanted . They look and fit good .
 Bought these for my husband and they fit true to size , maybe a little bit long but not so much that he wo n't wear them . He love them , they look good so I love them ! Great Pants !
 I ordered these jeans for my 16yo son & he really liked them . The only thing he would have preferred was a lower rise , but he 's wearing them without complaints . : -RRB-
 I bought 2 of these and man they are nice . I 'll admit the guy wearing the jean in the picture sold me . Like I went and look for all the style of Levi 's , and these attracted me the most . Although I would n't tuck in my shirt like that . But they sure look good with some chucks and or casual boots and a dress shirt , with a silver wrist watch , and a pair of shades . They are heavy , and for me kinda tight even though jean of a different brand and style with the same size , fit me perfectly . I do n't know I guess it the way they are made . But for the look , I 'll take the pain any day , yes these jean are so tight mostly in my thigh area and waist , that I do get a little discomfort pain in my lower back . I guess it the way they are design and the heaviness of the jean . Of course I am in the process of getting in shape again . So with time , these will be perfect . I do like to sag a little , but as of right now I ca n't with these . Until I lose some of that belly fat I accumulated over the years .
 These are the jeans I always buy , they are a great comfortable fit . It is also great that Amazon stocks the size I need , it 's impossible to get from the shops .
 his pants in overall line is still very good , sturdy , feels soft to the touch on the skin , the profile legendary cutting adds a touch of elegance , and even after several washings the fabric remains the same and does not shrink , the only thing I did not like the pants is that they have deteriorated the quality of the clips and metal buttons , formerly of copper and bronze , and now this are of aluminum and does not look good , however I recommend buying them are very good at the price .
 These came a little long , maybe an inch or two . Seeing as many others have noticed this is a problem with this fit , I suggest going one inseam size lower . I ordered a 30 '' and they fit more like a 31-32 '' . Other than the sizing , they are great jeans , and still look great on me . The boot cut allows the extra length to bunch up a little around the shoes , so you do n't really notice it . It actually looks good.I wish they sold these in a low rise version , as I do n't like hiking them up to where you might put dress pants or khakis . They stopped selling the 517 in a low rise though , so I 'm happy to wear them as is , great fit .
 I have always appreciated the fit and quality of Levi jeans . The boot cut has a closer fit around the knee with comfortable room in the hips and waist . What Levi Strauss needs to understand is that there is a huge population of men out there that has a 31 inch inseam . Men between 5 ' 9 &#34; and 6 ' fall into this size range . My growth did not stop at 30 &#34; inseam , and did not make it to 32 &#34; . So I either buy high water jeans that show my socks , or I let the cuffs drag the floor which signicantly reduces the life of the jeans . I liked the fit enough that I spent an additional $ 10 to get them hemmed to 31 .
 product arrived as expected on time , the product was as expected and the quality was as you 'd expect to find in a brick & mortar store .
 Great fitting . I usually buy the 527 style but they did n't have black in that style . Ordered a 517 instead and love the fitting .
 The fit and look are great and I saved a few dollars . Will purchase more when the price is right
 love this jeans , the fabric is really good and the cut is impecable . it is original and the communication was really easy , i recieved really fast .
 These are the first jeans in a while that actually fit my waist size , inseam and the leg openings are perfect .
 These jeans fit well but the denim seems less hefty than the denim of the same 517s from 5 years ago .
 I received my pants very quickly . I was concerned that my size would be too short for boots . I was pleasantly surprised that the designer was thoughtful about the shape and length for this item &#34; after &#34; several washings . Pants are about 1/2 inch longer than the average pants which make them perfect for cowboy boots . Pants are also very comfortable . JCD
 Noticed that they even have an extra pair of belt loops compared to my previous order . They are sturdy & dependable .
 The jeans were great ! The price was right , they were delivered in a timely fashion , and I lost a few lbs to get in them and I look good . lol . I recommend this company .
 These are the only jeans my son likes . He is tall and I have trouble finding his size in local stores and I could not find a better price .
 The jean came very quickly . They were the proper color , size , and cut . The packaging was excellent , and so was the quality of the jeans .
 Perfect price and fit for my husband . I would recommend this jean to any &#34; baby boomer &#34; who loves boot cut jeans.The jean has not changed at all good quality material and the right color . Thank you .
 This pair of Levi 's fits perfectly and the indigo color is the same as the Levi 's I wore back in the day !
 I gave these Jeans to my daughter 's friend for Christmas and he really likes them.He is real thin and wears motorcycle boots.He likes how they fit and loves the boot cut.He especially likes the rugged material .
 Nice one . . Boot Cut with nice fit.Ordered the Jeans with 29L but got it 3inch longer . So I had to do alteration , usually I order my pants with 29L and it fits perfect on me .
 Levis 517 's fit me better than any other jeans that I 've bought . Gon na stick with them . I wear a 38 waist , 36 inseam . Have bought several pair over the past six months from various places and they all fit the same . Good quality control !
 BASTANTE BIEN . BUENA CALIDAD DEL PANTALON . ME QUEDO MUY BIEN . TANTO EL LARGO COMO EN CINTURA . EXCELENTE COMPRA A UDS . GRACIAS .
 The jeans are a good deep color . Wish they were n't quite as thin as jean material seems to be getting , but seems they are all like that now . Overall a good pair of jeans.These are hard to find in 36x36 , so I 'm glad Amazon carries them .
 Perfect fit right out of the box . Started wearing immediately , stitches , pockets , zipper perfectly in place . Survived several washes good as new .
 Good price , perfect quality . Very good model for young and old-aged people . Gorgeous color . Classic zipper . I 'm satisfied ! I recommend to buy it .
 These jeans fit me very well and look good . One thing I noticed however is that the denim has a more coarse feeling compared to other Levi 's jeans . I would buy these again .
 IL TELL YOU I HAVE BEEN WEARING LEVI 'S FOR YEARS ON END AND THE BEST DEAL I GOT ON THESE GREAT JEANS WAS FROM MY FAVORITE STORE AMAZON
 Fit well at the waist and look good . Last a lot longer than most most jeans and seem to get more and more comfortable the more you wear them .
 These are great jeans , they do tend to run a little big , both on length and waist . The color was a lot more bluer then it looks in the picture , so be weary of that it . It was too country , and I needed more rock and roll , if you know what I mean.Pros
 I was a bit concerned about this purchase . My husband likes the boot cut style and that was an excellent choice for my purchase . I have zero compliants other then I wish I 'd bought more !
 they were exactly what we were looking for . the orginal 517 , these are my hubby 's most favoritie , they also hold up better than the other styles seem to
 Will have to wash several times for them to fit . I buy this size all the time from other retailers and they are n't this big . Like the color and the style . They just run big I guess . Mainly in the length . Would buy again , just a smaller size .
 The fit is nice , the color is holding up through the wash . I am glad they have different sizes then the stores . Very hard to find 33 x 36 !
 I like the way these jeans fit.The are also comfortable.The ones I have purchased previously have been durable .
 d e m a r a v i l l a e s t e m o d e l o muy bueno
 i traveled 80 miles one day looking for the jeans i like with no luck , it did make for a nice bike ride though ! then i went online looking and i found what i was looking for at amozon these jeans are hard to get in my hometown!Levi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jean
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut JeansWhat a nice pair of rugged jeans . And I got them so FAST !! Thanks again.Roxann Hill
 Good product , on time and as shown in Amazon.But ... years ago , ordering the same # jean and the same size always brought the exact same fit and look . Lately , the same length , for instance , some times is a bit too long -LRB- can be fixed -RRB- or a bit too short -LRB- bad news -RRB- . The price to be paid for savings by manufacturing offshore . Lets see if with the crisis we return to the memorable `` MADE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ''
 What can I say ? They are Levis . Perfect fit , excellent quality , and the most impressive thing was the price . Unbelievable !
 a la medida , tabla de medidas excelente ...
 The only problem was I had was that I had to have them hemmed 2 &#34; so as not to walk on the cuff . I would have ordered them shorter but they were not offered in the waist size I needed . The waist fit perfect and having them hemmed was not that big of a deal . It coast me $ 12.00 to have them hemmed .
 These jeans come washed so they are soft , supple and ready to wear . They are pre-shrunk so order the size you wear . I choose boot-cut jeans because I wear 12 '' - shaft western boots . Levies are the only jeans I wear because they fit well , look good , and get better with age .
 These jeans are perfect for the guy who wants to wear boots and not look like a geek or a thug . Just the right combination of loose and fitted .
 This is my first pair of Levi 517 's and I have to say I am very impressed . They sit on my natural waist -LRB- not low-rise like the 527 's -RRB- , and are fitted in the seat and thigh , and then flare out below the knee to fall on the boot . I 'm 6 ' 3 '' 190lbs and have a 36 waist and 34 inseam and it fit perfectly . Hard to find jeans these days that sit on the waist ... I 'm not a fan of the low-rise look or feel , so these jeans were a great find .
 Came to Amazon to order these jeans for my husband since no one ever has his size , 36x36 . I was pleasantly surprised because I did order two of these in different colors , Rancher Light and Rinse , both of which were the perfect colors . Perfect light colored jean and perfect dark colored jean . My husband and I are very hard to fit in jeans and tops so when something works we often get multiples , the problem however is that sometimes we buy the exact same thing in a different color and they fit totally different . Not these ! These jeans were great and the same fit ! Some people might not be able to appreciate that as much as I , but I was very grateful . It was a risk I had to take since his size is so common , but with free returns I had to take advantage . The boot leg is also very subtle but incredibly flattering . He does wear boots but of course they are n't necessary . I would say they are very true to size and great quality . They are currently his `` good jeans '' ... . that is until he `` accidentally '' wears them to go work in the garage . But when that happens , because it will , I will be back to purchase more ! By the way he is just over 6 ' 3 '' about 230-240lbs .
 I love these jeans . For me they are perfect . Long enough to wear with or without boots and the fit is not too tight . How can you go wrong with Levi 's ?
 I got what I ordered promptly . I wish I had ordered a different color but -- my bad . No complaints . What else can I say ?
 The jeans was just perfect , the material , size and colour , nothing to complain about , and great timing too.They fit really well , and amazon 's size chart was very helpfull .
 Style & size stayed true since the last time I bought a pair , after gettingLevi 's Men 's 527 Low Rise Boot Cut Jeanthat are nothing like they used to be that 's all a shopper can ask .
 Levi 's 517 Boot Cut . Black 42 waist / 30 length . If you are short , stocky and have a big butt . These pants are perfect . They wo n't bunch up at your fat knees and they will last a long time before the zipper explodes . I suggest you buy the next size up because they will shrink after 6 months of washing , drying and severe stretching in the seat area . Great pants .
 MY FAVORITE JEANS FOR 25 YEARS . I HAVE WORN MAINLY 501 MODEL , SO I READ MANY REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING THESE 517 JEANS.AFTER THINKING FOR A LONG TIME I DECIDED TO BUY ONE SIZE BIGGER THAN USUAL . IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE.THEY ARE JUST FINE , BLACK COLOR AND ZIPPER FLY WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DETAIL FOR ME !
 My husband 's body type includes slight pot belly and skinny hips and thighs . Almost impossible to find pants that fit well without being either too tight in the belly or looking baggy in the seat and thighs . He used to wear Levi 's Action Jeans which were boot cut jeans with slight stretch in fabric and a slight crease in the legs . These jeans always looked and fit great ; real snappy . Unfortunately they 're no longer available . Then went to wearing David Taylor Flexjeans from Sears which were almost as good . However , he now find that although Sears still sells jeans by this name , they are no longer the same . They are now made in China and are made from a crappy fabric and no longer fit the same . In desperation , he started looking thru available Levis products and found Levi 's 517 . Advertised as slim in seat and thighs . He did not expect much but was pleasantly surprised to find that they are indeed somewhat slim in the seat and thighs , even though the pants he bought had a waist size slightly larger than minimally necessary , thankfully allowing him to breathe . Bottom line was that he was very happy that these pants are not so tight in the waist that its hard to breathe , but still slim enough in the seat and thighs that they do n't look like old man 's jeans . Just wish they had the snappy look of the old Levi 's Action Jeans .
 I bought a pair of these in 29X34 and they are great . Fit perfect , really like the cut , lighter weight material but not too light , should hold up well . Just wish they would reduce the size of the internal tag -- I 've actually had to tuck it back into the pants a few times after putting them on !
 I 've always wanted a ` black 527 ' but found out I could only get that in rigid black.I decided to try 517 n whao I might just decide to continue with 517 even with other colors.Just the perfect fit I love .
 Is exactly what i was looking for . . i being using this model for years , and this pair of pant are excellent
 I am a creature of habit . Being of slim build I have found the 517 Boot cut to be the perfect jean for me . I also know my size so the fit was great as received . This is not always the case when ordering over the Internet . Service was great delivered on time as expected .
 These are the best jeans Levis has to offer in my opinion . They are not light and flimsy like some jeans Levis are making these days . The medium stonewash is a great even color . They do n't look faded on the seat and thighs or dingly and dirty like so many jeans do . These jeans are rugged , comfortable and last a long , long time . On top of that they look great . These are the only jeans I will buy .
 These jeans are everything they say they are . We will definately order these jeans again when the time comes . Thanks !
 100 % recomended , i have no doubt that i am going to buy another , it is really regular fit and boot cut
 This is the only jean my husband wears . He has the hardest time finding 36x29 . This is a perfect fit for him . When he needs more I will return to amazon .
 I finally found a pear of jeans that my wife said they look good on me and after being washed still fits great
 Great fit for my long legs ! Hard to find jeans my size but Levi 's always comes through for me ! a
 My order arrived in a timely fashion , they fit good and look great ... I 'm gon na get a couple more pairs .
 Levi 's 517 ` sThese Levi 's were the perfect fit . I like the fact that they are pre rinsed , which makes the fabric softer .
 Many of us do n't want to wear our Levi 's half way up our bellies . 517s are the best answer for that !
 A well tried and true blue jean that I 've been wearing for decades . The fit , finish , and quality is a good as or better than ever .
 These seemed a bit darker in person than pictured but they were a great pair of jeans for my husband . This is his favorite style of jeans and he needed a new pair of &#34; dressy jeans . &#34; Same great jeans as in the past .
 All the Levi 's I purchased for my 16 year old son were ` made to fit ' ! From the straight to boot cut , they all were a perfect fit for his personal taste . They are well made and very stylish .
 Great jeans , great price , speedy delivery as promised ! Will definitely be ordering them again since my son is so tall and slim and this is one of the only places I can find his size .
 Great basic jeans in hard to find sizes . Not much to say otherwise . They have washed up well and held up well for my long and lanky teen .
 Jeans are a little tight in the thighs for my husband . It did n't come with packing slip so I 'm hoping I can return them !
 I like this style and they are getting very hard to find . The price here was the best I found , got in a timely manner . I 'm happy with my purchase .
 Purchased these jeans for my husband . They have a nice fit and look very good on . No baggy butt like the relaxed fit jeans .
 I usually have a hard time finding good bootcut jeans with the right fit in the retail stores . If the color/wash/fabric is right , the size isnt . If the size is right , the fit is too loose at the seat and thighs . Now that my favorite pair of jeans is past its prime , I started looking for a new pair to replace it . After hunting all stores in and around my area and trying all available bootcuts in my size , I was very disappointed . That is , until I found a pair of Levi 's 517 Blue Ox in the local Macy 's store . This was the first bootcut I found in the last 3 years that fit me perfectly . Since I already had a pair of jeans that was of a very similar color , I came online and started looking for the correct color in that fit . Unfortunately , it wasnt that easy finding one online . Kohls , Dillards and others had Levi 's 517s , but they werent the same ones I saw in the store . Apart from Macys and Amazon , no other site -LRB- including Levi 's own site -RRB- had the same fit in Rancher Light color I was looking for . I could have ordered at Macys website , but my past experience with Amazon was stellar and so it my first choice . Even then I was a little skeptical if the photos were close to how the jeans looked in reality . Since amazon had a free returns on this one , I went ahead with the order . The product , as always with Amazon , came 6 days ahead of their estimated delivery date . The jeans is , in fact , very close to the pictures on the website and the fit is PERFECT !! Thanks to Levi 's for the perfect color and fit and KUDOS to amazon for the perfect shopping experience !
 Finally Levi went back to 7 belt loops instead of the five . Makes a big difference for those of us that work for a living .
 I bought the 517 as I prefer this cut to any other one of the Levi 's catalog , I place it even above the so famous 501 . I 'm fully satisfied
 I love these jeans . The wash and fit are great . That being said , they did arrive with a hole in the seat and the seam is a little crooked on the inside left leg . I really do n't care though because they fit so good .
 It is hard to find male , black , slim fit , boot cut jeans . Believe me I searched many places both on-line and local retail outlets . Finally I found these on Amazon and they were just right . Great fit , looks good , and the price was reasonable . I highly recommend them .
 We will take these to alterations but they were about 5 inches too long . Otherwise they are very nice .
 True to size , did n't shrink , and minimal wrinkling . Love the variety of sizing - son is tall and thin , and hard to fit , but Levis 517 made it happen !
 I ordered these jeans an exrta size longer becaause I wanted a high cuff . Got exactally that . Perfect !!! Now I 'm looking for a white pair
 Well , they 're Levi 's . There you go . Best jeans on the market . Last forever and fit great . The black does fade to gray quicker than I would like , but that 's probably because I wear only black , all the time . So ...
 I have worn Levi jenas for the last 16years , i am relatively tall guy and seldom get my size in the store , Amazon provides me my size and then quality as well .
 Purchased two pairs of Levi 's Boot Cut Jeans for my husband , the Jeans are very hard to find in the stores . Since my husband is tall , it is hard to find 36x36 .
 These pants are very well put together and I am a big fan of Levi 's pants durability which is what prompted me to purchase these .
 I am a woman but men 's jeans fit me better . These are very comfortable . My jeans do NOT get hung up on my boots as they do with jeans that are not boot cut .

 Quality jeans , but not made in the USA.Arrived quickly and each pair were individually bagged in plastic.Good fit , for me .
 My body was made for Levi 's brand jeans , and I 'd worn through a couple of pairs . I bought duplicate black 517s - soft but not washed out , dark , with a predictable fit . They are my new favorites . The process went smoothly . Who knew I 'd be buying clothes online ?
 I ordered these for Christmas for my 6 ' 2 '' grandson who had grown out of all his pants after checking stores and finding his size is almost impossible to find . They were perfect and he loved them .
 The Levi 's 517 Boot Cut were purchused as a replacement of the wrong ones bought at a local store , These ordered & delivered ; I was told fit greatly before & after ; washThe price for my buying , totaled out a nuff less even with shipping to come fromamazon , rather than a store , even on sale after my tax & shipping ; -LRB- as a late gift -RRB- Theonly guestion I got was about , they did not have the Levi 's cardboard shelf tagswe see on Jean 's in store .
 I love my levis . I was unaware they came in black . I bought a blue pair and black pair , Ilove them
 Just as described ! Fit & look exactly what he needed and wanted . And he said I could n't find this product ... LOLThanks !!! The Wife wrote the review ...
 These jeans fit great . The boot cut gives a good look without being sloppy . My husband looks hot in them .
 Got these as a gift for my brother , and they are the true blue classic with a great slim shape . Perfect `` date night '' jeans .
 These are the only jeans my husband will wear and we could not find them ANYWHERE . When i found them here i was happily suprised with the discount price and they look great . Would buy again from this seller .
 Excellent transaction on hard to find size and style Levi Jeans.Reasonable price and quick shipping.I 'm very pleased with this purchase !
 jeans were shipped quick , arrived in good shape the medium stonewash has that worn look most people want , I am pleased with the purchase .
 After spending a lot of money at Doodlebops live in September , my son really wanted to be Moe Doodle for Halloween . Of course , they only sell it online . Although the price is not cheap , I find the costume to be worth it . The wig is surprisingly good . It fits perfectly on my child 's head , which he surprisingly kept on the entire Halloween night . There was no incident of the wig falling off.My only gripe is the gloves . It 's very oversized compared to the rest of the costume . My son wanted to wear it even though he had a hard time holding his bag of treats.I give this product 4 stars , minus 1 for the oversized gloves .
 I own about seven of these!Great all weather hats , very cool in the summer , and I like the fact that they can be washed on a gentle cycle .

 This is a great fit for a silk shirt . I thought it would not be a close fit being silk , but I was wrong . This item fits snug and looks great on . Both alone and layered . I would recommend this shirt to people that like the look of a tight tank .
 I love my Silk Tank Tops . I wear them to work under my dress shirts and the feel is very nice . Much more comfie than the Hanes cotton tanks . The quality is very good for the price . The initial fit was just a tad snug , but stretched out just a bit after a couple of washes/wears and is very comfortable now . I tried wearing one on a hike but i find the coolmax type active wear handles sweating much better than silk . But for casual wear , or sleeping at night I love them .
 I never tried or even heard of silk tank tops , but now I will never go back . It 's a great under shirt/workout shirt . I like the way it feels like im wearing nothing at all .
 I bought this top for my 18 year old son -- thought it looked comfortable to wear under shirts etc. . It is . He likes wearing it , but he says he would never wear it alone . It is a wee bit too ` feminine ' to wear on top . Would I buy another one ? I do n't know . I think for him , the basic cotton tank tops are more versatile .

 My husband bought one of these shirts last year to try it out . I was very skeptical of the `` no ironing '' claim . I could n't believe my eyes when I took it out of the dryer the first time -- not a wrinkle to be seen . The material is truly miraculous . We both love this product and plan to buy more . Thank you , Jos. Banks !
 I own three of these shirts and they are great . I get my shirts cleaned and pressed and here is an example of what great shirts they are
 I own two of these Traveler non-wrinkle shirts and they are absolutely the best shirts I have ever owned . They are of high quality material and the size I bought was right on the money . The colors offered are very versatile with just about anything a person would own and can be worn formally or casually . I am going to stick with buying more of these shirts .
 I bought 2 to begin with and now own seven and I ca n't see myself buying other dress shirts
 I received this shirt as a gift over Christmas . Since then I have bought two more . The fit is outstanding and I have never felt a finer material in a dress shirt - it is soft yet sturdy and always appears pressed . The iron free is for real . I hate ironing and will pay the extra 20 dollars per shirt to never have to dry clean or iron again . I will never buy another shirt and I almost want to throw away my non-iron free dress shirts . I highly recommend this shirt . You will enjoy it and probably buy more of them .
 These dress shirts are the best ! Wrinkle-Free , Breathable , Durable Material , Plus lots of styles , sizes and color options . Compare side-by-side to other dress shirts and you 'll see and feel the difference .
 This was the only 0-3 months baby onsie that said `` little brother '' on it . All the others were 6 months or larger . I was very happy to find a baby onsie that the baby could wear right away .
 This was an excellent cover for my Aspire the new Women of Color study bible its a prefect fit on the one that is in Italian leather cover bible not the hardcover

 i got this as a spring jacket it looks real nice and it fits and feels just right .
 Jacket is reasonably priced for a great quality item . My husband was thrilled with it . Also has a lot of handy pockets .
 I have n't worn anything that is made of microfiber but I liked the design of this jacket and decided to give it a try . Well , it is really very good . It keeps me warm during the cold days and it looks fine . Recommended .
 Is perfect for what i need it , the only problem is that i had to ordered L and i needed M , but I will use it anyways , excellent quality and it 's awesome the way it repels the water ... I for shure recommend it .
 Several years ago , my employer gave us Weatherproof jackets very much like this one , embroidered with the company logo as Christmas gifts . I have worn it so much , it is starting to look shopworn.I was very pleased to find that Amazon offers this jacket . the style is very similar to my old one . While the fabric is lightweight , it is very good for cool weather . I guess the micro-weave keeps the wind and cool weather out . I 've worn this jacket in weather from 40 to 65 degrees and have kept comfortable . This is more of a fall and spring jacket than a winter coat.If you 're looking for a warmer , lined jacket , Weatherproof makes ones that Amazon offers as well .
 Reminds me of my -LRB- much more expensive -RRB- ski jacket ! Water proof , wind proof , and stain proof -LRB- a big plus for a coffee addict like me -RRB- . Water and coffee will roll right off the material without soaking in . This is a great light jacket with plenty of pockets . Item I received was identical in color to the one pictured on Amazon . You 'll need to wear layers if it 's cold outside but this will block the wind and rain to keep your layers underneath nice and dry . Wear a thermal or two underneath and you could hike around in this all day . Very pleased with the purchase , the microfiber feel is much softer than similar looking jackets I 've owned in the past made from cotton .
 It is light . looks exactly like the picture to me . The only bad thing about it is the secret pocket is poorly placed .
 This jacket has served me well . For $ 15 -LRB- total $ 20 after s/h -RRB- it 's a great spring jacket . It 's actually higher quality than I expected , with a good number of pockets on the inside . It 's pretty thin , but good enough to keep me warm in 50 + weather -LRB- Fahrenheit -RRB- . I do n't think I 've tried it out in rain , although with water hitting it once or twice -LRB- maybe rain , ca n't recall ? -RRB- it held up ok . I doubt it can be too water-proof in light of the thin material . Nonetheless , this serves my purposes .
 I was looking for something a bit heavier then a windbreaker , but lighter then most of my coats . This fits the bill perfectly.The material is light enough that I can comfortably wear it in 50 or 60 degree weather , but heavy enough that it gives protection against the wind and rain.The only two drawbacks for me were that it lacks a hood -LRB- useful for the rain -RRB- and it is open bottom -LRB- that is , there is no drawstring or other way to tighten up the base -RRB- which allows a breeze to come in . As long as you 're aware of those drawbacks before buying it , it 's an excellent jacket for the price !
 My husband loves this jacket . It does not have the texture one usually associates with a rain jacket , so it can be worn in both rainy and not rainy weather .
 This is a great vest . I ordered a medium , I am a 38 &#34; in chest , yet the medium was too big for me really -LRB- if you want a close to the body fit -RRB- . I will get this vest again in a smaller size and other color .
 This vest is of decent quality , not quite as good as the previous Columbia fleece vest as it is thinner . The color is more of a faded black or dark grey than black . I think I would have been disappointed if I had paid full price but for $ 25 it is worth it . I would buy it again .
 everything in order , very good quality product , service stock.came charging according to the agreement.excellent , recommended to all users .
 I ordered this as something to layer underneath my work jackets . It fits well , so it should be comfortable when layering . Even if this just lasts through this winter , it was a great deal at this price.I have a lot of Colombia jackets -LRB- fleece , rain shell , omni-heat jacket , etc. -RRB- , and I have never been disappointed .
 This vest is just right when a jacket is too much , or when a less bulky additional layer is needed . It is true to size and is well constructed . I plan to add other colors to my collection .
 Quality is good , not as thin as some said . Fit is small than usual . I wear a medium usually but was glad I got a small .
 The vest is comfortable and is made well . The size is my only reason for giving 4 stars . The vest runs on the large side . If you want a tighter fit you will have to order at least one size smaller than what you normally wear . It would be better with an elastic draw string too .
 Bought this for my son in college after he asked for a black fleece vest for his birthday ... He thought it was perfect .
 Got my Columbia Cathedral Vest yesterday . Fits great and does it 's job perfectly.Paid 36 $ for it and its worth the money . It 's also much cheaper than similar products from North Face.Great for a run !
 Very nicely made Vest.Columbia has great products.Like the texture of the material.Pictures on amazon page could be better .
 The fit is not too loose and the cypress color is a gray-green cross . Nice neutral color for men . This was purchased for use in winter time , but it 's rather thin to wear alone . It 's better suited for use in spring-time or under a jacket since it 's not bulky .
 Great ! The fabric felt very gentle , and it 's very light . My husband love it very much . I also introduced it to our friends , one of them placed an order , so I bought it again . The size is a little bit bigger .
 The product was made well . It looks good has a lining but I found that it was not as warm as a similar product purchased over 10 years ago . I did not return it as when the weather gets warmer or when I will wear it inside .
 He likes it . A basic black vest . Seems well made unlike some brands whose zippers are not the best quality . If you are not broad shouldered though the sleeve area in the large size is a bit &#34; wingy &#34; looking . My husband is tall but not bulky so it is a little too big in that respect .
 Second of the same type for me . Perfect for cool weather . Yes indeed . comfy warm not restrictive . All one could ask .
 Columbia gear seems to be priced much lower than other companies like Patagonia and North Face but I feel like the quality of Columbia 's clothes stands up.This vest is exceptionally warm and comfortable .
 The most important factors for me when purchasing a vest were warmth and comfort . This vest is just what I wanted in both categories . It gives me just the right amount of warmth when I go for my morning run without getting too hot once I get warmed up . It 's also comfortable and soft . The pockets have zippers so I can put my keys etc in there and do n't have to worry about them falling out . The only fault I can find is the zippers jingle a bit as I move . Overall I 'm happy with my purchase .
 This was a great purchase for my husbands birthday . Very well cut and designed using quality materials that wear well . I purchsed the navy color and it is a very nice shade more of a navy/grey that goes well with everything . My husband wears a size 42 jacket so I purchased the large since the medium I bought him before fit a little too close for his liking , the large is a little roomier . Columbia is always a good product and the price was good too .
 This is a beautifully made vest and my husband loves the color -LRB- bark -RRB- . From another review I was tipped off that the vest runs large , so I got a size smaller than my husband 's usual size -LRB- XL to L -RRB- . It fits perfectly .
 Ca n't beat this vest especially for the price ! I have purchased 3 of them !
 My son was very pleased with this vest . I liked the price for a name like Columbia Sportwear . I also liked how fast it was sent to me .
 The vest is comfortable and roomy , though not the very best of materials .
 This was a gift for someone . From what I saw , he was very pleased with it . The item arrived in a very timely manner .
 Purchased two of these for Christmas gifts . Was very impressed with the quality . Would definitely buy again !
 I bought this for my husband last year , for Christmas . At this point in time , no complaints at all from him . Washes well and wears well , and its light color does n't show white dog hair , which was a must for a new vest !
 Quality is good but I need Longs and they dont seem to have many longs
 Warm and made well and comfortable . Husband wears a large but had to order in medium size . He loves it but beware it runs large . Price was great too !
 Bought this at half the price to replace an old Columbia vest in which the zipper fell apart after a year . Wore it 5 days a week for work so I got my monies worth although I paid full price for that one .
 Columbia Men 's Cathedral Peak VestAmple sizing for stout waste . Soft , good feeling fabric with good zippers and warm comfort.Good color and value for a casual look.It can be worn most of the time for a light jacket or coat . Easy to maintain .
 Like the columbia fleece product they are soft . I got the same product from a discount store and it was cheaper even after tax . I have to rate it as 4 because of the product quality .
 This is my second Columbia vest and I really like them . I would recommend this vest to anyone . I like to wear it to work with my dress shirts and ties . Looks sharp .
 I have received this Vest , It is according the picture and it is beautiful , I like the color and I recommend to the people buy this product .
 This vest is the best value in a fleece vest that I 've found , hands down -- for quality , comfort , durability ... I travel constantly and I like the charcoal color because it shows no lint , hair etc. . I lost one of these and replaced it immediately . It 's perfect for layering in cool or cold weather ... but also for that little extra warmth I need in a refrigerated movie theater . -- When I replaced my lost vest I looked at other brands again and was reminded that this Columbia vest is the best thing out there for the money ... by far .
 Lightweight . I wear it mostly at night in my hammock to keep warm throughout the night . Layers well . Added a drawstring at the waist . Easy to do but would have preferred it was included .
 Although the product is great . It was not the exact color as published . It does not have a different color on the neck
 It was wright for what I was looking for . It arrived in good conditions but the coulor is a bit different that in the picture anyway it fits well , thanks .
 Works for what I wanted . Something to wear while walking in cooler temps , where I did n't want a full coat .
 This product was first class -LRB- not a second -RRB- and was as ordered and on time . Ca n't get any better than that .
 This vest is soft yet rugged , true to size and just right for my son for Christmas .
 It 's hard for me to find some shirt with right size sleeve and collar . But that would be a problem for a vest , :-RRB- . I do n't like the zippers on the pockets , i never put any stuff in the pockets . Overall , this is a good vest for me , I wish it a little bit warmer .
 Columbia sizes are really big so just be a little conservative in ordering for sizes . Buy is for less than 20 bucks for getting value .
 I was satified with the product my only concern is that the color was off black insteadof black .
 One of the better purchases I 've made , in terms of satisfaction and value.The product is well-made and durable , which you come to expect from Columbia . It can be had for a good price and should last for a long time . Fits true to size , zipper works fine , and it does its job
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He finds them to be warm yet keeps his arms free at work . This Columbia vest is very nice and thick . Very nicely made and of good quality .
 Bought this for my husband , and he really liked it . The vest is generously cut and well sewn . It 's also very soft and the color is true and pleasing.Just right for those chilly nights when a long sleeved sweater would be `` too much . ''
 Have several different brands . . this is the best value of all ... fits great quality stitching and best price of all seen
 Extremely pleased with this purchase . After having ordered the wrong color by mistake , i quickly ordered again . Came exactly as described and within given time . No disappointments here !
 The vest is great -- second one I 've purchased ; however , the zipper , as the vest ages , has a tendency to pull apart at the bottom . The reason is the very short insert piece . Increase the depth of the insert and this vest would rate 5 stars . I bought my first vest at Mervins and when they went out of business I never found this make of vest again until I checked Amazon.com -- a great source and great products .
 I bought this vest for a casual look around the office and not at all disappointed . The sizing is about average , the look is great , and as it is Columbia , the material is of good quality . It will keep one warm in the winter months .
 This was a Christmas gift for my husband that he actually loved . Thanks for a great buy . Will be back !
 I 've had this vest for about a month now & I really do enjoy it.I 've had similar vests in the past , but I needed something newer to wear around the office and under my winter coat when a sweater or hoody just does n't work.The vest is very soft & does n't get caught on much . I bought the dark grey hoping that it would `` hide '' my dogs hair unlike the black vest . And it does . I have a beagle , and I can barely notice when -LRB- a few/decent amount -RRB- of his white & black hairs get on it . Some fleece seems to attract dog hair & never let go - this does NOT.The only negative I have about this vest , as others noted , is that there is n't a pull string around the waist . This has n't really bothered me , but I would like to tighten it up just a little bit.I work outdoors so this is perfect for helping me layer up but allowing me something to wear that wo n't bulk up & slow down my arm movement which happens if you wear too many sweaters or hoody 's . I plan on buying another in a few months so I do n't wear this one out too much . Awesome price too . I checked a couple of stores online and no one had the same price as Amazon .
 I just want to say that is the best way to keep you warm , high quality product and very comfortable .
 My experience with this Columbia vest made me feel it was spot on for size . The side pockets a bonus for a mid-layer piece . The vest itself let me wanting a little more . The collar is double the weight of the main body of the vest . It is a nice vest but thin for use as a mid-layer . I myself would have preferred if the body was equal to the collar in weight , but for the price I paid I 'd have to say it matches the quality . I guess I expected a little more from Columbia , as I own other products from them that always went beyond my expectations . Guess I 'll just have to be a little creative in my layering to get the best use out of this purchase . The style and color are nice , but I also got the `` bunching '' effect during active use , maybe better as a low activity use item , walking around town and such . It really comes down to what you 'll be using it for , activity level and quality of other layering items .
 Ordered the Large in Green color and was a great value . Quality was excellent as you would expect from Columbia .
 These vests are well made , stylish and fullfill their purpose exceptionally . They provide a little extra warmth at home when the thermostat is set down low to save energy . But being sleveless they do n't make you sweat . The sizes are exactly as specified . I normally wear large in shirts and jackets , and the large vest fits perfectly .
 Great extra layer for the winter.Very good quality . Generous pockets.Extremely comfortable.Logo over the breast is pleasantly inconspicuous .
 Most of my winter gear is from Columbia and I 've never had any complaints about it . It 's about half the price of a comparable North Face garment and works just as well .
 Like all Columbia products , this item arrived true to fit and size . I purchased this item for my husband and he wears it all the time . It washes well and is very durable . We have had this product for two years and it still looks and feels brand new .
 I bought this to layer under my coat when the weather dips below freezing . It 's comfortable , soft , and keeps me warm . I also like the blue color . Dropped one star because it seems to be made for people with pot bellies . I 'm 6 ' 1 180 and the medium fits perfectly lengthwise and in the shoulder/chest area but there 's a lot of extra fabric in the middle .
 Nice color and Im wanting to buy another vest different color . I highly reccomend to buy , columbia has great cloths .
 I wear this nearly every day in the office to stay warm . It 's fleece is perfect , and I love the freedom to move my arms . Size is perfect . No complaints .
 Great extra layer to add during the winter months for a fair price . Looks great too around the office or at home .
 My son and my husband loved their new vests . They love the feel and fit and the colors . I will have to remember to get them some more .
 Fits great and what a great price -- medium weight - true to size for mens large . Priced locally at $ 65 dollars
 love columbia products , it helps keep my chest warm so I can lower the heat in the house during the daytime .
 This vest is exactly what I wanted , lightweight yet warm , does n't hinder arm and shoulder motion ; very soft comfortable material .
 I chose thie vest because of the brand and color . It is good quality and stylish . Shipping was fast . I 'm happy , happy , happy !
 Fits just right , material is a nice weight . very warm . Columbia products are always nice . ca n't go wrong with this vest .
 Vest is a nice weight , not too heavy or too lightweight . Great over a long sleeve t-shirt or henley . The charcoal color is really nice . It holds up well through repeated washings . He got this vest last year for Christmas and recently lost it but he loves it so much he asked for a replacement . So if your husband is forgetful like mine you might want to get two . : -RRB-
 Absolutely a fine purchase . I really like this vest -- the fit , the breathability , the warmth . Excellent quality . I recommend it highly .
 My wife wanted one for Traveling , got it , Love 's it , She is very Happy and i am very Happy . Thanks
 We are very pleased with the Vest that we purchased and are looking forward to giving it to my Father in Law for the holiday . I am sure he will be happy . Sizing looks accurate as does fabric and style . It will be a great gift for him
 As it usually happens , Columbia makes the best and tis vest is not an exception . comfortable , nice and well made .
 All I wanted was a basic vest for cool summer days . Does the job perfectly . Will not stop the wind or keep you very warm - but if you are a guy needing pockets for your wallet - this works well .
 I have wide shoulders -LRB- 50 Regular suit jacket -RRB- , and the XL fit me perfect . I was especially pleased with the collar - which was shorter when popped than the previous Columbia vest I had owned . My previous fleece vest from Columbia lasted me about 2 years , so I have high hopes for this one as well . Very soft , great fit , extremely comfortable and versatile .
 Purchased this vest as a team vest for our local biathlon team . The fit was slightly large , but that is good for winter wear . The length was just below belt line . This is ideal for keeping the lower back warm while skiing and also shooting . Everyone that got a vest on our team was very pleased with the fit and the look . Great for training and looks good too !
 Dumb me , I ordered the wrong size . No problem with this purchase . It was easy to return and reorder the correct size . Credit came through for this purchase with days of me shipping wrong size back . This firm is `` On he Ball '' when it comes to handling a situation like this .
 While I do n't get too excited by clothing , and this is no exception , I do find this is a well made , comfortably warm vest , that I am glad I purchased .
 I wear this as an insulating layering or by itself over a shirt . It looks much better than my Columbia fleece which does n't have much shape . I like that it is super light and moderately warm .
 I ordered several of these in different colors . The quality is great and the sizing is true . Furthermore , they have come out of the washer & dryer looking like new each and every time . If additional colors become available , I wo n't hesitate to order more .
 Ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas . Beautiful red shade , and fits extremely well . He is very happy and I was pleased that it arrived so quickly and in perfect condition .
 First off - I am very happy with this purchase as it is exactly what I expected . And for the price , it 's hard to complain.The vest fits very nicely , i got the green large . I 'm a male 5 ' 11 '' and about 190 lbs . It fits me very nicely . Sometimes these vests bunch up around the gut looking dumpy but not this one.I have washed it a few times and it seems to be holding its colour , shape and stretch . It blocks the wind nicely and is perfect for cool autumn weather/early winter when it 's not too brutal but a t-shirt just does n't cut it.The collar is one it 's best features - it folds down nicely to keep your neck warm or you can turn it up to avoid the wind . The material is very soft and feels great on your skin.As for complaints , I find that i really miss having a breast pocket and I wish the pocket zippers went up to open as opposed to down.Since neither of these features were advertised , obviously i ca n't complain about their absence - i just prefer them and will be looking for both on my next vest purchase.One thing that I will knock off a star for is the depth of the pockets . They are quite shallow causing things to fall out easily - especially if you are sitting . If you are going to make a jacket with shallow pockets i think the pocket zips should go the other way ... Just make sure you remember to close the zips ! you can fit your entire hand in if you are trying to stay warm , but there is almost no downward angle to make a good pocket for holding your keys , phone or wallet.While we 're on the topic of zippers i will say that the quality of the zips on this jacket is top-notch . it will open or close from almost any angle and i would be very surprised if they stopped working.At $ 20 it 's hard to imagine a better purchase !
 Columbia fleece vests are the best I 've ever owned -LRB- it 's the third Columbia fleece I 've purchased -RRB- . They 're warm and very durable without being too bulky , making for a good fit and a nice appearance .
 My Significant Other needed something easy to get into because of shoulder surgery ... Perfect for him ! The warmth is wonderful ; the sizing worked out great . He did n't have a vest like this , but now he 's talking about getting another one , in another color . Pricing is perfect too . Ca n't think of any negative !
 Definitely get one size smaller than what you normally wear . I almost always wear an XL and when I tried this on it was baggy and roomy and with an item like this you want it to be snugger .
 I bought this for my husband because he likes a fleece vest with a collar . He is very pleased and the vest looks great . The collar is big enough to really keep the wind off your neck .
 Its comfortable , warm , a little short in length but overall a really nice vest for me to wear in all types of weather . If I had to complain about one thing it would be that it is not fleece like I thought it would be so make sure you know what you 're buying . Other then that a nice product though !
 The vest fits well and is well made . If it had a zippered breast pocket it would be ideal and would get 5 stars . I would order it again .
 I got two of these , the blue and the Cattail , which is just brown . They are nice and warm . They look good . They run a little bit big . I got an XL , and I usually wear an XL in everything . I 'm probably right in between a L and an XL . I 'm 6 ' and 240 lbs , if that helps you order yours correctly .
 My son really loves this vest . We ordered two in different colors . It looked very nice on him and he wore it every other day with jeans . A great vest !
 Bought this for my dad for Christmas . He really llikes it . Fits really well and was just as promised and described .
 Perfect fit - this was purchased for an elderly person for indoor wear . It 's not black and it 's not grey - more like graphite . It is very lightweight and keeps him cozy and warm in these cold months .
 We 've been wearing our own Columbia vests for quite some time here in Wisconsin , but it only recently occurred to me that it was just the thing for my 93-year-old dad in Florida , who 's often cold , despite fairly warm temperatures . He loves the vest 's softness and is enjoying having something more youthful and &#34; cool &#34; to wear . I 'm happy to know that it 's easily machine wash and dryable .
 I picked this up to use as a stand-alone or extra layering depending on the temperature . This vest is great - it 's like wearing a soft fleece blanket.It fits easily under all my jackets or sweatshirts . A nice bonus is the zip pockets - they 're great for my phone or warming up my hands very fast .
 I like Columbia garments for myself . So I bought one for My Dad for Christmas . It fits well in the XL and is nicely made.Washable too !!
 Quick service , good price and no complaints after wearing this for a month . Considering ordering another in a different color .
 Great vest for cool sunny days . Vest is a little on the thin side . It looks great and feels great . The only problem occurs is that it lets wind in and out very easily . I would recommend this to a friend , but do n't look for a whole lot of warmth from it .
 What 's to review ? It is fleece , warm , I picked the color and got what I wanted . I did get a better price than I expected.Here is something review-worthy
 This is a good vest and I enjoy the heck out of mine . I actually own two in different colours , since I was given another one several years ago for my birthday . There are already a lot of reviews and opinions here so I will not be too redundant.The vest is Polartec fleece -LRB- 200 mid-weight -RRB- so it keeps the core warm and comfortable down to about 40 degrees F. Any colder and I must go to a higher tech solution . It works wet or dry , and drys pretty quickly if soaked.It 's a cozy piece of gear and I think a perfect gift item for a loved one since they will think of you in the comfort and warmth of it . I actually LIKE that short fuzzy fibres starts to clump and pill like a snuggly , familiar stuffed teddy bear after only a few washings . I often use it as a throw blanket or a pillow -LRB- esp on airline flights -RRB- . It is also very easy to maintain and as I have two , I often have one in the wash as I 'm wearing the other one.I like the roomy sizing as I use this for layering , and this is an intermediate layer . When zipped all the way up , it practically serves as it 's own Polartec scarf around the neck . Being a taller/larger human , I appreciate that this vest is available in extended sizes too.The design of the vest is simple with a stand up/fold down collar , 2 zippered side slash pockets at the waist , and the Columbia logo on the chest.Herein lies , my first minor criticism ... value . For a simple , unlined vest without any `` extras '' -LRB- like chest pocket , map pocket , interior pockets , drawstring at the bottom or the waist , throat abrasion guard , dbl access zipper , uppers shell , back hook loop , even zipper pulls with whistles , compasses and LED lights -RRB- I would expect a basic level price . If you shop around even online you should quickly get a feel for what the no frills model vs. the all the bells and whistles model are comparatively worth.The two pockets that it does have utilizes this elastized sateen material as the interior . Not only is this pocket lining not very warm , but I find that it snags uncomfortably on little dry skin flakes , hangnails , and tiny dry skin spurs on my hands . It might be just me , but it makes it unpleasant to put my hands in the pockets -LRB- for warmth -RRB- . On both of my Columbia vests , I have replaced the pocket liners with nice non-snagging flat mesh -LRB- like that found in luggage pockets -RRB- . Well the world is what you make of it , so of course I have made some heavy mods to my vests , which have made them my favourites and practically daily wear for me.Columbia makes consistently high quality products -LRB- overseas -RRB- geared toward the outdoor person , so paying a little bit extra for the brand name logo is not that painful I guess .
 This vest is very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear . Most of the time I wear it with short sleeved shirts . When zipped , it 's just right for those 45-50 degree days -LRB- as long as you 're not out in the chill for really long periods - but fine for car-to-store , or short walks -RRB- . It 's also great around the house when you want to drop the thermostat a few degrees to save a little on heating costs . My only disappointment is the main zipper . Sometimes it takes several tries to get it started , and it often sticks mid-zip -LRB- as if there was grit or something in it -RRB- . It always ends up working , but not always smoothly . I 'd definitely recommend the vest , and I suspect my zipper issue is not a design flaw , but rather a production glitch , which would not likely affect other buyers .
 I have purchased Columbia products I have liked in the past . So this was not a difficult choice form me . It is sized correctly for the big guys . I ordered a xxlt and it fits just the way it should . I nice way to add a bit of extra warmth under a jacket that need a little help . Good price and a quality product that was shipped fast .
 Ca n't beat the price , but the vest is larger than I thought a large would be - should 've got a medium .
 This Columbia vest is a quality product and is equipped with a durable zipper , style and feel .
 Awesome vest . Better than expected , well packed and arrived quickly ! I give it 2 thumbs up and my highest recommendation !
 A gift for my Grandson , quality and craftsmanship excellent , could not ask for a better product , or reliability . Thank you for a great fitting product , my Grandson absolutely loves it .
 I gave my husband this for Christmas and he is pleased , so I am too . Looks good , is comfortable . Have only had it less than 1 week .
 Honestly do n't know what 's all the hype about the North Face is . The good old Columbia looks great , feels comfortable and is well made . Navy color is very pleasant to the eye . I am very happy with the vest .
 My husband absolutely loved his vest I got him . We have even bought these in different colors . We would recommend this to anyone looking for a vest to wear as a casual attire or even a dressy attire .
 Bought this vest for my brother and he loves it . I really liked the color of it because its so different .
 The fit , number of zippered pockets , and quality of fabric are all in keeping with a fleece vest that might have cost $ 15 or so more .
 Got this as a present for my dad . He loved it . Ordered an xl should have gone smaller product runs big
 Wonderful vest at retail price , the Amazon has outdone itself.For $ 12 + tax , it seems like a steal to me.The material is very soft and of good craftmanship.thank you , Amazon and Columbia
 This product is a good value . Nothing spectacular , but a good deal . I use it as a good layer for skiing to provide warmth for my core without restricting shoulder and elbow movement . It more than adequately provides what I need .
 Every piece of Columbia clothing that I own is top quality and this is no different . It 's a lightweight , and yet warm vest perfect for those crisp fall days .
 Good light weight Vest.Material soft and flexible.Deep pockets . The fit was great . I wear mine in the office . I would recommend .
 This vest is similar to my Columbia Fleece jacket -- both are excellent and perform very well , especially at this price point . Fast delivery too .
 Was just what i was looking for . Brand new with tags and shipped very quickly . My husband loves it . Color looks exactly same as shown in the pic as well .
 I bought this as soon as the Winter cold hit NM and love it . The XL I first purchased was a bit short -LRB- I 'm 6 ' 5 &#34; -RRB- so I then bought an XLT which I put in the morning and wear till I retire at night . Excellent warmth and comfort . Excellent value for money .
 These vests are the most comfortable and great lookingAnd are very affordable and go great with any causual outfit
 My wife bought a couple of these first . I saw them and liked what I saw . Then I learned that she had bought a men 's vest , so I was pretty sure I could have one , too ! The zipper on the pockets is necessary , since the bottom of the opening is about even with the bottom of the pocket and things can fall out . I found one that fits my chest but it is loose at the waist . I will probably take a seam in a bit to correct that . The material is pleasingly soft and warm . They clean up in the washing machine.My wife 's two vests are the same size , but the waistband is larger on one than the other . They were manufactured in different countries .
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He is very fussy and almost always finds something -LRB- even if it is really minor -RRB- wrong with anything he either buys or receives . He has worn this vest 3 times and has only had it for 6 days ! The fit was on target a large is a large . The craftsmanship above average . The price very good . This large fit nicely over a bit more belly than desired but would still fit well minus the extra pounds .
 I bought this vest for my husband for Christmas . It was perfect . He 's 6 ' 2 '' and about 220lbs and the XL fits him perfectly . He loves wearing it . It 's great for Southern winters were it does n't get too cold .
 This vest is very warm . It fits snug to your body keeping in your core body heat.The pockets are large . . perfect for someone who likes to carry a lot of things with them.The collar can be flipped up to cover more of your neck , or folded down when it 's not as cold.The fleece is very soft , and the vest overall is made well . I recommend this vest if you ` relooking to keep warm this winter . . either worn solo or as part of your winter layered clothing .
 I have been wearing this vest everyday since i got it . the color is great and the warmth is perfect . its not cold enough to wear heavy down jacket but this is just right for the cool days and nights here is S. Calif. thank you
 I ordered this one night , and had it in my hands within 3 business days - with regular shipping . It is a very good layer to add to any winter gear . It has two side zip-up pockets , and the collar zips all the way up if you need . It is super lightweight , and very warm -LRB- for a vest -RRB- . This vest does stop a tiny bit of wind , but not much . On a cool rainy day , wear this underneath a non-insulated rain jacket -LRB- shell -RRB- , and it 's perfect ! -- Very nice !
 This vest was exactly what I wanted . It has a furry texture -LRB- not all fleeces have that same texture -RRB- ; it has pockets that completely sewn into the garment -LRB- some sew it only on one edge -RRB- ; it has room in the pockets all the way to the side edge -LRB- and not just to the edge of the zipper -RRB- . The fit was good ; the sizes run large , so a L fits an XL person . I am very please and will probably purchase another .
 Fleece is fleece , but this vest is surprisingly well put-together . The only thing is it missing is a third pocket -LRB- the small vertical one near the left center that most other vests have -RRB- .
 I was very satisfied with the vest . I would get a size smaller than your usual size , they run big .
 I had to replace a vest the job gave me because it was wearing out . I decided to order these vest in different colors . They go great with whatever I wear at the job . The quality is good for the money . I 'm known as the vest guy now .
 fits great , the blue is amazing , its warm but not too warm , I simply love this one . also got the black one and this a great product .
 I received just what I had ordered , which was the same brand I 've always worn and it was received very quickly before the expected date was even close to being up . I love my Columbia vests .
 Estoy muy contento de haber encargado &eacute;sta prenda . El color es muy suave y elegante . La prenda es muy c&oacute;moda .
 i liked this vest , , , the texture of the fabric is ideal for all season with style the thing is there is not enough pockets , , , , , , but it really serve my life style , , , , ill going to buy two more , , , i love it.i recommend this vest for all walks of life in style .
 Just the right weight to be outside in the Fall or Spring doing things . Keeps you warm without restricting mobility . Looks good and is very functional .
 very nice vest . light yet warm enough and not too hot during warmer days . the run a little big , I ordered a Large and had to exchange it for a M and I run on the larger side ... in all great buy I would recommend to a friend hands down ...
 I lost a vest that I previously owned , so I was looking for one to replace it . I am very satisfied with the fit and color of the one I purchased .
 Not the first vest of this type from Columbia that I 've purchased . Exactly what I wanted , soft , light weight but provides the warmth I want . Seems easy to mantian , wears good over time , easy to fold and carry if not needed . Satisfied .
 My husband bought one of these shirts last year to try it out . I was very skeptical of the `` no ironing '' claim . I could n't believe my eyes when I took it out of the dryer the first time -- not a wrinkle to be seen . The material is truly miraculous . We both love this product and plan to buy more . Thank you , Jos. Banks !
 I own three of these shirts and they are great . I get my shirts cleaned and pressed and here is an example of what great shirts they are
 I own two of these Traveler non-wrinkle shirts and they are absolutely the best shirts I have ever owned . They are of high quality material and the size I bought was right on the money . The colors offered are very versatile with just about anything a person would own and can be worn formally or casually . I am going to stick with buying more of these shirts .
 I bought 2 to begin with and now own seven and I ca n't see myself buying other dress shirts
 I received this shirt as a gift over Christmas . Since then I have bought two more . The fit is outstanding and I have never felt a finer material in a dress shirt - it is soft yet sturdy and always appears pressed . The iron free is for real . I hate ironing and will pay the extra 20 dollars per shirt to never have to dry clean or iron again . I will never buy another shirt and I almost want to throw away my non-iron free dress shirts . I highly recommend this shirt . You will enjoy it and probably buy more of them .
 These dress shirts are the best ! Wrinkle-Free , Breathable , Durable Material , Plus lots of styles , sizes and color options . Compare side-by-side to other dress shirts and you 'll see and feel the difference .

 My daughter looked adorable with this costume . My only observation is that I had a hard time dealing the shoes .
 We were looking for a little baby Halloween costume and this was it . Perfect!Plus , we could use it next year , too . The little bunny cape is adorable with the little carrot.The bunny booties and little bunny mittens were just too cute ! Great all around.Excellent service from this company !
 This dress far exceeded our expectations ... it 's truly a keeper . Was a little worried about the gold , but it was perfect . Could n't be happier . Very sophisticated yet sexy . The mermaid shape may not be for everyone , but with the right figure , it was beautiful ! With the bias cut and satiny material , it hugs every curve . Reminiscent of 1930 's Hollywood . It looked vintage , but new . Very reasonably priced -LRB- we bought it `` on sale '' -RRB- , an excellent first-time experience buying a gown online ... If only all transactions could go as smoothly . I was grateful for the previous reviews regarding sizing on this dress -LRB- apparently it runs a little large -RRB- , so took that into consideration when ordering . The dress arrived on time , in the time allotted . Just steam & go for the gold !
 This has been my best purchase ever . The dress fit well and it arrived on time . I look forward to buying my next dress from this company . Amazon has really out did themselves with this company . I would like to know if there are up coming sale items from this company ? They could email or send me a catalog in the mail . I really enjoyed my dress . Thank you Amazon for everything .
 My daughter is a junior in high school and she loved the dress thank you .
 When I first went on the internet to look for a dress to take w / me to NY I was a little sketchy doing it on the computer cause it 's safer to just go and shop for one and drive somewhere ! But I came to Amazon and found the perfect dress for the USMA dance.Everyone loved my dress and my boyfriend too ! They thought I looked lovely in it ! I 'm happy with the dress , happy with the quick service and happy all around !
 I own about seven of these!Great all weather hats , very cool in the summer , and I like the fact that they can be washed on a gentle cycle .
 This is a great fit for a silk shirt . I thought it would not be a close fit being silk , but I was wrong . This item fits snug and looks great on . Both alone and layered . I would recommend this shirt to people that like the look of a tight tank .
 I love my Silk Tank Tops . I wear them to work under my dress shirts and the feel is very nice . Much more comfie than the Hanes cotton tanks . The quality is very good for the price . The initial fit was just a tad snug , but stretched out just a bit after a couple of washes/wears and is very comfortable now . I tried wearing one on a hike but i find the coolmax type active wear handles sweating much better than silk . But for casual wear , or sleeping at night I love them .
 I never tried or even heard of silk tank tops , but now I will never go back . It 's a great under shirt/workout shirt . I like the way it feels like im wearing nothing at all .
 I bought this top for my 18 year old son -- thought it looked comfortable to wear under shirts etc. . It is . He likes wearing it , but he says he would never wear it alone . It is a wee bit too ` feminine ' to wear on top . Would I buy another one ? I do n't know . I think for him , the basic cotton tank tops are more versatile .
 I bought this for my husband last year , for Christmas . At this point in time , no complaints at all from him . Washes well and wears well , and its light color does n't show white dog hair , which was a must for a new vest !
 Quality is good but I need Longs and they dont seem to have many longs
 Bought this for my son in college after he asked for a black fleece vest for his birthday ... He thought it was perfect .
 Got my Columbia Cathedral Vest yesterday . Fits great and does it 's job perfectly.Paid 36 $ for it and its worth the money . It 's also much cheaper than similar products from North Face.Great for a run !
 First off - I am very happy with this purchase as it is exactly what I expected . And for the price , it 's hard to complain.The vest fits very nicely , i got the green large . I 'm a male 5 ' 11 '' and about 190 lbs . It fits me very nicely . Sometimes these vests bunch up around the gut looking dumpy but not this one.I have washed it a few times and it seems to be holding its colour , shape and stretch . It blocks the wind nicely and is perfect for cool autumn weather/early winter when it 's not too brutal but a t-shirt just does n't cut it.The collar is one it 's best features - it folds down nicely to keep your neck warm or you can turn it up to avoid the wind . The material is very soft and feels great on your skin.As for complaints , I find that i really miss having a breast pocket and I wish the pocket zippers went up to open as opposed to down.Since neither of these features were advertised , obviously i ca n't complain about their absence - i just prefer them and will be looking for both on my next vest purchase.One thing that I will knock off a star for is the depth of the pockets . They are quite shallow causing things to fall out easily - especially if you are sitting . If you are going to make a jacket with shallow pockets i think the pocket zips should go the other way ... Just make sure you remember to close the zips ! you can fit your entire hand in if you are trying to stay warm , but there is almost no downward angle to make a good pocket for holding your keys , phone or wallet.While we 're on the topic of zippers i will say that the quality of the zips on this jacket is top-notch . it will open or close from almost any angle and i would be very surprised if they stopped working.At $ 20 it 's hard to imagine a better purchase !
 Columbia fleece vests are the best I 've ever owned -LRB- it 's the third Columbia fleece I 've purchased -RRB- . They 're warm and very durable without being too bulky , making for a good fit and a nice appearance .
 My Significant Other needed something easy to get into because of shoulder surgery ... Perfect for him ! The warmth is wonderful ; the sizing worked out great . He did n't have a vest like this , but now he 's talking about getting another one , in another color . Pricing is perfect too . Ca n't think of any negative !
 Definitely get one size smaller than what you normally wear . I almost always wear an XL and when I tried this on it was baggy and roomy and with an item like this you want it to be snugger .
 Lightweight . I wear it mostly at night in my hammock to keep warm throughout the night . Layers well . Added a drawstring at the waist . Easy to do but would have preferred it was included .
 Although the product is great . It was not the exact color as published . It does not have a different color on the neck
 It was wright for what I was looking for . It arrived in good conditions but the coulor is a bit different that in the picture anyway it fits well , thanks .
 As it usually happens , Columbia makes the best and tis vest is not an exception . comfortable , nice and well made .
 All I wanted was a basic vest for cool summer days . Does the job perfectly . Will not stop the wind or keep you very warm - but if you are a guy needing pockets for your wallet - this works well .
 I have wide shoulders -LRB- 50 Regular suit jacket -RRB- , and the XL fit me perfect . I was especially pleased with the collar - which was shorter when popped than the previous Columbia vest I had owned . My previous fleece vest from Columbia lasted me about 2 years , so I have high hopes for this one as well . Very soft , great fit , extremely comfortable and versatile .
 Purchased this vest as a team vest for our local biathlon team . The fit was slightly large , but that is good for winter wear . The length was just below belt line . This is ideal for keeping the lower back warm while skiing and also shooting . Everyone that got a vest on our team was very pleased with the fit and the look . Great for training and looks good too !
 Dumb me , I ordered the wrong size . No problem with this purchase . It was easy to return and reorder the correct size . Credit came through for this purchase with days of me shipping wrong size back . This firm is `` On he Ball '' when it comes to handling a situation like this .
 While I do n't get too excited by clothing , and this is no exception , I do find this is a well made , comfortably warm vest , that I am glad I purchased .
 I wear this as an insulating layering or by itself over a shirt . It looks much better than my Columbia fleece which does n't have much shape . I like that it is super light and moderately warm .
 I bought this as soon as the Winter cold hit NM and love it . The XL I first purchased was a bit short -LRB- I 'm 6 ' 5 &#34; -RRB- so I then bought an XLT which I put in the morning and wear till I retire at night . Excellent warmth and comfort . Excellent value for money .

 Great extra layer for the winter.Very good quality . Generous pockets.Extremely comfortable.Logo over the breast is pleasantly inconspicuous .
 Most of my winter gear is from Columbia and I 've never had any complaints about it . It 's about half the price of a comparable North Face garment and works just as well .
 Like all Columbia products , this item arrived true to fit and size . I purchased this item for my husband and he wears it all the time . It washes well and is very durable . We have had this product for two years and it still looks and feels brand new .
 I bought this to layer under my coat when the weather dips below freezing . It 's comfortable , soft , and keeps me warm . I also like the blue color . Dropped one star because it seems to be made for people with pot bellies . I 'm 6 ' 1 180 and the medium fits perfectly lengthwise and in the shoulder/chest area but there 's a lot of extra fabric in the middle .
 Nice color and Im wanting to buy another vest different color . I highly reccomend to buy , columbia has great cloths .
 Bought this vest for my brother and he loves it . I really liked the color of it because its so different .
 The fit , number of zippered pockets , and quality of fabric are all in keeping with a fleece vest that might have cost $ 15 or so more .
 Got this as a present for my dad . He loved it . Ordered an xl should have gone smaller product runs big
 Fits great and what a great price -- medium weight - true to size for mens large . Priced locally at $ 65 dollars
 love columbia products , it helps keep my chest warm so I can lower the heat in the house during the daytime .
 This vest is exactly what I wanted , lightweight yet warm , does n't hinder arm and shoulder motion ; very soft comfortable material .
 I chose thie vest because of the brand and color . It is good quality and stylish . Shipping was fast . I 'm happy , happy , happy !
 Fits just right , material is a nice weight . very warm . Columbia products are always nice . ca n't go wrong with this vest .
 Vest is a nice weight , not too heavy or too lightweight . Great over a long sleeve t-shirt or henley . The charcoal color is really nice . It holds up well through repeated washings . He got this vest last year for Christmas and recently lost it but he loves it so much he asked for a replacement . So if your husband is forgetful like mine you might want to get two . : -RRB-
 Absolutely a fine purchase . I really like this vest -- the fit , the breathability , the warmth . Excellent quality . I recommend it highly .
 My wife wanted one for Traveling , got it , Love 's it , She is very Happy and i am very Happy . Thanks
 We are very pleased with the Vest that we purchased and are looking forward to giving it to my Father in Law for the holiday . I am sure he will be happy . Sizing looks accurate as does fabric and style . It will be a great gift for him
 This is a great vest . I ordered a medium , I am a 38 &#34; in chest , yet the medium was too big for me really -LRB- if you want a close to the body fit -RRB- . I will get this vest again in a smaller size and other color .
 This vest is of decent quality , not quite as good as the previous Columbia fleece vest as it is thinner . The color is more of a faded black or dark grey than black . I think I would have been disappointed if I had paid full price but for $ 25 it is worth it . I would buy it again .
 everything in order , very good quality product , service stock.came charging according to the agreement.excellent , recommended to all users .
 I ordered this as something to layer underneath my work jackets . It fits well , so it should be comfortable when layering . Even if this just lasts through this winter , it was a great deal at this price.I have a lot of Colombia jackets -LRB- fleece , rain shell , omni-heat jacket , etc. -RRB- , and I have never been disappointed .
 This vest is just right when a jacket is too much , or when a less bulky additional layer is needed . It is true to size and is well constructed . I plan to add other colors to my collection .
 Quality is good , not as thin as some said . Fit is small than usual . I wear a medium usually but was glad I got a small .
 The vest is comfortable and is made well . The size is my only reason for giving 4 stars . The vest runs on the large side . If you want a tighter fit you will have to order at least one size smaller than what you normally wear . It would be better with an elastic draw string too .
 I wear this nearly every day in the office to stay warm . It 's fleece is perfect , and I love the freedom to move my arms . Size is perfect . No complaints .
 Great extra layer to add during the winter months for a fair price . Looks great too around the office or at home .
 My son and my husband loved their new vests . They love the feel and fit and the colors . I will have to remember to get them some more .
 Very nicely made Vest.Columbia has great products.Like the texture of the material.Pictures on amazon page could be better .
 The fit is not too loose and the cypress color is a gray-green cross . Nice neutral color for men . This was purchased for use in winter time , but it 's rather thin to wear alone . It 's better suited for use in spring-time or under a jacket since it 's not bulky .
 Great ! The fabric felt very gentle , and it 's very light . My husband love it very much . I also introduced it to our friends , one of them placed an order , so I bought it again . The size is a little bit bigger .
 The product was made well . It looks good has a lining but I found that it was not as warm as a similar product purchased over 10 years ago . I did not return it as when the weather gets warmer or when I will wear it inside .
 He likes it . A basic black vest . Seems well made unlike some brands whose zippers are not the best quality . If you are not broad shouldered though the sleeve area in the large size is a bit &#34; wingy &#34; looking . My husband is tall but not bulky so it is a little too big in that respect .
 Second of the same type for me . Perfect for cool weather . Yes indeed . comfy warm not restrictive . All one could ask .
 This was a great purchase for my husbands birthday . Very well cut and designed using quality materials that wear well . I purchsed the navy color and it is a very nice shade more of a navy/grey that goes well with everything . My husband wears a size 42 jacket so I purchased the large since the medium I bought him before fit a little too close for his liking , the large is a little roomier . Columbia is always a good product and the price was good too .
 This is a beautifully made vest and my husband loves the color -LRB- bark -RRB- . From another review I was tipped off that the vest runs large , so I got a size smaller than my husband 's usual size -LRB- XL to L -RRB- . It fits perfectly .
 I bought this for my husband because he likes a fleece vest with a collar . He is very pleased and the vest looks great . The collar is big enough to really keep the wind off your neck .
 Its comfortable , warm , a little short in length but overall a really nice vest for me to wear in all types of weather . If I had to complain about one thing it would be that it is not fleece like I thought it would be so make sure you know what you 're buying . Other then that a nice product though !
 The vest fits well and is well made . If it had a zippered breast pocket it would be ideal and would get 5 stars . I would order it again .
 I had to replace a vest the job gave me because it was wearing out . I decided to order these vest in different colors . They go great with whatever I wear at the job . The quality is good for the money . I 'm known as the vest guy now .
 fits great , the blue is amazing , its warm but not too warm , I simply love this one . also got the black one and this a great product .
 I received just what I had ordered , which was the same brand I 've always worn and it was received very quickly before the expected date was even close to being up . I love my Columbia vests .

 Just the right weight to be outside in the Fall or Spring doing things . Keeps you warm without restricting mobility . Looks good and is very functional .
 I ordered several of these in different colors . The quality is great and the sizing is true . Furthermore , they have come out of the washer & dryer looking like new each and every time . If additional colors become available , I wo n't hesitate to order more .
 Ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas . Beautiful red shade , and fits extremely well . He is very happy and I was pleased that it arrived so quickly and in perfect condition .
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He is very fussy and almost always finds something -LRB- even if it is really minor -RRB- wrong with anything he either buys or receives . He has worn this vest 3 times and has only had it for 6 days ! The fit was on target a large is a large . The craftsmanship above average . The price very good . This large fit nicely over a bit more belly than desired but would still fit well minus the extra pounds .
 I bought this vest for my husband for Christmas . It was perfect . He 's 6 ' 2 '' and about 220lbs and the XL fits him perfectly . He loves wearing it . It 's great for Southern winters were it does n't get too cold .
 This vest is very warm . It fits snug to your body keeping in your core body heat.The pockets are large . . perfect for someone who likes to carry a lot of things with them.The collar can be flipped up to cover more of your neck , or folded down when it 's not as cold.The fleece is very soft , and the vest overall is made well . I recommend this vest if you ` relooking to keep warm this winter . . either worn solo or as part of your winter layered clothing .
 I have been wearing this vest everyday since i got it . the color is great and the warmth is perfect . its not cold enough to wear heavy down jacket but this is just right for the cool days and nights here is S. Calif. thank you
 I ordered this one night , and had it in my hands within 3 business days - with regular shipping . It is a very good layer to add to any winter gear . It has two side zip-up pockets , and the collar zips all the way up if you need . It is super lightweight , and very warm -LRB- for a vest -RRB- . This vest does stop a tiny bit of wind , but not much . On a cool rainy day , wear this underneath a non-insulated rain jacket -LRB- shell -RRB- , and it 's perfect ! -- Very nice !
 This vest was exactly what I wanted . It has a furry texture -LRB- not all fleeces have that same texture -RRB- ; it has pockets that completely sewn into the garment -LRB- some sew it only on one edge -RRB- ; it has room in the pockets all the way to the side edge -LRB- and not just to the edge of the zipper -RRB- . The fit was good ; the sizes run large , so a L fits an XL person . I am very please and will probably purchase another .
 I like Columbia garments for myself . So I bought one for My Dad for Christmas . It fits well in the XL and is nicely made.Washable too !!
 Quick service , good price and no complaints after wearing this for a month . Considering ordering another in a different color .
 Great vest for cool sunny days . Vest is a little on the thin side . It looks great and feels great . The only problem occurs is that it lets wind in and out very easily . I would recommend this to a friend , but do n't look for a whole lot of warmth from it .
 Awesome vest . Better than expected , well packed and arrived quickly ! I give it 2 thumbs up and my highest recommendation !
 A gift for my Grandson , quality and craftsmanship excellent , could not ask for a better product , or reliability . Thank you for a great fitting product , my Grandson absolutely loves it .
 I gave my husband this for Christmas and he is pleased , so I am too . Looks good , is comfortable . Have only had it less than 1 week .
 Honestly do n't know what 's all the hype about the North Face is . The good old Columbia looks great , feels comfortable and is well made . Navy color is very pleasant to the eye . I am very happy with the vest .
 My husband absolutely loved his vest I got him . We have even bought these in different colors . We would recommend this to anyone looking for a vest to wear as a casual attire or even a dressy attire .
 Wonderful vest at retail price , the Amazon has outdone itself.For $ 12 + tax , it seems like a steal to me.The material is very soft and of good craftmanship.thank you , Amazon and Columbia
 This product is a good value . Nothing spectacular , but a good deal . I use it as a good layer for skiing to provide warmth for my core without restricting shoulder and elbow movement . It more than adequately provides what I need .
 Every piece of Columbia clothing that I own is top quality and this is no different . It 's a lightweight , and yet warm vest perfect for those crisp fall days .
 Not a whole lot to say other than it 's well built , the fabric is very comfortable and strong feeling and the vest looks great . I 'd buy it again if I had the need .
 this is a very nice vest . looks good on and fabric is great . color stays true when washed as well
 Good light weight Vest.Material soft and flexible.Deep pockets . The fit was great . I wear mine in the office . I would recommend .
 This vest is similar to my Columbia Fleece jacket -- both are excellent and perform very well , especially at this price point . Fast delivery too .
 Was just what i was looking for . Brand new with tags and shipped very quickly . My husband loves it . Color looks exactly same as shown in the pic as well .
 My experience with this Columbia vest made me feel it was spot on for size . The side pockets a bonus for a mid-layer piece . The vest itself let me wanting a little more . The collar is double the weight of the main body of the vest . It is a nice vest but thin for use as a mid-layer . I myself would have preferred if the body was equal to the collar in weight , but for the price I paid I 'd have to say it matches the quality . I guess I expected a little more from Columbia , as I own other products from them that always went beyond my expectations . Guess I 'll just have to be a little creative in my layering to get the best use out of this purchase . The style and color are nice , but I also got the `` bunching '' effect during active use , maybe better as a low activity use item , walking around town and such . It really comes down to what you 'll be using it for , activity level and quality of other layering items .
 Ordered the Large in Green color and was a great value . Quality was excellent as you would expect from Columbia .
 These vests are well made , stylish and fullfill their purpose exceptionally . They provide a little extra warmth at home when the thermostat is set down low to save energy . But being sleveless they do n't make you sweat . The sizes are exactly as specified . I normally wear large in shirts and jackets , and the large vest fits perfectly .
 Warm and made well and comfortable . Husband wears a large but had to order in medium size . He loves it but beware it runs large . Price was great too !
 Bought this at half the price to replace an old Columbia vest in which the zipper fell apart after a year . Wore it 5 days a week for work so I got my monies worth although I paid full price for that one .
 Columbia Men 's Cathedral Peak VestAmple sizing for stout waste . Soft , good feeling fabric with good zippers and warm comfort.Good color and value for a casual look.It can be worn most of the time for a light jacket or coat . Easy to maintain .
 Like the columbia fleece product they are soft . I got the same product from a discount store and it was cheaper even after tax . I have to rate it as 4 because of the product quality .
 This is my second Columbia vest and I really like them . I would recommend this vest to anyone . I like to wear it to work with my dress shirts and ties . Looks sharp .
 I have received this Vest , It is according the picture and it is beautiful , I like the color and I recommend to the people buy this product .
 This vest is the best value in a fleece vest that I 've found , hands down -- for quality , comfort , durability ... I travel constantly and I like the charcoal color because it shows no lint , hair etc. . I lost one of these and replaced it immediately . It 's perfect for layering in cool or cold weather ... but also for that little extra warmth I need in a refrigerated movie theater . -- When I replaced my lost vest I looked at other brands again and was reminded that this Columbia vest is the best thing out there for the money ... by far .
 One of the better purchases I 've made , in terms of satisfaction and value.The product is well-made and durable , which you come to expect from Columbia . It can be had for a good price and should last for a long time . Fits true to size , zipper works fine , and it does its job
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He finds them to be warm yet keeps his arms free at work . This Columbia vest is very nice and thick . Very nicely made and of good quality .
 Bought this for my husband , and he really liked it . The vest is generously cut and well sewn . It 's also very soft and the color is true and pleasing.Just right for those chilly nights when a long sleeved sweater would be `` too much . ''
 Ca n't beat this vest especially for the price ! I have purchased 3 of them !
 My son was very pleased with this vest . I liked the price for a name like Columbia Sportwear . I also liked how fast it was sent to me .
 The vest is comfortable and roomy , though not the very best of materials .
 This was a gift for someone . From what I saw , he was very pleased with it . The item arrived in a very timely manner .
 Purchased two of these for Christmas gifts . Was very impressed with the quality . Would definitely buy again !
 very nice vest . light yet warm enough and not too hot during warmer days . the run a little big , I ordered a Large and had to exchange it for a M and I run on the larger side ... in all great buy I would recommend to a friend hands down ...
 I lost a vest that I previously owned , so I was looking for one to replace it . I am very satisfied with the fit and color of the one I purchased .
 Not the first vest of this type from Columbia that I 've purchased . Exactly what I wanted , soft , light weight but provides the warmth I want . Seems easy to mantian , wears good over time , easy to fold and carry if not needed . Satisfied .
 Have several different brands . . this is the best value of all ... fits great quality stitching and best price of all seen
 Extremely pleased with this purchase . After having ordered the wrong color by mistake , i quickly ordered again . Came exactly as described and within given time . No disappointments here !
 The vest is great -- second one I 've purchased ; however , the zipper , as the vest ages , has a tendency to pull apart at the bottom . The reason is the very short insert piece . Increase the depth of the insert and this vest would rate 5 stars . I bought my first vest at Mervins and when they went out of business I never found this make of vest again until I checked Amazon.com -- a great source and great products .
 I bought this vest for a casual look around the office and not at all disappointed . The sizing is about average , the look is great , and as it is Columbia , the material is of good quality . It will keep one warm in the winter months .
 This was a Christmas gift for my husband that he actually loved . Thanks for a great buy . Will be back !
 I 've had this vest for about a month now & I really do enjoy it.I 've had similar vests in the past , but I needed something newer to wear around the office and under my winter coat when a sweater or hoody just does n't work.The vest is very soft & does n't get caught on much . I bought the dark grey hoping that it would `` hide '' my dogs hair unlike the black vest . And it does . I have a beagle , and I can barely notice when -LRB- a few/decent amount -RRB- of his white & black hairs get on it . Some fleece seems to attract dog hair & never let go - this does NOT.The only negative I have about this vest , as others noted , is that there is n't a pull string around the waist . This has n't really bothered me , but I would like to tighten it up just a little bit.I work outdoors so this is perfect for helping me layer up but allowing me something to wear that wo n't bulk up & slow down my arm movement which happens if you wear too many sweaters or hoody 's . I plan on buying another in a few months so I do n't wear this one out too much . Awesome price too . I checked a couple of stores online and no one had the same price as Amazon .
 I just want to say that is the best way to keep you warm , high quality product and very comfortable .
 Fleece is fleece , but this vest is surprisingly well put-together . The only thing is it missing is a third pocket -LRB- the small vertical one near the left center that most other vests have -RRB- .
 I was very satisfied with the vest . I would get a size smaller than your usual size , they run big .
 Works for what I wanted . Something to wear while walking in cooler temps , where I did n't want a full coat .
 This product was first class -LRB- not a second -RRB- and was as ordered and on time . Ca n't get any better than that .
 This vest is soft yet rugged , true to size and just right for my son for Christmas .
 It 's hard for me to find some shirt with right size sleeve and collar . But that would be a problem for a vest , :-RRB- . I do n't like the zippers on the pockets , i never put any stuff in the pockets . Overall , this is a good vest for me , I wish it a little bit warmer .
 Columbia sizes are really big so just be a little conservative in ordering for sizes . Buy is for less than 20 bucks for getting value .
 I was satified with the product my only concern is that the color was off black insteadof black .
 Columbia gear seems to be priced much lower than other companies like Patagonia and North Face but I feel like the quality of Columbia 's clothes stands up.This vest is exceptionally warm and comfortable .
 The most important factors for me when purchasing a vest were warmth and comfort . This vest is just what I wanted in both categories . It gives me just the right amount of warmth when I go for my morning run without getting too hot once I get warmed up . It 's also comfortable and soft . The pockets have zippers so I can put my keys etc in there and do n't have to worry about them falling out . The only fault I can find is the zippers jingle a bit as I move . Overall I 'm happy with my purchase .
 I got two of these , the blue and the Cattail , which is just brown . They are nice and warm . They look good . They run a little bit big . I got an XL , and I usually wear an XL in everything . I 'm probably right in between a L and an XL . I 'm 6 ' and 240 lbs , if that helps you order yours correctly .
 My son really loves this vest . We ordered two in different colors . It looked very nice on him and he wore it every other day with jeans . A great vest !
 Bought this for my dad for Christmas . He really llikes it . Fits really well and was just as promised and described .
 Perfect fit - this was purchased for an elderly person for indoor wear . It 's not black and it 's not grey - more like graphite . It is very lightweight and keeps him cozy and warm in these cold months .
 We 've been wearing our own Columbia vests for quite some time here in Wisconsin , but it only recently occurred to me that it was just the thing for my 93-year-old dad in Florida , who 's often cold , despite fairly warm temperatures . He loves the vest 's softness and is enjoying having something more youthful and &#34; cool &#34; to wear . I 'm happy to know that it 's easily machine wash and dryable .
 I picked this up to use as a stand-alone or extra layering depending on the temperature . This vest is great - it 's like wearing a soft fleece blanket.It fits easily under all my jackets or sweatshirts . A nice bonus is the zip pockets - they 're great for my phone or warming up my hands very fast .
 What 's to review ? It is fleece , warm , I picked the color and got what I wanted . I did get a better price than I expected.Here is something review-worthy
 This is a good vest and I enjoy the heck out of mine . I actually own two in different colours , since I was given another one several years ago for my birthday . There are already a lot of reviews and opinions here so I will not be too redundant.The vest is Polartec fleece -LRB- 200 mid-weight -RRB- so it keeps the core warm and comfortable down to about 40 degrees F. Any colder and I must go to a higher tech solution . It works wet or dry , and drys pretty quickly if soaked.It 's a cozy piece of gear and I think a perfect gift item for a loved one since they will think of you in the comfort and warmth of it . I actually LIKE that short fuzzy fibres starts to clump and pill like a snuggly , familiar stuffed teddy bear after only a few washings . I often use it as a throw blanket or a pillow -LRB- esp on airline flights -RRB- . It is also very easy to maintain and as I have two , I often have one in the wash as I 'm wearing the other one.I like the roomy sizing as I use this for layering , and this is an intermediate layer . When zipped all the way up , it practically serves as it 's own Polartec scarf around the neck . Being a taller/larger human , I appreciate that this vest is available in extended sizes too.The design of the vest is simple with a stand up/fold down collar , 2 zippered side slash pockets at the waist , and the Columbia logo on the chest.Herein lies , my first minor criticism ... value . For a simple , unlined vest without any `` extras '' -LRB- like chest pocket , map pocket , interior pockets , drawstring at the bottom or the waist , throat abrasion guard , dbl access zipper , uppers shell , back hook loop , even zipper pulls with whistles , compasses and LED lights -RRB- I would expect a basic level price . If you shop around even online you should quickly get a feel for what the no frills model vs. the all the bells and whistles model are comparatively worth.The two pockets that it does have utilizes this elastized sateen material as the interior . Not only is this pocket lining not very warm , but I find that it snags uncomfortably on little dry skin flakes , hangnails , and tiny dry skin spurs on my hands . It might be just me , but it makes it unpleasant to put my hands in the pockets -LRB- for warmth -RRB- . On both of my Columbia vests , I have replaced the pocket liners with nice non-snagging flat mesh -LRB- like that found in luggage pockets -RRB- . Well the world is what you make of it , so of course I have made some heavy mods to my vests , which have made them my favourites and practically daily wear for me.Columbia makes consistently high quality products -LRB- overseas -RRB- geared toward the outdoor person , so paying a little bit extra for the brand name logo is not that painful I guess .
 This vest is very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear . Most of the time I wear it with short sleeved shirts . When zipped , it 's just right for those 45-50 degree days -LRB- as long as you 're not out in the chill for really long periods - but fine for car-to-store , or short walks -RRB- . It 's also great around the house when you want to drop the thermostat a few degrees to save a little on heating costs . My only disappointment is the main zipper . Sometimes it takes several tries to get it started , and it often sticks mid-zip -LRB- as if there was grit or something in it -RRB- . It always ends up working , but not always smoothly . I 'd definitely recommend the vest , and I suspect my zipper issue is not a design flaw , but rather a production glitch , which would not likely affect other buyers .
 I have purchased Columbia products I have liked in the past . So this was not a difficult choice form me . It is sized correctly for the big guys . I ordered a xxlt and it fits just the way it should . I nice way to add a bit of extra warmth under a jacket that need a little help . Good price and a quality product that was shipped fast .
 Ca n't beat the price , but the vest is larger than I thought a large would be - should 've got a medium .
 This Columbia vest is a quality product and is equipped with a durable zipper , style and feel .
 This is a great fit for a silk shirt . I thought it would not be a close fit being silk , but I was wrong . This item fits snug and looks great on . Both alone and layered . I would recommend this shirt to people that like the look of a tight tank .
 I love my Silk Tank Tops . I wear them to work under my dress shirts and the feel is very nice . Much more comfie than the Hanes cotton tanks . The quality is very good for the price . The initial fit was just a tad snug , but stretched out just a bit after a couple of washes/wears and is very comfortable now . I tried wearing one on a hike but i find the coolmax type active wear handles sweating much better than silk . But for casual wear , or sleeping at night I love them .
 I never tried or even heard of silk tank tops , but now I will never go back . It 's a great under shirt/workout shirt . I like the way it feels like im wearing nothing at all .
 I bought this top for my 18 year old son -- thought it looked comfortable to wear under shirts etc. . It is . He likes wearing it , but he says he would never wear it alone . It is a wee bit too ` feminine ' to wear on top . Would I buy another one ? I do n't know . I think for him , the basic cotton tank tops are more versatile .
 The stark contrast between the white background and photograph makes the picture realy stand out . It is a very bright shirt . The fabric is comfortable , but a bit stiff . Over all I think it is a great shirt which fits in to my hawian shrit collection . The shirt rates a very cool with me -LRB- the best rating I give is suprer cool -RRB- .
 When I received this item , it was clean , pressed and did n't have a hint of industrial soap smell to it . The item arrived within the alotted time frame and I could n't have been happier , will most definately buy from again .
 Awesome vest . Better than expected , well packed and arrived quickly ! I give it 2 thumbs up and my highest recommendation !
 A gift for my Grandson , quality and craftsmanship excellent , could not ask for a better product , or reliability . Thank you for a great fitting product , my Grandson absolutely loves it .
 I gave my husband this for Christmas and he is pleased , so I am too . Looks good , is comfortable . Have only had it less than 1 week .
 Honestly do n't know what 's all the hype about the North Face is . The good old Columbia looks great , feels comfortable and is well made . Navy color is very pleasant to the eye . I am very happy with the vest .
 My husband absolutely loved his vest I got him . We have even bought these in different colors . We would recommend this to anyone looking for a vest to wear as a casual attire or even a dressy attire .
 Bought this vest for my brother and he loves it . I really liked the color of it because its so different .
 The fit , number of zippered pockets , and quality of fabric are all in keeping with a fleece vest that might have cost $ 15 or so more .
 Got this as a present for my dad . He loved it . Ordered an xl should have gone smaller product runs big
 Wonderful vest at retail price , the Amazon has outdone itself.For $ 12 + tax , it seems like a steal to me.The material is very soft and of good craftmanship.thank you , Amazon and Columbia

 Was just what i was looking for . Brand new with tags and shipped very quickly . My husband loves it . Color looks exactly same as shown in the pic as well .
 I bought this as soon as the Winter cold hit NM and love it . The XL I first purchased was a bit short -LRB- I 'm 6 ' 5 &#34; -RRB- so I then bought an XLT which I put in the morning and wear till I retire at night . Excellent warmth and comfort . Excellent value for money .
 These vests are the most comfortable and great lookingAnd are very affordable and go great with any causual outfit
 My wife bought a couple of these first . I saw them and liked what I saw . Then I learned that she had bought a men 's vest , so I was pretty sure I could have one , too ! The zipper on the pockets is necessary , since the bottom of the opening is about even with the bottom of the pocket and things can fall out . I found one that fits my chest but it is loose at the waist . I will probably take a seam in a bit to correct that . The material is pleasingly soft and warm . They clean up in the washing machine.My wife 's two vests are the same size , but the waistband is larger on one than the other . They were manufactured in different countries .
 Warm and made well and comfortable . Husband wears a large but had to order in medium size . He loves it but beware it runs large . Price was great too !
 Bought this at half the price to replace an old Columbia vest in which the zipper fell apart after a year . Wore it 5 days a week for work so I got my monies worth although I paid full price for that one .

 Lightweight . I wear it mostly at night in my hammock to keep warm throughout the night . Layers well . Added a drawstring at the waist . Easy to do but would have preferred it was included .
 Although the product is great . It was not the exact color as published . It does not have a different color on the neck
 It was wright for what I was looking for . It arrived in good conditions but the coulor is a bit different that in the picture anyway it fits well , thanks .
 Ca n't beat this vest especially for the price ! I have purchased 3 of them !

 I bought this for my husband last year , for Christmas . At this point in time , no complaints at all from him . Washes well and wears well , and its light color does n't show white dog hair , which was a must for a new vest !
 Quality is good but I need Longs and they dont seem to have many longs
 Have several different brands . . this is the best value of all ... fits great quality stitching and best price of all seen

 We 've been wearing our own Columbia vests for quite some time here in Wisconsin , but it only recently occurred to me that it was just the thing for my 93-year-old dad in Florida , who 's often cold , despite fairly warm temperatures . He loves the vest 's softness and is enjoying having something more youthful and &#34; cool &#34; to wear . I 'm happy to know that it 's easily machine wash and dryable .
 I picked this up to use as a stand-alone or extra layering depending on the temperature . This vest is great - it 's like wearing a soft fleece blanket.It fits easily under all my jackets or sweatshirts . A nice bonus is the zip pockets - they 're great for my phone or warming up my hands very fast .
 I like Columbia garments for myself . So I bought one for My Dad for Christmas . It fits well in the XL and is nicely made.Washable too !!
 Quick service , good price and no complaints after wearing this for a month . Considering ordering another in a different color .
 Great vest for cool sunny days . Vest is a little on the thin side . It looks great and feels great . The only problem occurs is that it lets wind in and out very easily . I would recommend this to a friend , but do n't look for a whole lot of warmth from it .
 What 's to review ? It is fleece , warm , I picked the color and got what I wanted . I did get a better price than I expected.Here is something review-worthy
 This is a good vest and I enjoy the heck out of mine . I actually own two in different colours , since I was given another one several years ago for my birthday . There are already a lot of reviews and opinions here so I will not be too redundant.The vest is Polartec fleece -LRB- 200 mid-weight -RRB- so it keeps the core warm and comfortable down to about 40 degrees F. Any colder and I must go to a higher tech solution . It works wet or dry , and drys pretty quickly if soaked.It 's a cozy piece of gear and I think a perfect gift item for a loved one since they will think of you in the comfort and warmth of it . I actually LIKE that short fuzzy fibres starts to clump and pill like a snuggly , familiar stuffed teddy bear after only a few washings . I often use it as a throw blanket or a pillow -LRB- esp on airline flights -RRB- . It is also very easy to maintain and as I have two , I often have one in the wash as I 'm wearing the other one.I like the roomy sizing as I use this for layering , and this is an intermediate layer . When zipped all the way up , it practically serves as it 's own Polartec scarf around the neck . Being a taller/larger human , I appreciate that this vest is available in extended sizes too.The design of the vest is simple with a stand up/fold down collar , 2 zippered side slash pockets at the waist , and the Columbia logo on the chest.Herein lies , my first minor criticism ... value . For a simple , unlined vest without any `` extras '' -LRB- like chest pocket , map pocket , interior pockets , drawstring at the bottom or the waist , throat abrasion guard , dbl access zipper , uppers shell , back hook loop , even zipper pulls with whistles , compasses and LED lights -RRB- I would expect a basic level price . If you shop around even online you should quickly get a feel for what the no frills model vs. the all the bells and whistles model are comparatively worth.The two pockets that it does have utilizes this elastized sateen material as the interior . Not only is this pocket lining not very warm , but I find that it snags uncomfortably on little dry skin flakes , hangnails , and tiny dry skin spurs on my hands . It might be just me , but it makes it unpleasant to put my hands in the pockets -LRB- for warmth -RRB- . On both of my Columbia vests , I have replaced the pocket liners with nice non-snagging flat mesh -LRB- like that found in luggage pockets -RRB- . Well the world is what you make of it , so of course I have made some heavy mods to my vests , which have made them my favourites and practically daily wear for me.Columbia makes consistently high quality products -LRB- overseas -RRB- geared toward the outdoor person , so paying a little bit extra for the brand name logo is not that painful I guess .
 This vest is very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear . Most of the time I wear it with short sleeved shirts . When zipped , it 's just right for those 45-50 degree days -LRB- as long as you 're not out in the chill for really long periods - but fine for car-to-store , or short walks -RRB- . It 's also great around the house when you want to drop the thermostat a few degrees to save a little on heating costs . My only disappointment is the main zipper . Sometimes it takes several tries to get it started , and it often sticks mid-zip -LRB- as if there was grit or something in it -RRB- . It always ends up working , but not always smoothly . I 'd definitely recommend the vest , and I suspect my zipper issue is not a design flaw , but rather a production glitch , which would not likely affect other buyers .
 I have purchased Columbia products I have liked in the past . So this was not a difficult choice form me . It is sized correctly for the big guys . I ordered a xxlt and it fits just the way it should . I nice way to add a bit of extra warmth under a jacket that need a little help . Good price and a quality product that was shipped fast .
 Ca n't beat the price , but the vest is larger than I thought a large would be - should 've got a medium .
 This Columbia vest is a quality product and is equipped with a durable zipper , style and feel .
 First off - I am very happy with this purchase as it is exactly what I expected . And for the price , it 's hard to complain.The vest fits very nicely , i got the green large . I 'm a male 5 ' 11 '' and about 190 lbs . It fits me very nicely . Sometimes these vests bunch up around the gut looking dumpy but not this one.I have washed it a few times and it seems to be holding its colour , shape and stretch . It blocks the wind nicely and is perfect for cool autumn weather/early winter when it 's not too brutal but a t-shirt just does n't cut it.The collar is one it 's best features - it folds down nicely to keep your neck warm or you can turn it up to avoid the wind . The material is very soft and feels great on your skin.As for complaints , I find that i really miss having a breast pocket and I wish the pocket zippers went up to open as opposed to down.Since neither of these features were advertised , obviously i ca n't complain about their absence - i just prefer them and will be looking for both on my next vest purchase.One thing that I will knock off a star for is the depth of the pockets . They are quite shallow causing things to fall out easily - especially if you are sitting . If you are going to make a jacket with shallow pockets i think the pocket zips should go the other way ... Just make sure you remember to close the zips ! you can fit your entire hand in if you are trying to stay warm , but there is almost no downward angle to make a good pocket for holding your keys , phone or wallet.While we 're on the topic of zippers i will say that the quality of the zips on this jacket is top-notch . it will open or close from almost any angle and i would be very surprised if they stopped working.At $ 20 it 's hard to imagine a better purchase !
 Columbia fleece vests are the best I 've ever owned -LRB- it 's the third Columbia fleece I 've purchased -RRB- . They 're warm and very durable without being too bulky , making for a good fit and a nice appearance .
 My Significant Other needed something easy to get into because of shoulder surgery ... Perfect for him ! The warmth is wonderful ; the sizing worked out great . He did n't have a vest like this , but now he 's talking about getting another one , in another color . Pricing is perfect too . Ca n't think of any negative !
 Definitely get one size smaller than what you normally wear . I almost always wear an XL and when I tried this on it was baggy and roomy and with an item like this you want it to be snugger .
 I bought this for my husband because he likes a fleece vest with a collar . He is very pleased and the vest looks great . The collar is big enough to really keep the wind off your neck .
 Its comfortable , warm , a little short in length but overall a really nice vest for me to wear in all types of weather . If I had to complain about one thing it would be that it is not fleece like I thought it would be so make sure you know what you 're buying . Other then that a nice product though !
 The vest fits well and is well made . If it had a zippered breast pocket it would be ideal and would get 5 stars . I would order it again .
 As it usually happens , Columbia makes the best and tis vest is not an exception . comfortable , nice and well made .
 All I wanted was a basic vest for cool summer days . Does the job perfectly . Will not stop the wind or keep you very warm - but if you are a guy needing pockets for your wallet - this works well .
 I have wide shoulders -LRB- 50 Regular suit jacket -RRB- , and the XL fit me perfect . I was especially pleased with the collar - which was shorter when popped than the previous Columbia vest I had owned . My previous fleece vest from Columbia lasted me about 2 years , so I have high hopes for this one as well . Very soft , great fit , extremely comfortable and versatile .
 Purchased this vest as a team vest for our local biathlon team . The fit was slightly large , but that is good for winter wear . The length was just below belt line . This is ideal for keeping the lower back warm while skiing and also shooting . Everyone that got a vest on our team was very pleased with the fit and the look . Great for training and looks good too !
 Dumb me , I ordered the wrong size . No problem with this purchase . It was easy to return and reorder the correct size . Credit came through for this purchase with days of me shipping wrong size back . This firm is `` On he Ball '' when it comes to handling a situation like this .
 While I do n't get too excited by clothing , and this is no exception , I do find this is a well made , comfortably warm vest , that I am glad I purchased .
 I wear this as an insulating layering or by itself over a shirt . It looks much better than my Columbia fleece which does n't have much shape . I like that it is super light and moderately warm .
 I ordered several of these in different colors . The quality is great and the sizing is true . Furthermore , they have come out of the washer & dryer looking like new each and every time . If additional colors become available , I wo n't hesitate to order more .
 Ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas . Beautiful red shade , and fits extremely well . He is very happy and I was pleased that it arrived so quickly and in perfect condition .
 Great extra layer for the winter.Very good quality . Generous pockets.Extremely comfortable.Logo over the breast is pleasantly inconspicuous .
 Most of my winter gear is from Columbia and I 've never had any complaints about it . It 's about half the price of a comparable North Face garment and works just as well .
 Like all Columbia products , this item arrived true to fit and size . I purchased this item for my husband and he wears it all the time . It washes well and is very durable . We have had this product for two years and it still looks and feels brand new .
 I bought this to layer under my coat when the weather dips below freezing . It 's comfortable , soft , and keeps me warm . I also like the blue color . Dropped one star because it seems to be made for people with pot bellies . I 'm 6 ' 1 180 and the medium fits perfectly lengthwise and in the shoulder/chest area but there 's a lot of extra fabric in the middle .
 Nice color and Im wanting to buy another vest different color . I highly reccomend to buy , columbia has great cloths .
 I wear this nearly every day in the office to stay warm . It 's fleece is perfect , and I love the freedom to move my arms . Size is perfect . No complaints .
 Great extra layer to add during the winter months for a fair price . Looks great too around the office or at home .
 My son and my husband loved their new vests . They love the feel and fit and the colors . I will have to remember to get them some more .
 Fits great and what a great price -- medium weight - true to size for mens large . Priced locally at $ 65 dollars
 love columbia products , it helps keep my chest warm so I can lower the heat in the house during the daytime .
 This vest is exactly what I wanted , lightweight yet warm , does n't hinder arm and shoulder motion ; very soft comfortable material .
 I chose thie vest because of the brand and color . It is good quality and stylish . Shipping was fast . I 'm happy , happy , happy !
 Fits just right , material is a nice weight . very warm . Columbia products are always nice . ca n't go wrong with this vest .
 Vest is a nice weight , not too heavy or too lightweight . Great over a long sleeve t-shirt or henley . The charcoal color is really nice . It holds up well through repeated washings . He got this vest last year for Christmas and recently lost it but he loves it so much he asked for a replacement . So if your husband is forgetful like mine you might want to get two . : -RRB-
 Absolutely a fine purchase . I really like this vest -- the fit , the breathability , the warmth . Excellent quality . I recommend it highly .
 My wife wanted one for Traveling , got it , Love 's it , She is very Happy and i am very Happy . Thanks
 We are very pleased with the Vest that we purchased and are looking forward to giving it to my Father in Law for the holiday . I am sure he will be happy . Sizing looks accurate as does fabric and style . It will be a great gift for him
 This is a great vest . I ordered a medium , I am a 38 &#34; in chest , yet the medium was too big for me really -LRB- if you want a close to the body fit -RRB- . I will get this vest again in a smaller size and other color .
 This vest is of decent quality , not quite as good as the previous Columbia fleece vest as it is thinner . The color is more of a faded black or dark grey than black . I think I would have been disappointed if I had paid full price but for $ 25 it is worth it . I would buy it again .
 everything in order , very good quality product , service stock.came charging according to the agreement.excellent , recommended to all users .
 I ordered this as something to layer underneath my work jackets . It fits well , so it should be comfortable when layering . Even if this just lasts through this winter , it was a great deal at this price.I have a lot of Colombia jackets -LRB- fleece , rain shell , omni-heat jacket , etc. -RRB- , and I have never been disappointed .
 This vest is just right when a jacket is too much , or when a less bulky additional layer is needed . It is true to size and is well constructed . I plan to add other colors to my collection .
 Quality is good , not as thin as some said . Fit is small than usual . I wear a medium usually but was glad I got a small .
 The vest is comfortable and is made well . The size is my only reason for giving 4 stars . The vest runs on the large side . If you want a tighter fit you will have to order at least one size smaller than what you normally wear . It would be better with an elastic draw string too .
 Bought this for my son in college after he asked for a black fleece vest for his birthday ... He thought it was perfect .
 Got my Columbia Cathedral Vest yesterday . Fits great and does it 's job perfectly.Paid 36 $ for it and its worth the money . It 's also much cheaper than similar products from North Face.Great for a run !
 Very nicely made Vest.Columbia has great products.Like the texture of the material.Pictures on amazon page could be better .
 The fit is not too loose and the cypress color is a gray-green cross . Nice neutral color for men . This was purchased for use in winter time , but it 's rather thin to wear alone . It 's better suited for use in spring-time or under a jacket since it 's not bulky .
 Great ! The fabric felt very gentle , and it 's very light . My husband love it very much . I also introduced it to our friends , one of them placed an order , so I bought it again . The size is a little bit bigger .
 The product was made well . It looks good has a lining but I found that it was not as warm as a similar product purchased over 10 years ago . I did not return it as when the weather gets warmer or when I will wear it inside .
 He likes it . A basic black vest . Seems well made unlike some brands whose zippers are not the best quality . If you are not broad shouldered though the sleeve area in the large size is a bit &#34; wingy &#34; looking . My husband is tall but not bulky so it is a little too big in that respect .
 Second of the same type for me . Perfect for cool weather . Yes indeed . comfy warm not restrictive . All one could ask .
 Columbia gear seems to be priced much lower than other companies like Patagonia and North Face but I feel like the quality of Columbia 's clothes stands up.This vest is exceptionally warm and comfortable .
 The most important factors for me when purchasing a vest were warmth and comfort . This vest is just what I wanted in both categories . It gives me just the right amount of warmth when I go for my morning run without getting too hot once I get warmed up . It 's also comfortable and soft . The pockets have zippers so I can put my keys etc in there and do n't have to worry about them falling out . The only fault I can find is the zippers jingle a bit as I move . Overall I 'm happy with my purchase .
 This was a great purchase for my husbands birthday . Very well cut and designed using quality materials that wear well . I purchsed the navy color and it is a very nice shade more of a navy/grey that goes well with everything . My husband wears a size 42 jacket so I purchased the large since the medium I bought him before fit a little too close for his liking , the large is a little roomier . Columbia is always a good product and the price was good too .
 This is a beautifully made vest and my husband loves the color -LRB- bark -RRB- . From another review I was tipped off that the vest runs large , so I got a size smaller than my husband 's usual size -LRB- XL to L -RRB- . It fits perfectly .
 I had to replace a vest the job gave me because it was wearing out . I decided to order these vest in different colors . They go great with whatever I wear at the job . The quality is good for the money . I 'm known as the vest guy now .
 fits great , the blue is amazing , its warm but not too warm , I simply love this one . also got the black one and this a great product .
 I received just what I had ordered , which was the same brand I 've always worn and it was received very quickly before the expected date was even close to being up . I love my Columbia vests .
 Estoy muy contento de haber encargado &eacute;sta prenda . El color es muy suave y elegante . La prenda es muy c&oacute;moda .
 i liked this vest , , , the texture of the fabric is ideal for all season with style the thing is there is not enough pockets , , , , , , but it really serve my life style , , , , ill going to buy two more , , , i love it.i recommend this vest for all walks of life in style .
 Just the right weight to be outside in the Fall or Spring doing things . Keeps you warm without restricting mobility . Looks good and is very functional .
 very nice vest . light yet warm enough and not too hot during warmer days . the run a little big , I ordered a Large and had to exchange it for a M and I run on the larger side ... in all great buy I would recommend to a friend hands down ...
 I lost a vest that I previously owned , so I was looking for one to replace it . I am very satisfied with the fit and color of the one I purchased .
 Not the first vest of this type from Columbia that I 've purchased . Exactly what I wanted , soft , light weight but provides the warmth I want . Seems easy to mantian , wears good over time , easy to fold and carry if not needed . Satisfied .
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He is very fussy and almost always finds something -LRB- even if it is really minor -RRB- wrong with anything he either buys or receives . He has worn this vest 3 times and has only had it for 6 days ! The fit was on target a large is a large . The craftsmanship above average . The price very good . This large fit nicely over a bit more belly than desired but would still fit well minus the extra pounds .
 I bought this vest for my husband for Christmas . It was perfect . He 's 6 ' 2 '' and about 220lbs and the XL fits him perfectly . He loves wearing it . It 's great for Southern winters were it does n't get too cold .
 This vest is very warm . It fits snug to your body keeping in your core body heat.The pockets are large . . perfect for someone who likes to carry a lot of things with them.The collar can be flipped up to cover more of your neck , or folded down when it 's not as cold.The fleece is very soft , and the vest overall is made well . I recommend this vest if you ` relooking to keep warm this winter . . either worn solo or as part of your winter layered clothing .
 I have been wearing this vest everyday since i got it . the color is great and the warmth is perfect . its not cold enough to wear heavy down jacket but this is just right for the cool days and nights here is S. Calif. thank you
 I ordered this one night , and had it in my hands within 3 business days - with regular shipping . It is a very good layer to add to any winter gear . It has two side zip-up pockets , and the collar zips all the way up if you need . It is super lightweight , and very warm -LRB- for a vest -RRB- . This vest does stop a tiny bit of wind , but not much . On a cool rainy day , wear this underneath a non-insulated rain jacket -LRB- shell -RRB- , and it 's perfect ! -- Very nice !
 This vest was exactly what I wanted . It has a furry texture -LRB- not all fleeces have that same texture -RRB- ; it has pockets that completely sewn into the garment -LRB- some sew it only on one edge -RRB- ; it has room in the pockets all the way to the side edge -LRB- and not just to the edge of the zipper -RRB- . The fit was good ; the sizes run large , so a L fits an XL person . I am very please and will probably purchase another .
 Fleece is fleece , but this vest is surprisingly well put-together . The only thing is it missing is a third pocket -LRB- the small vertical one near the left center that most other vests have -RRB- .
 I was very satisfied with the vest . I would get a size smaller than your usual size , they run big .
 good quality ! . . good price !! . . My fiance will love it ! It was about same price through Arkansas website , but love it !
 When you are my size , finding the right clothing is a challenge and buying it on line a bit of a risk . I was happy when they arrived and fit perfectly . They are comfortable and well made . A great value .

 This vest is exactly what I wanted , lightweight yet warm , does n't hinder arm and shoulder motion ; very soft comfortable material .
 I chose thie vest because of the brand and color . It is good quality and stylish . Shipping was fast . I 'm happy , happy , happy !
 Fits just right , material is a nice weight . very warm . Columbia products are always nice . ca n't go wrong with this vest .
 Vest is a nice weight , not too heavy or too lightweight . Great over a long sleeve t-shirt or henley . The charcoal color is really nice . It holds up well through repeated washings . He got this vest last year for Christmas and recently lost it but he loves it so much he asked for a replacement . So if your husband is forgetful like mine you might want to get two . : -RRB-
 Absolutely a fine purchase . I really like this vest -- the fit , the breathability , the warmth . Excellent quality . I recommend it highly .
 My wife wanted one for Traveling , got it , Love 's it , She is very Happy and i am very Happy . Thanks
 We are very pleased with the Vest that we purchased and are looking forward to giving it to my Father in Law for the holiday . I am sure he will be happy . Sizing looks accurate as does fabric and style . It will be a great gift for him
 First off - I am very happy with this purchase as it is exactly what I expected . And for the price , it 's hard to complain.The vest fits very nicely , i got the green large . I 'm a male 5 ' 11 '' and about 190 lbs . It fits me very nicely . Sometimes these vests bunch up around the gut looking dumpy but not this one.I have washed it a few times and it seems to be holding its colour , shape and stretch . It blocks the wind nicely and is perfect for cool autumn weather/early winter when it 's not too brutal but a t-shirt just does n't cut it.The collar is one it 's best features - it folds down nicely to keep your neck warm or you can turn it up to avoid the wind . The material is very soft and feels great on your skin.As for complaints , I find that i really miss having a breast pocket and I wish the pocket zippers went up to open as opposed to down.Since neither of these features were advertised , obviously i ca n't complain about their absence - i just prefer them and will be looking for both on my next vest purchase.One thing that I will knock off a star for is the depth of the pockets . They are quite shallow causing things to fall out easily - especially if you are sitting . If you are going to make a jacket with shallow pockets i think the pocket zips should go the other way ... Just make sure you remember to close the zips ! you can fit your entire hand in if you are trying to stay warm , but there is almost no downward angle to make a good pocket for holding your keys , phone or wallet.While we 're on the topic of zippers i will say that the quality of the zips on this jacket is top-notch . it will open or close from almost any angle and i would be very surprised if they stopped working.At $ 20 it 's hard to imagine a better purchase !
 Columbia fleece vests are the best I 've ever owned -LRB- it 's the third Columbia fleece I 've purchased -RRB- . They 're warm and very durable without being too bulky , making for a good fit and a nice appearance .
 My Significant Other needed something easy to get into because of shoulder surgery ... Perfect for him ! The warmth is wonderful ; the sizing worked out great . He did n't have a vest like this , but now he 's talking about getting another one , in another color . Pricing is perfect too . Ca n't think of any negative !
 Definitely get one size smaller than what you normally wear . I almost always wear an XL and when I tried this on it was baggy and roomy and with an item like this you want it to be snugger .
 I bought this for my husband because he likes a fleece vest with a collar . He is very pleased and the vest looks great . The collar is big enough to really keep the wind off your neck .
 Its comfortable , warm , a little short in length but overall a really nice vest for me to wear in all types of weather . If I had to complain about one thing it would be that it is not fleece like I thought it would be so make sure you know what you 're buying . Other then that a nice product though !
 The vest fits well and is well made . If it had a zippered breast pocket it would be ideal and would get 5 stars . I would order it again .
 As it usually happens , Columbia makes the best and tis vest is not an exception . comfortable , nice and well made .
 All I wanted was a basic vest for cool summer days . Does the job perfectly . Will not stop the wind or keep you very warm - but if you are a guy needing pockets for your wallet - this works well .
 I have wide shoulders -LRB- 50 Regular suit jacket -RRB- , and the XL fit me perfect . I was especially pleased with the collar - which was shorter when popped than the previous Columbia vest I had owned . My previous fleece vest from Columbia lasted me about 2 years , so I have high hopes for this one as well . Very soft , great fit , extremely comfortable and versatile .
 Purchased this vest as a team vest for our local biathlon team . The fit was slightly large , but that is good for winter wear . The length was just below belt line . This is ideal for keeping the lower back warm while skiing and also shooting . Everyone that got a vest on our team was very pleased with the fit and the look . Great for training and looks good too !
 Dumb me , I ordered the wrong size . No problem with this purchase . It was easy to return and reorder the correct size . Credit came through for this purchase with days of me shipping wrong size back . This firm is `` On he Ball '' when it comes to handling a situation like this .
 While I do n't get too excited by clothing , and this is no exception , I do find this is a well made , comfortably warm vest , that I am glad I purchased .
 I wear this as an insulating layering or by itself over a shirt . It looks much better than my Columbia fleece which does n't have much shape . I like that it is super light and moderately warm .
 I ordered several of these in different colors . The quality is great and the sizing is true . Furthermore , they have come out of the washer & dryer looking like new each and every time . If additional colors become available , I wo n't hesitate to order more .
 Ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas . Beautiful red shade , and fits extremely well . He is very happy and I was pleased that it arrived so quickly and in perfect condition .
 Have several different brands . . this is the best value of all ... fits great quality stitching and best price of all seen
 Extremely pleased with this purchase . After having ordered the wrong color by mistake , i quickly ordered again . Came exactly as described and within given time . No disappointments here !
 The vest is great -- second one I 've purchased ; however , the zipper , as the vest ages , has a tendency to pull apart at the bottom . The reason is the very short insert piece . Increase the depth of the insert and this vest would rate 5 stars . I bought my first vest at Mervins and when they went out of business I never found this make of vest again until I checked Amazon.com -- a great source and great products .
 I bought this vest for a casual look around the office and not at all disappointed . The sizing is about average , the look is great , and as it is Columbia , the material is of good quality . It will keep one warm in the winter months .
 This was a Christmas gift for my husband that he actually loved . Thanks for a great buy . Will be back !
 I 've had this vest for about a month now & I really do enjoy it.I 've had similar vests in the past , but I needed something newer to wear around the office and under my winter coat when a sweater or hoody just does n't work.The vest is very soft & does n't get caught on much . I bought the dark grey hoping that it would `` hide '' my dogs hair unlike the black vest . And it does . I have a beagle , and I can barely notice when -LRB- a few/decent amount -RRB- of his white & black hairs get on it . Some fleece seems to attract dog hair & never let go - this does NOT.The only negative I have about this vest , as others noted , is that there is n't a pull string around the waist . This has n't really bothered me , but I would like to tighten it up just a little bit.I work outdoors so this is perfect for helping me layer up but allowing me something to wear that wo n't bulk up & slow down my arm movement which happens if you wear too many sweaters or hoody 's . I plan on buying another in a few months so I do n't wear this one out too much . Awesome price too . I checked a couple of stores online and no one had the same price as Amazon .
 I just want to say that is the best way to keep you warm , high quality product and very comfortable .
 My experience with this Columbia vest made me feel it was spot on for size . The side pockets a bonus for a mid-layer piece . The vest itself let me wanting a little more . The collar is double the weight of the main body of the vest . It is a nice vest but thin for use as a mid-layer . I myself would have preferred if the body was equal to the collar in weight , but for the price I paid I 'd have to say it matches the quality . I guess I expected a little more from Columbia , as I own other products from them that always went beyond my expectations . Guess I 'll just have to be a little creative in my layering to get the best use out of this purchase . The style and color are nice , but I also got the `` bunching '' effect during active use , maybe better as a low activity use item , walking around town and such . It really comes down to what you 'll be using it for , activity level and quality of other layering items .
 Ordered the Large in Green color and was a great value . Quality was excellent as you would expect from Columbia .
 These vests are well made , stylish and fullfill their purpose exceptionally . They provide a little extra warmth at home when the thermostat is set down low to save energy . But being sleveless they do n't make you sweat . The sizes are exactly as specified . I normally wear large in shirts and jackets , and the large vest fits perfectly .
 Works for what I wanted . Something to wear while walking in cooler temps , where I did n't want a full coat .
 This product was first class -LRB- not a second -RRB- and was as ordered and on time . Ca n't get any better than that .
 This vest is soft yet rugged , true to size and just right for my son for Christmas .
 It 's hard for me to find some shirt with right size sleeve and collar . But that would be a problem for a vest , :-RRB- . I do n't like the zippers on the pockets , i never put any stuff in the pockets . Overall , this is a good vest for me , I wish it a little bit warmer .
 Columbia sizes are really big so just be a little conservative in ordering for sizes . Buy is for less than 20 bucks for getting value .
 I was satified with the product my only concern is that the color was off black insteadof black .
 One of the better purchases I 've made , in terms of satisfaction and value.The product is well-made and durable , which you come to expect from Columbia . It can be had for a good price and should last for a long time . Fits true to size , zipper works fine , and it does its job
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He finds them to be warm yet keeps his arms free at work . This Columbia vest is very nice and thick . Very nicely made and of good quality .
 Bought this for my husband , and he really liked it . The vest is generously cut and well sewn . It 's also very soft and the color is true and pleasing.Just right for those chilly nights when a long sleeved sweater would be `` too much . ''
 What 's to review ? It is fleece , warm , I picked the color and got what I wanted . I did get a better price than I expected.Here is something review-worthy
 This is a good vest and I enjoy the heck out of mine . I actually own two in different colours , since I was given another one several years ago for my birthday . There are already a lot of reviews and opinions here so I will not be too redundant.The vest is Polartec fleece -LRB- 200 mid-weight -RRB- so it keeps the core warm and comfortable down to about 40 degrees F. Any colder and I must go to a higher tech solution . It works wet or dry , and drys pretty quickly if soaked.It 's a cozy piece of gear and I think a perfect gift item for a loved one since they will think of you in the comfort and warmth of it . I actually LIKE that short fuzzy fibres starts to clump and pill like a snuggly , familiar stuffed teddy bear after only a few washings . I often use it as a throw blanket or a pillow -LRB- esp on airline flights -RRB- . It is also very easy to maintain and as I have two , I often have one in the wash as I 'm wearing the other one.I like the roomy sizing as I use this for layering , and this is an intermediate layer . When zipped all the way up , it practically serves as it 's own Polartec scarf around the neck . Being a taller/larger human , I appreciate that this vest is available in extended sizes too.The design of the vest is simple with a stand up/fold down collar , 2 zippered side slash pockets at the waist , and the Columbia logo on the chest.Herein lies , my first minor criticism ... value . For a simple , unlined vest without any `` extras '' -LRB- like chest pocket , map pocket , interior pockets , drawstring at the bottom or the waist , throat abrasion guard , dbl access zipper , uppers shell , back hook loop , even zipper pulls with whistles , compasses and LED lights -RRB- I would expect a basic level price . If you shop around even online you should quickly get a feel for what the no frills model vs. the all the bells and whistles model are comparatively worth.The two pockets that it does have utilizes this elastized sateen material as the interior . Not only is this pocket lining not very warm , but I find that it snags uncomfortably on little dry skin flakes , hangnails , and tiny dry skin spurs on my hands . It might be just me , but it makes it unpleasant to put my hands in the pockets -LRB- for warmth -RRB- . On both of my Columbia vests , I have replaced the pocket liners with nice non-snagging flat mesh -LRB- like that found in luggage pockets -RRB- . Well the world is what you make of it , so of course I have made some heavy mods to my vests , which have made them my favourites and practically daily wear for me.Columbia makes consistently high quality products -LRB- overseas -RRB- geared toward the outdoor person , so paying a little bit extra for the brand name logo is not that painful I guess .
 This vest is very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear . Most of the time I wear it with short sleeved shirts . When zipped , it 's just right for those 45-50 degree days -LRB- as long as you 're not out in the chill for really long periods - but fine for car-to-store , or short walks -RRB- . It 's also great around the house when you want to drop the thermostat a few degrees to save a little on heating costs . My only disappointment is the main zipper . Sometimes it takes several tries to get it started , and it often sticks mid-zip -LRB- as if there was grit or something in it -RRB- . It always ends up working , but not always smoothly . I 'd definitely recommend the vest , and I suspect my zipper issue is not a design flaw , but rather a production glitch , which would not likely affect other buyers .
 I have purchased Columbia products I have liked in the past . So this was not a difficult choice form me . It is sized correctly for the big guys . I ordered a xxlt and it fits just the way it should . I nice way to add a bit of extra warmth under a jacket that need a little help . Good price and a quality product that was shipped fast .
 Ca n't beat the price , but the vest is larger than I thought a large would be - should 've got a medium .
 This Columbia vest is a quality product and is equipped with a durable zipper , style and feel .
 I got two of these , the blue and the Cattail , which is just brown . They are nice and warm . They look good . They run a little bit big . I got an XL , and I usually wear an XL in everything . I 'm probably right in between a L and an XL . I 'm 6 ' and 240 lbs , if that helps you order yours correctly .
 My son really loves this vest . We ordered two in different colors . It looked very nice on him and he wore it every other day with jeans . A great vest !
 Bought this for my dad for Christmas . He really llikes it . Fits really well and was just as promised and described .
 Perfect fit - this was purchased for an elderly person for indoor wear . It 's not black and it 's not grey - more like graphite . It is very lightweight and keeps him cozy and warm in these cold months .
 We 've been wearing our own Columbia vests for quite some time here in Wisconsin , but it only recently occurred to me that it was just the thing for my 93-year-old dad in Florida , who 's often cold , despite fairly warm temperatures . He loves the vest 's softness and is enjoying having something more youthful and &#34; cool &#34; to wear . I 'm happy to know that it 's easily machine wash and dryable .
 I picked this up to use as a stand-alone or extra layering depending on the temperature . This vest is great - it 's like wearing a soft fleece blanket.It fits easily under all my jackets or sweatshirts . A nice bonus is the zip pockets - they 're great for my phone or warming up my hands very fast .
 I like Columbia garments for myself . So I bought one for My Dad for Christmas . It fits well in the XL and is nicely made.Washable too !!
 Quick service , good price and no complaints after wearing this for a month . Considering ordering another in a different color .
 Great vest for cool sunny days . Vest is a little on the thin side . It looks great and feels great . The only problem occurs is that it lets wind in and out very easily . I would recommend this to a friend , but do n't look for a whole lot of warmth from it .
 Warm and made well and comfortable . Husband wears a large but had to order in medium size . He loves it but beware it runs large . Price was great too !
 Bought this at half the price to replace an old Columbia vest in which the zipper fell apart after a year . Wore it 5 days a week for work so I got my monies worth although I paid full price for that one .
 Columbia Men 's Cathedral Peak VestAmple sizing for stout waste . Soft , good feeling fabric with good zippers and warm comfort.Good color and value for a casual look.It can be worn most of the time for a light jacket or coat . Easy to maintain .
 Like the columbia fleece product they are soft . I got the same product from a discount store and it was cheaper even after tax . I have to rate it as 4 because of the product quality .
 This is my second Columbia vest and I really like them . I would recommend this vest to anyone . I like to wear it to work with my dress shirts and ties . Looks sharp .
 I have received this Vest , It is according the picture and it is beautiful , I like the color and I recommend to the people buy this product .
 This vest is the best value in a fleece vest that I 've found , hands down -- for quality , comfort , durability ... I travel constantly and I like the charcoal color because it shows no lint , hair etc. . I lost one of these and replaced it immediately . It 's perfect for layering in cool or cold weather ... but also for that little extra warmth I need in a refrigerated movie theater . -- When I replaced my lost vest I looked at other brands again and was reminded that this Columbia vest is the best thing out there for the money ... by far .
 Lightweight . I wear it mostly at night in my hammock to keep warm throughout the night . Layers well . Added a drawstring at the waist . Easy to do but would have preferred it was included .
 Although the product is great . It was not the exact color as published . It does not have a different color on the neck
 It was wright for what I was looking for . It arrived in good conditions but the coulor is a bit different that in the picture anyway it fits well , thanks .
 Ca n't beat this vest especially for the price ! I have purchased 3 of them !
 My son was very pleased with this vest . I liked the price for a name like Columbia Sportwear . I also liked how fast it was sent to me .
 The vest is comfortable and roomy , though not the very best of materials .
 This was a gift for someone . From what I saw , he was very pleased with it . The item arrived in a very timely manner .
 Purchased two of these for Christmas gifts . Was very impressed with the quality . Would definitely buy again !
 I bought this for my husband last year , for Christmas . At this point in time , no complaints at all from him . Washes well and wears well , and its light color does n't show white dog hair , which was a must for a new vest !
 Quality is good but I need Longs and they dont seem to have many longs
 Wonderful vest at retail price , the Amazon has outdone itself.For $ 12 + tax , it seems like a steal to me.The material is very soft and of good craftmanship.thank you , Amazon and Columbia
 This product is a good value . Nothing spectacular , but a good deal . I use it as a good layer for skiing to provide warmth for my core without restricting shoulder and elbow movement . It more than adequately provides what I need .
 Every piece of Columbia clothing that I own is top quality and this is no different . It 's a lightweight , and yet warm vest perfect for those crisp fall days .
 Good light weight Vest.Material soft and flexible.Deep pockets . The fit was great . I wear mine in the office . I would recommend .
 This vest is similar to my Columbia Fleece jacket -- both are excellent and perform very well , especially at this price point . Fast delivery too .
 Was just what i was looking for . Brand new with tags and shipped very quickly . My husband loves it . Color looks exactly same as shown in the pic as well .
 I bought this as soon as the Winter cold hit NM and love it . The XL I first purchased was a bit short -LRB- I 'm 6 ' 5 &#34; -RRB- so I then bought an XLT which I put in the morning and wear till I retire at night . Excellent warmth and comfort . Excellent value for money .
 These vests are the most comfortable and great lookingAnd are very affordable and go great with any causual outfit
 My wife bought a couple of these first . I saw them and liked what I saw . Then I learned that she had bought a men 's vest , so I was pretty sure I could have one , too ! The zipper on the pockets is necessary , since the bottom of the opening is about even with the bottom of the pocket and things can fall out . I found one that fits my chest but it is loose at the waist . I will probably take a seam in a bit to correct that . The material is pleasingly soft and warm . They clean up in the washing machine.My wife 's two vests are the same size , but the waistband is larger on one than the other . They were manufactured in different countries .
 Awesome vest . Better than expected , well packed and arrived quickly ! I give it 2 thumbs up and my highest recommendation !
 A gift for my Grandson , quality and craftsmanship excellent , could not ask for a better product , or reliability . Thank you for a great fitting product , my Grandson absolutely loves it .
 I gave my husband this for Christmas and he is pleased , so I am too . Looks good , is comfortable . Have only had it less than 1 week .
 Honestly do n't know what 's all the hype about the North Face is . The good old Columbia looks great , feels comfortable and is well made . Navy color is very pleasant to the eye . I am very happy with the vest .
 My husband absolutely loved his vest I got him . We have even bought these in different colors . We would recommend this to anyone looking for a vest to wear as a casual attire or even a dressy attire .
 Bought this vest for my brother and he loves it . I really liked the color of it because its so different .
 The fit , number of zippered pockets , and quality of fabric are all in keeping with a fleece vest that might have cost $ 15 or so more .
 Got this as a present for my dad . He loved it . Ordered an xl should have gone smaller product runs big
 When you are my size , finding the right clothing is a challenge and buying it on line a bit of a risk . I was happy when they arrived and fit perfectly . They are comfortable and well made . A great value .

 this shirt is a really cool shirt . i wear purchased one of these shirts and i wear it everyday . and the girls come running . i have to beat them off with a stick .
 I own the Austin Reed dartmouth blazer in every color in which they make it -- it is a staple of my business wardrobe . Well made , quality fabric , nicely tailored , classic lines , appropriate for a professional woman . -LRB- something that can be hard to find at times -RRB- It should be noted , however , that the periwinkle and raspberry colors are lovely , but the fabric and buttons are slightly different than the `` classic '' colors -LRB- lighter -RRB- and the linings and interfacings are not as substantial as the brown , navy , camel , red and ivory . It 's still a good value , particularly as these are colors appropriate to warmer seasons and climates , but I was a bit surprised .
 This is a great fit for a silk shirt . I thought it would not be a close fit being silk , but I was wrong . This item fits snug and looks great on . Both alone and layered . I would recommend this shirt to people that like the look of a tight tank .
 I love my Silk Tank Tops . I wear them to work under my dress shirts and the feel is very nice . Much more comfie than the Hanes cotton tanks . The quality is very good for the price . The initial fit was just a tad snug , but stretched out just a bit after a couple of washes/wears and is very comfortable now . I tried wearing one on a hike but i find the coolmax type active wear handles sweating much better than silk . But for casual wear , or sleeping at night I love them .
 I never tried or even heard of silk tank tops , but now I will never go back . It 's a great under shirt/workout shirt . I like the way it feels like im wearing nothing at all .
 I bought this top for my 18 year old son -- thought it looked comfortable to wear under shirts etc. . It is . He likes wearing it , but he says he would never wear it alone . It is a wee bit too ` feminine ' to wear on top . Would I buy another one ? I do n't know . I think for him , the basic cotton tank tops are more versatile .

 It looks exact to the picture :-RRB- buy it . . watch amazon they fluctuate their prices !!
 Like I said for th three or four bucks it 's a good keychaine . Homies needs to do more of these .

 I own about seven of these!Great all weather hats , very cool in the summer , and I like the fact that they can be washed on a gentle cycle .

 Fits great and what a great price -- medium weight - true to size for mens large . Priced locally at $ 65 dollars
 love columbia products , it helps keep my chest warm so I can lower the heat in the house during the daytime .
 This vest is exactly what I wanted , lightweight yet warm , does n't hinder arm and shoulder motion ; very soft comfortable material .
 I chose thie vest because of the brand and color . It is good quality and stylish . Shipping was fast . I 'm happy , happy , happy !
 Fits just right , material is a nice weight . very warm . Columbia products are always nice . ca n't go wrong with this vest .
 Vest is a nice weight , not too heavy or too lightweight . Great over a long sleeve t-shirt or henley . The charcoal color is really nice . It holds up well through repeated washings . He got this vest last year for Christmas and recently lost it but he loves it so much he asked for a replacement . So if your husband is forgetful like mine you might want to get two . : -RRB-

 Great extra layer for the winter.Very good quality . Generous pockets.Extremely comfortable.Logo over the breast is pleasantly inconspicuous .
 Most of my winter gear is from Columbia and I 've never had any complaints about it . It 's about half the price of a comparable North Face garment and works just as well .
 Like all Columbia products , this item arrived true to fit and size . I purchased this item for my husband and he wears it all the time . It washes well and is very durable . We have had this product for two years and it still looks and feels brand new .
 I bought this to layer under my coat when the weather dips below freezing . It 's comfortable , soft , and keeps me warm . I also like the blue color . Dropped one star because it seems to be made for people with pot bellies . I 'm 6 ' 1 180 and the medium fits perfectly lengthwise and in the shoulder/chest area but there 's a lot of extra fabric in the middle .
 Nice color and Im wanting to buy another vest different color . I highly reccomend to buy , columbia has great cloths .
 Fleece is fleece , but this vest is surprisingly well put-together . The only thing is it missing is a third pocket -LRB- the small vertical one near the left center that most other vests have -RRB- .
 I was very satisfied with the vest . I would get a size smaller than your usual size , they run big .
 Works for what I wanted . Something to wear while walking in cooler temps , where I did n't want a full coat .
 This product was first class -LRB- not a second -RRB- and was as ordered and on time . Ca n't get any better than that .

 Columbia sizes are really big so just be a little conservative in ordering for sizes . Buy is for less than 20 bucks for getting value .
 I was satified with the product my only concern is that the color was off black insteadof black .
 very nice vest . light yet warm enough and not too hot during warmer days . the run a little big , I ordered a Large and had to exchange it for a M and I run on the larger side ... in all great buy I would recommend to a friend hands down ...
 I lost a vest that I previously owned , so I was looking for one to replace it . I am very satisfied with the fit and color of the one I purchased .
 Not the first vest of this type from Columbia that I 've purchased . Exactly what I wanted , soft , light weight but provides the warmth I want . Seems easy to mantian , wears good over time , easy to fold and carry if not needed . Satisfied .
 Have several different brands . . this is the best value of all ... fits great quality stitching and best price of all seen
 Extremely pleased with this purchase . After having ordered the wrong color by mistake , i quickly ordered again . Came exactly as described and within given time . No disappointments here !
 The vest is great -- second one I 've purchased ; however , the zipper , as the vest ages , has a tendency to pull apart at the bottom . The reason is the very short insert piece . Increase the depth of the insert and this vest would rate 5 stars . I bought my first vest at Mervins and when they went out of business I never found this make of vest again until I checked Amazon.com -- a great source and great products .
 I bought this vest for a casual look around the office and not at all disappointed . The sizing is about average , the look is great , and as it is Columbia , the material is of good quality . It will keep one warm in the winter months .
 This was a Christmas gift for my husband that he actually loved . Thanks for a great buy . Will be back !
 I 've had this vest for about a month now & I really do enjoy it.I 've had similar vests in the past , but I needed something newer to wear around the office and under my winter coat when a sweater or hoody just does n't work.The vest is very soft & does n't get caught on much . I bought the dark grey hoping that it would `` hide '' my dogs hair unlike the black vest . And it does . I have a beagle , and I can barely notice when -LRB- a few/decent amount -RRB- of his white & black hairs get on it . Some fleece seems to attract dog hair & never let go - this does NOT.The only negative I have about this vest , as others noted , is that there is n't a pull string around the waist . This has n't really bothered me , but I would like to tighten it up just a little bit.I work outdoors so this is perfect for helping me layer up but allowing me something to wear that wo n't bulk up & slow down my arm movement which happens if you wear too many sweaters or hoody 's . I plan on buying another in a few months so I do n't wear this one out too much . Awesome price too . I checked a couple of stores online and no one had the same price as Amazon .
 I just want to say that is the best way to keep you warm , high quality product and very comfortable .
 One of the better purchases I 've made , in terms of satisfaction and value.The product is well-made and durable , which you come to expect from Columbia . It can be had for a good price and should last for a long time . Fits true to size , zipper works fine , and it does its job
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He finds them to be warm yet keeps his arms free at work . This Columbia vest is very nice and thick . Very nicely made and of good quality .
 Bought this for my husband , and he really liked it . The vest is generously cut and well sewn . It 's also very soft and the color is true and pleasing.Just right for those chilly nights when a long sleeved sweater would be `` too much . ''
 Ca n't beat this vest especially for the price ! I have purchased 3 of them !
 My son was very pleased with this vest . I liked the price for a name like Columbia Sportwear . I also liked how fast it was sent to me .
 The vest is comfortable and roomy , though not the very best of materials .
 This was a gift for someone . From what I saw , he was very pleased with it . The item arrived in a very timely manner .
 Purchased two of these for Christmas gifts . Was very impressed with the quality . Would definitely buy again !
 My experience with this Columbia vest made me feel it was spot on for size . The side pockets a bonus for a mid-layer piece . The vest itself let me wanting a little more . The collar is double the weight of the main body of the vest . It is a nice vest but thin for use as a mid-layer . I myself would have preferred if the body was equal to the collar in weight , but for the price I paid I 'd have to say it matches the quality . I guess I expected a little more from Columbia , as I own other products from them that always went beyond my expectations . Guess I 'll just have to be a little creative in my layering to get the best use out of this purchase . The style and color are nice , but I also got the `` bunching '' effect during active use , maybe better as a low activity use item , walking around town and such . It really comes down to what you 'll be using it for , activity level and quality of other layering items .
 Ordered the Large in Green color and was a great value . Quality was excellent as you would expect from Columbia .
 These vests are well made , stylish and fullfill their purpose exceptionally . They provide a little extra warmth at home when the thermostat is set down low to save energy . But being sleveless they do n't make you sweat . The sizes are exactly as specified . I normally wear large in shirts and jackets , and the large vest fits perfectly .
 Warm and made well and comfortable . Husband wears a large but had to order in medium size . He loves it but beware it runs large . Price was great too !
 Bought this at half the price to replace an old Columbia vest in which the zipper fell apart after a year . Wore it 5 days a week for work so I got my monies worth although I paid full price for that one .
 Columbia Men 's Cathedral Peak VestAmple sizing for stout waste . Soft , good feeling fabric with good zippers and warm comfort.Good color and value for a casual look.It can be worn most of the time for a light jacket or coat . Easy to maintain .
 Like the columbia fleece product they are soft . I got the same product from a discount store and it was cheaper even after tax . I have to rate it as 4 because of the product quality .
 This is my second Columbia vest and I really like them . I would recommend this vest to anyone . I like to wear it to work with my dress shirts and ties . Looks sharp .
 I have received this Vest , It is according the picture and it is beautiful , I like the color and I recommend to the people buy this product .
 This vest is the best value in a fleece vest that I 've found , hands down -- for quality , comfort , durability ... I travel constantly and I like the charcoal color because it shows no lint , hair etc. . I lost one of these and replaced it immediately . It 's perfect for layering in cool or cold weather ... but also for that little extra warmth I need in a refrigerated movie theater . -- When I replaced my lost vest I looked at other brands again and was reminded that this Columbia vest is the best thing out there for the money ... by far .
 This was a great purchase for my husbands birthday . Very well cut and designed using quality materials that wear well . I purchsed the navy color and it is a very nice shade more of a navy/grey that goes well with everything . My husband wears a size 42 jacket so I purchased the large since the medium I bought him before fit a little too close for his liking , the large is a little roomier . Columbia is always a good product and the price was good too .
 This is a beautifully made vest and my husband loves the color -LRB- bark -RRB- . From another review I was tipped off that the vest runs large , so I got a size smaller than my husband 's usual size -LRB- XL to L -RRB- . It fits perfectly .
 I wear this nearly every day in the office to stay warm . It 's fleece is perfect , and I love the freedom to move my arms . Size is perfect . No complaints .
 Great extra layer to add during the winter months for a fair price . Looks great too around the office or at home .
 My son and my husband loved their new vests . They love the feel and fit and the colors . I will have to remember to get them some more .
 Very nicely made Vest.Columbia has great products.Like the texture of the material.Pictures on amazon page could be better .
 The fit is not too loose and the cypress color is a gray-green cross . Nice neutral color for men . This was purchased for use in winter time , but it 's rather thin to wear alone . It 's better suited for use in spring-time or under a jacket since it 's not bulky .
 Great ! The fabric felt very gentle , and it 's very light . My husband love it very much . I also introduced it to our friends , one of them placed an order , so I bought it again . The size is a little bit bigger .
 The product was made well . It looks good has a lining but I found that it was not as warm as a similar product purchased over 10 years ago . I did not return it as when the weather gets warmer or when I will wear it inside .
 He likes it . A basic black vest . Seems well made unlike some brands whose zippers are not the best quality . If you are not broad shouldered though the sleeve area in the large size is a bit &#34; wingy &#34; looking . My husband is tall but not bulky so it is a little too big in that respect .
 Second of the same type for me . Perfect for cool weather . Yes indeed . comfy warm not restrictive . All one could ask .
 Absolutely a fine purchase . I really like this vest -- the fit , the breathability , the warmth . Excellent quality . I recommend it highly .
 My wife wanted one for Traveling , got it , Love 's it , She is very Happy and i am very Happy . Thanks
 We are very pleased with the Vest that we purchased and are looking forward to giving it to my Father in Law for the holiday . I am sure he will be happy . Sizing looks accurate as does fabric and style . It will be a great gift for him
 This is a great vest . I ordered a medium , I am a 38 &#34; in chest , yet the medium was too big for me really -LRB- if you want a close to the body fit -RRB- . I will get this vest again in a smaller size and other color .
 This vest is of decent quality , not quite as good as the previous Columbia fleece vest as it is thinner . The color is more of a faded black or dark grey than black . I think I would have been disappointed if I had paid full price but for $ 25 it is worth it . I would buy it again .
 everything in order , very good quality product , service stock.came charging according to the agreement.excellent , recommended to all users .
 I ordered this as something to layer underneath my work jackets . It fits well , so it should be comfortable when layering . Even if this just lasts through this winter , it was a great deal at this price.I have a lot of Colombia jackets -LRB- fleece , rain shell , omni-heat jacket , etc. -RRB- , and I have never been disappointed .
 This vest is just right when a jacket is too much , or when a less bulky additional layer is needed . It is true to size and is well constructed . I plan to add other colors to my collection .
 Quality is good , not as thin as some said . Fit is small than usual . I wear a medium usually but was glad I got a small .
 The vest is comfortable and is made well . The size is my only reason for giving 4 stars . The vest runs on the large side . If you want a tighter fit you will have to order at least one size smaller than what you normally wear . It would be better with an elastic draw string too .
 I ordered several of these in different colors . The quality is great and the sizing is true . Furthermore , they have come out of the washer & dryer looking like new each and every time . If additional colors become available , I wo n't hesitate to order more .
 Ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas . Beautiful red shade , and fits extremely well . He is very happy and I was pleased that it arrived so quickly and in perfect condition .
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He is very fussy and almost always finds something -LRB- even if it is really minor -RRB- wrong with anything he either buys or receives . He has worn this vest 3 times and has only had it for 6 days ! The fit was on target a large is a large . The craftsmanship above average . The price very good . This large fit nicely over a bit more belly than desired but would still fit well minus the extra pounds .
 I bought this vest for my husband for Christmas . It was perfect . He 's 6 ' 2 '' and about 220lbs and the XL fits him perfectly . He loves wearing it . It 's great for Southern winters were it does n't get too cold .
 This vest is very warm . It fits snug to your body keeping in your core body heat.The pockets are large . . perfect for someone who likes to carry a lot of things with them.The collar can be flipped up to cover more of your neck , or folded down when it 's not as cold.The fleece is very soft , and the vest overall is made well . I recommend this vest if you ` relooking to keep warm this winter . . either worn solo or as part of your winter layered clothing .
 I have been wearing this vest everyday since i got it . the color is great and the warmth is perfect . its not cold enough to wear heavy down jacket but this is just right for the cool days and nights here is S. Calif. thank you
 I ordered this one night , and had it in my hands within 3 business days - with regular shipping . It is a very good layer to add to any winter gear . It has two side zip-up pockets , and the collar zips all the way up if you need . It is super lightweight , and very warm -LRB- for a vest -RRB- . This vest does stop a tiny bit of wind , but not much . On a cool rainy day , wear this underneath a non-insulated rain jacket -LRB- shell -RRB- , and it 's perfect ! -- Very nice !
 This vest was exactly what I wanted . It has a furry texture -LRB- not all fleeces have that same texture -RRB- ; it has pockets that completely sewn into the garment -LRB- some sew it only on one edge -RRB- ; it has room in the pockets all the way to the side edge -LRB- and not just to the edge of the zipper -RRB- . The fit was good ; the sizes run large , so a L fits an XL person . I am very please and will probably purchase another .
 I bought this for my husband because he likes a fleece vest with a collar . He is very pleased and the vest looks great . The collar is big enough to really keep the wind off your neck .
 Its comfortable , warm , a little short in length but overall a really nice vest for me to wear in all types of weather . If I had to complain about one thing it would be that it is not fleece like I thought it would be so make sure you know what you 're buying . Other then that a nice product though !
 The vest fits well and is well made . If it had a zippered breast pocket it would be ideal and would get 5 stars . I would order it again .
 I had to replace a vest the job gave me because it was wearing out . I decided to order these vest in different colors . They go great with whatever I wear at the job . The quality is good for the money . I 'm known as the vest guy now .
 fits great , the blue is amazing , its warm but not too warm , I simply love this one . also got the black one and this a great product .
 I received just what I had ordered , which was the same brand I 've always worn and it was received very quickly before the expected date was even close to being up . I love my Columbia vests .
 Estoy muy contento de haber encargado &eacute;sta prenda . El color es muy suave y elegante . La prenda es muy c&oacute;moda .
 i liked this vest , , , the texture of the fabric is ideal for all season with style the thing is there is not enough pockets , , , , , , but it really serve my life style , , , , ill going to buy two more , , , i love it.i recommend this vest for all walks of life in style .
 Just the right weight to be outside in the Fall or Spring doing things . Keeps you warm without restricting mobility . Looks good and is very functional .
 Wonderful vest at retail price , the Amazon has outdone itself.For $ 12 + tax , it seems like a steal to me.The material is very soft and of good craftmanship.thank you , Amazon and Columbia
 This product is a good value . Nothing spectacular , but a good deal . I use it as a good layer for skiing to provide warmth for my core without restricting shoulder and elbow movement . It more than adequately provides what I need .
 Every piece of Columbia clothing that I own is top quality and this is no different . It 's a lightweight , and yet warm vest perfect for those crisp fall days .
 Not a whole lot to say other than it 's well built , the fabric is very comfortable and strong feeling and the vest looks great . I 'd buy it again if I had the need .
 this is a very nice vest . looks good on and fabric is great . color stays true when washed as well
 Good light weight Vest.Material soft and flexible.Deep pockets . The fit was great . I wear mine in the office . I would recommend .
 This vest is similar to my Columbia Fleece jacket -- both are excellent and perform very well , especially at this price point . Fast delivery too .
 Was just what i was looking for . Brand new with tags and shipped very quickly . My husband loves it . Color looks exactly same as shown in the pic as well .
 I like Columbia garments for myself . So I bought one for My Dad for Christmas . It fits well in the XL and is nicely made.Washable too !!
 Quick service , good price and no complaints after wearing this for a month . Considering ordering another in a different color .
 Great vest for cool sunny days . Vest is a little on the thin side . It looks great and feels great . The only problem occurs is that it lets wind in and out very easily . I would recommend this to a friend , but do n't look for a whole lot of warmth from it .
 Awesome vest . Better than expected , well packed and arrived quickly ! I give it 2 thumbs up and my highest recommendation !
 A gift for my Grandson , quality and craftsmanship excellent , could not ask for a better product , or reliability . Thank you for a great fitting product , my Grandson absolutely loves it .
 I gave my husband this for Christmas and he is pleased , so I am too . Looks good , is comfortable . Have only had it less than 1 week .
 Honestly do n't know what 's all the hype about the North Face is . The good old Columbia looks great , feels comfortable and is well made . Navy color is very pleasant to the eye . I am very happy with the vest .
 My husband absolutely loved his vest I got him . We have even bought these in different colors . We would recommend this to anyone looking for a vest to wear as a casual attire or even a dressy attire .
 What 's to review ? It is fleece , warm , I picked the color and got what I wanted . I did get a better price than I expected.Here is something review-worthy
 This is a good vest and I enjoy the heck out of mine . I actually own two in different colours , since I was given another one several years ago for my birthday . There are already a lot of reviews and opinions here so I will not be too redundant.The vest is Polartec fleece -LRB- 200 mid-weight -RRB- so it keeps the core warm and comfortable down to about 40 degrees F. Any colder and I must go to a higher tech solution . It works wet or dry , and drys pretty quickly if soaked.It 's a cozy piece of gear and I think a perfect gift item for a loved one since they will think of you in the comfort and warmth of it . I actually LIKE that short fuzzy fibres starts to clump and pill like a snuggly , familiar stuffed teddy bear after only a few washings . I often use it as a throw blanket or a pillow -LRB- esp on airline flights -RRB- . It is also very easy to maintain and as I have two , I often have one in the wash as I 'm wearing the other one.I like the roomy sizing as I use this for layering , and this is an intermediate layer . When zipped all the way up , it practically serves as it 's own Polartec scarf around the neck . Being a taller/larger human , I appreciate that this vest is available in extended sizes too.The design of the vest is simple with a stand up/fold down collar , 2 zippered side slash pockets at the waist , and the Columbia logo on the chest.Herein lies , my first minor criticism ... value . For a simple , unlined vest without any `` extras '' -LRB- like chest pocket , map pocket , interior pockets , drawstring at the bottom or the waist , throat abrasion guard , dbl access zipper , uppers shell , back hook loop , even zipper pulls with whistles , compasses and LED lights -RRB- I would expect a basic level price . If you shop around even online you should quickly get a feel for what the no frills model vs. the all the bells and whistles model are comparatively worth.The two pockets that it does have utilizes this elastized sateen material as the interior . Not only is this pocket lining not very warm , but I find that it snags uncomfortably on little dry skin flakes , hangnails , and tiny dry skin spurs on my hands . It might be just me , but it makes it unpleasant to put my hands in the pockets -LRB- for warmth -RRB- . On both of my Columbia vests , I have replaced the pocket liners with nice non-snagging flat mesh -LRB- like that found in luggage pockets -RRB- . Well the world is what you make of it , so of course I have made some heavy mods to my vests , which have made them my favourites and practically daily wear for me.Columbia makes consistently high quality products -LRB- overseas -RRB- geared toward the outdoor person , so paying a little bit extra for the brand name logo is not that painful I guess .
 This vest is very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear . Most of the time I wear it with short sleeved shirts . When zipped , it 's just right for those 45-50 degree days -LRB- as long as you 're not out in the chill for really long periods - but fine for car-to-store , or short walks -RRB- . It 's also great around the house when you want to drop the thermostat a few degrees to save a little on heating costs . My only disappointment is the main zipper . Sometimes it takes several tries to get it started , and it often sticks mid-zip -LRB- as if there was grit or something in it -RRB- . It always ends up working , but not always smoothly . I 'd definitely recommend the vest , and I suspect my zipper issue is not a design flaw , but rather a production glitch , which would not likely affect other buyers .
 I have purchased Columbia products I have liked in the past . So this was not a difficult choice form me . It is sized correctly for the big guys . I ordered a xxlt and it fits just the way it should . I nice way to add a bit of extra warmth under a jacket that need a little help . Good price and a quality product that was shipped fast .
 Ca n't beat the price , but the vest is larger than I thought a large would be - should 've got a medium .
 This Columbia vest is a quality product and is equipped with a durable zipper , style and feel .
 Columbia gear seems to be priced much lower than other companies like Patagonia and North Face but I feel like the quality of Columbia 's clothes stands up.This vest is exceptionally warm and comfortable .
 The most important factors for me when purchasing a vest were warmth and comfort . This vest is just what I wanted in both categories . It gives me just the right amount of warmth when I go for my morning run without getting too hot once I get warmed up . It 's also comfortable and soft . The pockets have zippers so I can put my keys etc in there and do n't have to worry about them falling out . The only fault I can find is the zippers jingle a bit as I move . Overall I 'm happy with my purchase .
 I got two of these , the blue and the Cattail , which is just brown . They are nice and warm . They look good . They run a little bit big . I got an XL , and I usually wear an XL in everything . I 'm probably right in between a L and an XL . I 'm 6 ' and 240 lbs , if that helps you order yours correctly .
 My son really loves this vest . We ordered two in different colors . It looked very nice on him and he wore it every other day with jeans . A great vest !
 Bought this for my dad for Christmas . He really llikes it . Fits really well and was just as promised and described .
 Perfect fit - this was purchased for an elderly person for indoor wear . It 's not black and it 's not grey - more like graphite . It is very lightweight and keeps him cozy and warm in these cold months .
 We 've been wearing our own Columbia vests for quite some time here in Wisconsin , but it only recently occurred to me that it was just the thing for my 93-year-old dad in Florida , who 's often cold , despite fairly warm temperatures . He loves the vest 's softness and is enjoying having something more youthful and &#34; cool &#34; to wear . I 'm happy to know that it 's easily machine wash and dryable .
 I picked this up to use as a stand-alone or extra layering depending on the temperature . This vest is great - it 's like wearing a soft fleece blanket.It fits easily under all my jackets or sweatshirts . A nice bonus is the zip pockets - they 're great for my phone or warming up my hands very fast .
 I bought this for my husband last year , for Christmas . At this point in time , no complaints at all from him . Washes well and wears well , and its light color does n't show white dog hair , which was a must for a new vest !
 Quality is good but I need Longs and they dont seem to have many longs
 Lightweight . I wear it mostly at night in my hammock to keep warm throughout the night . Layers well . Added a drawstring at the waist . Easy to do but would have preferred it was included .
 Although the product is great . It was not the exact color as published . It does not have a different color on the neck
 It was wright for what I was looking for . It arrived in good conditions but the coulor is a bit different that in the picture anyway it fits well , thanks .
 As it usually happens , Columbia makes the best and tis vest is not an exception . comfortable , nice and well made .
 All I wanted was a basic vest for cool summer days . Does the job perfectly . Will not stop the wind or keep you very warm - but if you are a guy needing pockets for your wallet - this works well .
 I have wide shoulders -LRB- 50 Regular suit jacket -RRB- , and the XL fit me perfect . I was especially pleased with the collar - which was shorter when popped than the previous Columbia vest I had owned . My previous fleece vest from Columbia lasted me about 2 years , so I have high hopes for this one as well . Very soft , great fit , extremely comfortable and versatile .
 Purchased this vest as a team vest for our local biathlon team . The fit was slightly large , but that is good for winter wear . The length was just below belt line . This is ideal for keeping the lower back warm while skiing and also shooting . Everyone that got a vest on our team was very pleased with the fit and the look . Great for training and looks good too !
 Dumb me , I ordered the wrong size . No problem with this purchase . It was easy to return and reorder the correct size . Credit came through for this purchase with days of me shipping wrong size back . This firm is `` On he Ball '' when it comes to handling a situation like this .
 While I do n't get too excited by clothing , and this is no exception , I do find this is a well made , comfortably warm vest , that I am glad I purchased .
 I wear this as an insulating layering or by itself over a shirt . It looks much better than my Columbia fleece which does n't have much shape . I like that it is super light and moderately warm .
 Bought this for my son in college after he asked for a black fleece vest for his birthday ... He thought it was perfect .
 Got my Columbia Cathedral Vest yesterday . Fits great and does it 's job perfectly.Paid 36 $ for it and its worth the money . It 's also much cheaper than similar products from North Face.Great for a run !
 First off - I am very happy with this purchase as it is exactly what I expected . And for the price , it 's hard to complain.The vest fits very nicely , i got the green large . I 'm a male 5 ' 11 '' and about 190 lbs . It fits me very nicely . Sometimes these vests bunch up around the gut looking dumpy but not this one.I have washed it a few times and it seems to be holding its colour , shape and stretch . It blocks the wind nicely and is perfect for cool autumn weather/early winter when it 's not too brutal but a t-shirt just does n't cut it.The collar is one it 's best features - it folds down nicely to keep your neck warm or you can turn it up to avoid the wind . The material is very soft and feels great on your skin.As for complaints , I find that i really miss having a breast pocket and I wish the pocket zippers went up to open as opposed to down.Since neither of these features were advertised , obviously i ca n't complain about their absence - i just prefer them and will be looking for both on my next vest purchase.One thing that I will knock off a star for is the depth of the pockets . They are quite shallow causing things to fall out easily - especially if you are sitting . If you are going to make a jacket with shallow pockets i think the pocket zips should go the other way ... Just make sure you remember to close the zips ! you can fit your entire hand in if you are trying to stay warm , but there is almost no downward angle to make a good pocket for holding your keys , phone or wallet.While we 're on the topic of zippers i will say that the quality of the zips on this jacket is top-notch . it will open or close from almost any angle and i would be very surprised if they stopped working.At $ 20 it 's hard to imagine a better purchase !
 Columbia fleece vests are the best I 've ever owned -LRB- it 's the third Columbia fleece I 've purchased -RRB- . They 're warm and very durable without being too bulky , making for a good fit and a nice appearance .
 My Significant Other needed something easy to get into because of shoulder surgery ... Perfect for him ! The warmth is wonderful ; the sizing worked out great . He did n't have a vest like this , but now he 's talking about getting another one , in another color . Pricing is perfect too . Ca n't think of any negative !
 Definitely get one size smaller than what you normally wear . I almost always wear an XL and when I tried this on it was baggy and roomy and with an item like this you want it to be snugger .
 When you are my size , finding the right clothing is a challenge and buying it on line a bit of a risk . I was happy when they arrived and fit perfectly . They are comfortable and well made . A great value .
 My husband bought one of these shirts last year to try it out . I was very skeptical of the `` no ironing '' claim . I could n't believe my eyes when I took it out of the dryer the first time -- not a wrinkle to be seen . The material is truly miraculous . We both love this product and plan to buy more . Thank you , Jos. Banks !
 I own three of these shirts and they are great . I get my shirts cleaned and pressed and here is an example of what great shirts they are
 I own two of these Traveler non-wrinkle shirts and they are absolutely the best shirts I have ever owned . They are of high quality material and the size I bought was right on the money . The colors offered are very versatile with just about anything a person would own and can be worn formally or casually . I am going to stick with buying more of these shirts .
 I bought 2 to begin with and now own seven and I ca n't see myself buying other dress shirts
 I received this shirt as a gift over Christmas . Since then I have bought two more . The fit is outstanding and I have never felt a finer material in a dress shirt - it is soft yet sturdy and always appears pressed . The iron free is for real . I hate ironing and will pay the extra 20 dollars per shirt to never have to dry clean or iron again . I will never buy another shirt and I almost want to throw away my non-iron free dress shirts . I highly recommend this shirt . You will enjoy it and probably buy more of them .
 These dress shirts are the best ! Wrinkle-Free , Breathable , Durable Material , Plus lots of styles , sizes and color options . Compare side-by-side to other dress shirts and you 'll see and feel the difference .
 This is a great vest . I ordered a medium , I am a 38 &#34; in chest , yet the medium was too big for me really -LRB- if you want a close to the body fit -RRB- . I will get this vest again in a smaller size and other color .
 This vest is of decent quality , not quite as good as the previous Columbia fleece vest as it is thinner . The color is more of a faded black or dark grey than black . I think I would have been disappointed if I had paid full price but for $ 25 it is worth it . I would buy it again .
 everything in order , very good quality product , service stock.came charging according to the agreement.excellent , recommended to all users .

Even if this just lasts through this winter , it was a great deal at this price.I have a lot of Colombia jackets -LRB- fleece , rain shell , omni-heat jacket , etc. -RRB- , and I have never been disappointed .

 He likes it . A basic black vest . Seems well made unlike some brands whose zippers are not the best quality . If you are not broad shouldered though the sleeve area in the large size is a bit &#34; wingy &#34; looking . My husband is tall but not bulky so it is a little too big in that respect .
 Second of the same type for me . Perfect for cool weather . Yes indeed . comfy warm not restrictive . All one could ask .
 Columbia gear seems to be priced much lower than other companies like Patagonia and North Face but I feel like the quality of Columbia 's clothes stands up.This vest is exceptionally warm and comfortable .
 The most important factors for me when purchasing a vest were warmth and comfort . This vest is just what I wanted in both categories . It gives me just the right amount of warmth when I go for my morning run without getting too hot once I get warmed up . It 's also comfortable and soft . The pockets have zippers so I can put my keys etc in there and do n't have to worry about them falling out . The only fault I can find is the zippers jingle a bit as I move . Overall I 'm happy with my purchase .
 This was a great purchase for my husbands birthday . Very well cut and designed using quality materials that wear well . I purchsed the navy color and it is a very nice shade more of a navy/grey that goes well with everything . My husband wears a size 42 jacket so I purchased the large since the medium I bought him before fit a little too close for his liking , the large is a little roomier . Columbia is always a good product and the price was good too .
 This is a beautifully made vest and my husband loves the color -LRB- bark -RRB- . From another review I was tipped off that the vest runs large , so I got a size smaller than my husband 's usual size -LRB- XL to L -RRB- . It fits perfectly .
 Have several different brands . . this is the best value of all ... fits great quality stitching and best price of all seen
 Extremely pleased with this purchase . After having ordered the wrong color by mistake , i quickly ordered again . Came exactly as described and within given time . No disappointments here !
 The vest is great -- second one I 've purchased ; however , the zipper , as the vest ages , has a tendency to pull apart at the bottom . The reason is the very short insert piece . Increase the depth of the insert and this vest would rate 5 stars . I bought my first vest at Mervins and when they went out of business I never found this make of vest again until I checked Amazon.com -- a great source and great products .
 I bought this vest for a casual look around the office and not at all disappointed . The sizing is about average , the look is great , and as it is Columbia , the material is of good quality . It will keep one warm in the winter months .
 This was a Christmas gift for my husband that he actually loved . Thanks for a great buy . Will be back !
 I 've had this vest for about a month now & I really do enjoy it.I 've had similar vests in the past , but I needed something newer to wear around the office and under my winter coat when a sweater or hoody just does n't work.The vest is very soft & does n't get caught on much . I bought the dark grey hoping that it would `` hide '' my dogs hair unlike the black vest . And it does . I have a beagle , and I can barely notice when -LRB- a few/decent amount -RRB- of his white & black hairs get on it . Some fleece seems to attract dog hair & never let go - this does NOT.The only negative I have about this vest , as others noted , is that there is n't a pull string around the waist . This has n't really bothered me , but I would like to tighten it up just a little bit.I work outdoors so this is perfect for helping me layer up but allowing me something to wear that wo n't bulk up & slow down my arm movement which happens if you wear too many sweaters or hoody 's . I plan on buying another in a few months so I do n't wear this one out too much . Awesome price too . I checked a couple of stores online and no one had the same price as Amazon .
 I just want to say that is the best way to keep you warm , high quality product and very comfortable .
 My experience with this Columbia vest made me feel it was spot on for size . The side pockets a bonus for a mid-layer piece . The vest itself let me wanting a little more . The collar is double the weight of the main body of the vest . It is a nice vest but thin for use as a mid-layer . I myself would have preferred if the body was equal to the collar in weight , but for the price I paid I 'd have to say it matches the quality . I guess I expected a little more from Columbia , as I own other products from them that always went beyond my expectations . Guess I 'll just have to be a little creative in my layering to get the best use out of this purchase . The style and color are nice , but I also got the `` bunching '' effect during active use , maybe better as a low activity use item , walking around town and such . It really comes down to what you 'll be using it for , activity level and quality of other layering items .
 Ordered the Large in Green color and was a great value . Quality was excellent as you would expect from Columbia .
 These vests are well made , stylish and fullfill their purpose exceptionally . They provide a little extra warmth at home when the thermostat is set down low to save energy . But being sleveless they do n't make you sweat . The sizes are exactly as specified . I normally wear large in shirts and jackets , and the large vest fits perfectly .
 Works for what I wanted . Something to wear while walking in cooler temps , where I did n't want a full coat .
 This product was first class -LRB- not a second -RRB- and was as ordered and on time . Ca n't get any better than that .
 This vest is soft yet rugged , true to size and just right for my son for Christmas .
 It 's hard for me to find some shirt with right size sleeve and collar . But that would be a problem for a vest , :-RRB- . I do n't like the zippers on the pockets , i never put any stuff in the pockets . Overall , this is a good vest for me , I wish it a little bit warmer .
 Columbia sizes are really big so just be a little conservative in ordering for sizes . Buy is for less than 20 bucks for getting value .
 I was satified with the product my only concern is that the color was off black insteadof black .
 One of the better purchases I 've made , in terms of satisfaction and value.The product is well-made and durable , which you come to expect from Columbia . It can be had for a good price and should last for a long time . Fits true to size , zipper works fine , and it does its job
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He finds them to be warm yet keeps his arms free at work . This Columbia vest is very nice and thick . Very nicely made and of good quality .
 Bought this for my husband , and he really liked it . The vest is generously cut and well sewn . It 's also very soft and the color is true and pleasing.Just right for those chilly nights when a long sleeved sweater would be `` too much . ''
 Warm and made well and comfortable . Husband wears a large but had to order in medium size . He loves it but beware it runs large . Price was great too !
 Bought this at half the price to replace an old Columbia vest in which the zipper fell apart after a year . Wore it 5 days a week for work so I got my monies worth although I paid full price for that one .
 Columbia Men 's Cathedral Peak VestAmple sizing for stout waste . Soft , good feeling fabric with good zippers and warm comfort.Good color and value for a casual look.It can be worn most of the time for a light jacket or coat . Easy to maintain .
 Like the columbia fleece product they are soft . I got the same product from a discount store and it was cheaper even after tax . I have to rate it as 4 because of the product quality .
 This is my second Columbia vest and I really like them . I would recommend this vest to anyone . I like to wear it to work with my dress shirts and ties . Looks sharp .
 I have received this Vest , It is according the picture and it is beautiful , I like the color and I recommend to the people buy this product .
 This vest is the best value in a fleece vest that I 've found , hands down -- for quality , comfort , durability ... I travel constantly and I like the charcoal color because it shows no lint , hair etc. . I lost one of these and replaced it immediately . It 's perfect for layering in cool or cold weather ... but also for that little extra warmth I need in a refrigerated movie theater . -- When I replaced my lost vest I looked at other brands again and was reminded that this Columbia vest is the best thing out there for the money ... by far .
 Lightweight . I wear it mostly at night in my hammock to keep warm throughout the night . Layers well . Added a drawstring at the waist . Easy to do but would have preferred it was included .
 Although the product is great . It was not the exact color as published . It does not have a different color on the neck
 It was wright for what I was looking for . It arrived in good conditions but the coulor is a bit different that in the picture anyway it fits well , thanks .
 Ca n't beat this vest especially for the price ! I have purchased 3 of them !
 My son was very pleased with this vest . I liked the price for a name like Columbia Sportwear . I also liked how fast it was sent to me .
 The vest is comfortable and roomy , though not the very best of materials .
 This was a gift for someone . From what I saw , he was very pleased with it . The item arrived in a very timely manner .
 Purchased two of these for Christmas gifts . Was very impressed with the quality . Would definitely buy again !
 I bought this for my husband last year , for Christmas . At this point in time , no complaints at all from him . Washes well and wears well , and its light color does n't show white dog hair , which was a must for a new vest !
 Quality is good but I need Longs and they dont seem to have many longs
 Great extra layer for the winter.Very good quality . Generous pockets.Extremely comfortable.Logo over the breast is pleasantly inconspicuous .
 Most of my winter gear is from Columbia and I 've never had any complaints about it . It 's about half the price of a comparable North Face garment and works just as well .
 Like all Columbia products , this item arrived true to fit and size . I purchased this item for my husband and he wears it all the time . It washes well and is very durable . We have had this product for two years and it still looks and feels brand new .
 I bought this to layer under my coat when the weather dips below freezing . It 's comfortable , soft , and keeps me warm . I also like the blue color . Dropped one star because it seems to be made for people with pot bellies . I 'm 6 ' 1 180 and the medium fits perfectly lengthwise and in the shoulder/chest area but there 's a lot of extra fabric in the middle .
 Nice color and Im wanting to buy another vest different color . I highly reccomend to buy , columbia has great cloths .
 I wear this nearly every day in the office to stay warm . It 's fleece is perfect , and I love the freedom to move my arms . Size is perfect . No complaints .
 Great extra layer to add during the winter months for a fair price . Looks great too around the office or at home .
 My son and my husband loved their new vests . They love the feel and fit and the colors . I will have to remember to get them some more .
 Fits great and what a great price -- medium weight - true to size for mens large . Priced locally at $ 65 dollars
 love columbia products , it helps keep my chest warm so I can lower the heat in the house during the daytime .
 This vest is exactly what I wanted , lightweight yet warm , does n't hinder arm and shoulder motion ; very soft comfortable material .
 I chose thie vest because of the brand and color . It is good quality and stylish . Shipping was fast . I 'm happy , happy , happy !
 Fits just right , material is a nice weight . very warm . Columbia products are always nice . ca n't go wrong with this vest .
 Vest is a nice weight , not too heavy or too lightweight . Great over a long sleeve t-shirt or henley . The charcoal color is really nice . It holds up well through repeated washings . He got this vest last year for Christmas and recently lost it but he loves it so much he asked for a replacement . So if your husband is forgetful like mine you might want to get two . : -RRB-
 Absolutely a fine purchase . I really like this vest -- the fit , the breathability , the warmth . Excellent quality . I recommend it highly .
 My wife wanted one for Traveling , got it , Love 's it , She is very Happy and i am very Happy . Thanks
 We are very pleased with the Vest that we purchased and are looking forward to giving it to my Father in Law for the holiday . I am sure he will be happy . Sizing looks accurate as does fabric and style . It will be a great gift for him
 I had to replace a vest the job gave me because it was wearing out . I decided to order these vest in different colors . They go great with whatever I wear at the job . The quality is good for the money . I 'm known as the vest guy now .
 fits great , the blue is amazing , its warm but not too warm , I simply love this one . also got the black one and this a great product .
 I received just what I had ordered , which was the same brand I 've always worn and it was received very quickly before the expected date was even close to being up . I love my Columbia vests .
 Estoy muy contento de haber encargado &eacute;sta prenda . El color es muy suave y elegante . La prenda es muy c&oacute;moda .
 i liked this vest , , , the texture of the fabric is ideal for all season with style the thing is there is not enough pockets , , , , , , but it really serve my life style , , , , ill going to buy two more , , , i love it.i recommend this vest for all walks of life in style .
 Just the right weight to be outside in the Fall or Spring doing things . Keeps you warm without restricting mobility . Looks good and is very functional .
 very nice vest . light yet warm enough and not too hot during warmer days . the run a little big , I ordered a Large and had to exchange it for a M and I run on the larger side ... in all great buy I would recommend to a friend hands down ...
 I lost a vest that I previously owned , so I was looking for one to replace it . I am very satisfied with the fit and color of the one I purchased .
 Not the first vest of this type from Columbia that I 've purchased . Exactly what I wanted , soft , light weight but provides the warmth I want . Seems easy to mantian , wears good over time , easy to fold and carry if not needed . Satisfied .
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He is very fussy and almost always finds something -LRB- even if it is really minor -RRB- wrong with anything he either buys or receives . He has worn this vest 3 times and has only had it for 6 days ! The fit was on target a large is a large . The craftsmanship above average . The price very good . This large fit nicely over a bit more belly than desired but would still fit well minus the extra pounds .
 I bought this vest for my husband for Christmas . It was perfect . He 's 6 ' 2 '' and about 220lbs and the XL fits him perfectly . He loves wearing it . It 's great for Southern winters were it does n't get too cold .
 This vest is very warm . It fits snug to your body keeping in your core body heat.The pockets are large . . perfect for someone who likes to carry a lot of things with them.The collar can be flipped up to cover more of your neck , or folded down when it 's not as cold.The fleece is very soft , and the vest overall is made well . I recommend this vest if you ` relooking to keep warm this winter . . either worn solo or as part of your winter layered clothing .
 I have been wearing this vest everyday since i got it . the color is great and the warmth is perfect . its not cold enough to wear heavy down jacket but this is just right for the cool days and nights here is S. Calif. thank you
 I ordered this one night , and had it in my hands within 3 business days - with regular shipping . It is a very good layer to add to any winter gear . It has two side zip-up pockets , and the collar zips all the way up if you need . It is super lightweight , and very warm -LRB- for a vest -RRB- . This vest does stop a tiny bit of wind , but not much . On a cool rainy day , wear this underneath a non-insulated rain jacket -LRB- shell -RRB- , and it 's perfect ! -- Very nice !
 This vest was exactly what I wanted . It has a furry texture -LRB- not all fleeces have that same texture -RRB- ; it has pockets that completely sewn into the garment -LRB- some sew it only on one edge -RRB- ; it has room in the pockets all the way to the side edge -LRB- and not just to the edge of the zipper -RRB- . The fit was good ; the sizes run large , so a L fits an XL person . I am very please and will probably purchase another .
 Fleece is fleece , but this vest is surprisingly well put-together . The only thing is it missing is a third pocket -LRB- the small vertical one near the left center that most other vests have -RRB- .
 I was very satisfied with the vest . I would get a size smaller than your usual size , they run big .
 I got two of these , the blue and the Cattail , which is just brown . They are nice and warm . They look good . They run a little bit big . I got an XL , and I usually wear an XL in everything . I 'm probably right in between a L and an XL . I 'm 6 ' and 240 lbs , if that helps you order yours correctly .
 My son really loves this vest . We ordered two in different colors . It looked very nice on him and he wore it every other day with jeans . A great vest !
 Bought this for my dad for Christmas . He really llikes it . Fits really well and was just as promised and described .
 Perfect fit - this was purchased for an elderly person for indoor wear . It 's not black and it 's not grey - more like graphite . It is very lightweight and keeps him cozy and warm in these cold months .
 We 've been wearing our own Columbia vests for quite some time here in Wisconsin , but it only recently occurred to me that it was just the thing for my 93-year-old dad in Florida , who 's often cold , despite fairly warm temperatures . He loves the vest 's softness and is enjoying having something more youthful and &#34; cool &#34; to wear . I 'm happy to know that it 's easily machine wash and dryable .
 I picked this up to use as a stand-alone or extra layering depending on the temperature . This vest is great - it 's like wearing a soft fleece blanket.It fits easily under all my jackets or sweatshirts . A nice bonus is the zip pockets - they 're great for my phone or warming up my hands very fast .
 I like Columbia garments for myself . So I bought one for My Dad for Christmas . It fits well in the XL and is nicely made.Washable too !!
 Quick service , good price and no complaints after wearing this for a month . Considering ordering another in a different color .
 Great vest for cool sunny days . Vest is a little on the thin side . It looks great and feels great . The only problem occurs is that it lets wind in and out very easily . I would recommend this to a friend , but do n't look for a whole lot of warmth from it .
 What 's to review ? It is fleece , warm , I picked the color and got what I wanted . I did get a better price than I expected.Here is something review-worthy
 This is a good vest and I enjoy the heck out of mine . I actually own two in different colours , since I was given another one several years ago for my birthday . There are already a lot of reviews and opinions here so I will not be too redundant.The vest is Polartec fleece -LRB- 200 mid-weight -RRB- so it keeps the core warm and comfortable down to about 40 degrees F. Any colder and I must go to a higher tech solution . It works wet or dry , and drys pretty quickly if soaked.It 's a cozy piece of gear and I think a perfect gift item for a loved one since they will think of you in the comfort and warmth of it . I actually LIKE that short fuzzy fibres starts to clump and pill like a snuggly , familiar stuffed teddy bear after only a few washings . I often use it as a throw blanket or a pillow -LRB- esp on airline flights -RRB- . It is also very easy to maintain and as I have two , I often have one in the wash as I 'm wearing the other one.I like the roomy sizing as I use this for layering , and this is an intermediate layer . When zipped all the way up , it practically serves as it 's own Polartec scarf around the neck . Being a taller/larger human , I appreciate that this vest is available in extended sizes too.The design of the vest is simple with a stand up/fold down collar , 2 zippered side slash pockets at the waist , and the Columbia logo on the chest.Herein lies , my first minor criticism ... value . For a simple , unlined vest without any `` extras '' -LRB- like chest pocket , map pocket , interior pockets , drawstring at the bottom or the waist , throat abrasion guard , dbl access zipper , uppers shell , back hook loop , even zipper pulls with whistles , compasses and LED lights -RRB- I would expect a basic level price . If you shop around even online you should quickly get a feel for what the no frills model vs. the all the bells and whistles model are comparatively worth.The two pockets that it does have utilizes this elastized sateen material as the interior . Not only is this pocket lining not very warm , but I find that it snags uncomfortably on little dry skin flakes , hangnails , and tiny dry skin spurs on my hands . It might be just me , but it makes it unpleasant to put my hands in the pockets -LRB- for warmth -RRB- . On both of my Columbia vests , I have replaced the pocket liners with nice non-snagging flat mesh -LRB- like that found in luggage pockets -RRB- . Well the world is what you make of it , so of course I have made some heavy mods to my vests , which have made them my favourites and practically daily wear for me.Columbia makes consistently high quality products -LRB- overseas -RRB- geared toward the outdoor person , so paying a little bit extra for the brand name logo is not that painful I guess .
 This vest is very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear . Most of the time I wear it with short sleeved shirts . When zipped , it 's just right for those 45-50 degree days -LRB- as long as you 're not out in the chill for really long periods - but fine for car-to-store , or short walks -RRB- . It 's also great around the house when you want to drop the thermostat a few degrees to save a little on heating costs . My only disappointment is the main zipper . Sometimes it takes several tries to get it started , and it often sticks mid-zip -LRB- as if there was grit or something in it -RRB- . It always ends up working , but not always smoothly . I 'd definitely recommend the vest , and I suspect my zipper issue is not a design flaw , but rather a production glitch , which would not likely affect other buyers .
 I have purchased Columbia products I have liked in the past . So this was not a difficult choice form me . It is sized correctly for the big guys . I ordered a xxlt and it fits just the way it should . I nice way to add a bit of extra warmth under a jacket that need a little help . Good price and a quality product that was shipped fast .
 Ca n't beat the price , but the vest is larger than I thought a large would be - should 've got a medium .
 This Columbia vest is a quality product and is equipped with a durable zipper , style and feel .
 Awesome vest . Better than expected , well packed and arrived quickly ! I give it 2 thumbs up and my highest recommendation !
 A gift for my Grandson , quality and craftsmanship excellent , could not ask for a better product , or reliability . Thank you for a great fitting product , my Grandson absolutely loves it .
 I gave my husband this for Christmas and he is pleased , so I am too . Looks good , is comfortable . Have only had it less than 1 week .
 Honestly do n't know what 's all the hype about the North Face is . The good old Columbia looks great , feels comfortable and is well made . Navy color is very pleasant to the eye . I am very happy with the vest .
 My husband absolutely loved his vest I got him . We have even bought these in different colors . We would recommend this to anyone looking for a vest to wear as a casual attire or even a dressy attire .
 Bought this vest for my brother and he loves it . I really liked the color of it because its so different .
 The fit , number of zippered pockets , and quality of fabric are all in keeping with a fleece vest that might have cost $ 15 or so more .
 Got this as a present for my dad . He loved it . Ordered an xl should have gone smaller product runs big
 Wonderful vest at retail price , the Amazon has outdone itself.For $ 12 + tax , it seems like a steal to me.The material is very soft and of good craftmanship.thank you , Amazon and Columbia
 This product is a good value . Nothing spectacular , but a good deal . I use it as a good layer for skiing to provide warmth for my core without restricting shoulder and elbow movement . It more than adequately provides what I need .
 Every piece of Columbia clothing that I own is top quality and this is no different . It 's a lightweight , and yet warm vest perfect for those crisp fall days .
 Good light weight Vest.Material soft and flexible.Deep pockets . The fit was great . I wear mine in the office . I would recommend .
 This vest is similar to my Columbia Fleece jacket -- both are excellent and perform very well , especially at this price point . Fast delivery too .
 Was just what i was looking for . Brand new with tags and shipped very quickly . My husband loves it . Color looks exactly same as shown in the pic as well .
 I bought this as soon as the Winter cold hit NM and love it . The XL I first purchased was a bit short -LRB- I 'm 6 ' 5 &#34; -RRB- so I then bought an XLT which I put in the morning and wear till I retire at night . Excellent warmth and comfort . Excellent value for money .
 These vests are the most comfortable and great lookingAnd are very affordable and go great with any causual outfit
 My wife bought a couple of these first . I saw them and liked what I saw . Then I learned that she had bought a men 's vest , so I was pretty sure I could have one , too ! The zipper on the pockets is necessary , since the bottom of the opening is about even with the bottom of the pocket and things can fall out . I found one that fits my chest but it is loose at the waist . I will probably take a seam in a bit to correct that . The material is pleasingly soft and warm . They clean up in the washing machine.My wife 's two vests are the same size , but the waistband is larger on one than the other . They were manufactured in different countries .
 First off - I am very happy with this purchase as it is exactly what I expected . And for the price , it 's hard to complain.The vest fits very nicely , i got the green large . I 'm a male 5 ' 11 '' and about 190 lbs . It fits me very nicely . Sometimes these vests bunch up around the gut looking dumpy but not this one.I have washed it a few times and it seems to be holding its colour , shape and stretch . It blocks the wind nicely and is perfect for cool autumn weather/early winter when it 's not too brutal but a t-shirt just does n't cut it.The collar is one it 's best features - it folds down nicely to keep your neck warm or you can turn it up to avoid the wind . The material is very soft and feels great on your skin.As for complaints , I find that i really miss having a breast pocket and I wish the pocket zippers went up to open as opposed to down.Since neither of these features were advertised , obviously i ca n't complain about their absence - i just prefer them and will be looking for both on my next vest purchase.One thing that I will knock off a star for is the depth of the pockets . They are quite shallow causing things to fall out easily - especially if you are sitting . If you are going to make a jacket with shallow pockets i think the pocket zips should go the other way ... Just make sure you remember to close the zips ! you can fit your entire hand in if you are trying to stay warm , but there is almost no downward angle to make a good pocket for holding your keys , phone or wallet.While we 're on the topic of zippers i will say that the quality of the zips on this jacket is top-notch . it will open or close from almost any angle and i would be very surprised if they stopped working.At $ 20 it 's hard to imagine a better purchase !
 Columbia fleece vests are the best I 've ever owned -LRB- it 's the third Columbia fleece I 've purchased -RRB- . They 're warm and very durable without being too bulky , making for a good fit and a nice appearance .
 My Significant Other needed something easy to get into because of shoulder surgery ... Perfect for him ! The warmth is wonderful ; the sizing worked out great . He did n't have a vest like this , but now he 's talking about getting another one , in another color . Pricing is perfect too . Ca n't think of any negative !
 Definitely get one size smaller than what you normally wear . I almost always wear an XL and when I tried this on it was baggy and roomy and with an item like this you want it to be snugger .
 I bought this for my husband because he likes a fleece vest with a collar . He is very pleased and the vest looks great . The collar is big enough to really keep the wind off your neck .
 Its comfortable , warm , a little short in length but overall a really nice vest for me to wear in all types of weather . If I had to complain about one thing it would be that it is not fleece like I thought it would be so make sure you know what you 're buying . Other then that a nice product though !
 The vest fits well and is well made . If it had a zippered breast pocket it would be ideal and would get 5 stars . I would order it again .
 As it usually happens , Columbia makes the best and tis vest is not an exception . comfortable , nice and well made .
 All I wanted was a basic vest for cool summer days . Does the job perfectly . Will not stop the wind or keep you very warm - but if you are a guy needing pockets for your wallet - this works well .
 I have wide shoulders -LRB- 50 Regular suit jacket -RRB- , and the XL fit me perfect . I was especially pleased with the collar - which was shorter when popped than the previous Columbia vest I had owned . My previous fleece vest from Columbia lasted me about 2 years , so I have high hopes for this one as well . Very soft , great fit , extremely comfortable and versatile .
 Purchased this vest as a team vest for our local biathlon team . The fit was slightly large , but that is good for winter wear . The length was just below belt line . This is ideal for keeping the lower back warm while skiing and also shooting . Everyone that got a vest on our team was very pleased with the fit and the look . Great for training and looks good too !
 Dumb me , I ordered the wrong size . No problem with this purchase . It was easy to return and reorder the correct size . Credit came through for this purchase with days of me shipping wrong size back . This firm is `` On he Ball '' when it comes to handling a situation like this .
 While I do n't get too excited by clothing , and this is no exception , I do find this is a well made , comfortably warm vest , that I am glad I purchased .
 I wear this as an insulating layering or by itself over a shirt . It looks much better than my Columbia fleece which does n't have much shape . I like that it is super light and moderately warm .
 I ordered several of these in different colors . The quality is great and the sizing is true . Furthermore , they have come out of the washer & dryer looking like new each and every time . If additional colors become available , I wo n't hesitate to order more .
 Ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas . Beautiful red shade , and fits extremely well . He is very happy and I was pleased that it arrived so quickly and in perfect condition .
 it 's as described
 A nice belt its a good quality leather and its easy to put my buckles on .
 This is a basic belt for a great price . I could n't have asked for better quality for the price that I paid for it . If I ever do need another belt I will definitely be checking here first .
 Fantastic belt . When I saw the low price , I worried that the belt was really some sort of pleather product . This belt is made of soft and durable leather . One note though , the measurements listed match actual waste measurements . For example , if the listing says it fits up to 42 inches - the belt is only 42 inches long .
 I ca n't believe all the negative reviews there are for this belt . I am aware that it is n't top notch quality , but did you look at the price and think `` THIS IS GOING TO BE THE BEST BELT EVER ! '' ? The belt is decent quality , and for the price I could purchase 20 of these and still pay less then what i 'd pay for a belt brand new at a department store . Also , i 've been trying to find a brown belt with snaps on the back for interchangable buckles for 6 months and this is the first I found that was n't insanely priced . I would and probably will buy more of these just to have around for the future . If one breaks , big deal I spent under $ 1 for it .
 ok , this is NOT real leather it looks sort of like leather but it is n't you can find a piece of leather that cheep any where do your research if your looking for a genuine leather belt this is n't it if your looking for a belt to where around town and you do n't have people inspecting the quality of your belt no one will notice its not genuine leather its not top notch but it does the job and looks the part
 Great quick shipping ! item was as described , wear it with faded jeans and looks and feels great . would buy from again .
 this belt was VERY reasonable in price & shipping costs . MUCH cheaper than in any local stores . The quality if great as well .
 I got 2 of the belts a black , snd s brown . in my area they are hard to find
 Better than I expected . Looks kinda like real leather . Couldnt ask for a better price . Sizes are hard to judge .
 This belt arrived on time and in great condition . It is true to size and great quality for the price . I would recommend this product to anyone in need of a good belt for their belt buckle .
 my husband was needing a brown leather belt to attach his new belt buckle to . this product was exactly what he was looking for at an incredible price . We got the belt within a week and half of ordering .
 Nice leather belt , good quality , good price . Got a free buckle with it , not good quality , but what do you expect it was free . Would buy it again !!
 When you are my size , finding the right clothing is a challenge and buying it on line a bit of a risk . I was happy when they arrived and fit perfectly . They are comfortable and well made . A great value .

 I own about seven of these!Great all weather hats , very cool in the summer , and I like the fact that they can be washed on a gentle cycle .
 I love the `` Be Flirty Underwire Bra '' ! It gives great coverage and support , but still looks pretty . The plushline in the cups is also great - it 's thin and soft , but still does a solid job of keeping the rest of the world from , ahem , knowing when you 're cold . The lace on the cups does n't really show through your t-shirts , either . The black 's my favorite , but I 'm buying all the other colors now . A real find !

 I like Columbia garments for myself . So I bought one for My Dad for Christmas . It fits well in the XL and is nicely made.Washable too !!
 Quick service , good price and no complaints after wearing this for a month . Considering ordering another in a different color .
 Great vest for cool sunny days . Vest is a little on the thin side . It looks great and feels great . The only problem occurs is that it lets wind in and out very easily . I would recommend this to a friend , but do n't look for a whole lot of warmth from it .
 Awesome vest . Better than expected , well packed and arrived quickly ! I give it 2 thumbs up and my highest recommendation !
 A gift for my Grandson , quality and craftsmanship excellent , could not ask for a better product , or reliability . Thank you for a great fitting product , my Grandson absolutely loves it .
 I gave my husband this for Christmas and he is pleased , so I am too . Looks good , is comfortable . Have only had it less than 1 week .
 Honestly do n't know what 's all the hype about the North Face is . The good old Columbia looks great , feels comfortable and is well made . Navy color is very pleasant to the eye . I am very happy with the vest .
 My husband absolutely loved his vest I got him . We have even bought these in different colors . We would recommend this to anyone looking for a vest to wear as a casual attire or even a dressy attire .
 Wonderful vest at retail price , the Amazon has outdone itself.For $ 12 + tax , it seems like a steal to me.The material is very soft and of good craftmanship.thank you , Amazon and Columbia
 This product is a good value . Nothing spectacular , but a good deal . I use it as a good layer for skiing to provide warmth for my core without restricting shoulder and elbow movement . It more than adequately provides what I need .
 Every piece of Columbia clothing that I own is top quality and this is no different . It 's a lightweight , and yet warm vest perfect for those crisp fall days .
 Not a whole lot to say other than it 's well built , the fabric is very comfortable and strong feeling and the vest looks great . I 'd buy it again if I had the need .
 this is a very nice vest . looks good on and fabric is great . color stays true when washed as well
 Good light weight Vest.Material soft and flexible.Deep pockets . The fit was great . I wear mine in the office . I would recommend .
 This vest is similar to my Columbia Fleece jacket -- both are excellent and perform very well , especially at this price point . Fast delivery too .
 Was just what i was looking for . Brand new with tags and shipped very quickly . My husband loves it . Color looks exactly same as shown in the pic as well .
 Fleece is fleece , but this vest is surprisingly well put-together . The only thing is it missing is a third pocket -LRB- the small vertical one near the left center that most other vests have -RRB- .
 I was very satisfied with the vest . I would get a size smaller than your usual size , they run big .
 Works for what I wanted . Something to wear while walking in cooler temps , where I did n't want a full coat .
 This product was first class -LRB- not a second -RRB- and was as ordered and on time . Ca n't get any better than that .
 This vest is soft yet rugged , true to size and just right for my son for Christmas .
 It 's hard for me to find some shirt with right size sleeve and collar . But that would be a problem for a vest , :-RRB- . I do n't like the zippers on the pockets , i never put any stuff in the pockets . Overall , this is a good vest for me , I wish it a little bit warmer .
 Columbia sizes are really big so just be a little conservative in ordering for sizes . Buy is for less than 20 bucks for getting value .
 I was satified with the product my only concern is that the color was off black insteadof black .
 very nice vest . light yet warm enough and not too hot during warmer days . the run a little big , I ordered a Large and had to exchange it for a M and I run on the larger side ... in all great buy I would recommend to a friend hands down ...
 I lost a vest that I previously owned , so I was looking for one to replace it . I am very satisfied with the fit and color of the one I purchased .
 Not the first vest of this type from Columbia that I 've purchased . Exactly what I wanted , soft , light weight but provides the warmth I want . Seems easy to mantian , wears good over time , easy to fold and carry if not needed . Satisfied .
 Have several different brands . . this is the best value of all ... fits great quality stitching and best price of all seen
 Extremely pleased with this purchase . After having ordered the wrong color by mistake , i quickly ordered again . Came exactly as described and within given time . No disappointments here !
 The vest is great -- second one I 've purchased ; however , the zipper , as the vest ages , has a tendency to pull apart at the bottom . The reason is the very short insert piece . Increase the depth of the insert and this vest would rate 5 stars . I bought my first vest at Mervins and when they went out of business I never found this make of vest again until I checked Amazon.com -- a great source and great products .
 I bought this vest for a casual look around the office and not at all disappointed . The sizing is about average , the look is great , and as it is Columbia , the material is of good quality . It will keep one warm in the winter months .
 This was a Christmas gift for my husband that he actually loved . Thanks for a great buy . Will be back !
 I 've had this vest for about a month now & I really do enjoy it.I 've had similar vests in the past , but I needed something newer to wear around the office and under my winter coat when a sweater or hoody just does n't work.The vest is very soft & does n't get caught on much . I bought the dark grey hoping that it would `` hide '' my dogs hair unlike the black vest . And it does . I have a beagle , and I can barely notice when -LRB- a few/decent amount -RRB- of his white & black hairs get on it . Some fleece seems to attract dog hair & never let go - this does NOT.The only negative I have about this vest , as others noted , is that there is n't a pull string around the waist . This has n't really bothered me , but I would like to tighten it up just a little bit.I work outdoors so this is perfect for helping me layer up but allowing me something to wear that wo n't bulk up & slow down my arm movement which happens if you wear too many sweaters or hoody 's . I plan on buying another in a few months so I do n't wear this one out too much . Awesome price too . I checked a couple of stores online and no one had the same price as Amazon .
 I just want to say that is the best way to keep you warm , high quality product and very comfortable .
 Columbia gear seems to be priced much lower than other companies like Patagonia and North Face but I feel like the quality of Columbia 's clothes stands up.This vest is exceptionally warm and comfortable .
 The most important factors for me when purchasing a vest were warmth and comfort . This vest is just what I wanted in both categories . It gives me just the right amount of warmth when I go for my morning run without getting too hot once I get warmed up . It 's also comfortable and soft . The pockets have zippers so I can put my keys etc in there and do n't have to worry about them falling out . The only fault I can find is the zippers jingle a bit as I move . Overall I 'm happy with my purchase .
 I got two of these , the blue and the Cattail , which is just brown . They are nice and warm . They look good . They run a little bit big . I got an XL , and I usually wear an XL in everything . I 'm probably right in between a L and an XL . I 'm 6 ' and 240 lbs , if that helps you order yours correctly .
 My son really loves this vest . We ordered two in different colors . It looked very nice on him and he wore it every other day with jeans . A great vest !
 Bought this for my dad for Christmas . He really llikes it . Fits really well and was just as promised and described .
 Perfect fit - this was purchased for an elderly person for indoor wear . It 's not black and it 's not grey - more like graphite . It is very lightweight and keeps him cozy and warm in these cold months .
 We 've been wearing our own Columbia vests for quite some time here in Wisconsin , but it only recently occurred to me that it was just the thing for my 93-year-old dad in Florida , who 's often cold , despite fairly warm temperatures . He loves the vest 's softness and is enjoying having something more youthful and &#34; cool &#34; to wear . I 'm happy to know that it 's easily machine wash and dryable .
 I picked this up to use as a stand-alone or extra layering depending on the temperature . This vest is great - it 's like wearing a soft fleece blanket.It fits easily under all my jackets or sweatshirts . A nice bonus is the zip pockets - they 're great for my phone or warming up my hands very fast .
 What 's to review ? It is fleece , warm , I picked the color and got what I wanted . I did get a better price than I expected.Here is something review-worthy
 This is a good vest and I enjoy the heck out of mine . I actually own two in different colours , since I was given another one several years ago for my birthday . There are already a lot of reviews and opinions here so I will not be too redundant.The vest is Polartec fleece -LRB- 200 mid-weight -RRB- so it keeps the core warm and comfortable down to about 40 degrees F. Any colder and I must go to a higher tech solution . It works wet or dry , and drys pretty quickly if soaked.It 's a cozy piece of gear and I think a perfect gift item for a loved one since they will think of you in the comfort and warmth of it . I actually LIKE that short fuzzy fibres starts to clump and pill like a snuggly , familiar stuffed teddy bear after only a few washings . I often use it as a throw blanket or a pillow -LRB- esp on airline flights -RRB- . It is also very easy to maintain and as I have two , I often have one in the wash as I 'm wearing the other one.I like the roomy sizing as I use this for layering , and this is an intermediate layer . When zipped all the way up , it practically serves as it 's own Polartec scarf around the neck . Being a taller/larger human , I appreciate that this vest is available in extended sizes too.The design of the vest is simple with a stand up/fold down collar , 2 zippered side slash pockets at the waist , and the Columbia logo on the chest.Herein lies , my first minor criticism ... value . For a simple , unlined vest without any `` extras '' -LRB- like chest pocket , map pocket , interior pockets , drawstring at the bottom or the waist , throat abrasion guard , dbl access zipper , uppers shell , back hook loop , even zipper pulls with whistles , compasses and LED lights -RRB- I would expect a basic level price . If you shop around even online you should quickly get a feel for what the no frills model vs. the all the bells and whistles model are comparatively worth.The two pockets that it does have utilizes this elastized sateen material as the interior . Not only is this pocket lining not very warm , but I find that it snags uncomfortably on little dry skin flakes , hangnails , and tiny dry skin spurs on my hands . It might be just me , but it makes it unpleasant to put my hands in the pockets -LRB- for warmth -RRB- . On both of my Columbia vests , I have replaced the pocket liners with nice non-snagging flat mesh -LRB- like that found in luggage pockets -RRB- . Well the world is what you make of it , so of course I have made some heavy mods to my vests , which have made them my favourites and practically daily wear for me.Columbia makes consistently high quality products -LRB- overseas -RRB- geared toward the outdoor person , so paying a little bit extra for the brand name logo is not that painful I guess .
 This vest is very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear . Most of the time I wear it with short sleeved shirts . When zipped , it 's just right for those 45-50 degree days -LRB- as long as you 're not out in the chill for really long periods - but fine for car-to-store , or short walks -RRB- . It 's also great around the house when you want to drop the thermostat a few degrees to save a little on heating costs . My only disappointment is the main zipper . Sometimes it takes several tries to get it started , and it often sticks mid-zip -LRB- as if there was grit or something in it -RRB- . It always ends up working , but not always smoothly . I 'd definitely recommend the vest , and I suspect my zipper issue is not a design flaw , but rather a production glitch , which would not likely affect other buyers .
 I have purchased Columbia products I have liked in the past . So this was not a difficult choice form me . It is sized correctly for the big guys . I ordered a xxlt and it fits just the way it should . I nice way to add a bit of extra warmth under a jacket that need a little help . Good price and a quality product that was shipped fast .
 Ca n't beat the price , but the vest is larger than I thought a large would be - should 've got a medium .
 This Columbia vest is a quality product and is equipped with a durable zipper , style and feel .
 One of the better purchases I 've made , in terms of satisfaction and value.The product is well-made and durable , which you come to expect from Columbia . It can be had for a good price and should last for a long time . Fits true to size , zipper works fine , and it does its job
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He finds them to be warm yet keeps his arms free at work . This Columbia vest is very nice and thick . Very nicely made and of good quality .
 Bought this for my husband , and he really liked it . The vest is generously cut and well sewn . It 's also very soft and the color is true and pleasing.Just right for those chilly nights when a long sleeved sweater would be `` too much . ''
 Ca n't beat this vest especially for the price ! I have purchased 3 of them !
 My son was very pleased with this vest . I liked the price for a name like Columbia Sportwear . I also liked how fast it was sent to me .
 The vest is comfortable and roomy , though not the very best of materials .
 This was a gift for someone . From what I saw , he was very pleased with it . The item arrived in a very timely manner .
 Purchased two of these for Christmas gifts . Was very impressed with the quality . Would definitely buy again !
 My experience with this Columbia vest made me feel it was spot on for size . The side pockets a bonus for a mid-layer piece . The vest itself let me wanting a little more . The collar is double the weight of the main body of the vest . It is a nice vest but thin for use as a mid-layer . I myself would have preferred if the body was equal to the collar in weight , but for the price I paid I 'd have to say it matches the quality . I guess I expected a little more from Columbia , as I own other products from them that always went beyond my expectations . Guess I 'll just have to be a little creative in my layering to get the best use out of this purchase . The style and color are nice , but I also got the `` bunching '' effect during active use , maybe better as a low activity use item , walking around town and such . It really comes down to what you 'll be using it for , activity level and quality of other layering items .
 Ordered the Large in Green color and was a great value . Quality was excellent as you would expect from Columbia .
 These vests are well made , stylish and fullfill their purpose exceptionally . They provide a little extra warmth at home when the thermostat is set down low to save energy . But being sleveless they do n't make you sweat . The sizes are exactly as specified . I normally wear large in shirts and jackets , and the large vest fits perfectly .
 Warm and made well and comfortable . Husband wears a large but had to order in medium size . He loves it but beware it runs large . Price was great too !
 Bought this at half the price to replace an old Columbia vest in which the zipper fell apart after a year . Wore it 5 days a week for work so I got my monies worth although I paid full price for that one .
 Columbia Men 's Cathedral Peak VestAmple sizing for stout waste . Soft , good feeling fabric with good zippers and warm comfort.Good color and value for a casual look.It can be worn most of the time for a light jacket or coat . Easy to maintain .
 Like the columbia fleece product they are soft . I got the same product from a discount store and it was cheaper even after tax . I have to rate it as 4 because of the product quality .
 This is my second Columbia vest and I really like them . I would recommend this vest to anyone . I like to wear it to work with my dress shirts and ties . Looks sharp .
 I have received this Vest , It is according the picture and it is beautiful , I like the color and I recommend to the people buy this product .
 This vest is the best value in a fleece vest that I 've found , hands down -- for quality , comfort , durability ... I travel constantly and I like the charcoal color because it shows no lint , hair etc. . I lost one of these and replaced it immediately . It 's perfect for layering in cool or cold weather ... but also for that little extra warmth I need in a refrigerated movie theater . -- When I replaced my lost vest I looked at other brands again and was reminded that this Columbia vest is the best thing out there for the money ... by far .
 Bought this vest for my brother and he loves it . I really liked the color of it because its so different .
 The fit , number of zippered pockets , and quality of fabric are all in keeping with a fleece vest that might have cost $ 15 or so more .
 Got this as a present for my dad . He loved it . Ordered an xl should have gone smaller product runs big
 Fits great and what a great price -- medium weight - true to size for mens large . Priced locally at $ 65 dollars
 love columbia products , it helps keep my chest warm so I can lower the heat in the house during the daytime .
 This vest is exactly what I wanted , lightweight yet warm , does n't hinder arm and shoulder motion ; very soft comfortable material .
 I chose thie vest because of the brand and color . It is good quality and stylish . Shipping was fast . I 'm happy , happy , happy !
 Fits just right , material is a nice weight . very warm . Columbia products are always nice . ca n't go wrong with this vest .
 Vest is a nice weight , not too heavy or too lightweight . Great over a long sleeve t-shirt or henley . The charcoal color is really nice . It holds up well through repeated washings . He got this vest last year for Christmas and recently lost it but he loves it so much he asked for a replacement . So if your husband is forgetful like mine you might want to get two . : -RRB-
 I bought this as soon as the Winter cold hit NM and love it . The XL I first purchased was a bit short -LRB- I 'm 6 ' 5 &#34; -RRB- so I then bought an XLT which I put in the morning and wear till I retire at night . Excellent warmth and comfort . Excellent value for money .
 These vests are the most comfortable and great lookingAnd are very affordable and go great with any causual outfit
 My wife bought a couple of these first . I saw them and liked what I saw . Then I learned that she had bought a men 's vest , so I was pretty sure I could have one , too ! The zipper on the pockets is necessary , since the bottom of the opening is about even with the bottom of the pocket and things can fall out . I found one that fits my chest but it is loose at the waist . I will probably take a seam in a bit to correct that . The material is pleasingly soft and warm . They clean up in the washing machine.My wife 's two vests are the same size , but the waistband is larger on one than the other . They were manufactured in different countries .
 Great extra layer for the winter.Very good quality . Generous pockets.Extremely comfortable.Logo over the breast is pleasantly inconspicuous .
 Most of my winter gear is from Columbia and I 've never had any complaints about it . It 's about half the price of a comparable North Face garment and works just as well .
 Like all Columbia products , this item arrived true to fit and size . I purchased this item for my husband and he wears it all the time . It washes well and is very durable . We have had this product for two years and it still looks and feels brand new .
 I bought this to layer under my coat when the weather dips below freezing . It 's comfortable , soft , and keeps me warm . I also like the blue color . Dropped one star because it seems to be made for people with pot bellies . I 'm 6 ' 1 180 and the medium fits perfectly lengthwise and in the shoulder/chest area but there 's a lot of extra fabric in the middle .
 Nice color and Im wanting to buy another vest different color . I highly reccomend to buy , columbia has great cloths .
 I ordered several of these in different colors . The quality is great and the sizing is true . Furthermore , they have come out of the washer & dryer looking like new each and every time . If additional colors become available , I wo n't hesitate to order more .
 Ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas . Beautiful red shade , and fits extremely well . He is very happy and I was pleased that it arrived so quickly and in perfect condition .
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He is very fussy and almost always finds something -LRB- even if it is really minor -RRB- wrong with anything he either buys or receives . He has worn this vest 3 times and has only had it for 6 days ! The fit was on target a large is a large . The craftsmanship above average . The price very good . This large fit nicely over a bit more belly than desired but would still fit well minus the extra pounds .
 I bought this vest for my husband for Christmas . It was perfect . He 's 6 ' 2 '' and about 220lbs and the XL fits him perfectly . He loves wearing it . It 's great for Southern winters were it does n't get too cold .
 This vest is very warm . It fits snug to your body keeping in your core body heat.The pockets are large . . perfect for someone who likes to carry a lot of things with them.The collar can be flipped up to cover more of your neck , or folded down when it 's not as cold.The fleece is very soft , and the vest overall is made well . I recommend this vest if you ` relooking to keep warm this winter . . either worn solo or as part of your winter layered clothing .
 I have been wearing this vest everyday since i got it . the color is great and the warmth is perfect . its not cold enough to wear heavy down jacket but this is just right for the cool days and nights here is S. Calif. thank you
 I ordered this one night , and had it in my hands within 3 business days - with regular shipping . It is a very good layer to add to any winter gear . It has two side zip-up pockets , and the collar zips all the way up if you need . It is super lightweight , and very warm -LRB- for a vest -RRB- . This vest does stop a tiny bit of wind , but not much . On a cool rainy day , wear this underneath a non-insulated rain jacket -LRB- shell -RRB- , and it 's perfect ! -- Very nice !
 This vest was exactly what I wanted . It has a furry texture -LRB- not all fleeces have that same texture -RRB- ; it has pockets that completely sewn into the garment -LRB- some sew it only on one edge -RRB- ; it has room in the pockets all the way to the side edge -LRB- and not just to the edge of the zipper -RRB- . The fit was good ; the sizes run large , so a L fits an XL person . I am very please and will probably purchase another .
 I bought this for my husband because he likes a fleece vest with a collar . He is very pleased and the vest looks great . The collar is big enough to really keep the wind off your neck .
 Its comfortable , warm , a little short in length but overall a really nice vest for me to wear in all types of weather . If I had to complain about one thing it would be that it is not fleece like I thought it would be so make sure you know what you 're buying . Other then that a nice product though !
 The vest fits well and is well made . If it had a zippered breast pocket it would be ideal and would get 5 stars . I would order it again .
 I had to replace a vest the job gave me because it was wearing out . I decided to order these vest in different colors . They go great with whatever I wear at the job . The quality is good for the money . I 'm known as the vest guy now .
 fits great , the blue is amazing , its warm but not too warm , I simply love this one . also got the black one and this a great product .
 I received just what I had ordered , which was the same brand I 've always worn and it was received very quickly before the expected date was even close to being up . I love my Columbia vests .
 Estoy muy contento de haber encargado &eacute;sta prenda . El color es muy suave y elegante . La prenda es muy c&oacute;moda .
 i liked this vest , , , the texture of the fabric is ideal for all season with style the thing is there is not enough pockets , , , , , , but it really serve my life style , , , , ill going to buy two more , , , i love it.i recommend this vest for all walks of life in style .
 Just the right weight to be outside in the Fall or Spring doing things . Keeps you warm without restricting mobility . Looks good and is very functional .
 I wear this nearly every day in the office to stay warm . It 's fleece is perfect , and I love the freedom to move my arms . Size is perfect . No complaints .
 Great extra layer to add during the winter months for a fair price . Looks great too around the office or at home .
 My son and my husband loved their new vests . They love the feel and fit and the colors . I will have to remember to get them some more .
 Very nicely made Vest.Columbia has great products.Like the texture of the material.Pictures on amazon page could be better .
 The fit is not too loose and the cypress color is a gray-green cross . Nice neutral color for men . This was purchased for use in winter time , but it 's rather thin to wear alone . It 's better suited for use in spring-time or under a jacket since it 's not bulky .
 Great ! The fabric felt very gentle , and it 's very light . My husband love it very much . I also introduced it to our friends , one of them placed an order , so I bought it again . The size is a little bit bigger .
 The product was made well . It looks good has a lining but I found that it was not as warm as a similar product purchased over 10 years ago . I did not return it as when the weather gets warmer or when I will wear it inside .
 He likes it . A basic black vest . Seems well made unlike some brands whose zippers are not the best quality . If you are not broad shouldered though the sleeve area in the large size is a bit &#34; wingy &#34; looking . My husband is tall but not bulky so it is a little too big in that respect .
 Second of the same type for me . Perfect for cool weather . Yes indeed . comfy warm not restrictive . All one could ask .
 This was a great purchase for my husbands birthday . Very well cut and designed using quality materials that wear well . I purchsed the navy color and it is a very nice shade more of a navy/grey that goes well with everything . My husband wears a size 42 jacket so I purchased the large since the medium I bought him before fit a little too close for his liking , the large is a little roomier . Columbia is always a good product and the price was good too .
 This is a beautifully made vest and my husband loves the color -LRB- bark -RRB- . From another review I was tipped off that the vest runs large , so I got a size smaller than my husband 's usual size -LRB- XL to L -RRB- . It fits perfectly .
 Absolutely a fine purchase . I really like this vest -- the fit , the breathability , the warmth . Excellent quality . I recommend it highly .
 My wife wanted one for Traveling , got it , Love 's it , She is very Happy and i am very Happy . Thanks
 We are very pleased with the Vest that we purchased and are looking forward to giving it to my Father in Law for the holiday . I am sure he will be happy . Sizing looks accurate as does fabric and style . It will be a great gift for him
 This is a great vest . I ordered a medium , I am a 38 &#34; in chest , yet the medium was too big for me really -LRB- if you want a close to the body fit -RRB- . I will get this vest again in a smaller size and other color .
 This vest is of decent quality , not quite as good as the previous Columbia fleece vest as it is thinner . The color is more of a faded black or dark grey than black . I think I would have been disappointed if I had paid full price but for $ 25 it is worth it . I would buy it again .
 everything in order , very good quality product , service stock.came charging according to the agreement.excellent , recommended to all users .
 I ordered this as something to layer underneath my work jackets . It fits well , so it should be comfortable when layering . Even if this just lasts through this winter , it was a great deal at this price.I have a lot of Colombia jackets -LRB- fleece , rain shell , omni-heat jacket , etc. -RRB- , and I have never been disappointed .
 This vest is just right when a jacket is too much , or when a less bulky additional layer is needed . It is true to size and is well constructed . I plan to add other colors to my collection .
 Quality is good , not as thin as some said . Fit is small than usual . I wear a medium usually but was glad I got a small .
 The vest is comfortable and is made well . The size is my only reason for giving 4 stars . The vest runs on the large side . If you want a tighter fit you will have to order at least one size smaller than what you normally wear . It would be better with an elastic draw string too .
 Lightweight . I wear it mostly at night in my hammock to keep warm throughout the night . Layers well . Added a drawstring at the waist . Easy to do but would have preferred it was included .
 Although the product is great . It was not the exact color as published . It does not have a different color on the neck
 It was wright for what I was looking for . It arrived in good conditions but the coulor is a bit different that in the picture anyway it fits well , thanks .
 As it usually happens , Columbia makes the best and tis vest is not an exception . comfortable , nice and well made .
 All I wanted was a basic vest for cool summer days . Does the job perfectly . Will not stop the wind or keep you very warm - but if you are a guy needing pockets for your wallet - this works well .
 I have wide shoulders -LRB- 50 Regular suit jacket -RRB- , and the XL fit me perfect . I was especially pleased with the collar - which was shorter when popped than the previous Columbia vest I had owned . My previous fleece vest from Columbia lasted me about 2 years , so I have high hopes for this one as well . Very soft , great fit , extremely comfortable and versatile .
 Purchased this vest as a team vest for our local biathlon team . The fit was slightly large , but that is good for winter wear . The length was just below belt line . This is ideal for keeping the lower back warm while skiing and also shooting . Everyone that got a vest on our team was very pleased with the fit and the look . Great for training and looks good too !
 Dumb me , I ordered the wrong size . No problem with this purchase . It was easy to return and reorder the correct size . Credit came through for this purchase with days of me shipping wrong size back . This firm is `` On he Ball '' when it comes to handling a situation like this .
 While I do n't get too excited by clothing , and this is no exception , I do find this is a well made , comfortably warm vest , that I am glad I purchased .
 I wear this as an insulating layering or by itself over a shirt . It looks much better than my Columbia fleece which does n't have much shape . I like that it is super light and moderately warm .
 Bought this for my son in college after he asked for a black fleece vest for his birthday ... He thought it was perfect .
 Got my Columbia Cathedral Vest yesterday . Fits great and does it 's job perfectly.Paid 36 $ for it and its worth the money . It 's also much cheaper than similar products from North Face.Great for a run !
 First off - I am very happy with this purchase as it is exactly what I expected . And for the price , it 's hard to complain.The vest fits very nicely , i got the green large . I 'm a male 5 ' 11 '' and about 190 lbs . It fits me very nicely . Sometimes these vests bunch up around the gut looking dumpy but not this one.I have washed it a few times and it seems to be holding its colour , shape and stretch . It blocks the wind nicely and is perfect for cool autumn weather/early winter when it 's not too brutal but a t-shirt just does n't cut it.The collar is one it 's best features - it folds down nicely to keep your neck warm or you can turn it up to avoid the wind . The material is very soft and feels great on your skin.As for complaints , I find that i really miss having a breast pocket and I wish the pocket zippers went up to open as opposed to down.Since neither of these features were advertised , obviously i ca n't complain about their absence - i just prefer them and will be looking for both on my next vest purchase.One thing that I will knock off a star for is the depth of the pockets . They are quite shallow causing things to fall out easily - especially if you are sitting . If you are going to make a jacket with shallow pockets i think the pocket zips should go the other way ... Just make sure you remember to close the zips ! you can fit your entire hand in if you are trying to stay warm , but there is almost no downward angle to make a good pocket for holding your keys , phone or wallet.While we 're on the topic of zippers i will say that the quality of the zips on this jacket is top-notch . it will open or close from almost any angle and i would be very surprised if they stopped working.At $ 20 it 's hard to imagine a better purchase !
 Columbia fleece vests are the best I 've ever owned -LRB- it 's the third Columbia fleece I 've purchased -RRB- . They 're warm and very durable without being too bulky , making for a good fit and a nice appearance .
 My Significant Other needed something easy to get into because of shoulder surgery ... Perfect for him ! The warmth is wonderful ; the sizing worked out great . He did n't have a vest like this , but now he 's talking about getting another one , in another color . Pricing is perfect too . Ca n't think of any negative !
 Definitely get one size smaller than what you normally wear . I almost always wear an XL and when I tried this on it was baggy and roomy and with an item like this you want it to be snugger .
 I bought this for my husband last year , for Christmas . At this point in time , no complaints at all from him . Washes well and wears well , and its light color does n't show white dog hair , which was a must for a new vest !
 Quality is good but I need Longs and they dont seem to have many longs
 When you are my size , finding the right clothing is a challenge and buying it on line a bit of a risk . I was happy when they arrived and fit perfectly . They are comfortable and well made . A great value .
 My husband bought one of these shirts last year to try it out . I was very skeptical of the `` no ironing '' claim . I could n't believe my eyes when I took it out of the dryer the first time -- not a wrinkle to be seen . The material is truly miraculous . We both love this product and plan to buy more . Thank you , Jos. Banks !
 I own three of these shirts and they are great . I get my shirts cleaned and pressed and here is an example of what great shirts they are
 I own two of these Traveler non-wrinkle shirts and they are absolutely the best shirts I have ever owned . They are of high quality material and the size I bought was right on the money . The colors offered are very versatile with just about anything a person would own and can be worn formally or casually . I am going to stick with buying more of these shirts .
 I bought 2 to begin with and now own seven and I ca n't see myself buying other dress shirts
 I received this shirt as a gift over Christmas . Since then I have bought two more . The fit is outstanding and I have never felt a finer material in a dress shirt - it is soft yet sturdy and always appears pressed . The iron free is for real . I hate ironing and will pay the extra 20 dollars per shirt to never have to dry clean or iron again . I will never buy another shirt and I almost want to throw away my non-iron free dress shirts . I highly recommend this shirt . You will enjoy it and probably buy more of them .
 These dress shirts are the best ! Wrinkle-Free , Breathable , Durable Material , Plus lots of styles , sizes and color options . Compare side-by-side to other dress shirts and you 'll see and feel the difference .

 I own about seven of these!Great all weather hats , very cool in the summer , and I like the fact that they can be washed on a gentle cycle .

 What 's to review ? It is fleece , warm , I picked the color and got what I wanted . I did get a better price than I expected.Here is something review-worthy
 This is a good vest and I enjoy the heck out of mine . I actually own two in different colours , since I was given another one several years ago for my birthday . There are already a lot of reviews and opinions here so I will not be too redundant.The vest is Polartec fleece -LRB- 200 mid-weight -RRB- so it keeps the core warm and comfortable down to about 40 degrees F. Any colder and I must go to a higher tech solution . It works wet or dry , and drys pretty quickly if soaked.It 's a cozy piece of gear and I think a perfect gift item for a loved one since they will think of you in the comfort and warmth of it . I actually LIKE that short fuzzy fibres starts to clump and pill like a snuggly , familiar stuffed teddy bear after only a few washings . I often use it as a throw blanket or a pillow -LRB- esp on airline flights -RRB- . It is also very easy to maintain and as I have two , I often have one in the wash as I 'm wearing the other one.I like the roomy sizing as I use this for layering , and this is an intermediate layer . When zipped all the way up , it practically serves as it 's own Polartec scarf around the neck . Being a taller/larger human , I appreciate that this vest is available in extended sizes too.The design of the vest is simple with a stand up/fold down collar , 2 zippered side slash pockets at the waist , and the Columbia logo on the chest.Herein lies , my first minor criticism ... value . For a simple , unlined vest without any `` extras '' -LRB- like chest pocket , map pocket , interior pockets , drawstring at the bottom or the waist , throat abrasion guard , dbl access zipper , uppers shell , back hook loop , even zipper pulls with whistles , compasses and LED lights -RRB- I would expect a basic level price . If you shop around even online you should quickly get a feel for what the no frills model vs. the all the bells and whistles model are comparatively worth.The two pockets that it does have utilizes this elastized sateen material as the interior . Not only is this pocket lining not very warm , but I find that it snags uncomfortably on little dry skin flakes , hangnails , and tiny dry skin spurs on my hands . It might be just me , but it makes it unpleasant to put my hands in the pockets -LRB- for warmth -RRB- . On both of my Columbia vests , I have replaced the pocket liners with nice non-snagging flat mesh -LRB- like that found in luggage pockets -RRB- . Well the world is what you make of it , so of course I have made some heavy mods to my vests , which have made them my favourites and practically daily wear for me.Columbia makes consistently high quality products -LRB- overseas -RRB- geared toward the outdoor person , so paying a little bit extra for the brand name logo is not that painful I guess .
 This vest is very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear . Most of the time I wear it with short sleeved shirts . When zipped , it 's just right for those 45-50 degree days -LRB- as long as you 're not out in the chill for really long periods - but fine for car-to-store , or short walks -RRB- . It 's also great around the house when you want to drop the thermostat a few degrees to save a little on heating costs . My only disappointment is the main zipper . Sometimes it takes several tries to get it started , and it often sticks mid-zip -LRB- as if there was grit or something in it -RRB- . It always ends up working , but not always smoothly . I 'd definitely recommend the vest , and I suspect my zipper issue is not a design flaw , but rather a production glitch , which would not likely affect other buyers .
 I have purchased Columbia products I have liked in the past . So this was not a difficult choice form me . It is sized correctly for the big guys . I ordered a xxlt and it fits just the way it should . I nice way to add a bit of extra warmth under a jacket that need a little help . Good price and a quality product that was shipped fast .
 Ca n't beat the price , but the vest is larger than I thought a large would be - should 've got a medium .
 This Columbia vest is a quality product and is equipped with a durable zipper , style and feel .
 Columbia gear seems to be priced much lower than other companies like Patagonia and North Face but I feel like the quality of Columbia 's clothes stands up.This vest is exceptionally warm and comfortable .
 The most important factors for me when purchasing a vest were warmth and comfort . This vest is just what I wanted in both categories . It gives me just the right amount of warmth when I go for my morning run without getting too hot once I get warmed up . It 's also comfortable and soft . The pockets have zippers so I can put my keys etc in there and do n't have to worry about them falling out . The only fault I can find is the zippers jingle a bit as I move . Overall I 'm happy with my purchase .
 I got two of these , the blue and the Cattail , which is just brown . They are nice and warm . They look good . They run a little bit big . I got an XL , and I usually wear an XL in everything . I 'm probably right in between a L and an XL . I 'm 6 ' and 240 lbs , if that helps you order yours correctly .
 My son really loves this vest . We ordered two in different colors . It looked very nice on him and he wore it every other day with jeans . A great vest !
 Bought this for my dad for Christmas . He really llikes it . Fits really well and was just as promised and described .
 Perfect fit - this was purchased for an elderly person for indoor wear . It 's not black and it 's not grey - more like graphite . It is very lightweight and keeps him cozy and warm in these cold months .
 We 've been wearing our own Columbia vests for quite some time here in Wisconsin , but it only recently occurred to me that it was just the thing for my 93-year-old dad in Florida , who 's often cold , despite fairly warm temperatures . He loves the vest 's softness and is enjoying having something more youthful and &#34; cool &#34; to wear . I 'm happy to know that it 's easily machine wash and dryable .
 I picked this up to use as a stand-alone or extra layering depending on the temperature . This vest is great - it 's like wearing a soft fleece blanket.It fits easily under all my jackets or sweatshirts . A nice bonus is the zip pockets - they 're great for my phone or warming up my hands very fast .
 My experience with this Columbia vest made me feel it was spot on for size . The side pockets a bonus for a mid-layer piece . The vest itself let me wanting a little more . The collar is double the weight of the main body of the vest . It is a nice vest but thin for use as a mid-layer . I myself would have preferred if the body was equal to the collar in weight , but for the price I paid I 'd have to say it matches the quality . I guess I expected a little more from Columbia , as I own other products from them that always went beyond my expectations . Guess I 'll just have to be a little creative in my layering to get the best use out of this purchase . The style and color are nice , but I also got the `` bunching '' effect during active use , maybe better as a low activity use item , walking around town and such . It really comes down to what you 'll be using it for , activity level and quality of other layering items .
 Ordered the Large in Green color and was a great value . Quality was excellent as you would expect from Columbia .
 These vests are well made , stylish and fullfill their purpose exceptionally . They provide a little extra warmth at home when the thermostat is set down low to save energy . But being sleveless they do n't make you sweat . The sizes are exactly as specified . I normally wear large in shirts and jackets , and the large vest fits perfectly .
 Warm and made well and comfortable . Husband wears a large but had to order in medium size . He loves it but beware it runs large . Price was great too !
 Bought this at half the price to replace an old Columbia vest in which the zipper fell apart after a year . Wore it 5 days a week for work so I got my monies worth although I paid full price for that one .
 Columbia Men 's Cathedral Peak VestAmple sizing for stout waste . Soft , good feeling fabric with good zippers and warm comfort.Good color and value for a casual look.It can be worn most of the time for a light jacket or coat . Easy to maintain .
 Like the columbia fleece product they are soft . I got the same product from a discount store and it was cheaper even after tax . I have to rate it as 4 because of the product quality .
 This is my second Columbia vest and I really like them . I would recommend this vest to anyone . I like to wear it to work with my dress shirts and ties . Looks sharp .
 I have received this Vest , It is according the picture and it is beautiful , I like the color and I recommend to the people buy this product .
 This vest is the best value in a fleece vest that I 've found , hands down -- for quality , comfort , durability ... I travel constantly and I like the charcoal color because it shows no lint , hair etc. . I lost one of these and replaced it immediately . It 's perfect for layering in cool or cold weather ... but also for that little extra warmth I need in a refrigerated movie theater . -- When I replaced my lost vest I looked at other brands again and was reminded that this Columbia vest is the best thing out there for the money ... by far .
 One of the better purchases I 've made , in terms of satisfaction and value.The product is well-made and durable , which you come to expect from Columbia . It can be had for a good price and should last for a long time . Fits true to size , zipper works fine , and it does its job
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He finds them to be warm yet keeps his arms free at work . This Columbia vest is very nice and thick . Very nicely made and of good quality .
 Bought this for my husband , and he really liked it . The vest is generously cut and well sewn . It 's also very soft and the color is true and pleasing.Just right for those chilly nights when a long sleeved sweater would be `` too much . ''
 Ca n't beat this vest especially for the price ! I have purchased 3 of them !
 My son was very pleased with this vest . I liked the price for a name like Columbia Sportwear . I also liked how fast it was sent to me .
 The vest is comfortable and roomy , though not the very best of materials .
 This was a gift for someone . From what I saw , he was very pleased with it . The item arrived in a very timely manner .
 Purchased two of these for Christmas gifts . Was very impressed with the quality . Would definitely buy again !
 very nice vest . light yet warm enough and not too hot during warmer days . the run a little big , I ordered a Large and had to exchange it for a M and I run on the larger side ... in all great buy I would recommend to a friend hands down ...
 I lost a vest that I previously owned , so I was looking for one to replace it . I am very satisfied with the fit and color of the one I purchased .
 Not the first vest of this type from Columbia that I 've purchased . Exactly what I wanted , soft , light weight but provides the warmth I want . Seems easy to mantian , wears good over time , easy to fold and carry if not needed . Satisfied .
 Have several different brands . . this is the best value of all ... fits great quality stitching and best price of all seen
 Extremely pleased with this purchase . After having ordered the wrong color by mistake , i quickly ordered again . Came exactly as described and within given time . No disappointments here !
 The vest is great -- second one I 've purchased ; however , the zipper , as the vest ages , has a tendency to pull apart at the bottom . The reason is the very short insert piece . Increase the depth of the insert and this vest would rate 5 stars . I bought my first vest at Mervins and when they went out of business I never found this make of vest again until I checked Amazon.com -- a great source and great products .
 I bought this vest for a casual look around the office and not at all disappointed . The sizing is about average , the look is great , and as it is Columbia , the material is of good quality . It will keep one warm in the winter months .
 This was a Christmas gift for my husband that he actually loved . Thanks for a great buy . Will be back !
 I 've had this vest for about a month now & I really do enjoy it.I 've had similar vests in the past , but I needed something newer to wear around the office and under my winter coat when a sweater or hoody just does n't work.The vest is very soft & does n't get caught on much . I bought the dark grey hoping that it would `` hide '' my dogs hair unlike the black vest . And it does . I have a beagle , and I can barely notice when -LRB- a few/decent amount -RRB- of his white & black hairs get on it . Some fleece seems to attract dog hair & never let go - this does NOT.The only negative I have about this vest , as others noted , is that there is n't a pull string around the waist . This has n't really bothered me , but I would like to tighten it up just a little bit.I work outdoors so this is perfect for helping me layer up but allowing me something to wear that wo n't bulk up & slow down my arm movement which happens if you wear too many sweaters or hoody 's . I plan on buying another in a few months so I do n't wear this one out too much . Awesome price too . I checked a couple of stores online and no one had the same price as Amazon .
 I just want to say that is the best way to keep you warm , high quality product and very comfortable .
 Fleece is fleece , but this vest is surprisingly well put-together . The only thing is it missing is a third pocket -LRB- the small vertical one near the left center that most other vests have -RRB- .
 I was very satisfied with the vest . I would get a size smaller than your usual size , they run big .
 Works for what I wanted . Something to wear while walking in cooler temps , where I did n't want a full coat .
 This product was first class -LRB- not a second -RRB- and was as ordered and on time . Ca n't get any better than that .
 This vest is soft yet rugged , true to size and just right for my son for Christmas .
 It 's hard for me to find some shirt with right size sleeve and collar . But that would be a problem for a vest , :-RRB- . I do n't like the zippers on the pockets , i never put any stuff in the pockets . Overall , this is a good vest for me , I wish it a little bit warmer .
 Columbia sizes are really big so just be a little conservative in ordering for sizes . Buy is for less than 20 bucks for getting value .
 I was satified with the product my only concern is that the color was off black insteadof black .
 Wonderful vest at retail price , the Amazon has outdone itself.For $ 12 + tax , it seems like a steal to me.The material is very soft and of good craftmanship.thank you , Amazon and Columbia
 This product is a good value . Nothing spectacular , but a good deal . I use it as a good layer for skiing to provide warmth for my core without restricting shoulder and elbow movement . It more than adequately provides what I need .
 Every piece of Columbia clothing that I own is top quality and this is no different . It 's a lightweight , and yet warm vest perfect for those crisp fall days .
 Not a whole lot to say other than it 's well built , the fabric is very comfortable and strong feeling and the vest looks great . I 'd buy it again if I had the need .
 this is a very nice vest . looks good on and fabric is great . color stays true when washed as well
 Good light weight Vest.Material soft and flexible.Deep pockets . The fit was great . I wear mine in the office . I would recommend .
 This vest is similar to my Columbia Fleece jacket -- both are excellent and perform very well , especially at this price point . Fast delivery too .
 Was just what i was looking for . Brand new with tags and shipped very quickly . My husband loves it . Color looks exactly same as shown in the pic as well .
 I like Columbia garments for myself . So I bought one for My Dad for Christmas . It fits well in the XL and is nicely made.Washable too !!
 Quick service , good price and no complaints after wearing this for a month . Considering ordering another in a different color .
 Great vest for cool sunny days . Vest is a little on the thin side . It looks great and feels great . The only problem occurs is that it lets wind in and out very easily . I would recommend this to a friend , but do n't look for a whole lot of warmth from it .
 Awesome vest . Better than expected , well packed and arrived quickly ! I give it 2 thumbs up and my highest recommendation !
 A gift for my Grandson , quality and craftsmanship excellent , could not ask for a better product , or reliability . Thank you for a great fitting product , my Grandson absolutely loves it .
 I gave my husband this for Christmas and he is pleased , so I am too . Looks good , is comfortable . Have only had it less than 1 week .
 Honestly do n't know what 's all the hype about the North Face is . The good old Columbia looks great , feels comfortable and is well made . Navy color is very pleasant to the eye . I am very happy with the vest .
 My husband absolutely loved his vest I got him . We have even bought these in different colors . We would recommend this to anyone looking for a vest to wear as a casual attire or even a dressy attire .
 I bought this for my husband last year , for Christmas . At this point in time , no complaints at all from him . Washes well and wears well , and its light color does n't show white dog hair , which was a must for a new vest !
 Quality is good but I need Longs and they dont seem to have many longs
 Bought this for my son in college after he asked for a black fleece vest for his birthday ... He thought it was perfect .
 Got my Columbia Cathedral Vest yesterday . Fits great and does it 's job perfectly.Paid 36 $ for it and its worth the money . It 's also much cheaper than similar products from North Face.Great for a run !

 Columbia fleece vests are the best I 've ever owned -LRB- it 's the third Columbia fleece I 've purchased -RRB- . They 're warm and very durable without being too bulky , making for a good fit and a nice appearance .
 My Significant Other needed something easy to get into because of shoulder surgery ... Perfect for him ! The warmth is wonderful ; the sizing worked out great .

 Definitely get one size smaller than what you normally wear . I almost always wear an XL and when I tried this on it was baggy and roomy and with an item like this you want it to be snugger .
 Lightweight . I wear it mostly at night in my hammock to keep warm throughout the night . Layers well . Added a drawstring at the waist . Easy to do but would have preferred it was included .
 Although the product is great . It was not the exact color as published . It does not have a different color on the neck
 It was wright for what I was looking for . It arrived in good conditions but the coulor is a bit different that in the picture anyway it fits well , thanks .
 As it usually happens , Columbia makes the best and tis vest is not an exception . comfortable , nice and well made .
 All I wanted was a basic vest for cool summer days . Does the job perfectly . Will not stop the wind or keep you very warm - but if you are a guy needing pockets for your wallet - this works well .
 I have wide shoulders -LRB- 50 Regular suit jacket -RRB- , and the XL fit me perfect . I was especially pleased with the collar - which was shorter when popped than the previous Columbia vest I had owned . My previous fleece vest from Columbia lasted me about 2 years , so I have high hopes for this one as well . Very soft , great fit , extremely comfortable and versatile .
 Purchased this vest as a team vest for our local biathlon team . The fit was slightly large , but that is good for winter wear . The length was just below belt line . This is ideal for keeping the lower back warm while skiing and also shooting . Everyone that got a vest on our team was very pleased with the fit and the look . Great for training and looks good too !
 Dumb me , I ordered the wrong size . No problem with this purchase . It was easy to return and reorder the correct size . Credit came through for this purchase with days of me shipping wrong size back . This firm is `` On he Ball '' when it comes to handling a situation like this .
 While I do n't get too excited by clothing , and this is no exception , I do find this is a well made , comfortably warm vest , that I am glad I purchased .
 I wear this as an insulating layering or by itself over a shirt . It looks much better than my Columbia fleece which does n't have much shape . I like that it is super light and moderately warm .
 Absolutely a fine purchase . I really like this vest -- the fit , the breathability , the warmth . Excellent quality . I recommend it highly .
 My wife wanted one for Traveling , got it , Love 's it , She is very Happy and i am very Happy . Thanks
 We are very pleased with the Vest that we purchased and are looking forward to giving it to my Father in Law for the holiday . I am sure he will be happy . Sizing looks accurate as does fabric and style . It will be a great gift for him
 This is a great vest . I ordered a medium , I am a 38 &#34; in chest , yet the medium was too big for me really -LRB- if you want a close to the body fit -RRB- . I will get this vest again in a smaller size and other color .
 This vest is of decent quality , not quite as good as the previous Columbia fleece vest as it is thinner . The color is more of a faded black or dark grey than black . I think I would have been disappointed if I had paid full price but for $ 25 it is worth it . I would buy it again .
 everything in order , very good quality product , service stock.came charging according to the agreement.excellent , recommended to all users .
 I ordered this as something to layer underneath my work jackets . It fits well , so it should be comfortable when layering . Even if this just lasts through this winter , it was a great deal at this price.I have a lot of Colombia jackets -LRB- fleece , rain shell , omni-heat jacket , etc. -RRB- , and I have never been disappointed .
 This vest is just right when a jacket is too much , or when a less bulky additional layer is needed . It is true to size and is well constructed . I plan to add other colors to my collection .
 Quality is good , not as thin as some said . Fit is small than usual . I wear a medium usually but was glad I got a small .
 The vest is comfortable and is made well . The size is my only reason for giving 4 stars . The vest runs on the large side . If you want a tighter fit you will have to order at least one size smaller than what you normally wear . It would be better with an elastic draw string too .
 This was a great purchase for my husbands birthday . Very well cut and designed using quality materials that wear well . I purchsed the navy color and it is a very nice shade more of a navy/grey that goes well with everything . My husband wears a size 42 jacket so I purchased the large since the medium I bought him before fit a little too close for his liking , the large is a little roomier . Columbia is always a good product and the price was good too .
 This is a beautifully made vest and my husband loves the color -LRB- bark -RRB- . From another review I was tipped off that the vest runs large , so I got a size smaller than my husband 's usual size -LRB- XL to L -RRB- . It fits perfectly .
 I wear this nearly every day in the office to stay warm . It 's fleece is perfect , and I love the freedom to move my arms . Size is perfect . No complaints .
 Great extra layer to add during the winter months for a fair price . Looks great too around the office or at home .
 My son and my husband loved their new vests . They love the feel and fit and the colors . I will have to remember to get them some more .
 Very nicely made Vest.Columbia has great products.Like the texture of the material.Pictures on amazon page could be better .
 The fit is not too loose and the cypress color is a gray-green cross . Nice neutral color for men . This was purchased for use in winter time , but it 's rather thin to wear alone . It 's better suited for use in spring-time or under a jacket since it 's not bulky .
 Great ! The fabric felt very gentle , and it 's very light . My husband love it very much . I also introduced it to our friends , one of them placed an order , so I bought it again . The size is a little bit bigger .
 The product was made well . It looks good has a lining but I found that it was not as warm as a similar product purchased over 10 years ago . I did not return it as when the weather gets warmer or when I will wear it inside .
 He likes it . A basic black vest . Seems well made unlike some brands whose zippers are not the best quality . If you are not broad shouldered though the sleeve area in the large size is a bit &#34; wingy &#34; looking . My husband is tall but not bulky so it is a little too big in that respect .
 Second of the same type for me . Perfect for cool weather . Yes indeed . comfy warm not restrictive . All one could ask .
 I bought this as soon as the Winter cold hit NM and love it . The XL I first purchased was a bit short -LRB- I 'm 6 ' 5 &#34; -RRB- so I then bought an XLT which I put in the morning and wear till I retire at night . Excellent warmth and comfort . Excellent value for money .
 These vests are the most comfortable and great lookingAnd are very affordable and go great with any causual outfit
 My wife bought a couple of these first . I saw them and liked what I saw . Then I learned that she had bought a men 's vest , so I was pretty sure I could have one , too ! The zipper on the pockets is necessary , since the bottom of the opening is about even with the bottom of the pocket and things can fall out . I found one that fits my chest but it is loose at the waist . I will probably take a seam in a bit to correct that . The material is pleasingly soft and warm . They clean up in the washing machine.My wife 's two vests are the same size , but the waistband is larger on one than the other . They were manufactured in different countries .
 Great extra layer for the winter.Very good quality . Generous pockets.Extremely comfortable.Logo over the breast is pleasantly inconspicuous .
 Most of my winter gear is from Columbia and I 've never had any complaints about it . It 's about half the price of a comparable North Face garment and works just as well .
 Like all Columbia products , this item arrived true to fit and size . I purchased this item for my husband and he wears it all the time . It washes well and is very durable . We have had this product for two years and it still looks and feels brand new .
 I bought this to layer under my coat when the weather dips below freezing . It 's comfortable , soft , and keeps me warm . I also like the blue color . Dropped one star because it seems to be made for people with pot bellies . I 'm 6 ' 1 180 and the medium fits perfectly lengthwise and in the shoulder/chest area but there 's a lot of extra fabric in the middle .
 Nice color and Im wanting to buy another vest different color . I highly reccomend to buy , columbia has great cloths .
 Bought this vest for my brother and he loves it . I really liked the color of it because its so different .
 The fit , number of zippered pockets , and quality of fabric are all in keeping with a fleece vest that might have cost $ 15 or so more .
 Got this as a present for my dad . He loved it . Ordered an xl should have gone smaller product runs big
 Fits great and what a great price -- medium weight - true to size for mens large . Priced locally at $ 65 dollars
 love columbia products , it helps keep my chest warm so I can lower the heat in the house during the daytime .
 This vest is exactly what I wanted , lightweight yet warm , does n't hinder arm and shoulder motion ; very soft comfortable material .
 I chose thie vest because of the brand and color . It is good quality and stylish . Shipping was fast . I 'm happy , happy , happy !
 Fits just right , material is a nice weight . very warm . Columbia products are always nice . ca n't go wrong with this vest .
 Vest is a nice weight , not too heavy or too lightweight . Great over a long sleeve t-shirt or henley . The charcoal color is really nice . It holds up well through repeated washings . He got this vest last year for Christmas and recently lost it but he loves it so much he asked for a replacement . So if your husband is forgetful like mine you might want to get two . : -RRB-
 I bought this for my husband because he likes a fleece vest with a collar . He is very pleased and the vest looks great . The collar is big enough to really keep the wind off your neck .
 Its comfortable , warm , a little short in length but overall a really nice vest for me to wear in all types of weather . If I had to complain about one thing it would be that it is not fleece like I thought it would be so make sure you know what you 're buying . Other then that a nice product though !
 The vest fits well and is well made . If it had a zippered breast pocket it would be ideal and would get 5 stars . I would order it again .
 I had to replace a vest the job gave me because it was wearing out . I decided to order these vest in different colors . They go great with whatever I wear at the job . The quality is good for the money . I 'm known as the vest guy now .
 fits great , the blue is amazing , its warm but not too warm , I simply love this one . also got the black one and this a great product .
 I received just what I had ordered , which was the same brand I 've always worn and it was received very quickly before the expected date was even close to being up . I love my Columbia vests .
 Estoy muy contento de haber encargado &eacute;sta prenda . El color es muy suave y elegante . La prenda es muy c&oacute;moda .
 i liked this vest , , , the texture of the fabric is ideal for all season with style the thing is there is not enough pockets , , , , , , but it really serve my life style , , , , ill going to buy two more , , , i love it.i recommend this vest for all walks of life in style .
 Just the right weight to be outside in the Fall or Spring doing things . Keeps you warm without restricting mobility . Looks good and is very functional .
 I ordered several of these in different colors . The quality is great and the sizing is true . Furthermore , they have come out of the washer & dryer looking like new each and every time . If additional colors become available , I wo n't hesitate to order more .
 Ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas . Beautiful red shade , and fits extremely well . He is very happy and I was pleased that it arrived so quickly and in perfect condition .
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He is very fussy and almost always finds something -LRB- even if it is really minor -RRB- wrong with anything he either buys or receives . He has worn this vest 3 times and has only had it for 6 days ! The fit was on target a large is a large . The craftsmanship above average . The price very good . This large fit nicely over a bit more belly than desired but would still fit well minus the extra pounds .
 I bought this vest for my husband for Christmas . It was perfect . He 's 6 ' 2 '' and about 220lbs and the XL fits him perfectly . He loves wearing it . It 's great for Southern winters were it does n't get too cold .
 This vest is very warm . It fits snug to your body keeping in your core body heat.The pockets are large . . perfect for someone who likes to carry a lot of things with them.The collar can be flipped up to cover more of your neck , or folded down when it 's not as cold.The fleece is very soft , and the vest overall is made well . I recommend this vest if you ` relooking to keep warm this winter . . either worn solo or as part of your winter layered clothing .
 I have been wearing this vest everyday since i got it . the color is great and the warmth is perfect . its not cold enough to wear heavy down jacket but this is just right for the cool days and nights here is S. Calif. thank you
 I ordered this one night , and had it in my hands within 3 business days - with regular shipping . It is a very good layer to add to any winter gear . It has two side zip-up pockets , and the collar zips all the way up if you need . It is super lightweight , and very warm -LRB- for a vest -RRB- . This vest does stop a tiny bit of wind , but not much . On a cool rainy day , wear this underneath a non-insulated rain jacket -LRB- shell -RRB- , and it 's perfect ! -- Very nice !
 This vest was exactly what I wanted . It has a furry texture -LRB- not all fleeces have that same texture -RRB- ; it has pockets that completely sewn into the garment -LRB- some sew it only on one edge -RRB- ; it has room in the pockets all the way to the side edge -LRB- and not just to the edge of the zipper -RRB- . The fit was good ; the sizes run large , so a L fits an XL person . I am very please and will probably purchase another .
 I was very happy with this Halloween costume .
 When you are my size , finding the right clothing is a challenge and buying it on line a bit of a risk . I was happy when they arrived and fit perfectly . They are comfortable and well made . A great value .
 Great Quality Product ! Authentic and Great Colors ! Shirt was larger than expected though . I ordered a Large and it was unnecessarily wide . I wish I would have knew or I would have ordered a Medium . So you might want to try a size smaller than you usually buy unless you are a wide person or have worn Puma Brand Shirts before . But it 's definitely a nice shirt !
 Great service and was quick arriving to our APO address . The shirt is great just the colors are reverse of what we thought we bought !

 I bought this cap for my husband because he has to wear a black cap on his job and the company only supplies one . That cap is frequently too dirty to wear the next day . Who wants to worry about coming home and washing a darn cap after working 10 hours?This cap is far superior in quality . He wants to wear this one all the time . Because it is easy to clean he usually does just that . I paid more than you pay for an average cap but it was well worth the extra money . In this case at least , you get what you pay for and I am glad I bought it.Sometimes in our ever lasting hunt for a bargain I think some of us forget that quality counts too . And this cap , is quality !
 I have lots of hats with glitter and colorful trim , but really needed a basic black one for those bad-hair days when I have to run out to the store for some little nothing that seems important at the time . :--RRB- I wanted black because it goes with more , so when I saw this `` cheapie '' at Amazon , I grabbed it up!For this low price I expected it would be poorly constructed , so I 'm very pleased that it 's sturdy , well-made and of good material . Woo-hoo ... For once I got a real bargain.I tip my cap to the maker of this product . Highly recommended.Reviewed by Betty Dravis , October 30 , 2010Author of `` Dream Reachers '' -LRB- with Chase Von -RRB- and other books
 At first a tad suspicious of what the quality the product would be even after reading the reviews . I was very surprised by the packaging , delivery speed , considering the Christmas holidays and quality of this product . I fully inspected the cap upon delivery and was surprised at the quality of the construction , sewing and the comfortable fit due to the ease of the Velcro type adjustment strap in the back . I will be using this cap to attach a military patch and a couple of insignia pins which I believe will look outstanding . I Highly Recommend this company and look forward to doing additional business with them in the future .
 it is a nice hat , i was so eager to get it in the mail , when i tried it on which is it was a bit too tight . the seller failed to put a proper sizing chart . So , big and tall men if your head size is close to or over 8 , forget it . Be careful not to get your hair caught in the strap , it nearly pull out my black natural hair , but it is a good buy
 This hat was bought as an accessory to a referee costume . However , it 's a pretty good quality hat for the price I paid and I expect to use it as an `` every day '' hat now .
 There is n't a whole lot to say about this hat , I 'm afraid . It 's a plain , black baseball-cap type hat . It 's not the most comfortable one I 've ever worn - with a short haircut like mine , it feels rather coarse . But it 's simple and it 's well-made so far as I can tell . It 's ideal for someone who wants a plain hat to have adornments of their own added to . I got my hat so I could have the emblem of a military school I attended sewn on . This hat is , as I said , ideal for things like that . It 's a good hat , and I recommend it for those looking for what it has to offer .
 The cap was exactly was I wanted . I actually plan to order more of them for some of my co-workers . Quality merchandise and fast service . I highly recommend this item .
 I bought this hat for my Halloween costume , and I ordered it a week before Halloween , and it came two days before ! I thought that it would get here late , because things usually do n't get to my place on time , and so I was really impressed with how fast the sipment went through and came . I am also impressed with the hat . It is a great hat , and it was a reasonable price !
 A perfect plain baseball hat , not in any way inferior to name brand expensive hats , with the benefit of no big logos .
 my husband loves this hat ! it came on time and was not bent up or anything . its very nice , and wears well .
 This is a high quality hat , the price is great I bought 3 of them & wear 1 daily
 Quick delivery . Satisfied that I paid a good price and got what I wanted .
 It 's an awesome hat , comfortable and high quality . I 've had people ask where I got it cause it did n't have any markings on it lol .
 This cap appears to be excellent value . Most caps are $ 15 - $ 18 . The very low cost makes this product a bargain . The quality and styling are completely adequate for my use . This cap fills the bill for a low cast , nice looking black cap that can be used for occasional field hockey officials work . Since I do n't use it for anything else , I can not rate it as a heavy duty cap .
 It 's a good hat , but it has a narrower brim than usual which was n't what I was looking for . Okay for styling , not so great for keeping the sun out . Not something you want to wear if you have a full beard or maybe even a broad face , the hat will look simply goofy with the brim .
 I needed a plain black cap for work so I ordered two of these . I was amazed by the quality of the caps when they arrived . Great value !
 The quality of the caps was really good . Very fast delivery . A wonderful low price , too .
 the caps fit the bill -LRB- excuse the pun -RRB- , they were exactly what i needed and are great price performers .
 I bought this cap for my husband two years ago and it is still one of his favorites . It is roomy and not tight fitting . Very generously made .
 this is my favorite hat i own . its tough though light , great for work or even everyday fashion use . great buy . im going to buy another one when mine is used up .
 This black hat is great to have a patched sewn on it or put an appropriate pin on it . I plan to order more of this same hat very soon , from this seller . And this company is EXCELLENT to work with .
 I love it . Nothing else to say . It fits slug , came great , had that &#34; new hat &#34; smell . A nice solid black color without any faded spots . Its perfect .
 This is a great hat , its so hard these days to find hats that arnt plastered with logos . This hat is just that a plain black ball cap and for 5 bucks its a great deal . Came in less than a week
 Great for costumes , I used it for a referee costume -- or when you just need a hat with no affiliations on it . Fits well , the brim bends like it like it to . Good hat .
 Very minimalistic . True black . Inexpensive . Breathes well . Good for summer . Would n't recommend for cold temps . Get yourself something else for cool weather . This is perfect for hot weather . Brim holds shape well . Has white mesh inside the front quarter of the hat so that it stays tall and does n't collapse - unlike other inexpensive hats I 've bought . Velcro on adjustable straps hold firm . Color has n't faded over time .
 This is a good quality , comfortable plain black baseball cap for a very good price . The seller shipped as promised . The confirmation email actually pictured a different cap , but the one that arrived was the one I ordered .
 This is a durable , comfortable and good looking baseball cap , just as I 'd hoped for and needed . I 'm happy I found it through Amazon .
 We looked everywhere trying find this exact style that would allow the mounting of our new custom logo . The hats turned out to be of better quality that we expected for the price . I told our supplier about these and they ordered them as well .
 Looks great as it fits . Perfect as a work hat -LRB- as I work in a warehouse myself -RRB- or everyday wear . For the price you would think it 's made of low quality fabric but it 's not . Much cheaper than most hats in sports stores . Great product overall .
 There really is n't too much to say about this thing . It 's fairly well constructed given its price , and fits nicely .
 When you are my size , finding the right clothing is a challenge and buying it on line a bit of a risk . I was happy when they arrived and fit perfectly . They are comfortable and well made . A great value .
 Works for what I wanted . Something to wear while walking in cooler temps , where I did n't want a full coat .
 This product was first class -LRB- not a second -RRB- and was as ordered and on time . Ca n't get any better than that .
 This vest is soft yet rugged , true to size and just right for my son for Christmas .
 It 's hard for me to find some shirt with right size sleeve and collar . But that would be a problem for a vest , :-RRB- . I do n't like the zippers on the pockets , i never put any stuff in the pockets . Overall , this is a good vest for me , I wish it a little bit warmer .
 Columbia sizes are really big so just be a little conservative in ordering for sizes . Buy is for less than 20 bucks for getting value .
 I was satified with the product my only concern is that the color was off black insteadof black .
 One of the better purchases I 've made , in terms of satisfaction and value.The product is well-made and durable , which you come to expect from Columbia . It can be had for a good price and should last for a long time . Fits true to size , zipper works fine , and it does its job
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He finds them to be warm yet keeps his arms free at work . This Columbia vest is very nice and thick . Very nicely made and of good quality .
 Bought this for my husband , and he really liked it . The vest is generously cut and well sewn . It 's also very soft and the color is true and pleasing.Just right for those chilly nights when a long sleeved sweater would be `` too much . ''
 Have several different brands . . this is the best value of all ... fits great quality stitching and best price of all seen
 Extremely pleased with this purchase . After having ordered the wrong color by mistake , i quickly ordered again . Came exactly as described and within given time . No disappointments here !
 The vest is great -- second one I 've purchased ; however , the zipper , as the vest ages , has a tendency to pull apart at the bottom . The reason is the very short insert piece . Increase the depth of the insert and this vest would rate 5 stars . I bought my first vest at Mervins and when they went out of business I never found this make of vest again until I checked Amazon.com -- a great source and great products .
 I bought this vest for a casual look around the office and not at all disappointed . The sizing is about average , the look is great , and as it is Columbia , the material is of good quality . It will keep one warm in the winter months .
 This was a Christmas gift for my husband that he actually loved . Thanks for a great buy . Will be back !
 I 've had this vest for about a month now & I really do enjoy it.I 've had similar vests in the past , but I needed something newer to wear around the office and under my winter coat when a sweater or hoody just does n't work.The vest is very soft & does n't get caught on much . I bought the dark grey hoping that it would `` hide '' my dogs hair unlike the black vest . And it does . I have a beagle , and I can barely notice when -LRB- a few/decent amount -RRB- of his white & black hairs get on it . Some fleece seems to attract dog hair & never let go - this does NOT.The only negative I have about this vest , as others noted , is that there is n't a pull string around the waist . This has n't really bothered me , but I would like to tighten it up just a little bit.I work outdoors so this is perfect for helping me layer up but allowing me something to wear that wo n't bulk up & slow down my arm movement which happens if you wear too many sweaters or hoody 's . I plan on buying another in a few months so I do n't wear this one out too much . Awesome price too . I checked a couple of stores online and no one had the same price as Amazon .
 I just want to say that is the best way to keep you warm , high quality product and very comfortable .
 My experience with this Columbia vest made me feel it was spot on for size . The side pockets a bonus for a mid-layer piece . The vest itself let me wanting a little more . The collar is double the weight of the main body of the vest . It is a nice vest but thin for use as a mid-layer . I myself would have preferred if the body was equal to the collar in weight , but for the price I paid I 'd have to say it matches the quality . I guess I expected a little more from Columbia , as I own other products from them that always went beyond my expectations . Guess I 'll just have to be a little creative in my layering to get the best use out of this purchase . The style and color are nice , but I also got the `` bunching '' effect during active use , maybe better as a low activity use item , walking around town and such . It really comes down to what you 'll be using it for , activity level and quality of other layering items .
 Ordered the Large in Green color and was a great value . Quality was excellent as you would expect from Columbia .
 These vests are well made , stylish and fullfill their purpose exceptionally . They provide a little extra warmth at home when the thermostat is set down low to save energy . But being sleveless they do n't make you sweat . The sizes are exactly as specified . I normally wear large in shirts and jackets , and the large vest fits perfectly .
 What 's to review ? It is fleece , warm , I picked the color and got what I wanted . I did get a better price than I expected.Here is something review-worthy
 This is a good vest and I enjoy the heck out of mine . I actually own two in different colours , since I was given another one several years ago for my birthday . There are already a lot of reviews and opinions here so I will not be too redundant.The vest is Polartec fleece -LRB- 200 mid-weight -RRB- so it keeps the core warm and comfortable down to about 40 degrees F. Any colder and I must go to a higher tech solution . It works wet or dry , and drys pretty quickly if soaked.It 's a cozy piece of gear and I think a perfect gift item for a loved one since they will think of you in the comfort and warmth of it . I actually LIKE that short fuzzy fibres starts to clump and pill like a snuggly , familiar stuffed teddy bear after only a few washings . I often use it as a throw blanket or a pillow -LRB- esp on airline flights -RRB- . It is also very easy to maintain and as I have two , I often have one in the wash as I 'm wearing the other one.I like the roomy sizing as I use this for layering , and this is an intermediate layer . When zipped all the way up , it practically serves as it 's own Polartec scarf around the neck . Being a taller/larger human , I appreciate that this vest is available in extended sizes too.The design of the vest is simple with a stand up/fold down collar , 2 zippered side slash pockets at the waist , and the Columbia logo on the chest.Herein lies , my first minor criticism ... value . For a simple , unlined vest without any `` extras '' -LRB- like chest pocket , map pocket , interior pockets , drawstring at the bottom or the waist , throat abrasion guard , dbl access zipper , uppers shell , back hook loop , even zipper pulls with whistles , compasses and LED lights -RRB- I would expect a basic level price . If you shop around even online you should quickly get a feel for what the no frills model vs. the all the bells and whistles model are comparatively worth.The two pockets that it does have utilizes this elastized sateen material as the interior . Not only is this pocket lining not very warm , but I find that it snags uncomfortably on little dry skin flakes , hangnails , and tiny dry skin spurs on my hands . It might be just me , but it makes it unpleasant to put my hands in the pockets -LRB- for warmth -RRB- . On both of my Columbia vests , I have replaced the pocket liners with nice non-snagging flat mesh -LRB- like that found in luggage pockets -RRB- . Well the world is what you make of it , so of course I have made some heavy mods to my vests , which have made them my favourites and practically daily wear for me.Columbia makes consistently high quality products -LRB- overseas -RRB- geared toward the outdoor person , so paying a little bit extra for the brand name logo is not that painful I guess .
 This vest is very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear . Most of the time I wear it with short sleeved shirts . When zipped , it 's just right for those 45-50 degree days -LRB- as long as you 're not out in the chill for really long periods - but fine for car-to-store , or short walks -RRB- . It 's also great around the house when you want to drop the thermostat a few degrees to save a little on heating costs . My only disappointment is the main zipper . Sometimes it takes several tries to get it started , and it often sticks mid-zip -LRB- as if there was grit or something in it -RRB- . It always ends up working , but not always smoothly . I 'd definitely recommend the vest , and I suspect my zipper issue is not a design flaw , but rather a production glitch , which would not likely affect other buyers .
 I have purchased Columbia products I have liked in the past . So this was not a difficult choice form me . It is sized correctly for the big guys . I ordered a xxlt and it fits just the way it should . I nice way to add a bit of extra warmth under a jacket that need a little help . Good price and a quality product that was shipped fast .
 Ca n't beat the price , but the vest is larger than I thought a large would be - should 've got a medium .
 This Columbia vest is a quality product and is equipped with a durable zipper , style and feel .
 I got two of these , the blue and the Cattail , which is just brown . They are nice and warm . They look good . They run a little bit big . I got an XL , and I usually wear an XL in everything . I 'm probably right in between a L and an XL . I 'm 6 ' and 240 lbs , if that helps you order yours correctly .
 My son really loves this vest . We ordered two in different colors . It looked very nice on him and he wore it every other day with jeans . A great vest !
 Bought this for my dad for Christmas . He really llikes it . Fits really well and was just as promised and described .
 Perfect fit - this was purchased for an elderly person for indoor wear . It 's not black and it 's not grey - more like graphite . It is very lightweight and keeps him cozy and warm in these cold months .
 We 've been wearing our own Columbia vests for quite some time here in Wisconsin , but it only recently occurred to me that it was just the thing for my 93-year-old dad in Florida , who 's often cold , despite fairly warm temperatures . He loves the vest 's softness and is enjoying having something more youthful and &#34; cool &#34; to wear . I 'm happy to know that it 's easily machine wash and dryable .
 I picked this up to use as a stand-alone or extra layering depending on the temperature . This vest is great - it 's like wearing a soft fleece blanket.It fits easily under all my jackets or sweatshirts . A nice bonus is the zip pockets - they 're great for my phone or warming up my hands very fast .
 I like Columbia garments for myself . So I bought one for My Dad for Christmas . It fits well in the XL and is nicely made.Washable too !!
 Quick service , good price and no complaints after wearing this for a month . Considering ordering another in a different color .
 Great vest for cool sunny days . Vest is a little on the thin side . It looks great and feels great . The only problem occurs is that it lets wind in and out very easily . I would recommend this to a friend , but do n't look for a whole lot of warmth from it .
 Wonderful vest at retail price , the Amazon has outdone itself.For $ 12 + tax , it seems like a steal to me.The material is very soft and of good craftmanship.thank you , Amazon and Columbia
 This product is a good value . Nothing spectacular , but a good deal . I use it as a good layer for skiing to provide warmth for my core without restricting shoulder and elbow movement . It more than adequately provides what I need .
 Every piece of Columbia clothing that I own is top quality and this is no different . It 's a lightweight , and yet warm vest perfect for those crisp fall days .
 Good light weight Vest.Material soft and flexible.Deep pockets . The fit was great . I wear mine in the office . I would recommend .
 This vest is similar to my Columbia Fleece jacket -- both are excellent and perform very well , especially at this price point . Fast delivery too .
 Was just what i was looking for . Brand new with tags and shipped very quickly . My husband loves it . Color looks exactly same as shown in the pic as well .
 I bought this as soon as the Winter cold hit NM and love it . The XL I first purchased was a bit short -LRB- I 'm 6 ' 5 &#34; -RRB- so I then bought an XLT which I put in the morning and wear till I retire at night . Excellent warmth and comfort . Excellent value for money .
 These vests are the most comfortable and great lookingAnd are very affordable and go great with any causual outfit
 My wife bought a couple of these first . I saw them and liked what I saw . Then I learned that she had bought a men 's vest , so I was pretty sure I could have one , too ! The zipper on the pockets is necessary , since the bottom of the opening is about even with the bottom of the pocket and things can fall out . I found one that fits my chest but it is loose at the waist . I will probably take a seam in a bit to correct that . The material is pleasingly soft and warm . They clean up in the washing machine.My wife 's two vests are the same size , but the waistband is larger on one than the other . They were manufactured in different countries .
 Awesome vest . Better than expected , well packed and arrived quickly ! I give it 2 thumbs up and my highest recommendation !
 A gift for my Grandson , quality and craftsmanship excellent , could not ask for a better product , or reliability . Thank you for a great fitting product , my Grandson absolutely loves it .
 I gave my husband this for Christmas and he is pleased , so I am too . Looks good , is comfortable . Have only had it less than 1 week .
 Honestly do n't know what 's all the hype about the North Face is . The good old Columbia looks great , feels comfortable and is well made . Navy color is very pleasant to the eye . I am very happy with the vest .
 My husband absolutely loved his vest I got him . We have even bought these in different colors . We would recommend this to anyone looking for a vest to wear as a casual attire or even a dressy attire .
 Bought this vest for my brother and he loves it . I really liked the color of it because its so different .
 The fit , number of zippered pockets , and quality of fabric are all in keeping with a fleece vest that might have cost $ 15 or so more .
 Got this as a present for my dad . He loved it . Ordered an xl should have gone smaller product runs big
 Ca n't beat this vest especially for the price ! I have purchased 3 of them !
 My son was very pleased with this vest . I liked the price for a name like Columbia Sportwear . I also liked how fast it was sent to me .
 The vest is comfortable and roomy , though not the very best of materials .
 This was a gift for someone . From what I saw , he was very pleased with it . The item arrived in a very timely manner .
 Purchased two of these for Christmas gifts . Was very impressed with the quality . Would definitely buy again !
 I bought this for my husband last year , for Christmas . At this point in time , no complaints at all from him . Washes well and wears well , and its light color does n't show white dog hair , which was a must for a new vest !
 Quality is good but I need Longs and they dont seem to have many longs
 Warm and made well and comfortable . Husband wears a large but had to order in medium size . He loves it but beware it runs large . Price was great too !
 Bought this at half the price to replace an old Columbia vest in which the zipper fell apart after a year . Wore it 5 days a week for work so I got my monies worth although I paid full price for that one .
 Columbia Men 's Cathedral Peak VestAmple sizing for stout waste . Soft , good feeling fabric with good zippers and warm comfort.Good color and value for a casual look.It can be worn most of the time for a light jacket or coat . Easy to maintain .
 Like the columbia fleece product they are soft . I got the same product from a discount store and it was cheaper even after tax . I have to rate it as 4 because of the product quality .
 This is my second Columbia vest and I really like them . I would recommend this vest to anyone . I like to wear it to work with my dress shirts and ties . Looks sharp .
 I have received this Vest , It is according the picture and it is beautiful , I like the color and I recommend to the people buy this product .
 This vest is the best value in a fleece vest that I 've found , hands down -- for quality , comfort , durability ... I travel constantly and I like the charcoal color because it shows no lint , hair etc. . I lost one of these and replaced it immediately . It 's perfect for layering in cool or cold weather ... but also for that little extra warmth I need in a refrigerated movie theater . -- When I replaced my lost vest I looked at other brands again and was reminded that this Columbia vest is the best thing out there for the money ... by far .
 Lightweight . I wear it mostly at night in my hammock to keep warm throughout the night . Layers well . Added a drawstring at the waist . Easy to do but would have preferred it was included .
 Although the product is great . It was not the exact color as published . It does not have a different color on the neck
 It was wright for what I was looking for . It arrived in good conditions but the coulor is a bit different that in the picture anyway it fits well , thanks .
 This is a great vest . I ordered a medium , I am a 38 &#34; in chest , yet the medium was too big for me really -LRB- if you want a close to the body fit -RRB- . I will get this vest again in a smaller size and other color .
 This vest is of decent quality , not quite as good as the previous Columbia fleece vest as it is thinner . The color is more of a faded black or dark grey than black . I think I would have been disappointed if I had paid full price but for $ 25 it is worth it . I would buy it again .
 everything in order , very good quality product , service stock.came charging according to the agreement.excellent , recommended to all users .
 I ordered this as something to layer underneath my work jackets . It fits well , so it should be comfortable when layering . Even if this just lasts through this winter , it was a great deal at this price.I have a lot of Colombia jackets -LRB- fleece , rain shell , omni-heat jacket , etc. -RRB- , and I have never been disappointed .
 This vest is just right when a jacket is too much , or when a less bulky additional layer is needed . It is true to size and is well constructed . I plan to add other colors to my collection .
 Quality is good , not as thin as some said . Fit is small than usual . I wear a medium usually but was glad I got a small .
 The vest is comfortable and is made well . The size is my only reason for giving 4 stars . The vest runs on the large side . If you want a tighter fit you will have to order at least one size smaller than what you normally wear . It would be better with an elastic draw string too .
 Bought this for my son in college after he asked for a black fleece vest for his birthday ... He thought it was perfect .
 Got my Columbia Cathedral Vest yesterday . Fits great and does it 's job perfectly.Paid 36 $ for it and its worth the money . It 's also much cheaper than similar products from North Face.Great for a run !
 This was a great purchase for my husbands birthday . Very well cut and designed using quality materials that wear well . I purchsed the navy color and it is a very nice shade more of a navy/grey that goes well with everything . My husband wears a size 42 jacket so I purchased the large since the medium I bought him before fit a little too close for his liking , the large is a little roomier . Columbia is always a good product and the price was good too .
 This is a beautifully made vest and my husband loves the color -LRB- bark -RRB- . From another review I was tipped off that the vest runs large , so I got a size smaller than my husband 's usual size -LRB- XL to L -RRB- . It fits perfectly .
 Very nicely made Vest.Columbia has great products.Like the texture of the material.Pictures on amazon page could be better .
 The fit is not too loose and the cypress color is a gray-green cross . Nice neutral color for men . This was purchased for use in winter time , but it 's rather thin to wear alone . It 's better suited for use in spring-time or under a jacket since it 's not bulky .
 Great ! The fabric felt very gentle , and it 's very light . My husband love it very much . I also introduced it to our friends , one of them placed an order , so I bought it again . The size is a little bit bigger .
 The product was made well . It looks good has a lining but I found that it was not as warm as a similar product purchased over 10 years ago . I did not return it as when the weather gets warmer or when I will wear it inside .
 He likes it . A basic black vest . Seems well made unlike some brands whose zippers are not the best quality . If you are not broad shouldered though the sleeve area in the large size is a bit &#34; wingy &#34; looking . My husband is tall but not bulky so it is a little too big in that respect .
 Second of the same type for me . Perfect for cool weather . Yes indeed . comfy warm not restrictive . All one could ask .
 Columbia gear seems to be priced much lower than other companies like Patagonia and North Face but I feel like the quality of Columbia 's clothes stands up.This vest is exceptionally warm and comfortable .
 The most important factors for me when purchasing a vest were warmth and comfort . This vest is just what I wanted in both categories . It gives me just the right amount of warmth when I go for my morning run without getting too hot once I get warmed up . It 's also comfortable and soft . The pockets have zippers so I can put my keys etc in there and do n't have to worry about them falling out . The only fault I can find is the zippers jingle a bit as I move . Overall I 'm happy with my purchase .
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He is very fussy and almost always finds something -LRB- even if it is really minor -RRB- wrong with anything he either buys or receives . He has worn this vest 3 times and has only had it for 6 days ! The fit was on target a large is a large . The craftsmanship above average . The price very good . This large fit nicely over a bit more belly than desired but would still fit well minus the extra pounds .
 I bought this vest for my husband for Christmas . It was perfect . He 's 6 ' 2 '' and about 220lbs and the XL fits him perfectly . He loves wearing it . It 's great for Southern winters were it does n't get too cold .
 This vest is very warm . It fits snug to your body keeping in your core body heat.The pockets are large . . perfect for someone who likes to carry a lot of things with them.The collar can be flipped up to cover more of your neck , or folded down when it 's not as cold.The fleece is very soft , and the vest overall is made well . I recommend this vest if you ` relooking to keep warm this winter . . either worn solo or as part of your winter layered clothing .
 I have been wearing this vest everyday since i got it . the color is great and the warmth is perfect . its not cold enough to wear heavy down jacket but this is just right for the cool days and nights here is S. Calif. thank you
 I ordered this one night , and had it in my hands within 3 business days - with regular shipping . It is a very good layer to add to any winter gear . It has two side zip-up pockets , and the collar zips all the way up if you need . It is super lightweight , and very warm -LRB- for a vest -RRB- . This vest does stop a tiny bit of wind , but not much . On a cool rainy day , wear this underneath a non-insulated rain jacket -LRB- shell -RRB- , and it 's perfect ! -- Very nice !
 This vest was exactly what I wanted . It has a furry texture -LRB- not all fleeces have that same texture -RRB- ; it has pockets that completely sewn into the garment -LRB- some sew it only on one edge -RRB- ; it has room in the pockets all the way to the side edge -LRB- and not just to the edge of the zipper -RRB- . The fit was good ; the sizes run large , so a L fits an XL person . I am very please and will probably purchase another .
 Fleece is fleece , but this vest is surprisingly well put-together . The only thing is it missing is a third pocket -LRB- the small vertical one near the left center that most other vests have -RRB- .
 I was very satisfied with the vest . I would get a size smaller than your usual size , they run big .
 I had to replace a vest the job gave me because it was wearing out . I decided to order these vest in different colors . They go great with whatever I wear at the job . The quality is good for the money . I 'm known as the vest guy now .
 fits great , the blue is amazing , its warm but not too warm , I simply love this one . also got the black one and this a great product .
 I received just what I had ordered , which was the same brand I 've always worn and it was received very quickly before the expected date was even close to being up . I love my Columbia vests .
 Estoy muy contento de haber encargado &eacute;sta prenda . El color es muy suave y elegante . La prenda es muy c&oacute;moda .
 i liked this vest , , , the texture of the fabric is ideal for all season with style the thing is there is not enough pockets , , , , , , but it really serve my life style , , , , ill going to buy two more , , , i love it.i recommend this vest for all walks of life in style .
 Just the right weight to be outside in the Fall or Spring doing things . Keeps you warm without restricting mobility . Looks good and is very functional .
 very nice vest . light yet warm enough and not too hot during warmer days . the run a little big , I ordered a Large and had to exchange it for a M and I run on the larger side ... in all great buy I would recommend to a friend hands down ...
 I lost a vest that I previously owned , so I was looking for one to replace it . I am very satisfied with the fit and color of the one I purchased .
 Not the first vest of this type from Columbia that I 've purchased . Exactly what I wanted , soft , light weight but provides the warmth I want . Seems easy to mantian , wears good over time , easy to fold and carry if not needed . Satisfied .
 As it usually happens , Columbia makes the best and tis vest is not an exception . comfortable , nice and well made .
 All I wanted was a basic vest for cool summer days . Does the job perfectly . Will not stop the wind or keep you very warm - but if you are a guy needing pockets for your wallet - this works well .
 I have wide shoulders -LRB- 50 Regular suit jacket -RRB- , and the XL fit me perfect . I was especially pleased with the collar - which was shorter when popped than the previous Columbia vest I had owned . My previous fleece vest from Columbia lasted me about 2 years , so I have high hopes for this one as well . Very soft , great fit , extremely comfortable and versatile .
 Purchased this vest as a team vest for our local biathlon team . The fit was slightly large , but that is good for winter wear . The length was just below belt line . This is ideal for keeping the lower back warm while skiing and also shooting . Everyone that got a vest on our team was very pleased with the fit and the look . Great for training and looks good too !
 Dumb me , I ordered the wrong size . No problem with this purchase . It was easy to return and reorder the correct size . Credit came through for this purchase with days of me shipping wrong size back . This firm is `` On he Ball '' when it comes to handling a situation like this .
 While I do n't get too excited by clothing , and this is no exception , I do find this is a well made , comfortably warm vest , that I am glad I purchased .
 I wear this as an insulating layering or by itself over a shirt . It looks much better than my Columbia fleece which does n't have much shape . I like that it is super light and moderately warm .
 I ordered several of these in different colors . The quality is great and the sizing is true . Furthermore , they have come out of the washer & dryer looking like new each and every time . If additional colors become available , I wo n't hesitate to order more .
 Ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas . Beautiful red shade , and fits extremely well . He is very happy and I was pleased that it arrived so quickly and in perfect condition .
 First off - I am very happy with this purchase as it is exactly what I expected . And for the price , it 's hard to complain.The vest fits very nicely , i got the green large . I 'm a male 5 ' 11 '' and about 190 lbs . It fits me very nicely . Sometimes these vests bunch up around the gut looking dumpy but not this one.I have washed it a few times and it seems to be holding its colour , shape and stretch . It blocks the wind nicely and is perfect for cool autumn weather/early winter when it 's not too brutal but a t-shirt just does n't cut it.The collar is one it 's best features - it folds down nicely to keep your neck warm or you can turn it up to avoid the wind . The material is very soft and feels great on your skin.As for complaints , I find that i really miss having a breast pocket and I wish the pocket zippers went up to open as opposed to down.Since neither of these features were advertised , obviously i ca n't complain about their absence - i just prefer them and will be looking for both on my next vest purchase.One thing that I will knock off a star for is the depth of the pockets . They are quite shallow causing things to fall out easily - especially if you are sitting . If you are going to make a jacket with shallow pockets i think the pocket zips should go the other way ... Just make sure you remember to close the zips ! you can fit your entire hand in if you are trying to stay warm , but there is almost no downward angle to make a good pocket for holding your keys , phone or wallet.While we 're on the topic of zippers i will say that the quality of the zips on this jacket is top-notch . it will open or close from almost any angle and i would be very surprised if they stopped working.At $ 20 it 's hard to imagine a better purchase !
 Columbia fleece vests are the best I 've ever owned -LRB- it 's the third Columbia fleece I 've purchased -RRB- . They 're warm and very durable without being too bulky , making for a good fit and a nice appearance .
 My Significant Other needed something easy to get into because of shoulder surgery ... Perfect for him ! The warmth is wonderful ; the sizing worked out great . He did n't have a vest like this , but now he 's talking about getting another one , in another color . Pricing is perfect too . Ca n't think of any negative !
 Definitely get one size smaller than what you normally wear . I almost always wear an XL and when I tried this on it was baggy and roomy and with an item like this you want it to be snugger .
 I bought this for my husband because he likes a fleece vest with a collar . He is very pleased and the vest looks great . The collar is big enough to really keep the wind off your neck .
 Its comfortable , warm , a little short in length but overall a really nice vest for me to wear in all types of weather . If I had to complain about one thing it would be that it is not fleece like I thought it would be so make sure you know what you 're buying . Other then that a nice product though !
 The vest fits well and is well made . If it had a zippered breast pocket it would be ideal and would get 5 stars . I would order it again .
 Great extra layer for the winter.Very good quality . Generous pockets.Extremely comfortable.Logo over the breast is pleasantly inconspicuous .
 Most of my winter gear is from Columbia and I 've never had any complaints about it . It 's about half the price of a comparable North Face garment and works just as well .
 Like all Columbia products , this item arrived true to fit and size . I purchased this item for my husband and he wears it all the time . It washes well and is very durable . We have had this product for two years and it still looks and feels brand new .
 I bought this to layer under my coat when the weather dips below freezing . It 's comfortable , soft , and keeps me warm . I also like the blue color . Dropped one star because it seems to be made for people with pot bellies . I 'm 6 ' 1 180 and the medium fits perfectly lengthwise and in the shoulder/chest area but there 's a lot of extra fabric in the middle .
 Nice color and Im wanting to buy another vest different color . I highly reccomend to buy , columbia has great cloths .
 I wear this nearly every day in the office to stay warm . It 's fleece is perfect , and I love the freedom to move my arms . Size is perfect . No complaints .
 Great extra layer to add during the winter months for a fair price . Looks great too around the office or at home .
 My son and my husband loved their new vests . They love the feel and fit and the colors . I will have to remember to get them some more .
 Fits great and what a great price -- medium weight - true to size for mens large . Priced locally at $ 65 dollars
 love columbia products , it helps keep my chest warm so I can lower the heat in the house during the daytime .
 This vest is exactly what I wanted , lightweight yet warm , does n't hinder arm and shoulder motion ; very soft comfortable material .
 I chose thie vest because of the brand and color . It is good quality and stylish . Shipping was fast . I 'm happy , happy , happy !
 Fits just right , material is a nice weight . very warm . Columbia products are always nice . ca n't go wrong with this vest .
 Vest is a nice weight , not too heavy or too lightweight . Great over a long sleeve t-shirt or henley . The charcoal color is really nice . It holds up well through repeated washings . He got this vest last year for Christmas and recently lost it but he loves it so much he asked for a replacement . So if your husband is forgetful like mine you might want to get two . : -RRB-
 Absolutely a fine purchase . I really like this vest -- the fit , the breathability , the warmth . Excellent quality . I recommend it highly .
 My wife wanted one for Traveling , got it , Love 's it , She is very Happy and i am very Happy . Thanks
 We are very pleased with the Vest that we purchased and are looking forward to giving it to my Father in Law for the holiday . I am sure he will be happy . Sizing looks accurate as does fabric and style . It will be a great gift for him
 this shirt is a really cool shirt . i wear purchased one of these shirts and i wear it everyday . and the girls come running . i have to beat them off with a stick .
 When you are my size , finding the right clothing is a challenge and buying it on line a bit of a risk . I was happy when they arrived and fit perfectly . They are comfortable and well made . A great value .
 My husband bought one of these shirts last year to try it out . I was very skeptical of the `` no ironing '' claim . I could n't believe my eyes when I took it out of the dryer the first time -- not a wrinkle to be seen . The material is truly miraculous . We both love this product and plan to buy more . Thank you , Jos. Banks !
 I own three of these shirts and they are great . I get my shirts cleaned and pressed and here is an example of what great shirts they are
 I own two of these Traveler non-wrinkle shirts and they are absolutely the best shirts I have ever owned . They are of high quality material and the size I bought was right on the money . The colors offered are very versatile with just about anything a person would own and can be worn formally or casually . I am going to stick with buying more of these shirts .
 I bought 2 to begin with and now own seven and I ca n't see myself buying other dress shirts
 I received this shirt as a gift over Christmas . Since then I have bought two more . The fit is outstanding and I have never felt a finer material in a dress shirt - it is soft yet sturdy and always appears pressed . The iron free is for real . I hate ironing and will pay the extra 20 dollars per shirt to never have to dry clean or iron again . I will never buy another shirt and I almost want to throw away my non-iron free dress shirts . I highly recommend this shirt . You will enjoy it and probably buy more of them .
 These dress shirts are the best ! Wrinkle-Free , Breathable , Durable Material , Plus lots of styles , sizes and color options . Compare side-by-side to other dress shirts and you 'll see and feel the difference .
 Bought these for my brother . He loves them . Wears them all the time . They do the job and reflect his favorite pastime .
 When you are my size , finding the right clothing is a challenge and buying it on line a bit of a risk . I was happy when they arrived and fit perfectly . They are comfortable and well made . A great value .

 I own about seven of these!Great all weather hats , very cool in the summer , and I like the fact that they can be washed on a gentle cycle .
 I own the Austin Reed dartmouth blazer in every color in which they make it -- it is a staple of my business wardrobe . Well made , quality fabric , nicely tailored , classic lines , appropriate for a professional woman . -LRB- something that can be hard to find at times -RRB- It should be noted , however , that the periwinkle and raspberry colors are lovely , but the fabric and buttons are slightly different than the `` classic '' colors -LRB- lighter -RRB- and the linings and interfacings are not as substantial as the brown , navy , camel , red and ivory . It 's still a good value , particularly as these are colors appropriate to warmer seasons and climates , but I was a bit surprised .

 It 's not easy to find a good , reasonably priced neck pillow that provides solid support and is comfortable too . This pillow gets top marks in all these categories . I would definitely recommend the item . In fact , I bought another one for when I 'm riding along as a passenger or when I 'm in the dentist chair .
 I bought this neck pillow for a 14 hour flight from Chicago to Shanghai -LRB- in coach -RRB- . I own a basic blow-up neck pillow , but it never seemed very comfortable so I stopped using it . I used this pillow for both legs of my flight and was extremely happy with its performance.Pros : - Velvety soft covering with no sharp edges or things to annoy your neck -LRB- machine washable too -RRB- - Firm but comfortable memory foam inside . I felt like my head was in the perfect position the whole time ... I never got sore or irritated while using it to relax and/or sleep.Cons : - It does n't deflate ... so it took up a fair amount of space in my carry on bag.-Snobby appearance ... I imagine I looked a little over-the-top with both the Reakt neck pillow and eye covering . They are pretty ` posh ' , but if you have a killer trip then who really cares about what other people think!When I first got it in the mail my wife was making fun of me for going overboard . She put it around her neck and put on the eye cover and did her best impression of what I would look like , mocking me . Two minutes later she had stopped talking and was falling asleep while sitting up on the couch - I 'm not kidding !

 This bag is AWESOME ! I love it ! It is big enough to carry about 5 textbooks , or a computer with about 3 books . There are only a few slightly negative aspects -LRB- that really are n't that big of a deal , but a slight surprise nonetheless -RRB- ... the bag 's over the shoulder strap does not lengthen as far as some other messenger bags , meaning for those who like to have the bag trailing behind their ankles , I suggest another style of bag . Also , it has no padding in the inside . Absolutely none . The fabric is very durable , and that makes up for the lack of cushion . This is not a problem unless you need to use it to carry a laptop ... I just wrap my computer in a piece of fleece , which adds a little comfort and ease to my mind and computer , and it is fine
 Every feature of this bag is practical and efficient . While some bags and full of pockets and key rings and flaps that serve only to confuse , tangle and annoy , the Timbuk2 Messenger Bag was clearly designed by someone who actually USES this bag.The front flap is big enough to safely cover the contents , yet flexible enough to quickly retrieve something . The key ring is on a red cord , making it easy to find , and the cord is attached to the opening of the large zip pocket so you can keep it in or out of the pocket but always find and access your keys even when the bag is full . Pockets within pockets make for sensible organization , and there 's a great cell phone pocket and ID or security card pocket . The side of the bag with the pockets is the one that 's AWAY from your body as you wear the bag , which at first seems strange . You then realize it is far easier to get in the pockets when you can see them!I ca n't say enough about this great bag . Oh yes I can ... It looks great too !
 This review is for the medium , solid black , made in the Philippines Timbuk2 messenger bag . I have been using it for about a month now , mostly going back and forth to school.As the title states , I am left-handed . One of the great features of the Timbuk2 is its easily adjustable cam belt . If you have the money to spare , I highly , highly recommend spending the extra money and getting the lefty model if you plan on wearing this over your right shoulder . I have only seen the lefty model available directly from Timbuk2 , but it may be available elsewhere . However , if you are like me and want to save a few bucks by shopping through Amazon , the `` right-handed '' model works just fine over the right shoulder . It just means that you have to take the bag off or flip it around front to adjust the strap instead of adjusting it while it 's still on the shoulder.This is a messenger bag not only in name , but in practice . I only suggest getting it if you plan on using it on a bicycle , as this is where it excels . The cross-strap helps it stay in place even when pedaling hard or leaning over . It is pretty bare bones
 I 've only recently heard of the Timbuk2 brand , but I am quickly sold . Their messenger bags are top-quality products . Sturdy material , spacious compartments , and efficient design -LRB- e.g. the sturdy snap-on latches , secure velcro , etc -RRB- . And best of all , these messenger bags come in a wide array of sizes and design/colors . The only caveat I would give to first-time customers is to really LOOK at the dimensions -LRB- inches centimeters -RRB- of the bag before you choose a particular size . I purchased the `` extra small '' and trust me there is nothing smallish about it . It is surprisingly spacious for an item labeled as `` extra small '' . I can only imagine that the `` Small '' bag would be adequate for the majority of people . And the `` Medium '' and `` Large '' bags would be immensely roomy that you can probably store your 10-pound pet poodle there , with plenty of room to spare !
 I wanted a small , lightweight , strong , and moderately versatile bag in which to tote my thinkpad about , suitable for cycling , but not limited to that alone.just right for these requirements . do n't expect to store much more than your laptop , a kindle , and maybe a book . but hey , this bag makes you feel better looking!tlt -
 I bought this bag for a trip to Barcelona . I needed something that would carry my guide books , Spanish-English dictionary , water bottle , camera , and anything else that might come along . The bag did an excellent job . And it 's huge -- I bought the small one and I could fit my 17 inch laptop in there , with room for extra books . The bag is durable , practically indestructable , and is comfortable against your side as you carry it . When my trip is over , I will still carry this bag with me everywhere I go .
 I 've had this bag for about a year of daily use and I 'm very pleased with it . I just cleaned the inside with a damp sponge and except for a few pen-marks it looks like it is brand new.Large is very large . I recently put 16 hard-back books in it and it had room for a little more . If I were buying again , medium would be my choice .
 4 months ago I got the black and gray medium classic messenger bag.Though I gave it a 5 , its more like a 4.5 Thus far I have been very satisfied with it . It is very durable , quite spacious and looks good . I would warn against getting a larger bag , if you are planning to use this as any every day commuter item . It works really well while biking to work ; except when I have a large coat on , the chest strap is a little too short . Also , the Velcro is rather annoying when trying to open my bag quietly , the buckle latches are usually enough , to keep everything together . All together a great bag , but I got my marked down , and to me the starting price seems a little high .
 Great bag , great price since it was on sale . I was looking for a small messenger bag and had looked at the Chrome series but found that a little out of budget . The material of this bag is amazing , super heavy duty ballistic nylon and a waterproof lining that seems impervious to tears . I 'm only worried about water/snow being able to creep in through the sldes beacuse the top flap doesnt cover it most of the time , which wasnt a problem with the Chrome bags . But for the price , size and material , it does the job .
 Here 's the series of reactions I had when I opened the box containing my Timbuk2 : : : open box to find a ` medium ' sized Covert Timbuk2 : : I think to myself , `` WOW , this thing is massive '' : : unwrap plastic wrapping to reveal external fabric : : `` This bag is huge ! Nice `` covert '' fabric . Pretty cool . '' : : Open the Timbuk2 to see the inside of the bag . The velcro releases a loud `` belch '' and the plastic fabric crinkles : : `` Jesus , this thing is loud . So `` plasticy ! '' This is like a tarp sewn into a bag . But , look at how spacious this is , and there 's pockets for pens , my phone , and miscellaneous stuff . Pretty cool . '' : : Toss it onto my shoulder : : `` Feels like plastic too . A bit awkward on my shoulders without anything in it . '' ... I have n't had the chance to use it . The bag looks tremendously useful ; I could easily put my four cats into the bag and ride around town . Unfortunately , part of it 's usefullnes is that it 's made of 99.9 % plastic , which feels cheep .
 This is a awesome bag . It 's my second one and the size is perfect from commuting to work.Javapie3
 I got the large size at first , and once I realized that it was way too big . The material feels nice and durable . I do n't think that I 'll get any damage to this unless I do something excessive to it .
 My son is very particular about his possessions and this bag was one he requested for Christmas and he really loves it . He researchs important possessions he purchases and he undoubtly did the same in this case . Service was prompt ant this had the look and feel of a quality product .
 This bag is great for so many uses . Bringing to work with files and such , bringing on a plane with personal belongings , a picnic with a packed lunch ! It 's just the right size ! Also , importantly for me , it 's perfect for riding a bike .
 I have had this bag for a few month 's now . I try not to go anywhere without it . The medium is perfect size for books and a laptop . I also use it for an overnight bag filled with clothes , alcohol , and still room for a netbook . Timbuk2 also has some cool accessories to go along with it like a bottle opener or an external pouch that goes on that strap that can hold most electronics .
 Got a bag in June of 2007 , use it for my gym gear and commute duties . Ride a motorcycle and the bag is great . I have a wide back and back packs do n't work very well , this bag perfect . After two years of hauling stuff back and forth from work and the gym , it still looks great.Would most definitely buy another one if something happened to this one . But at this point , the bag still looks new , except for some marks on the liner .
 This is definitely a solid versatile bag . I have 2 classic messenger bags and 1 commute laptop messenger bag . The large size classic messenger bag makes a perfect beach bag ; easily fits 2 large beach towels , a tarp for shade , sun screen , extra clothes , sandals , hat , frisbee etc. . . and is has those small pockets for your cell phone , wallet , and a key string ... and its water proof -LRB- so do n't have to worry about that big wave soaking all of your stuff when your not paying attention ! -RRB- . The medium size bag is great all around city bag ; on the bus , art fairs , concerts , college books etc. . . and the cross strap is perfect when your on your bike -LRB- that 's what this bag is made for . -RRB- The medium messenger bag easily fits everything you could ever need for a day in the city with room to spare.However , if you are looking to carry a laptop I would recommend going with the commute laptop messenger bag or any other timbuk2 bag that is laptop specific . The classic messenger bag has no structure as others reviewers have mentioned , and thus its not really made to hold a lap top . The commute laptop messenger bag is the way to go if your looking to haul your laptop and business papers ... it has a very nice protective laptop sleeve and more pockets for your school or business stuff .

 My son carries so many books and his binder and other stuff back and forth to school each day . It 's February and already I 've been through a backpack , another messenger bag , and a giant binder that is supposed to hold everything . First - three ring binders are a nightmare . I 'll never do that again . Second - a messenger bag or backpack you buy when all the school supplies are for sale in July and August just are n't going to cut it any more . The messenger bag worked but it was just too big . I did n't think it could be but his stuff just never `` fit '' and just moved around in that bag and it was just a mess . -LRB- NOTE
 I used to bike to work and this bag was great for that . It held my change of clothes -LRB- I biked hard -RRB- , my work laptop , and other various things . It also held up perfectly in the rain.Now I commute to work and the bag is great for that too . I keep my gym clothes and shoes in there and all my other normal work stuff . It 's kinda like a man purse ...
 Bag is quality ... you can tell it 's made well and with quality material . I only regret that I did n't go with a smaller size for my needs
 This bag is amazing . Yes , it 's definitely on the expensive side , but totally worth it to save the money . I doubt I will need to buy another bag of this type for a many , many years , if at all . I do n't use it for bike riding . I got it more because I live in the Seattle area and bus everywhere so I needed something that 's totally waterproof , can hold EVERYTHING -LRB- I got the medium size and yeah , it holds everything . As in , all my text books , a change of clothes for work , some food for work , and maybe toiletries if I decide to stay at my boyfriends that night -RRB- , and hold up to the wear and tear of life and heavy college text books . It does all of these things perfectly . I 've been using it everyday for the past month or so and have no gripes about it what-so-ever . I am a poor college kid but saving up for this bag was well worth it .
 WOW ! This bag was large . It was actually so large that I had to send it back . I later got the medium sized bag , and so far , it 's worked well for my uses .
 I 've been using my medium timbuk2 messenger bag for the past 2 years . Frankly , I think large is way too big . Even medium is a bit much for my 5 ' 3 '' frame . Let me give you an idea of how much a medium bag can hold
 I got the small one.Pros1 -RRB- Heavy-Duty Construction2 -RRB- Lots of pockets inside3 -RRB- Detachable Reflectors4 -RRB- Detachable Cross StrapCons1 -RRB- The velcro can be disruptive in quiet situations2 -RRB- It might not be good for protecting things that get creased easily -LRB- e.g. loose sheets paper -RRB- , esp . when it 's relatively empty -LRB- as it has no structure -RRB- I use it every day . Looks like a good investment .
 I was tired of carrying a camera bag that screams out `` expensive equipment inside ! '' After seeing a link on the Internet of another photographer that took a Tenba messenger bag insert , and placed it inside of a Medium Timbuk2 Messenger Bag , I imitated his idea . I 've now been carrying my Timbuk2 for the past month , and am amazed by the amount of equipment I can comfortable carry inside of it . It has been through both a snowstorm and a rainstorm , and my equipment stayed dry.The quality craftsmanship of the Timbuk2 is one of the first things I noted upon receiving this bag , making it obvious why this cost a bit more than the run of the mill big box store messenger bag .
 As a grad student in computer science , I take my computer with me * everywhere * . I need bags that can take a light beating every day for a long time . When my old computer bag developed a large tear at the computer pocket , I wanted something that would be large enough for me to carry my computer , its accessories , a textbook , a notebook , and my digital camera , which is an oversized point-and-shoot that 's just a little too large to fit comfortably into any bag . Needless to say I also wanted something that would n't rip open or have the clip for the shoulder strap snap and drop my computer onto the sidewalk , both unpleasant experiences I 've had with other bags.I was a little wary of carrying the laptop in a sleeve that could rattle around inside a larger bag , but many of my friends do it that way and seem to have no problems . One of them introduced me to Timbuk2 's products , and after a lot of research and agonizing I ordered the Classic Messenger Bag and Timbuk2 ` sTimbuk2 Wiki Laptop Sleeve.The CMB is great , though it is basically `` just a bag '' with a few auxiliary pockets . The medium size -- which looks big and is actually a little bigger -- holds everything I need , with just a little room to spare , and if I ever want to carry other stuff -LRB- groceries , camping supplies -RRB- I can just take the computer out and have a pretty humongous bag . It 's comfortable , the lining is waterproof , the strap has a nifty quick-release length adjustment , and it feels very , very secure . My girlfriend admired mine so much that she asked her family for one , and I got my brother one as a Christmas gift , as he frequently bikes to work.Some caveats , all of which I consider minor points a buyer might want to be aware of , rather than real issues I have with the product : - It took me a couple days of fiddling with the length of the main strap and how the bag sat on my back before it was really comfortable . I could tell when I first put it on that it was well-built and would be comfortable ; I just had to spend some time and find the sweet spot . - The top does n't really close ; it 's just the main flap of the bag flipped across the opening . Things seem to sit so that the bag pinches shut at the top naturally , and there 's a safe margin of overhang , but I 've noticed that the main strap can pull the overhanging edge of the flap up , rather than down over the side of the bag . I 've never had an actual problem with this , and neither has the friend who showed me the bags in the first place , but it seems worth mentioning . - The cross strap -- yes , it can be a little confusing at first . However , it 's not outrageously difficult either . I got it backwards the first time I tried it , reversed it , and had no further issues . Once you 've got it it 's pretty obvious , and you do n't really need it unless you 're riding a bike or something similarly athletic . - The quick-release on the main strap seems prone to a little slippage unless you really clamp it down . I assume that 's why it has a kind of double-loop system that allows you to adjust the amount of slack strap available for extending at any given time but that 's a little tedious to work with . - There are a lot of auxiliary pockets inside and a couple outside . They 're all useful sizes and pretty much perfectly hold all my stuff , but the interior pockets are built of some much lighter material than the rest of the bag , and it seems to stretch and sag with use . I 'd had a lot of pens in the pen pockets for a couple weeks until I noticed they were getting loose and slightly misshapen . I would n't rely on them to hold a lot of stuff , despite the apparent size . - You ca n't really carry anything on the outside of this bag without buying some accessories from Timbuk2 . This does n't bother me , as I keep phones in holsters and keys in my pocket , but if you put everything in your bag it might be a hindrance . - Word of caution
 I got my first Timbuk2 -LRB- large classic messenger -RRB- back in college , and it 's about 3 years old now . Still going strong and getting better with age i.e less stiff , more seasoned look and feel . Timbuk2 makes amazing bags in a wide range of designs , and the classic messenger is , in my opinion , the best of the lot.I own a large sized classic messenger , and it carries everything I need to bring around -LRB- lots of junk -RRB- and more . The only thing that you have to be careful is not to be too happy tossing stuff in , only to realise that the bag is just wayyyy to heavy to lug around without causing sore shoulders/back . A strap pad is essential if you 're carrying anything larger than a medium-sized classic messenger.These bags are sturdy , practical -LRB- very well-designed pockets , slots , keyrings etc -RRB- and look good to boot . I 've also got a small classic messenger and a large cargo tote that I bought for my mom who complained about her other bags not having enough compartments -LRB- typical women 's purses -RRB- or being too small to hold all her stuff in an organized way.While Crumpler bags are also an alternative in a similar price range , Timbuk2 bags seem more suited for serious messenger bag users , while Crumpler bags are more like casual , fashion accessories.All in all , I seriously recommend Timbuk2 bags for their design and durability . Go Timbuk2 ! -- > Updated to add that I 've added a limited edition purple retro messenger to the Timbuk2 family here : -RRB-
 A great bag for birders :1 . It 's very comfortable and rugged and holds just what I need without becoming a brush-navigation hindrance .2 . The strap is very wide , which I was put off by at first glance , but the result is a very comfortable carry when the bag is full . Unlike other bags I tried on , the strap on this bag is plenty long -LRB- although , I 'm 5 ' 2 '' , so what does that mean ? -RRB- .3 . I can carry a midsize camera , field guides , small notebook , snacks , and water in the main compartment . The internal pockets hold a LOT of little stuff -LRB- ipod , pens , jots , bug juice , memory sticks , first-aid junk -RRB- without cluttering the bottom of the bag . All this gear is right at my fingertips ... no more flushing birds while shucking a backpack in the brush .4 . It does n't have TIMBUKTU plastered across the front . The attractive logo is visible , but it does n't turn me into a human billboard .5 . I bought it for birding , but it quickly replaced the pack I -LRB- as a good Pacific Northwesterner -RRB- have long used as an everyday bag.It loses a star because I hate velcro and this bag comes with two enormous strips of that noisy % # @ ! . My usual trick of covering the scritchy side with felt fixed that problem . The bag is well balanced when loaded -LRB- does n't tip and spill -RRB- , so eliminating the velcro has n't reduced it 's performance.This model would NOT be an adequate size for use as a book bag . Try the next size up or stick with a pack to save your back .
 awesome bag . I love Timbuk2 . This is my 2nd bag , and I basically bought this one to have a smaller bag to use at different times when I do n't want to lug my laptop around . It 's made well and looks cool ... what more could you want .
 The Timbuk2 class messenger bag is great . Holds quite a bit for it 's size . Very useful and good quality .
 I bought this bag 11 years ago when I was in college . It has more than withstood the test of time - I still use this bag on a daily basis with only some mild wear on the inside vinyl waterproof lining that has affected its waterproof-ness -LRB- though based on what I read on the company website , this is covered as part of their lifetime warranty ! -RRB- . Pick your colors carefully because you 'll never need to buy a new bag .
 I used this thing for the first 2 years of grad school and it was excellent . I hauled huge quantities of books and notes around all the time and the thing is like new . And it is really waterproof . When I got a new laptop this year , I ordered the laptop version and I love that too .
 This is the best investment in a bag I have ever made . It looks brand new and I have had it for almost 8 months . Its waterproof , durable , and I can fit a lot of heavy school books into it . The strap is thick and comfortable to strap around your body . I love having it on my bike rides to the grocery store , because you can fit so much into it and not have to put plastic bags on your handle bars and hope they do n't break on the way home!LOVE IT . I plan to get a smaller one for shopping and travel .
 I was a messenger in NY , NY before I joined the Army and I used a Timbuk2 purple and green bag then and loved it . Now that I 'm in the army purple and green are out of the question but this bag will due . It is the strongest easy to use multipurpose bag you will ever need . Just be careful how you pack it for maximum comfort . On the negative side the waist band is too short.Timbuk2 Classic Messenger BagTimbuk2 Strap Pad - Grip -LRB- Black -LRB- Grip -RRB- - one size -RRB-
 This bag really amazed me when I got it . It was the perfect size with a little extra room just in case . I 'm able to take it downtown when I commute and bring a textbook and change of shoes to work , as well as carry all my textbooks , notebooks , and binders to school . It is extremely versatile and I love that it 's waterproof and very durable . This bag will also be extremely useful when I 'm able to go away for the weekend . :-RRB- This was definitely the bag for me .
 This is a great bag . Lots of room . The small is bigger than I thought it would be . I also bought a medium sized Timbuk2 bag and it would be great for traveling . I like the bag so much I bought a few for friends and family . Nicely made with lots of compartments for cell phones and PDA 's .
 This bag is great . Sturdy . Stylish . I love the quality . Works great as a purse , diaper bag , or carry-all . Highly recommend it !
 This is an awesome bag . Works great for a laptop and is easy to carry .
 I 'm using this bag to hold my 15 '' MacBook Pro . It has the right amount of padding and convenient pockets . The strap , however , just hurt my shoulder and annoyed me ! No worries , I replaced it with the SKOOBA superbungee strap , and now it 's the perfect laptop bag !
 Timbuk2 bags are awesome and nearly indestructible just like the T2 . I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it . The only thing missing is a side pocket for a water bottle . But I suppose the bike messengers did n't have time for frilly extras like that . If you can take the time to visit the company 's website to custom design your own bag or check out the cool artist designed limited ones .
 This bag has made such a difference . It is comfortable , spacious , and organized so that I am not constantly digging around looking for things . It is great for everyday and if I get tired of carrying it , my husband does n't mind holding my `` purse '' for me . There have been a couple of instances where I was a little embarrassed by the loud velcro sound of opening my bag , but that is far outweighed by the benefits . I even got a complement on how nice it looked , but this is no fashion purse . Thanks Timbuk2 !
 I was worried this bag would be too small , but there are enough pockets for everything , one big space for lunch , books , fits a regular size folder or notebook . If I could afford it , I 'd get a few in different colors because it was hard to choose just one . The only thing I would change is to remove the Velcro from the front flap - just not a fan of the noise . Sometimes you just need to grab a mint in a quiet place .
 I Love Timbuk2 ! This is my second bag . I have the medium size which I put my laptop and my work essentials in . I recently purchased the extra small to use for day trips and to run errands . I ordered the small but had to return it as the size difference between the medium and the small where not that significant . These bags are durable and sturdy . The quality surpasses any messenger back that I have ever owned . Amazon was great ! I purchased many things through them and the delivery time is pretty accurate . I hope to buy more Timbuk2 's soon !
 The bag is O.k. . It seems to be durable and is water-proof from rain splatters . Im sure that on a bike in a rainstorm water would get in from the top corners . One thing I dont like about the bag is that it should have a zippered pocket along the back of the inside . It does have a small one in the front inside . I saw another Timbuk 2 classic messenger bag with the zip pocket on the back inside for files etc. . I would definatly of prefered that model . As far as the color goes all black is kind of plain and boring . I should of got one with some colors . I was thinking about all black being able to hide stains , which im sure after a few years of use ill be glad I got the all black . Overall the bag is good for what it is . I use it for college and it is working well . I will definatly be using it to go to the lake this summer and on my boat .
 I got this bag on sale for thirty dollars . It looks sharp , it is comfortable , it is the perfect size . I just do n't know what else I could ask for . I knew it was going to last me a looooooong time just from seeing the fabric it was made out of up close . The dudes at timbuk2 have obviously been at this for awhile and know a lot about what a good bag needs and what serious cyclists demand . Sure it might not be as hip as Chrome or other brands , but seriously , they make some slick colorways , and at prices like these it is an undeniable steal .
 I bought for my wife because she is starting grad school . The bag is made very well and has an easily adjustable strap for comfortable over the shoulder carrying . The key holder is great because , with a purse my wife would search for hours . There is a good amount of storage and many deep pockets that are not exposed to the world . Great bag .
 this bag is really nice for traveling . i used it in place of a purse . it held all of the things i bought plus all of my personal items . the only thing that i was disappointed about was that it was the xs size , and the over the shoulder strap could be a tad bit longer . when i was ordering it i was n't aware there were different sizes and could n't find anywhere that said what size this bag was , when i got it , the bag was the extra small size , which i was concerned about , but in the end it all worked out .
 I have the XS size and I love it . It fits my personal essentials , a bottle of water and a book . It 's also light enough that it does n't strain my shoulder . I can access my things easily by swinging it around vs using a backpack . I just wish it had a pocket on the back of the outside -LRB- for mail -RRB- , a big open pocket on the inside and a handle on the top . The padded strap that came along with it kept sliding around so I took it off . It worked much better for me that way . It retains it 's shape with a bottle or a book inside it unlike the bigger models .
 I was very pleased with my purchase . It was exactly what I ordered and wanted . Price was great too .
 I just took this bag out for the first time to a 2 week trip through Brazil and the bag was even better than expected . I bought the medium-sized bag and was able to fit more than I could possibly ever need out and about on the streets . The bag is well-constructed and heavy-duty and shows no use whatsoever after using it for 12 + hours everyday for 2 weeks . The weight distribution works really well and my back never tired even with carry a lot of weight in the bag . If you are looking at buying a bag , I would seriously check out each size , because the medium was even bigger than I anticipated . This bag would be great for any traveler or person on the go .
 I bought this for my husband because he likes a fleece vest with a collar . He is very pleased and the vest looks great . The collar is big enough to really keep the wind off your neck .
 Its comfortable , warm , a little short in length but overall a really nice vest for me to wear in all types of weather . If I had to complain about one thing it would be that it is not fleece like I thought it would be so make sure you know what you 're buying . Other then that a nice product though !
 The vest fits well and is well made . If it had a zippered breast pocket it would be ideal and would get 5 stars . I would order it again .
