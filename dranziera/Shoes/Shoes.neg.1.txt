 The boot is comfortable , warm , waterproof , and protected my feet from falling objects . However , the side snaps broke off after 3 weeks . A week later , one side zipper broke . The zipper should be on the outside of the ankle so they do not collide with each other . I liked this boot and am disappointed in the poor construction .
 great on delivery but bad product the snaps broke the first time I put the boots on.What a deal ... not planning to continue use of this item.after seeing no response guess I 'll have to share my disappointment with my friends ... To no surprise ; the bottom of the right foot is already falling off . Beware this one
 I bought this and after 2 days of wear the buckle fell off on both shoes . I tried to jimmy it back on to no avail , they are sitting some where under some stuff in my closet and I am unable to wear them . I should have sent them back but I forgot about it , and now it has been too long since I bought them . Very cheap !
 Take it from someone who has very tough feet to make happy ! This Leo shoe is way too stiff for someone with bunions or bad feet . It ca n't compare with the Capezio 700 t-strap which worked well for me once I got it stretched a little .

 These shoes are a disappointment . I really wanted to like them but they just do n't cut it for any kind of offroad trail walking . They have no grip on damp rocks , let alone wet or mossy ones . The high footbed and vent cutouts leaves you with little ankle support . Also , they do n't breath despite all the holes , especially in the toe , which causes sweaty blistery toe rubbing . :--LRB- Overall , the biggest drawback is the awful grip . If you plan on walking anywhere remotely wet please AVOID .
 I find these shoes to be slightly larger than the size indicated causing a looser fit than I desire and this problem is compounded by the fact that the spring in the cinch tab is not as strong as needed to hold the laces tight . Walking no more than 100 feet causes the laces , and therefore shoes , to become uncomfortably loose . If I had not mistakenly discarded the box , I would have returned the shoes .
 I was disappointed since I really liked the look and tread of this product . I have a pair of Keens that are 4-5 years old and I 've worn them out . I wanted a new pair with better traction since I do some light hiking in with my Keen 's on . These were perfect ... however , when they arrived they were the right size but WAY too big . My foot was not snug in them & moved around even with the laces pulled as tight as possible . Then with the laces pulled so tight , the extra lace at the top was huge and would flop around . There is no place to secure or tuck in the top lace which seems to be a design flaw to me . I have fairly narrow feet so maybe that was the problem . Though I do not typically have issues with shoe size . I ultimately returned these Keen 's to Amazon .
 These shoes were too small and looked like it has been used . The soles were supposed to be black , but they were gray . Somehow , I tried these at the store and the size was fine . However the ones Amazon sent did n't fit . Overall , I was very unhappy with this purchase ; therefore , I returned it for a full refund .

 I 'm glad other people have had luck with Mack 's Prairie Wings because I definitely have not . After reading the reviews I decided to place an order for the Itasca boots . It was short notice as we were leaving on vacation soon . I was extremely careful about my shoe size selection because I 've inadvertently ordered the wrong size in the past . After reading Amazon 's sizing chart I placed my order . When I received my order I received toddler size boots and not youth -LRB- boys -RRB- size boots . Very frustrated I went back to look at the Amazon chart again , upset with myself for making the same mistake . Then I had 3 other people look at the sizing chart . The sizing chart Amazon shows is not the sizing chart Mack 's uses for this particular boot . Since our vacation was a week away I immediately wrote a note and included it with my return . I called the # but no one answered so I left a message saying it was urgent I get the right boots . Nothing . I heard nothing from Mack 's . No response to the note in my return package . No response to my phone call . After vacation I received a letter saying my order was on backorder until July 2011 . So I called and canceled the backorder . A week later , no credit . I called once again and the guy said I have to call back tomorrow . There 's no one here that can help you . For everyone that has a good experience with Mack 's , be thankful . I will never order from them again and neither will anyone I know .
 Not only did the boots show up about a week later than said , but they were a size 8 baby instead of the youth size 8 I ordered . I double checked the size just to make certain I was ordering the right size as I had read another review with the same problem . In desperate need of my sons snow boots , we waited and waited and waited ! Only to receive baby boots ! Than , they would n't respond to any of my emails so I finally got a hold of amazon and they took care of everything . I gave the boots to someone who could use them ! Wo n't buy from again !
 I ordered the Snow Stomper II `` Big Kids '' size 8 from Mack 's Prairie Wings and received a way smaller boot than what I had ordered . The size chart next to the product said that this size is for a 9-3/4 inch foot , so it would be the appropriate size for my 11-year-old son . I received a pair of boots that were 6-3/4 inches long , and the tag says `` Kids '' size 8 -LRB- not `` Big Kids '' -RRB- . I 'd read the reviews and some said the sizing was off , but since the size chart listed `` Big Kids '' I assumed it might have been an error that had been taken care of . I plan on returning them to Mack 's and complain that their size choices are not accurate and do not fit with what Amazon 's shoe/foot size chart says , as it is listed with their product . I believe they should provide return postage since this is in their error .
 There was nothing wrong with these boots except they were a toddler size not a boys size . The seller needs to be more specific on sizing .
 I purchased these boots in December 2010 . Not even 30 days after purchase the zipper broke on one of the boots . I ca n't return to the store because they do n't accept worn footware . We now have a $ 15 pair from Wal-Mart , no zippers . They work great !
 I have to say this upfront . I am 6 ' 2 and ordered a size 12 wide . I have very unusual feet . Very high arches is just one problem . Even though the shoes are marked wide , they narrow the front of the shoe when , to me , they ought to let it be a little wider at this point and then taper it down . It would make it easier for we girls with big feet to find shoes which would fit better.I could not get the front part of my foot in the first shoe out of the box . To me , shoe manufacturers forget we now have ladies in the 6 ' to 6 ' 7 heigths which means the size twelve they are used to making probably will not work with these taller ladies.All the regular size -LSB- under 5 ' 11 -RSB- women I bowl with , really love the Dexter shoe . In fact I would say over 90 % wear them.I bought a pair of Dexter mens shoe at one of the large named sport stores . They are comfortable.Rachael
 Actually these were advertised in the men 's bowling shoes section , but arrived in a woman 's shoe box.Women 's size 12 is different than men 's size 12 , so we returned them as they did not reflect the ad . shipping was quick and that was good , but product was not as expected or needed .
 The sole of one shoe was dirty , white filling had been applied to the toe , a white patch was evident , stitching was defective . All this on the left shoe . I can not claim it was n't what we ordered or that it did n't fit , but when my wife is unhappy , I am unhappy .
 I bought these bowling shoes for my mother and she said they feel about 1 size smaller than any other shoe she has ever worn . Extremely tight . The shoes look nice but if you ca n't wear them , they are useless .
 The shoes seemed to be just what I wanted , but in the left shoe the front of the sole was not glued down so the inner sole was all bunched up and uncomfortable . Can not recommend this product - besides the fact that I had to pay shipping both ways was not a good experience .
 it was small bad quality and for 32 $ it was awful i am not satisfiedi want 2 exchange but i cant
 The first pair I ordered after using the recommended process turned out to be to small . So I returned and order a 1/2 size larger and they were too small as well . I believe the shoes have a serious flaw and you can not rely on getting the right fit .
 I think this product runs a little small . I returned the product . I was a little discouraged by the method of return that I had to use . Unlike most sellers a bar-code return shipment page was not provided either in the packaging or via email . Oh , well ... I returned it anyway and now I 'm waiting for the credit . I 'm not saying they sell a bad product it just did n't work for me .
 The bowling shoes I ordered were not the correct size of US Woman 's size 7.5 . Thebox it was shipped in was originally labeled US Woman 's 8.5 . However , that was not the problem . The shoes themselves must have been labeled incorrectly at the factory . They were much TOO small . I have since purchased a size 7.5 Woman 's from another online vendor which fit correctly . My true problem is that I spent about $ 20 shipping to receive and send back the incorrect shoes .
 I bought these shoes from Eastbay . They are the worst pair of shoes that I have ever worn in my life . After wearing them for less than a week , I have identical cuts on both of my ankles from where the shoe jabbed into my skin . There is a flexible backing on the shoe which is sewn to the inside right where your ankle goes . As you walk , it grinds into your ankle and makes walking extremely uncomfortable . I HIGHLY recommend not buying this product .

 I like Vaneli styles , and I own other shoes from this company , but these were unusually cheap . They were unlined ! I looked at the other Vaneli shoes in my closet , and they are lined . The suede will certainly stretch out of shape very quickly without any type of lining . In addition , the heel plates are cheap , hard plastic . My experience with this type of heel plate is that it crack and even falls off . My other complaint is the excessive shipping charges . FootSmart charged me $ 12.99 to ship the shoes , and because I am mailing them back due to their cheap construction , they are charging me $ 6.99 more using the barcode return label . Thus I spent $ 20 to try on cheap shoes . I do n't think I will buy Vaneli online anymore , and I wo n't order from FootSmart . Many other shoe vendors charge much less or even zero -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- ! -RRB- .
 Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot , however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out .

 These are most uncomfortable shoes I have ever worn . I understand that there is a break in period for leather , but you ca n't possibly wear these enough times to ever break them in -LRB- if they ever do -RRB- . I feel like I have two boards strapped to my feet . They pinch in the heel and leave blisters within a few hours . The manufacturer may want to condition , rub 'em or whatever to make these a bit softer before they sell them .

 I had such high hopes when I ordered this thong . I read the Amazon product description and it made this footwear seems so comfortable . The only thing right about it is that it is lightweight . The insole was so hard and it did n't feel like it had any support at all . My feet ached after only a few minutes of wearing it . What a complete waste of money .
 This is definitely not something I would want to wear while working out . Even with mild exercise the lining feels sticky , and the fabric does not appear to breathe . I 'd rather wear cotton jersey pants than this . For cooler weather , I 'd prefer something like a good pair of tights -LRB- Sugoi for example -RRB- .

 Minnetonka Moccasins that have this type of sole are too wide . The sole with the little nubs on the bottom are a better fit if you have a more slender foot . I love the look of these , but can not keep my feet from falling out of them .
 Received the mocs in timely manner , however they were poorly fitted . They were huge , at least a size too large and the width would 've accommodated a very FAT , WIDE foot . Was so disappointed . Have had these mocs . before and they fit wonderfully . Not the case this time . Sorry
 The stitches on my left shoe fell apart , and I now have a `` joker 's mouth '' on my shoe front . I am very disappointed!Anyone knows how to repair the shoe ? It sounds silly , but i really want to get my money 's worth ...

 The boots were too big around my calves and I usually do n't have any trouble with that . It was a pretty good deal , but I will be sending mine back .

 I received shoes and they did not fit . So i packaged them up with the only piece of paper that was enclosed . I expected some kind of return label but was none . So i wrote on invoice `` did not fit '' and mailed back . Two weeks later the package came back with `` return to sender '' all over it . And in several places it said . RETURN , NO RMA . needless to say i was unhappy to see this . I called and was pleasant and got RMA , which is return merchandise authorization . I remailed a week ago and have heard nothing so far . I real pain in the neck experience and i will never buy propet shoe again . !!!!
 bad seller , took entirely too long to ship , some of my order was n't even sent and eventually had to cancel months later , have no idea why since my size was still listed for sale the whole time ... I think they just did n't want to honor their sale along with amazon 's discount . Hopefully I get a complete refund of what was n't sent . I 'm losing my faith in Amazon and the people who sell on there , shipping always seems to be sloooooowwwwwwww especially the super saver shipping items very very slow

 Purchased shoes in late May 2010 . Did not wear them until mid 2011 . Left sole began delaminating from the shoe after 3-4 months of wear . Continued to use them and attempted to glue sole back with Shoe Goop -LRB- tm -RRB- . Did not work . Finally gave up and sent an email asking if poor quality stitching problem had been resolved since I would like to buy another pair . I have owned at least 15 pairs since 1975 and all of them have failed after 3-4 years of extremely hard wear and never once has the sole come apart . The leather usually cracks after repeated wet and dry cycles -LRB- over many years -RRB- . In other words normal wear . The latest pair very prematurely failed . Shipped them back to Sperry -LRB- at my expense -RRB- for evaluation . I do n't expect much .
 I have been using Sperry Top-siders for about 40 years , always size 9.5 . These shoes arrived , marking inside said 9.5 , but there was no chance they would fit . Too small ... return . Replaced them with a pair of Timberline shoes from Amazon size 9.5 , they arrived yesterday , them fit fine .
 I 've been wearing Sperry Top-Siders in 12 wide since the early 1980s , and for well over a decade in the color Sahara.Though I specified Sahara , and what arrived was labeled Sahara , these appear to be shipped mislabeled and are actually Oatmeal -LRB- from what I can tell by comparing to online colors -RRB- . They say Sahara on the box but are not.Worse still , though they say 12 wide , my last pair was roomy in width and just right in length . This pair is tight in length and tight in width , but worse still , the left one is MUCH tighter than the right , and though I tried breaking them in for two days to see if they would stretch , this only resulted in pain and my left foot swelling up.Are they making these in China now ? That would explain so much.These are not the Sperry Top-Siders we have all worn for decades . Something is seriously wrong when a company is suddenly shipping out mislabeled products -LRB- the wrong color shoes in a box labeled as being a different color , and that most likely are also mis-labeled in size at the factory before being boxed . That 's two major errors ? I will never buy these shoes online again with these kinds of quality control issues , and will instead give Sebago boat shoes a try , ending a 30 year run with Sperry .
 I was extremely unhappy even at first when I received the shoes and saw that the insole only extended to the mid point of the shoe . It reduced support and made the inside feel rough and not very comfortable . I wore them for a time over the summer and the sole on both has split in the mid point of the front . I had owned Topsiders from Sperry before and they lasted for years , dealing with salt water from my sailing and other activities.It will be a long time before I can be convinced to buy a Sperry product again . They have obviously totally taken quality out of the equation .
 Got shoes within 2 days the whole insole cracked . It 's like there extremely old and dry rotted . Will never buy sperrys through amazon again .
 These shoes are very uncomfortable . I was extremely disappointed with what I thought would become a favorite shoe of mine . If support is what you need in footwear , search elsewhere .
 Disappointing is the word I 'd use to describe this purchase . I had a pair of identical shoes that were about 8 years old . They were pretty worn but I had enjoyed wearing them so much I bought them again.The leather on this shoe is not nearly as soft . Also , there was so much shoe polish on the shoes that it seeps through the leather and if you wear light-colored socks for more than a couple of hours you will take off a pair of socks with brown shoe polish all over them . I 've ruined two pairs of socks already thinking that it was just a slight remnant of the assembly process.I 'm going to wear them a few more times in hopes that the leather softens up and the polish diminishes but I 've already worn them for about 40 hours and there has been little improvement to either problem .
 The Sperry shoes are fine , but be careful in that what Amazon shows -LRB- a reddish brown leather with white sole -RRB- is not the shoe that is actually sent as that one is a tan shoe with a brown sole . Got these for my son 's birthday and was disappointed that what I thought we ordered was n't what we actually got . Went back and double checked to make sure I did n't just select the wrong pair , and now see that the small thumbnail image does n't match the original product page .
 I have owned several pairs of the AO Sahara . This pair is much , much lighter in color than past purchases . I am not sure why it is not even close in color to others I have owned and those seen in stores .
 The Sperry Top-Sider in Amaretto was a far darker color than the photo on Amazon . I did not try them on , and instead , returned it hassle-free and that went well . I chose a brown/brown replacement as it looked like my next best choice , but the size seems to run small . It 's an uncomfortable fit -LRB- I decided to tough it out and not do a second return -RRB- . My feet are not hard to fit as I have bought several pairs of shoes from other manufacturers on Amazon in this same size and they fit perfectly .
 The shoe I received must have been a second or a knockoff . Quality was not that of sperry . Very disappointing . Could not return it as my son left for college the next day and needed them .
 Ordered the Wide width expecting to shoe to be at least a bit wider than an average shoe . In fact , the shoe was so narrow through the ball of the foot , felt like my foot was being squeezed . Returning this shoe immediately . Also , did n't care for the brassy gold color of the shoe lace grommets ! Very disappointed !!
 The wrong size shoes were in the correct box , box said size 11 which is what I ordered but the shoes inside are a size 13 and the seller has not got back in touch with me . Not very happy here and I paid alot of money for them .
 This shoes are not worth the price or the quality.Ive used them probably 5 months now and they seem to be breaking apart ... the shoelaces especially are most likely made out of chalk or something.Ive ordered other boat shoes from amazong without any problems at all and get complimented all the time!This just dont match up , Get another one . .
 A pair of shoes arrived that did n't meet my color expectations -LRB- shoes were suede not brown leather -RRB- . I requested a return from the vendor and have been ignored to this point .
 This is definitely not something I would want to wear while working out . Even with mild exercise the lining feels sticky , and the fabric does not appear to breathe . I 'd rather wear cotton jersey pants than this . For cooler weather , I 'd prefer something like a good pair of tights -LRB- Sugoi for example -RRB- .
 Both of these were smaller than any 13 shoe I 've ever worn , especially the right shoe , which is too small to even wear . The silver finish is worn off around the edge like they 'd already been used . Not a good purchase
 Defective product , left shoe too tight and a bit short ! I have had three other pairs of New Balance 574 ' s with out a problem .
 im really so disappointed with this new balance , its really hard to wear it for long hours , my feet hurts , now i dont know what to do with it , i probably just gon na throw it on the trash , i wasted $ 38 , dont be fooled by false reviews , i have the same 574 but i bought it from a local store and its really good , the reason i bought the next one from amazon because it was hard to find the EE size at local stores , i should have a refund for this , i know amazon dont return worn shoes , but i was expecting same comfort as the one i bought from a local store , iam very dissappointed
 Only one color is available for the sale price , and not even in all sizes . It should read `` Sale . $ 39.99 on selected color ... ''
 I was greatly disappointed in fit , very narrow compared with previous New Balace shoes purchased over the last 25 + years . I will not buy NB again .
 el producto aun no ha llegado al lugar de destino , tiene mas de un mes de retraso y aun no ha sido despachado para recibirlo en mi local ...
 I loved the shoe itself , i.e. , the quality of its production and the colors , and in general have had great experiences with new balance in the past , but I ordered the wides and they were not really wide at all.If you are not a wide foot like myself , then this will not really apply to you , and you should read another review .
 Bought these for my husband and was wondering why they were so cheap . We love New Balance . But these were made in China !! What 's up New Balance ? We love you cause you 're made in the USA !!!
 Nowhere does it say this shoe has a slip-in insole . I HATE removable insoles so I 'm returning . Also , the box came sealed like new shoes , but one shoe had been laced - rather sloppily leaving twisty creases in the lace - a clear indication this was a return or a store second . Not sure I 'm guaranteed a factory-fresh shoe when I buy thru Amazon , but that 's what I expected . Would n't you ?
 First , these shoes look amazing . The navy suede over the silver really stands out . The N logo on the side even shimmers in the sunlight . So in that regard , they were perfect.As for comfort , they 're as good as any Airwalks or Vans I 've ever worn before . The insole is n't super thick , but it offers some protection from the rocks and whatnot.The durability , unfortunately , does n't seem to be working out for me . One of the shoes , the tighter of the two when I tried them on , has stretched out at least half a size in under a month . It went from rubbing my big toe a bit to my heel suddenly slipping out of the cup . I tried new insoles , that did n't work . I tried the heel lock lacing , and that did n't work . It just seems to be too big for my foot now , a little over a month after the purchase.It 's very frustrating , as I loved the shoes originally , but now my heel is sore from rubbing against the back of the shoe .
 Hard like a rock box label 8.5 ee But 8.5 gave them to Salvation Army not worth your time looking ordering waiting then you still have to buy again . I will be glad when gov takes control
 left one of pair is warped . . I wish I did n't make this purchase.if you do n't see and touch anything you want to buy , do not buy it .

 im really so disappointed with this new balance , its really hard to wear it for long hours , my feet hurts , now i dont know what to do with it , i probably just gon na throw it on the trash , i wasted $ 38 , dont be fooled by false reviews , i have the same 574 but i bought it from a local store and its really good , the reason i bought the next one from amazon because it was hard to find the EE size at local stores , i should have a refund for this , i know amazon dont return worn shoes , but i was expecting same comfort as the one i bought from a local store , iam very dissappointed
 Only one color is available for the sale price , and not even in all sizes . It should read `` Sale . $ 39.99 on selected color ... ''
 Both of these were smaller than any 13 shoe I 've ever worn , especially the right shoe , which is too small to even wear . The silver finish is worn off around the edge like they 'd already been used . Not a good purchase
 Defective product , left shoe too tight and a bit short ! I have had three other pairs of New Balance 574 ' s with out a problem .
 I was greatly disappointed in fit , very narrow compared with previous New Balace shoes purchased over the last 25 + years . I will not buy NB again .
 el producto aun no ha llegado al lugar de destino , tiene mas de un mes de retraso y aun no ha sido despachado para recibirlo en mi local ...
 I loved the shoe itself , i.e. , the quality of its production and the colors , and in general have had great experiences with new balance in the past , but I ordered the wides and they were not really wide at all.If you are not a wide foot like myself , then this will not really apply to you , and you should read another review .
 Hard like a rock box label 8.5 ee But 8.5 gave them to Salvation Army not worth your time looking ordering waiting then you still have to buy again . I will be glad when gov takes control
 left one of pair is warped . . I wish I did n't make this purchase.if you do n't see and touch anything you want to buy , do not buy it .
 Nowhere does it say this shoe has a slip-in insole . I HATE removable insoles so I 'm returning . Also , the box came sealed like new shoes , but one shoe had been laced - rather sloppily leaving twisty creases in the lace - a clear indication this was a return or a store second . Not sure I 'm guaranteed a factory-fresh shoe when I buy thru Amazon , but that 's what I expected . Would n't you ?
 First , these shoes look amazing . The navy suede over the silver really stands out . The N logo on the side even shimmers in the sunlight . So in that regard , they were perfect.As for comfort , they 're as good as any Airwalks or Vans I 've ever worn before . The insole is n't super thick , but it offers some protection from the rocks and whatnot.The durability , unfortunately , does n't seem to be working out for me . One of the shoes , the tighter of the two when I tried them on , has stretched out at least half a size in under a month . It went from rubbing my big toe a bit to my heel suddenly slipping out of the cup . I tried new insoles , that did n't work . I tried the heel lock lacing , and that did n't work . It just seems to be too big for my foot now , a little over a month after the purchase.It 's very frustrating , as I loved the shoes originally , but now my heel is sore from rubbing against the back of the shoe .
 Bought these for my husband and was wondering why they were so cheap . We love New Balance . But these were made in China !! What 's up New Balance ? We love you cause you 're made in the USA !!!
 The shoe looks sharp , but is lacking in comfort . As for the `` leather '' , it is more `` kind of leather looking . '' If looking for a similar shoe again , I would spend a little more and get something more comfortable with a higher quality leather .
 What can I say ? You get what you pay for . Took me two weeks to break these in and they still feel too small . Bought som Allen Edmonds later , what a difference . Consider yourself warned .
 Did not meet my expectations for the price paid . Could have purchased a better one from a nearby store . The image provided looks more like a photoshoped image .
 These shoes have never fit right . I have had them professionally stretched and my cobbler says there is no way these are a 5E . I 've never worn them for more than an hour -- because they hurt so much -- but figured after having them stretched Amazon probably would n't entertain the idea of returning . If there is an Amazon person monitoring this , and you think you can help , please let me know . I 'd be happy to buy the other shoes again as a return -- even though the cost was nearly double .
 This is an excellent high quality shoe made by Florsheim . I have successfully worn their 5 E width shoes in the past . Although the shoe I received was labeled 5 E in width on both the box and the shoe , I do not believe that was , in fact , the actual size . I believe that a 3 E shoe had been incorrectly mislabeled as a 5 E and that is what I had received . However , Amazon made the return process very easy .

 Well , I ordered this boot because the price makes it a fabulous bargain , and it looked good in the picture , but honestly , after trying it on , I ca n't think of a situation where I would wear it . It 's not waterproof , it 's not sturdy or heavy enough for cold weather wear ; snow and salt would probably ruin it in a hurry . The sole looks sturdy in the picture , but it feels very thin , and feels like you are walking barefoot . As far as looks , it 's very trendy and fashionable . If I rated it on looks alone , it would be 5 stars ! A couple more negatives
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .

 this shoe was unusually wide for A width , thus I had to return . Returnining is always a pain for me .
 size 10N . LifeStride used to fit , but these seemed to wide for me . Liked them , but returned them because of fit .
 I like Vaneli styles , and I own other shoes from this company , but these were unusually cheap . They were unlined ! I looked at the other Vaneli shoes in my closet , and they are lined . The suede will certainly stretch out of shape very quickly without any type of lining . In addition , the heel plates are cheap , hard plastic . My experience with this type of heel plate is that it crack and even falls off . My other complaint is the excessive shipping charges . FootSmart charged me $ 12.99 to ship the shoes , and because I am mailing them back due to their cheap construction , they are charging me $ 6.99 more using the barcode return label . Thus I spent $ 20 to try on cheap shoes . I do n't think I will buy Vaneli online anymore , and I wo n't order from FootSmart . Many other shoe vendors charge much less or even zero -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- ! -RRB- .
 Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot , however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out .

 PRODUCT WELL MADE , SIZED PROPERLY , LEATHER UPPERS SUPPLE AND NICE . HOWEVER , SOLE WAS VERY HARD AND UNCOMFORTABLE TO WALK IN . STRAP WAS DIFFICULT TO BUCKLE FOR ME , AND THERE WAS NO ARCH SUPPORT AT ALL
 This shoe looks like my regular diabetic walking shoes , but the quality and workmanship is very poor.The straps were made with such thin leather , that when walking in my livingroom , the straps actuallycut my skin over my ankles and toes . Had to send them right back . Beware of copy cat items whenpurchasing items for yourself .
 These were not comfortable for me . I have a bunion on one foot so the adjustable straps were good but after an hour or so on my feet , they hurt . I just have a really hard time finding shoes that do n't hurt my feet and these were not them .
 Propet Women 's W0001 Breeze Walker SandalThis shoe is advertised as a walker , but it did not give my feet enough support for me to walk across the street in them . I was very disappointed and returned the shoes . The return was easy , and I appreciated the service I received , just not the product .
 I purchased these knowing they would fit because I had a pair in another color , but I was wrong they were at least 1/2of a size too large . I returned them but had to pay the postage . I feel like that is unfair because they were sized wrong .
 The product runs large and the process of trying the exchange for smallersize is just about impossible . I am still trying to get the shoes back in a half size smaller . They would be o.k. if they fit .
 These shoes run much smaller than Clark 's . I was very disappointed and ended up stuck with them because I could n't get to the post office to return them within the 30 days .
 Looked like they were substantial sandals . I looked at the pictures very carefully , though what I could not see until they arrived was the poor finished product in the top strap . It was not rounded and finished off soft , rather it was rough along the seam edges and therefore it would give blisters rubbing on the top part of the toes . Shame , other than that it was a decent sandal .
 The sandal is stiff and the quality is so so . The original price is marked much way too high compared to the quality .

 bad seller , took entirely too long to ship , some of my order was n't even sent and eventually had to cancel months later , have no idea why since my size was still listed for sale the whole time ... I think they just did n't want to honor their sale along with amazon 's discount . Hopefully I get a complete refund of what was n't sent . I 'm losing my faith in Amazon and the people who sell on there , shipping always seems to be sloooooowwwwwwww especially the super saver shipping items very very slow

 The boot its self is a good boot . I paid an extra $ 35 for overnight shipping so all together spent $ 85 . But I ordered a size 7 put it on and it was abolutely huge . I thought wow they just must run big . I got the shoe at the last minute so I didnt have a chance to really look at the box . An hour into wearing the boot I had to take them off and go bare foot the rest of the night with no shoes because they caused such a massive blister on both feet do to them being so big . I just recently got around to looking at the box by accident when I realized they sent me a size 11 . I emailed the company explaining I didnt even think to look at the box to see why they were so big . I explained I did n't even want a refund just exchange for the size I paid for . They said no cause they were considered used . I expect when I pay such an enormous amount of money that the company would at least get the size right . So now I am stuck with a pair of boots I will never wear again . I will never oreder from this company again .

 I was very excited when I purchased these shoes . Unfortunately it took 2 weeks for them to arrive and when I opened the package to inspect it the shoes looked dirty . They were supposed to be new . They were also mis-matched . They were supposed to be a size 8 1/2 M . They were one 8 1/2 M and one 8 1/2 N. I do n't think I will buy anything from this seller again -LRB- Gotham City Online -RRB- .

 These boots are cute , but I only wore them a handful of times before the soles became detached from the rest of the boot . Very poor quality .
 Cute , and did their job for the first season I had them , but by the following spring both boots were leaking ... A LOT ! Very disappointing for the money .
 They totally fell apart after wearing them 2 or 3 times ! I expected more having paid nearly $ 20 for a pair of slippers . VERY dissapointed !
 I gave these slippers to my mother for Christmas and they do not hold up well . The first pair came apart in the wash and the second pair has n't been washed yet , but they 're already coming apart also . Not a good buy .
 after only one week use at home , the sole was completely broken . the worst quality slipper i have ever seen !

 These shoes look good online , but they do not have the support I expect from Rockport . Wish I could return them , but keep trying to wear them with my Orthotics . MY shoe of choice will continue to be Easy Spirit . kc
 These shoes are SO narrow ! I ordered a 4E 6.5 and I 'm warning you , they are as narrow as a child 's shoe ! The company was very easy to work with , so NO complaints there ! -LRB- I did have to pay $ 8 for return shipping which stinks , but at least I 'm not stuck with these shoes -RRB-
 The boot has a great heel and sole , and the price is good for a work boot . That is the plus side . The negatives are the country of origin is not listed and the boot leather is very thin . I returned my purchase after opening the box and thinking that these are not durable enough for farm work .
 I owned a pair of Doc Martens for 10 years and when they gave out I ordered this pair . Unlike my last pair , these were extremely uncomfortable . I could n't wear them without pain , so I returned them .
 shoe size was wrong , felt like the shoes were seconds . Sent them back for a replacement , or refund on the 26th of Dec. today is the 19th of Jan. and still have not received any new shoes , or heard from anyone via , e-mail , or phone . Customer service sucks since they already received payment from credit card . But the shoes look really nice ... if they fit anyone from america ??

 I ordered these cleats thinking maybe Lady Footlocker sold mens cleats , not the case . I got a pair of 10 's that fit like an eight . They look great , but as a guy , you just ca n't go around wearing chick cleats ...

 Very disappointed with this shoe and unfortunately I bought 2 pairs . Can not believe Aerosoles markets this design . Will stick with Steve Madden .
 THIS SHOE IS NOT COMFORTABLE I WAS DISAPPOINTED BEING IT IS AEROSOLES AND YOU USUALLY ASSOCIATE THAT NAME W / COMFORT . VERY NARROW ! IF YOU HAVE SMALL FEET THE PERFECT SHOE . QUALITY GOOD .

 Something about the front ankle portion of the boot is really inflexible , and therefore kind of uncomfortable to walk in .

 Shoes seemed comfortable so I have purchased to wear them in the office . The quality was so shoddy - I will never purchase another pair of Florsheim shoes.I have worn them only in a car driving to work and in the office . Still , in 2-3 days the spray-on laquer started to peel of from soles . After 3 weeks or so sole of one shoe desintegrated , cracked . Just imagine , wearing those shoes in the street - would they even last several hours?Could be just one `` unlucky '' pair ...

 I have received a box with 9 1/2 on the box which is what I ordered . Inside the box is a size 7 stamped on the shoe . What the heck do I DO WITH A SHOE 1 1/2 size too small .
 I was extremely excited to receive this item , but i was also just as disappointed with the condition that these boots were in . The box was covered in dust and the boots had numerous scruffs and discoloration all over the rubber .
 These are cute rain boots but that 's where the good things end . These offer no support and are very uncomfortable for wearing for any length of time . And after just a few weeks of wear they split on the top . I got mine at Target for about $ 20 . So really what did I expect for the price ? But the prices I 'm seeing online for these cheap boots are outrageous . Stay away from the `` Chooka '' boots and spring for something of higher quality even if they 're not at cute .
 These boots are very cute and have a nice wide shaft for girls with bigger calves like me . HOWEVER , they are horribly uncomfortable . If I walked more than 3 blocks in them I got cramps in my feet that drove me to find the nearest spot to sit down and rip them off . I can not figure out what it is that causes the horrible pain , as when I put them on and stand there or just pace around a room , they feel pretty good.Whoever designed these boots hates feet and wants to see them die .
 Boots arrived with mud splatters and huge scuffs down the sides ... a return that they have just put a new tag on ... they could have at least cleaned the mud splatters off ... . had to return them and get another pair . I am a size 8 shoe and these ran true to size for me -LRB- toe wise -RRB- but I have thin , long feet with a high arch because of my high arch the offer little support and my foot pops up and down when walking ... for sure not worth 60.00 ... but an OK buy for 23.00 .
 V. cute but after less than a year of usage there were splits all over the place . Up the spine of each boot , in the sole of the right foot at the toe seam in the left foot . I know that I should n't expect shoes to last forever but for the price I would expect these to last at least 2 yrs before deteriorating . Consumerism culture where companies see how short something can last but keep the customer returning
 I 've had two different pairs of Chooka rain boots and both times , they developed tears at the seam of the sole within a few months of purchse . I live in Seattle and felt that rain boots were a perfect shoe for the rain and snow . The tread on the shoe is good , so you definitely wo n't slip , but I was surprised at the degree of wear they developed just wearing them for walking to school and work . On one pair , the buckle cracked , and on both pairs , there were holes in the rubber that water would leak through . When I called Chooka 's customer service number to ask about repair , their represantative rudely informed me that `` It 's rubber . There 's nothing you can do about it . Just return it if it 's still under warranty . '' Thanks , jerk . For a company located right outside of Seattle , I would 've expected a longer lasting rain boot . Overall , I love the style and comfort of the boots , but they are not made for everyday use . Only consider purchasing if you do n't reside in a largely rainy climate .
 I had a pair of Chooka boots that I wore about 5-6 times on my walk to the subway -LRB- 3 blocks -RRB- and then to my office -LRB- 1 block -RRB- . With this modest use , somehow , the sole seemed to split . Ok , I get it , stuff breaks . BUT I have emailed them several times with no response . For $ 60 , I think I should at least get some kind of acknowledgement . I finally filed a complaint with the BBB and would recommend all the other critics do the same , if so inclined . I never do that sort of thing ... I would usually just chalk it up as a loss but when I read these other reviews about the universally rude and unhelpful customer service it added fuel to the fire !
 I have gotten a ton of compliments when I wear the boots and they worked really well . They seemed to be good quality ... alittle on the heavy side ; so I was completely suprised one day ... after wearing them modestly over a 5 month period -LRB- only when it rained -RRB- the rubber on the side of the boot split . I was really disappointed with it because the rain boots I had before this pair lasted me 2 years -LRB- Sam and Libby -RRB- . Personally , I 'm calling it quits for this brand .
 Lasted maybe 3 months with 2X a week wear . Split right along the side of the foot , rendering them rather useless for wet weather . What a complete waste . Get some real wellies .
 My mother called me 2 weeks ago and said that these boots were the only thing she wanted for Christmas , so of course I ordered them right away . I just got them today and opened the box to find a pair of extremely filthy boots . There are stains and there 's dirt embeded in the paint on the boot . They are scuffed and completely COVERED in dust . The little buckles are scratched and rusty . So I called to start the return process to find that I have to pay $ 8 to return them , $ 8 to get a new pair - and I wo n't get them til well after Christmas . I am so upset and can not believe that this Christmas I will either be giving my mom something covered in dirt and obviously used - or nothing at all . I am so dissapointed in Amazon as well , as they will do nothing to help me . The only reason I 'm giving the boots one star is that amazon wo n't let me give zero .
 I was really excited to get these pair of rain boots but I was immediately disappointed when I opened the box . The rain boots were covered in saw dust , and there are stains on the shoes that look like mud or dirt . Also , the blue rubber is discolored with white dots everywhere . I thought about keeping them anyways , since after all ... they are rain boots . But for the price of these boots , there is just no excuse for them to arrive in such an awful condition . I got them this evening and will be returning them tomorrow . I am a very disappointed buyer and after reading the other reviews on this page and experiencing this myself ... I will stay away from purchasing products made by this company .
 I have over a dozen pair of Clarks and bought two pair of the same style . The other color fits wonderfully but this pair , due to the patent leather is uncomfortable and I am going to have to take them to a shoe repair to have them stretched.Wearing them on the carpet with nylons did not do the stretching . If your feet are medium , these may not be the shoe for you . It still is cute and I plan to wear after I have them stretched .
 These sandals are awful . They are cheap -LRB- china -RRB- sandals , that really hurt your feet . Do n't get them , ever !
 These seemed to be comfy at first , but after an hour I had 3 bad blisters . i wouldnt reccomend this specific model of their sandals at all ! they do look nice , but thats it
 would not buy these again . Very uncomfortable & they have a wierd fit ... Really tight in some places , really large in others .
 I suppose I wanted this to be leather . Since it was n't , the tight feel of the card slots led me to believe that they would tear easily once I started adding and removing cards on a regular basis . It also has a lot less space on the interior for my phone and other small items than I had thought it might . It was rather cramped , making it uncomfortable to get things in and out . Overall , it 's just not a pleasant experience using this bag and so I sent it back .
 The `` leather '' string looked so cheap that I ended up unhooking it and throwing it away . There is a small loop handle that I use to hold the purse , but I usually ca n't get the handle to slide back into the clutch . The leather on the front has become scratched with about a dozen tiny scratches . I do n't know if the scratches are due to poor quality leather , or not.Otherwise , the purse is useful because it fits my iPhone .

 I use to love Dearfoam slippers , but now they sew the tag in such a way that you ca n't remove one side of the tag . I 'm a sewer , so I use seam rippers , but still ca n't get the whole tag out . The tags are made with a really stiff , itchy ribbon type of material and I actually get blisters from them . I just ca n't wear their slippers any longer . One lady wrote that these are quite stiff and not as comfortable as the older style and I agree with that too . It 's a shame that they 've become for concerned with people removing their tags than the comfort of their customers .
 The slippers will not stay on your feet the elastic is such that it forces your feet backward and out of the slippers . I would not reccomend these slippers to anyone .
 I washed these once and they ripped . They did n't hold up well in the washer . I would recommend getting a different pair of slippers .
 I have worn Dearfoam slides for about 30 years . The last ones I ordered from Amazon.com are junk . They stretched out and started falling apart with just a few wearings and I only weigh 115 lbs so I am not hard on my shoes . The old ones I could wash and wear for at least a year . I will never order them again . Dearfoam has lost my business forever .
 Size ordered was sm 5-6 and size received was xl 91/2 -7 , which were way too large . Instead of the company not filling the order because they did n't have the size that was ordered , they sent what they had , three pairs of slippers that were too large and charged me for it . I donated items to charity and I will not order anything else from this company .
 Looking for cotton absorbant slippers . These are fleace and too smallI returned the item
 For 45 years I have worn Dearfoam slippers and now they have changed them and they are not at all what they used to be . The tread on the bottom is different and they are stiff , so that as I walk , the slipper does n't walk with me . I have 3 sisters and we all have worn these , and they , too , have found these new slippers to be way inferior to the old ones . We are sad , as we often laughed together about how we had `` happy feet '' with our comfy scuffies , the Dearfoam slippers . These new ones are demanding that we find a new brand that is n't so stiff has tread on the bottom that moves with the foot as we walk . I am very disappointed that Dearfoam would have made such a change ... . and I will be looking for new slippers . I bought 2 pair and have given the spare away , as I do n't even want it .
 Wasted my money ! I never wear them . Bought more comfortable slippers at Walmart for a lot less money . These slippers fit strangely , they 're longer and narrower than any other slipper I 've ever purchased , and the label irritates the bottom of my feet . Do not recommend , but everyone 's feet are different , so you never know .
 These slippers are not worth $ 12.00 -LRB- plus S/H -RRB- ridiculous . Mine just arrived today - I take a 8 1/2 to 9 shoes so I purchased Size Large . These slipper are n't worth more than five dollars and ninety eight cents like they were selling for only 10 years ago in Filene 's basement . The Size Large fits poorly - I have excessive room at the heel end , also at the toe end . Nothing seems to fit any more even slippers . ` MADE IN U.S.A. ' I guess is over , too bad cause clothes , shoes , slippers all fit poorly now , all we do is send items back . Sick of this ...
 Wallet is cheaply made . The clasp for the coin section broke off in my purse after only three days of use . My previous Buxton wallet lasted for many years . This one is very disappointing .
 The coin part of this wallet was hard to close so I will be returning it , other then that I liked it
 I have purchased Buxton wallets before and thought they were great . This one however was n't up to their standards . Do n't know what they are thinking . I was very disapointed in the quality and would have returned it but I 'm simply to lazy . I keep wondering if it is a knockoff .
 I have bought Buxton wallets for the last 30 years and each one has lasted over 5 years . This one was tore up in 6 months . They do n't make them like they used too .
 I 've worn Deer Foam slippers for a number of years and have always appreciated their comfort and reasonable price . No more ! These are the saddest , sorriest excuse for slippers I can imagine.First , the size is off - I do n't know whether they were wrongly sized but a size 8 is no longer an 8 . They 're not soft and accommodating but hard and unyielding . And lastly the beaded trim leaves a trail on the carpet wherever you go.My advice is to slip right on by these and buy another style .
 They are lovely slippers , but not comfortable at all . Generally Dearfoam are very comfy . These are a harder , sturdier slipper but not as soft as the original Dearfoams . They are well-made however .
 I have over a dozen pair of Clarks and bought two pair of the same style . The other color fits wonderfully but this pair , due to the patent leather is uncomfortable and I am going to have to take them to a shoe repair to have them stretched.Wearing them on the carpet with nylons did not do the stretching . If your feet are medium , these may not be the shoe for you . It still is cute and I plan to wear after I have them stretched .
 this shoe was unusually wide for A width , thus I had to return . Returnining is always a pain for me .
 size 10N . LifeStride used to fit , but these seemed to wide for me . Liked them , but returned them because of fit .
 The shoes were fine , but I bought them for my five year old , and they 're way too big .
 I bought extra wide for my son & they were too narrow . Also my son prefers his regular width Payless Shoes over these . Waste of money . Not worth it . Regret that I bought them .
 i ordered them for my wedding and I got pink ones from converse but i never got the green ones and they charged me for the return . not happy at all
 The Logo was on the inside of the Sneaker not the outside.It was defective . disappointed with Macy 's .
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .
 The sizing runs big on these shoes so buyer beware . I ordered a size 10 but could have easily slipped both of my feet into one of these shoes . They were also rather wide and made of the thinnest leather imaginable.The sole on the shoe is so cheap and thin that after seeing them , my friend remarked that I must have ordered the house slippers by mistake.These were promptly returned .
 This shoe is cut right underneath the ankle . Everytime you walk the edge of the shoe rubs into your ankle and causes extreme discomfort and blisters .

 The boot has a great heel and sole , and the price is good for a work boot . That is the plus side . The negatives are the country of origin is not listed and the boot leather is very thin . I returned my purchase after opening the box and thinking that these are not durable enough for farm work .

 I was excited for these boots . They fit relatively well -LRB- which is hard for me to find -RRB- and they were reasonably priced . However , after about 3 weeks of use , there is already a large crack in the soles of each boot . They split across the ball of the foot , which is rather disappointing .
 While in the Army , I used to wear jungle boots all the time . I was in the infantry and put them through the lots hard use . That pair lasted me 2 years in the Army and 4 years afterwards . I recently had to let them go - so bought a new pair -LRB- These -RRB- and they seemed about the same so I had high expectations . Within 2 weeks the sole in the toe area on the right boot let loose . I had them glued by a cobbler -LRB- yep we still have one around -RRB- . Since then , I 've noticed the rest of that boot and the other starting to get loose around the sole and there appears to be some cracking in the leather around the bottom also.So basically - I do n't give these boots a very high review .
 I bought these for my husband who needed sturdy and rugged everyday footwear for chasing our kids and playing outside . He wanted combat boots because I 'd told him stories of the pair I bought my Sophmore year in high school and wore until they broke apart nearly ten years later . He hates to shop , so not having to buy new boots was a huge selling point for him , as was the cordura uppers , for hot weather . Anyway , he wore these daily for 6 months , at which point the leather across the toes had broken open where his foot bends as he walks , and the side of the boot over the toes had ripped out of the sole completely . It was very , very disappointing and was not the kind of longevity we 'd hoped for when we bought these . Our next pair will come from the local surplus store and be all leather .
 These boots disappoint me almost beyond words.I was anticipating them to wear out a little quicker than my other boots -LRB- Belleville Gore Tex combat boots issued in Iraq by the National Guard , and other Rothco boots -RRB- but these boots are simply horrible.They are comfortable , and easy to put on/take off , but that is about the end of the pros.Despite weekly cleaning with non-abrasive rags and using kiwi shoe polish and neatsfoot oil to keep the leather pliable they dried out and cracked within only a couple of months , and now after about 8 months they are almost unwearable.The rubber sole on the right boot has split down the middle where my foot bends at the ball , the left boots rubber outsole has completely separated from the boot upper , and both boots are riddled with cracks in all areas where there is a crease.Another pair of junk boots to throw on the rubbish pile .
 5090 G.I. TYPE BLACK CORDURA NYLON SPEEDLACE JUNGLE BOOTWhen these boots arrived I was disappointed . I read the reviews telling how good of a boot they were and I made the mistake of assuming they were USA made . They are not . These are Chinese Made Jungle boots and I can attest from experience they are of poor quality and the sole will detach from the boot in a short period of time . While Supply Sergeant did issue a quick refund it still cost be $ 10 to ship the product back to the supplier . I would suggest that you not purchase these boots and that if you 're looking for a quality boot that you stick to American made products .
 I wish I had kept the packaging , I would have returned them immediately . The foam cushioning is nice , but there is absolutely no support in the rear of the slipper , so my heals spin freely back and forth and make them totally dysfunctional as a walking device .
 These are really nice slippers , but beware of the sizing ! I ordered a size 9M for my husband who wears a size 9 shoe . They were WAY TOO SMALL . In fact , they just fit me and I wear a size 7-1/2 to 8 narrow in women 's shoes ! It 's not worth it to send them back to Amazon . The shipping to get them back for a refund would probably be near the purchase price , so I 'm just keeping them for myself . Only problem , I had to take my husband to J.C. Penney & buy ANOTHER pair of slippers for him . So , I ended up paying for 2 pair of slippers instead of one . I would allow AT LEAST 2 ADDITIONAL SIZES when ordering these slippers for your guy !
 These are not the best pair of memory foam slippers in terms of practical use . Initially , it was comfortable but within 3 or 4 days , the foam seems to have lost its strength.The stitching of the cloth on the inside is very very poor . Mine is coming out after about 2 weeks of use.I saw a pair in Bed Bath & Beyond for $ 10 -LRB- the ones you see on TV . . white color -RRB- . I actually like those better than these Dearfoams .
 The soles on these slippers are so thin that I could feel the floor beneath my feet . It felt as if I was wearing socks not slippers ; they offered so little insulation my feet were cold all the time . The picture suggests that the sole is thick , but do not be fooled , it is very thin .
 slipper support is wonderfull BUT it needs a higher back around the heal.that way the back of the heal wo n't slip sideways as you walk . also a higher back will keep the slipper on when you back up .

 This shoe is like having a hard piece of plastic under foot .

 size 10N . LifeStride used to fit , but these seemed to wide for me . Liked them , but returned them because of fit .
 I thought the quality of this boot was lacking . There was no lining on the leather above the ankle . Also I could n't get my foot into it , even though I ordered and received my size . I sent them back .
 the boots are nice but the problem is that amazon sent the wrong size instead of 7 US they send 7 and 1/2 US and i am located in Dubai so i cant return this item back and its too loss for me other wise i must pay another 300 usd to ship it back from Dubai to US and get the replacement
 I purchased this boot two years ago . Now it 's leaking water from bottom . I really do not recommend it ! The price is high makes you think it 's supposedly the best but , this product was a big failure for me .
 I began serious running about a year-and-a-half ago using cheap running shoes . Everyone kept telling me I needed to upgrade before I injured myself . I finally went to a running store where I was fitted with a pair of Brooks Beast due to my over pronation . As I first started running in them they seemed fine , but with each training run they became more uncomfortable . By the end of a month I was in such excruciating pain I could not run a full mile . I switched back to my cheap shoes and had immediate relief from the pain . I was back to running 10k distances in a few weeks . People who walk in these shoes seem to love them , runners seem far less taken with them .
 These shoes are SO narrow ! I ordered a 4E 6.5 and I 'm warning you , they are as narrow as a child 's shoe ! The company was very easy to work with , so NO complaints there ! -LRB- I did have to pay $ 8 for return shipping which stinks , but at least I 'm not stuck with these shoes -RRB-
 I love NewBalance shoes because they have great quality and extra wide sizes . But not this pair!First of all , it looks nothing like the picture . It actually looks really green . The logo on the tongue looks so bland and ugly -LRB- it just says `` 780 '' -RRB- And it is n't made in the USA . -LRB- Usually NB shoes are . -RRB- I have nothing against stuffs made in China , but this pair was so poorly made . The green paint on the side wears off on my jeans ! I can feel some threads of strings on my feet when I am wearing it -LRB- and I wear socks -RRB- . The insoles are really thin too . I bought two pairs of NewBalance shoes . The ones in 780 are thinner . The shape of the insoles is kinda different from the other pairs too.It 's functional ; it 's not like it 's falling apart out of the box . But I am not getting my money 's worth with this pair ...

 These were not comfortable for me . I have a bunion on one foot so the adjustable straps were good but after an hour or so on my feet , they hurt . I just have a really hard time finding shoes that do n't hurt my feet and these were not them .
 Propet Women 's W0001 Breeze Walker SandalThis shoe is advertised as a walker , but it did not give my feet enough support for me to walk across the street in them . I was very disappointed and returned the shoes . The return was easy , and I appreciated the service I received , just not the product .
 Looked like they were substantial sandals . I looked at the pictures very carefully , though what I could not see until they arrived was the poor finished product in the top strap . It was not rounded and finished off soft , rather it was rough along the seam edges and therefore it would give blisters rubbing on the top part of the toes . Shame , other than that it was a decent sandal .
 The sandal is stiff and the quality is so so . The original price is marked much way too high compared to the quality .
 I purchased these knowing they would fit because I had a pair in another color , but I was wrong they were at least 1/2of a size too large . I returned them but had to pay the postage . I feel like that is unfair because they were sized wrong .
 The product runs large and the process of trying the exchange for smallersize is just about impossible . I am still trying to get the shoes back in a half size smaller . They would be o.k. if they fit .
 These shoes run much smaller than Clark 's . I was very disappointed and ended up stuck with them because I could n't get to the post office to return them within the 30 days .
 PRODUCT WELL MADE , SIZED PROPERLY , LEATHER UPPERS SUPPLE AND NICE . HOWEVER , SOLE WAS VERY HARD AND UNCOMFORTABLE TO WALK IN . STRAP WAS DIFFICULT TO BUCKLE FOR ME , AND THERE WAS NO ARCH SUPPORT AT ALL
 This shoe looks like my regular diabetic walking shoes , but the quality and workmanship is very poor.The straps were made with such thin leather , that when walking in my livingroom , the straps actuallycut my skin over my ankles and toes . Had to send them right back . Beware of copy cat items whenpurchasing items for yourself .

 This Helle is uncomfortable . Because of the high heel , your toes are squeezed into the peep-toe . The width is TO roomie . This is the second pump I 've tried in Helle . Both were awful !!!

 I bought a pair of Chacos over 10 yrs ago , they were amazing ! Well they finally started wearing out so I ordered the same exact model and size -LRB- 10 wide -RRB- , not only were they not as wide -LRB- very important -RRB- but the straps were thinner and skinnier too . It really makes me mad when a company thinks they can charge a ton of money for a sub par product . Looks like I will be looking for a different brand sandal .
 After hearing that Chaco 's were pretty much the most comfortable shoes in the entire world I order a pair off of Amazon . After getting them I went for a long walk to break them in , and ended up with blisters all over my feet . By the time I was on my way back home I was almost crying from the pain . Chaco 's seem to be perfectly comfortable for most people , however , before just ordering a pair from online , I suggest going to a store and trying them on , and making sure they are the right shoe for you .

 These shoes are SO narrow ! I ordered a 4E 6.5 and I 'm warning you , they are as narrow as a child 's shoe ! The company was very easy to work with , so NO complaints there ! -LRB- I did have to pay $ 8 for return shipping which stinks , but at least I 'm not stuck with these shoes -RRB-

 These boots were defective , the harness was obviously too short and poorly connected on the right boot . I do n't know how they made it past QC at the factory . Worse yet , I returned them to Amazon and got the EXACT same defective pair back as a supposed replacement . Needless to say I returned them AGAIN for a full refund . Poor showing , Amazon and Frye .

 I began serious running about a year-and-a-half ago using cheap running shoes . Everyone kept telling me I needed to upgrade before I injured myself . I finally went to a running store where I was fitted with a pair of Brooks Beast due to my over pronation . As I first started running in them they seemed fine , but with each training run they became more uncomfortable . By the end of a month I was in such excruciating pain I could not run a full mile . I switched back to my cheap shoes and had immediate relief from the pain . I was back to running 10k distances in a few weeks . People who walk in these shoes seem to love them , runners seem far less taken with them .

 These shoes are SO narrow ! I ordered a 4E 6.5 and I 'm warning you , they are as narrow as a child 's shoe ! The company was very easy to work with , so NO complaints there ! -LRB- I did have to pay $ 8 for return shipping which stinks , but at least I 'm not stuck with these shoes -RRB-
 I bought these shoes from Eastbay . They are the worst pair of shoes that I have ever worn in my life . After wearing them for less than a week , I have identical cuts on both of my ankles from where the shoe jabbed into my skin . There is a flexible backing on the shoe which is sewn to the inside right where your ankle goes . As you walk , it grinds into your ankle and makes walking extremely uncomfortable . I HIGHLY recommend not buying this product .
 I am still waiting on an answer to my qoestion about returning 1 pair for a widerr size . It 's been 2 weeks.have not heard anything at all , Shame !

 Do not like the `` Cayman '' crocs . Very rough inside and not very `` cushy '' to walk on . Prefer the Beach crocs anyday . Would never buy again.crocs Cayman Sandal
 we like the correct product , the person that was shopped for , not me , had bought a pair of size 8 , it fiited her great , so her daughter , via amazon , bought her another pair , , same number , they did not fit her , Then i ordered anothef pair , one size bigger , the one i returned , well , in the one , -LRB- I compared it to the old one she is still using -RRB- the strap is shorterf , they dont fitWhen we checked the crocs we found that the old one she is still using is made in Mexico , the other two are made in China , It looks like the Chinese are using a different patttern , , and knowing from experience , the Chinese have smaller feet than Us , I can see the problem , CAN YOU CORRECTED IT FOR AMERICAN SHOPPERS ? and if you are going to answer this message , can you tell us the difference between the womens us/mens us and only womens sizes we see when we order shoes or crocs?Thank you
 Ordered my standard size but these kind of shoes are not made for slender feet . I felt like I was clomping everywhere .
 didnt know this item was coming from amsterdam germany . Next time im checking the seller profile before buying . Not the color I expected . The blue they had posted looked more like a baby blue the ones we go were like denim blue . Not a fan of the color .
 The shoe itself seemed to be nice but was about 2 sizes smaller than my crocs I bought before in the exact same style . They were so small I could n't even get them on but were marked the same size as the ones I have now . Had to return them and do n't really want the hassle of trying another pair without knowing if they will fit right .
 I tried them on in a store , then ordered on-line , as several people had suggested . The size that fit perfectly in the store turned out to be too big . I was about to order them a size smaller , but then I read all the comments about the sizing inconsistency . Since I have to pay for return shipping , and I do n't have any idea whether a size smaller will in fact fit , and the color choices in my size -LRB- s -RRB- are pretty much nonexistent , I am just going to return these . Disappointed !
 I have worn them for a while now , and they do not seem to be conforming to my feet , as I thought they might . In sum , if you have narrow feet and are seeking a softer shoe , you may not care for these . I have not found these sandals as comfortable as most people profess -- especially at the price . I have a pair of take-off crocs I got at a discount store , and they have a softer sole , which makes them more comfortable . I do have narrow feet , which may be a factor . The Caymans are narrower than the Beach sandal and they do clean up nicely , but my feet swim in them .
 I HATE THESE ! TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY ! I HAVE A PAIR OF BEACH CLOGS THAT ARE WORN OUT AND STILL ARE BETTER THAN THESE . YOUR FEET SLIDE AROUND IN THEM . THEY DO N'T CONFORM TO YOUR FEET LIKE THE BEACH CLOGS DO . THEY ARE NOT AS SOFT OR CUSHY . I HATE THEM . I SHOULD HAVE STUCK WITH THE `` TRIED AND TRUE '' INSTEAD OF TRYING SOMETHING NEW !
 Every seller has their own sizing chart for these things . It 's not consistent and it makes it impossible to order them . I give up and I 'm not going to bother to buy them . No wonder Crocs is bankrupt !
 I ordered my daughter the orange Crocs for her birthday . They arrived in two days in time for her to open for her big day . They broke within an hour of wearing . I am so disappointed . I have to find out how and if I can return them . What a hassle !
 For such a long time I heard how comfortable this shoes are and I decided to take the chance and purchased a pair . Well , day one of wearing them around the neighborhood , I noticed myself looking at plants in a new light . At first I thought it was just the rays of the sun reflecting nature into my mind . Then about two weeks later , I joined a book club and randomly went around planting trees . Instead of talking about sports I was talking about compost . Instead of having a few beers with my friends , I was only drinking organic water from a pond . For about four mouths , I was getting involved with random actives . I decided it was a good idea to protest buildings because it provided less room for nature . I ended every sentence with the word `` man '' and only wore earth tones . Out of no where , I wanted to quit my job and start a drum circle band . Because all I needed was love to live , well guess what ? I was wrong . I finally reached my peak when I blacked out for a few days and woke up hugging a tree . I had no idea what was happening , but then I realized , I became a HIPPY !!!!! I immediately removed my crocs and wore traditional sneakers like a real man . I was back talking about sports and drinking beers . I do not recommend these shoes unless you want to become very lazy .
 I ordered these crocs over the summer for my day camp job . But what I did not know was that they run big . I got a size 7 in this color and a size 6 in the purple . I only used the purple ones during the summer . The other day I was cleaning out my closet and found this khaki crocs , and I no longer want them . When I tried at least returning or getting Amazon credit I was told no because the deadline date had passed . But I do n't get if it is in it 's original packaging . HORRIBLE !!!!!! Will never order shoes from this site !
 I wore these for one day only . The rubber chafed against my ankles until my skin was rubbed off . So , do n't wear these without socks . In addition , they just were n't very comfortable at all . It felt like I had a bunch of hard rubber nipples pressed against my foot -LRB- and that 's pretty much what it was -RRB- . I guess if you want shoes that you can spray off with the garden hose , then these will work for you . But , if you want something more comfy , try Teva , or Keen .
 I ordered 2 pairs of shoes , both from the same page , which was sorted by size.The order came , both pairs of different size , and Amazon says I ordered them that way.Never again .
 I used to love Crocs . My first pair were the Classics then I got the slippers then the Yukon Sports and told everyone how great they were . I could not have been so far from the truth . These shoes keep podiatrists in business . After 3 years of wearing my Classics nearly every day of the summer and spring I started to feel a growing discomfort in my knees when walking and especially when going down steps and began to suspect the Crocs when I noticed uneven treadwear . I went to a podiatrist and he said the Crocs due to their spongy sole where not providing support or stabilizing my knees correctly . He said I was experiencing pronation as a result which explained the uneven tread wear . He recommended Keen shoes instead . I tried them on and it was immediate relief . I could literally feel the pressure redistribute in my knees . It felt like someone opened a pressure valve within my knee joints ! I also learned Crocs act as isolators and cause static electricity buildup which explains now why I regularly would get shocked when stepping out of my van . Lastly , they are slippery as snot on wet concrete . Almost went down several times . They may feel soft on the feet but these things are the devil in disguise .
 I was disappointed with the return policy . I would have thought that sperry would allow for disappointment with the product . But they offer no return policy once they have been worn . The bad thing is that you can not always tell how the fit is until you have worn them . I would not expect a `` lower end '' shoe maker to offer a refund , but I had hoped that sperry would have.When I opened them the color differences were not a pronounced as in the advertised photo . They look like `` old man '' shoes ! They are all light colored . No real color breaks as in the photo . The only reason I went with this color was they were out of my wider size in the traditional darker brown and was looking forward to having some new sperry 's for the spring . They were not as wide as I had hoped as well . I have a wide foot . They are uncomfortable to wear for more that a half hour at a time . I understand there is a `` break in '' time , but they were not as wide for me as I had hoped . I have purchased other sperry shoes that were not this tight as these were for the posted wider width.I did not want a refund , I just wanted a credit toward a different pair . I did not expect a full credit but 75 % would have been nice . I had only worn them a few times and were not dirty at all and hoped to send them back . If I had gotten them dirty I would not expect anything . I had all the contents from the original boxing . I did not call to inquire . The return policy was quite clear . Wished I had looked at that before I had worn them . Anyway , Unhappy with the purchase and look of the shoe .
 The straps broke in half within a few days -LRB- and only 3 or 4 wearings of short duration -RRB- of getting them . My husband literally only wore them to take out the garbage a few times . They belong in the garbage . What a waste of money . What happened to quality ? I would like to return them .
 I BUY THE WHITE COLOR BUT SENT ME THE COLOR BLACK , VERY BAD , THANK YOU.I BUY THE WHITE COLOR BUT SENT ME THE COLOR BLACK , VERY BAD , THANK YOU .
 I have had Sperry Top siders before and loved them . When this item was on sale as a close out item I was happy to see it available in my size . After waiting for a month or more , I finally got a E mail saying they had cancelled my order , because the supply had not arrived , and invited me to contact them directly , not through Amazon , to re submitt the order.I thought it was strange that a close out item would be on back order , and the whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth , so I just declined to pursue the item .
 The item received was the wrong color and most importantly the WRONG SIZE , cost more to return from a deployment than it worth ... : -LRB-
 I bought pair of blue shoes but they sent green . . bad service & iexcl ; & iexcl ;
 I am not impressed with the crocs . In the past I bought the look alikes from payless for less then half the price . I feel the look alikes feel allot better then the crocs . I have also had nothings that look like crocs and cost close to the price as crocs and thinking crocs would feel like them . I will not by crocs again . . I will go to payless .
 Crocs are marked M10 / W12 . . Since when are women 's sizes LARGER than men 's . Had to return them since I was looking for an actual men 's 10 . . These were way too large.Amazon said it was my mistake for orering the wrong size . Ha .
 the shipping was very fast , 4 stars for that . but ... no paper in the box crocs where just stuck into the box . size
 This is the ugliest shoe I 've ever seen - if a piece of plastic punched with holes could be called a shoe . If you 're opting for comfort , buy another shoe that is worth your money and dignity .
 I love Crocs and own several pair but this pair is not the true size . Although the size embedded in the shoe itself states the correct size , this shoe is actually almost 2 sizes to big .
 My size 12 crocks began to shrink , apparently from exposure to sunlight or the heat of the sun . Within 3 weeks I could no longer get the right one on and it was visibly smaller than the left . I believe it had gone down more than one size . Amazon did a great job of providing a means for returning them !! I have 2 other pair of Crocs that never had this problem .
 THIS PRODUCT WASNT THE SIZE THAT I ORDERED , THE SIZE IS SO BIG AND I CANT USE , SHOULD EXPLAIN BETTER THE PRODUCT
 I finally bought a pair of Crocs after finding them for the reasonable price of $ 19.99 on Amazon . I like Crocs , but I refuse to pay something like $ 30 to $ 45 for what essentially amounts to a pair of plastic slippers . I was skeptical of their usefulness , but they fill the niche -LRB- for me -RRB- between slippers and clogs pretty well.The fit was surprisingly small . I mean they are wide and clunky , but seem to run a bit short ; I bought the 9 for my 8 1/2 foot , but there is not as much room in the toe-box as I expected . Despite being plastic , the shoes breathes very well and are comfortable enough for extended wear . Running to the mailbox or cleaning the house is an ideal use for this type of footwear . Beware taking out the garbage in the morning as the dew seeping through the holes will come as unwelcome surprise.Not that I knew I needed them , but Crocs are popular for a reason . They are great for lounging around , but I am skeptical at the touted advantages of some of the more specialized models . Now , having bought a pair I feel existentially complete.Update 10/12/2012I am writing this review after about a week 's worth of wear . The fit was simply too small and I had to give them away . I am trying the men 's size 10 to see if they will be more comfortable . In my case it may be a matter of going a full size up .
 Over the years I have fallen in love with my Crocs . I have two pair , one made in China , and the other in Bosnia . The fit great and have served me well . This pair -LRB- made in Mexico -RRB- does not fit , they are too big . They also feel thinner and even the straps that normally just fold up out of the way are not the same size . If this is the new Crocs then I will find another brand and shame on the company for ruining a good product . If these are counterfeit , then shame on the supplier . As always Amazon 's return policy is quick & easy , however I will still be paying $ 5 shipping . This is the second time I have ordered a clothing product from Amazon suppliers and the quality has been very sub standard . In the future I will purchase such items locally and restrict my Amazon shopping to other categories .
 I got these as a replacement Croc . They are different and feel like fake Crocs.These are made in Mexico not China as my originals were . These are at least ONE FULL SIZE SMALLER , even though they are size 5/7 as my originals were . The bump pattern is a bit different and the bumps are very hard and unpleasant . The plastic is extremely hard and uncomfortable . I decided to try them on just in case they were n't so bad and they hurt my toes after walking in them under five minutes.I wanted to return or exchange them , but it seems like so much effort and nearly 1/4 the price to do so , so I wo n't . Annoying .
 I do love my Crocs , do n't get me wrong ... but it took three tries before I got a `` good pair '' , which it why it gets 2 stars . I bought two pairs on Amazon and was unhappy with them . The size 6 were too small and the size 7 were too large . The 7 was REALLY large . I think the 7 would have been ok but one heel strap was a different length than the other . The cotton candy color looks flat in the picture here and really it 's a shiny , almost metallic , color.I decided to order shoes directly from Crocs web site to see if I got a different result . I ordered two more pairs of shoes . This time , I got a size 7 that was abnormally large with different length heel straps . But I also got another size 7 that fit PERFECTLY . Upon investigation I noticed that the ones that was huge with odd heel straps were manufactured in Mexico . The pair that fit perfectly was manufactured in China . The shoes from Mexico had straps of different length and the nubs on the inside of the shoe were rather flat . The shoes from China were perfectly the same size , had a better texture on the outside of the shoe and the nubs inside were more pronounced . The shoe from China was a much better product and putting them next to each other was like night and day . It 's not a problem with the vendor supplying the shoe ... it 's a problem with maintaining manufacturing standards . I called Crocs and let them know that there is a stark contrast between the shoes from Mexico versus the ones from China.Regarding sizing
 The Crocs came packaged appropriately and in due time . The size was way off and was 2 sizes smaller than what is said on the bottom of the shoe as well as on the tag . They said made in China . I bought them for my husband to replace the same pair he owned-same style and size and color but his old pair said made in Canada . So buyer beware .
 I 've been looking for a PINK pair of crocs for a while . I found these and ordered a size women 's 8 . When they came I was so excited except they sent a men 's size 8 which ends up being a women 's size 10 so they were HUGE . Also , the pink they show is not the correct color , in person it 's more of a coral pink than a `` hot '' pink as indicated . BUMMER !
 I was very surprised and disappointed when I received these crocs . I have worn crocs for about three years and when these arrived I could n't believe how much smaller they were than the ones I already have even though they were marked as being the same size ! Rather than bother to return them , I am going to give them to Goodwill and hope someone can use them .
 I ordered a size 11 and got a size 13 - In Afghanistan , so it 's not like I can just return them ... . booo - clown shoes
 Do not order shoes from Amazon unless you know your size for that brand of shoe . I order a pair of crocs Yukon Clog the same size as my running shoe which has worked for me in the pass for other brand name shoes . But these crocs were just too big , it cost me 8 bucks to fine out .
 I received the product in good condition but not the size I ordered . Buy a size 8 , size 8 woman and sent a man . I am not satisfied with the receivedCrocs Classic Clog , Khaki , Women 's 8 M US/Men 's 6 M US
 I am a woman who wears a size 10 . The length is exaxt , and while I do understand the sizes were unisex , these are extremely wide for a normal sized ladies foot . My foot slides side to side in them . I also thought there would be at least a 1/2 '' lift from front to back since there appears to be deep sole , however it is actually totally flat because your heel sits lower than the top edge of the heel . There are air holes that go around the front and sides of the shoe , and one in the front is in the exact place that my second toe sticks through it and debris gets in . The strap can swing frontward or backwards , however when it 's backwards , it barely touches my heel since it 's so long . It 's not as cushy soft as other crocs I 've tried on . They are something to kick around in , but nothing I would have bought had I tried them on at the store . I think I will stick to the ones made specifically for women .
 Poor - The strap broke after only 1 week . I guess I know why they were cheap with free shipping .
 The crock in the size men 's 12 M , in the color white , is wide and long . Perhaps this is not true in the other colors , but the white is sloppy big on my husband 's long narrow foot .
 The strap on these broke the second time I wore them . Return policy from the vendor was poor . They only take them back if you can prove it is a manufacturers defect . Via mail , the process is difficult and frustrating .
 I am very dissatified with this product , as well as the vendor -LRB- I believe it was ShoeMall -RRB- . The plastic rivet that holds the strap on was missing when it arrived . The strap was extended straight out and flopping around . The rivet was not in the box either , so it was in that condition when shipped.Then , making it even worse , ShoeMall did not refund my shipping fees ! I can understand not refunding fees if I changed my mind or did n't `` like '' them . However , sending out a obviously defective item , that should not have been shipped to me in the first place is HORRIBLE customer service . I had even written on the return slip that I expected a refund.This is the second time ShoeMall has done this to me and I will NEVER order from them again .
 I went to 3 Crocs stores to find a size that fit in a suitable color . Only one store had 1 pair of size 10 in the model I wanted . Unfortunately it was lime green , a color I did not want . But at least I was able to try it on and determine that it fit . So I order a size 10 from Crocs through Amazon -LRB- because I trust them -RRB- . It arrived 4 days later , labeled size 10 and with the size 10 imprinted on the shoe , but the shoe was 2 sizes too big ! After calling Crocs customer service , the rep tells me that it is a manufacturing mistake . So now I have to pay to ship this pair back , and hope I can find a store with a size 10 that I want . BOTTOM LINE
 I have a hard time even believing these are true crocs . I bought them to replace the ones I 've worn out . And man , these are like hard plastic , they are narrower and smaller , though size 11 like my old crocs , the have hard and rough plastic bumps on the sole , so you remove your feet and you have tons of indentions on them , walking in these crocs is like walking on tiny gravel . They even hurt the feet with socks . So yeah , what a bummer , I am going to have to waste $ 5 and have them returned . So yeah , BEWARE , either these are not real crocs or I dunno what , I suppose I need to find a croc store in my area .
 Shoe is now a harder material . Not cushy like the original Crocs . Also foot bed has huge nubs that hurt the soles of my foot . 2 pair , navy and black are being sent back . Sad that the company tweaked their shoe , but went the wrong way .
 I purchased the exact same style and size as my last pair of crocs and this pair was significantly smaller . Unfortunately I had taken all the tags etc off before I went to wear them the first time . Before I even put them on I noticed they looked smaller , so I checked the size , which was right according to my old pair but they were significantly smaller . Now I have a pair of Crocs I ca n't wear . Definitely try them on before you detag them to make sure they will fit the way you are expecting .
 These things are comfortable , but not durable at all . The strap broke on one shoe the 1st day I was wearing it . Real cheaply made .
 Not a good fit for my feet , which are long and thin ; my toes scrubbed against the front of the shoe , so I had to send them back : -LRB-
 I wear a size 8.5 to 9.0 men 's shoe . I read the reviews on here and people said to round down , so I did . I ordered a size 8 croc . The shoe arrived on time , actually early . But ! Rounding down one size was incorrect , these shoes are HUGE . My son wears a size 10 and they fit ok on him . I received them today and they are being returned today . Even with socks they are so big they will not stay on my foot . That includes using the strap , they are just to big . I have no idea who measures the size of these things but they really need to learn how to read and measure . They are way off . Now to top it off I am being charged to return these .
 Recently I purchased a new pair of crocs as I need a choco color . I have had a pair for several years . I sent the new pair back as they were uncomfortable , stiff and hard . What happen to the soft rubber soles that soften each step . I wish products that were good to excellent would not use lower quality material that changes the comfort level they once had . I will not purchase crocs in the future . There is a huge difference . My four dollar off brand for gardening felt more comfortable than those new shoes .
 I ordered two pairs of Crocs - one pair of thongs and one pair of cayman crocs . I used the sizing chart provided and ordered both pairs in M5/W7 . However , when they arrived , while the Thongs fit perfectly , with room to wiggle , the Caymans were way too small -LRB- I 'd almost say a full size too small -RRB- . The Thongs were `` made in China '' and the Caymans `` made in Mexico '' . I went to my local store and discovered that they receive Croc orders which are often made in multiple countries . It would appear to me that there is no `` standard '' mold used . So beware - just because you have tried them on in a store and think you have the correct size - you may end up getting a larger or smaller size , depending on where they are manufactured .
 These shoes are at least one size larger than the `` normal '' size should be . I had to return my order and pay shipping . After reading the other reviews , I found that my problem is obviously not unique . Since there is no way to try out these shoes in local stores and buy the same size at Amazon -LRB- sizing inconsistent , depending on origins of manufacturers -RRB- , I would NOT advise anyone buying them online .
 Shoes were not delivered very quickly . Upon examination , they were two different sizes . Returned them for exchange , the new shoes lasted only a few days before the strap broke . Not happy .
 This was my first pair of crocs , planned to use them for gardening and expected to find them very comfortable as per reviews and friends ' opinions . There are very wide - the box said roomy fit or some similar word . They are supposed to be M but are quite wide and I have narrow feet , so my feet slip around in them , they are bulky and with the red , I look ridiculous in them but do wear them in the muddy garden when watering etc. . Disappointed in the fit .
 Wanted to be in the five star review group , but that was not to be this . I just got my Crocs - excited as I have not been able to find them locally . I live on the beach and walk everywhere miles a day , so this silly looking shoe has become a must have for me . I am a convert won over by there comfort and durability , but they are not a comfort when they run a size small . I returned mine , with the usually no problems return from Amazon and I have ordered more in size 9 instead of size 8 . Lets hope the 9 fits , or I swear I will go back to sneakers .
 Crocs Cayman Shoe for Adults : This was the 2nd pair of Crocs Cayman shoes that I bought on line . The first pair was perfect . This pair was made out of hard rubber and had no give to them at all . They are not able to be worn . Also , I felt the shipping charge was excessive . The first pair of Crocs I ordered were the exact same price and included free shipping . I will not be doing any more business with Amazon , unless you people resolve my complaint to my satisfaction .
 After my favorite `` jeans shoes '' fell apart , literally and at a social function much to my mortification , I began to wear my Crocs knock-offs that I bought at Dollar General about five years ago . They are dark purple and look pretty good with jeans and with some dark thick socks . I decided once and for all to get myself some REAL Crocs . Well I could have saved myself time and money by just sticking with my cute little DGs . I could not believe how ugly these Crocs were when I opened the box . I have a wide foot but these are ridiculously wide . I have a new-found respect for my DGs now and have brought them in from the front porch where they 've been for five years , washed them , and placed them in my closet .
 These shoes just look ridiculously stupid on anyone who wears them . So , unless you are a little kid or a clown - please stop the madness .
 I feel sorry for anyone who has such severe foot pain and discomfort that they would have to actually wear these horrendous looking shoes in public.If you own a pair of these , do yourself a favor and LOOK AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR before you go out in public wearing these unsightly things . If you ca n't see how ridiculous you look , I just do n't know what to tell you ... . Other than that everyone else can see just how dreadful you look wearing these hideous shoes , and we 're laughing our @ $ $ es off at you !
 Let 's get one thing straight . These things are ugly as sin . I 'm not a fashionista or a shoe snob by any means . I mostly tend towards sneakers , and I own Teva flip-slops . I care very little for fashions . Crocks , however , make my eyes bleed just a little whenever I see them.Yes , they are comfortable . That does not make it OK to wear them . Many , many , many other shoes out there are also comfortable and also have the benefit of not being a crime against humanity . Wearing them with jeans or slacks is twice as bad , and makes baby Jesus cry . And if there are any hipsters out there considering them , it is also not OK to wear them ironically.Please . For the good of all humanity , do not wear these . Ophthalmologists everywhere will thank you .
 I first saw these abominations on a 6 year old and I thought , it wo n't happen again ; surely this is just a one time thing-but no . Then I saw another person wearing them and another and another , and I said `` oh no '' `` no no no '' `` please , no '' . They are a complete fashion disaster . If good fashion had an evil twin brother , they would name him crocs . I wo n't even acknowledge anyone wearing these ... things . Anyone seen wearing these catastrophes will be removed from my will . When I get one . Horrible , just horrible . If you purchase these , do n't even look at me . I will ignore you and I will make sure you know I am ignoring you .
 I do n't own these and I never will . I do n't care how comfortable you say that these are , these are the ugliest and most ridiculous looking shoes on the planet . If someone gave me a pair of these I would throw them away . I 'm sure wearing a velvet diaper would be comfortable , but I do n't because I would look like a tool . Have some self respect people . Do n't wear Crocs !
 STILL I DONT RECEVICE THE PRODUCT -LRB- THE SHOE -RRB- I BUY THE FIRTS DAYS IN NOVEMBER AND TODAY IS DECEMBER 03
 In general a negative buying experience . Item did not arrive as specified in the specified date range.I declined review of item twice and amazon keeps asking me still to review this object , which is really annoying and detracts from the overall expereince
 it has not tha same quality as other purchased directly from the store.one is larger than the other , despite having the same size
 Last year I ordered the same size crocs from Amazon . They fit wonderfully . These are too short on the left foot . I ordered the very same crocs as last year . Did you change manufactures ?????
 I am a big fan of Crocs before but I now dont like it after I wear this . It is not comfortable , and I do n't know why my feet even feel painful after wearing this . I do n't recommend you to buy it . . . Hope seller can improve its quality .
 As previous reviewr , I also got wrong size shoes and the refund was only $ 3.49 . The shoes length on the label was 24cm , while it real length was only 22cm . This seller should be prosecuted for fraud .
 Eastbay does n't tell you that the reason these are closeout is becuase they do n't fit . if you are a size 7 you 'll need a size 8 . They also wo n't refund you the full amount if they do n't have more instock instead they charge you $ 16.98 total with shipping and will refund you only $ 3.49 without any explanations . the person that answers the phone sounds like their grandmother and will repeatly ask you the same questions over and over again , and then say they ca n't help you . she has no answers for you . This company is a thief and do n't bother yourself unless you can afford to throw money away .
 Damn , these shoes are so tight . It does n't even fit me . I wear a size 7 on every pair of shoes that I bought and they 're usually a bit loose so I can move around easily . This sizing must have came from Japan or something cos it ai n't U.S.A size . A 7 is more like a size 5.5 so do n't bother buying this shoes . Its nothing special . The only thing about it is its cheap but since it does n't fit you , no point of getting it at all unless u do n't mind throwing away $ 10 + shipping and the shipping for me costs more than the shoe itself . Buyers be warned !!
 I could n't wait to get these shoes . I work with children and have to be able to run all over . I ordered two pairs , one in 6.5 -LRB- my true size -RRB- and one in a 7 -LRB- size I can wear in most athletic shoes -RRB- . They charged me for 2 pair and canceled the size 7 . I 've been fighting with them and waiting forever for the pair they did have . Now , the shoes came and are made for a concubine who binds her feet and I 'm out the cost of the other pair plus shipping . REDICULOUS !!!!!!!!!!! I will never do business with them again . I thought I could trust them because they were selling through Amazon ... THINK AGAIN !!!!!!
 I ordered a 1/2 size bigger than my normal size and the shoes are too tight and very uncomfortable . I am going to try to sell them on Craig 's List since it looks like there would not be much of a refund if I return them to the company !! The shoes are cute but if you want to buy them , I would say get a whole size or even a size and a half larger than you normally would .
 Like others have said below , it is a very very tight fit . I had even gotten a size a half size bigger than what I normally wear since my feet are somewhat wide , and they were still incredibly tight . They gave a pittance of a refund . I am very disatisfied with this company . I would not recommend buying from them in the future . The deal was definitely too good to be true .
 I enjoy the sky blue color and the soles are squishy , more comfortable than many flip flops ... HOWEVER , the rubber toe hold has caused painful blistering due to rubbing when I walk . I think I will stick with my Teva flip flops and wear these sandals for showering when I camp .
 I was so looking forward to these flip flops . Ca n't seem to find the old school kind that do n't hurt . These were expensive for what they are and they hurt . Pieces stick out weird on the thong and hurt . Sorry I ordered them ...
 I wear a size 6 shoe so I purchased a 5/6 flip flop . The sole of the flip flop is the right size , but it is so thin , you might as well go barefoot ; whatever you are walking on , you can feel through to the soles of your feet . I also do not like the straps - maybe a mistake was made during manufacturing . It looks/feels like size 10 straps on 5/6 flip flops ; the flip flops will not stay on my feet . I will use them when I have to run outside for a few moments - but otherwise they are worthless if wearing more than a few minutes .
 I ordered the -LRB- 37-38 / US 7-8 -RRB- shoes and received a pair of shoes clearly marked `` US 6 . '' I need to return these because they are way too small .
 I ordered these flip flops , but they sent me the wrong size THREE times . Amazon barely helped with the returns . They allow returns , but the whole process was a mess.So , to summarize . I had to return the three pairs of flip flops , and I never received flip flops in my size .
 I tired these flip flops thinking they would be comfortable but I ended up giving them away . Nothing special .
 I LOVE Havianas Tops but , this pair - in the same size that I have ordered before - was too small . Very disappointed . Reordered from Zappos , hope they get it right .
 I ordered these because I thought they would be more comfortable than most flip flops . They were n't ! I wanted the green which is really pretty , but the plastic thong part is really uncomfortable . I gave mine to a consignment shop .
 I searched everywhere on line for flip flops because I had hurt the top of my foot and thought I had pay dirt when I found these and read all of the positive reviews . They are uncomfortable , they have unfinished rubber pieces all over the edges making them rough . The thong piece and the two side pcs that goes through to the bottom do not lay flat and that is also uncomfortable . Add a rough foot bed and it adds up to a big waste of money for a thong that looks like a piece of rubber from an old tire . The final kicker was that night when I went to payless I found a beautiful collection of flip flops in different colors and styles at $ 3.99 each , buy 1 get the second 1/2 price -LRB- $ 2 -RRB- .
 I bought these shoes from Eastbay . They are the worst pair of shoes that I have ever worn in my life . After wearing them for less than a week , I have identical cuts on both of my ankles from where the shoe jabbed into my skin . There is a flexible backing on the shoe which is sewn to the inside right where your ankle goes . As you walk , it grinds into your ankle and makes walking extremely uncomfortable . I HIGHLY recommend not buying this product .
 I do not find these walking boots to be comfortable , as advertised . They look good , but they hurt my feet . I would like to return them , but I have worn them four or five times , thinking I would `` break them in '' and they would become comfortable . Has n't worked so far .
 As previous reviewr , I also got wrong size shoes and the refund was only $ 3.49 . The shoes length on the label was 24cm , while it real length was only 22cm . This seller should be prosecuted for fraud .
 Eastbay does n't tell you that the reason these are closeout is becuase they do n't fit . if you are a size 7 you 'll need a size 8 . They also wo n't refund you the full amount if they do n't have more instock instead they charge you $ 16.98 total with shipping and will refund you only $ 3.49 without any explanations . the person that answers the phone sounds like their grandmother and will repeatly ask you the same questions over and over again , and then say they ca n't help you . she has no answers for you . This company is a thief and do n't bother yourself unless you can afford to throw money away .
 Damn , these shoes are so tight . It does n't even fit me . I wear a size 7 on every pair of shoes that I bought and they 're usually a bit loose so I can move around easily . This sizing must have came from Japan or something cos it ai n't U.S.A size . A 7 is more like a size 5.5 so do n't bother buying this shoes . Its nothing special . The only thing about it is its cheap but since it does n't fit you , no point of getting it at all unless u do n't mind throwing away $ 10 + shipping and the shipping for me costs more than the shoe itself . Buyers be warned !!
 I could n't wait to get these shoes . I work with children and have to be able to run all over . I ordered two pairs , one in 6.5 -LRB- my true size -RRB- and one in a 7 -LRB- size I can wear in most athletic shoes -RRB- . They charged me for 2 pair and canceled the size 7 . I 've been fighting with them and waiting forever for the pair they did have . Now , the shoes came and are made for a concubine who binds her feet and I 'm out the cost of the other pair plus shipping . REDICULOUS !!!!!!!!!!! I will never do business with them again . I thought I could trust them because they were selling through Amazon ... THINK AGAIN !!!!!!
 I ordered a 1/2 size bigger than my normal size and the shoes are too tight and very uncomfortable . I am going to try to sell them on Craig 's List since it looks like there would not be much of a refund if I return them to the company !! The shoes are cute but if you want to buy them , I would say get a whole size or even a size and a half larger than you normally would .
 Like others have said below , it is a very very tight fit . I had even gotten a size a half size bigger than what I normally wear since my feet are somewhat wide , and they were still incredibly tight . They gave a pittance of a refund . I am very disatisfied with this company . I would not recommend buying from them in the future . The deal was definitely too good to be true .
 I purchased these for my 13 year old son . He used them for 4 basketball practices and three games and the soles ripped off of the right shoe . My son liked the way they fit and felt they were a comfortable shoe but was dissappointed they did n't last long .
 I do not find these walking boots to be comfortable , as advertised . They look good , but they hurt my feet . I would like to return them , but I have worn them four or five times , thinking I would `` break them in '' and they would become comfortable . Has n't worked so far .
 I began serious running about a year-and-a-half ago using cheap running shoes . Everyone kept telling me I needed to upgrade before I injured myself . I finally went to a running store where I was fitted with a pair of Brooks Beast due to my over pronation . As I first started running in them they seemed fine , but with each training run they became more uncomfortable . By the end of a month I was in such excruciating pain I could not run a full mile . I switched back to my cheap shoes and had immediate relief from the pain . I was back to running 10k distances in a few weeks . People who walk in these shoes seem to love them , runners seem far less taken with them .
 I am overweight and these slippers do not offer any support . I had trouble after many wearings determinining which was the left and right shoe . I thought they were irregulars and wrote the manufacturer twice ... they never answered me .
 I love Minnetonka Moccasins , but these came today and when I opened the box I was shocked and disappointed . First of all I normally wear a size 9 , and my other mocs are a size 8 and too small now , so I ordered a 8.5 . These are larger than my 9 's ! Second ; The shoes looked worn , so I used socks when I tried them on , and the brown suede stained my socks ! I am returning them , ordering another pair in a size8 and different color . I know Minnetonka 's are good , but not this pair . Do n't know what went wrong , but lately have n't been having good luck shopping on Amazon . Hope it gets better .

 One size smaller than expected . Also , is very unbalanced in relation to the heel .

 Purchased slippers for my 89 year old mom . They were too tight and pointed . And were so slippery on her wood floors that she could not get up from the chair . These are not meant for the elderly person .
 slippers finally arrived and i was a little bit dissapointed . construction was cheap , goose fill was light and overall flimsy . if you want to wear it twice , then thats what its worth .
 I 'm disappointed that they are not warm . Unless I wear socks and my feet are warm to start out these slippers do n't keep my feet warm . I bought some down filled slippers several years ago that are wonderful . However , they are worn out and held together with duck tape . I wish I could find another pair like them as they are truly warm , get your feet warm when cold and keep them warm . I would n't purchase these slippers : -LRB-
 Not what i expected . Slippers too small and tight on the toes . Better to be able to try them on first .
 They run small . The seams are thick , and constantly rubbing up against your skin . Not very warm , barely any reinforcement on the bottom.Additionally , since I 've ordered these -LRB- A month ago -RRB- I 've received 2 catalogs in the mail from this company . Totally unsolicited , unwelcome ... and SENT TO MY WORK ADDRESS . Unacceptable ! When I called the girl said `` Sorry , I do n't control who sends those ! '' What the heck does that mean ?
 The price explains the quality it is true you get what you pay for . The `` down '' in these slippers comes out like crazy and they have feathers as well as down , the points poke you , but they do keep your feet warm . Would be ok if you do n't wear slippers very often but for high usage I would go with a better quality product

 i really like frye brand shoes , so i ordered these boots . they are sooooo uncomfortable . heavy , clunky , and junky . wore them a couple times and then donated them .

 I live in Florida where we wear flip flops everywhere , even to church . It 's fine for what you pay for it , and it 's comfortable , but it does n't last . It is not solid leather . It 's like some rubbery material wrapped in leather . Ok for occasional wear I guess but not for me . I 've already worn them through .
 So bad , Returns without exchange are subject to a 15 % restocking fee . and You will need to pay for return postage costs .
 I purchased this shoes for a bikini competition . I only walked around the house in them a couple of times and the straps became very loose . I knew they would stretch some due to being plastic , but not like that ! My foot continued to side forward even after putting in a no-slip insert . Some of the diamond studs also came off . The trim was not connected to the shoe very well . If you 're doing a competition I suggest getting a shoe that has an ankle strap .
 I bought this bag a few years ago but just got around to writing this review . Do not buy this bag . After only a few months -LRB- in which I did not even carry this bag everyday -RRB- , the leather handle began to loosen and now I ca n't even carry it . I spent almost $ 200 on this bag and dont even think it is worth getting repaired . The repair will probably cost about half of what I paid for it . I will not buy any leather handbags from this company ever again .
 I asked the week that I received it to have Ebags to send me the into to return it , but they never did . The purse does not look like the picture and the tan color was more of a brown . I am very dissatisfied with this purchase
 These are very comfortable shoes and I really like the rubber soles . The problem however is that because the leather is so soft it scuffs and scrapes easily . Perhaps as a limited use shoe it would be fine but if your intent is to wear them often then look elsewhere because they wo n't look good for long .

 I ordered the shoe twice Abd both time received an incorrect item . The picture does n't reflect an actual product . I ordered the new style but received old tie down laces version . I was told that amazon will stop the page until it correct the problem . The page is still up and they are selling wrong items again . Maybe they have old and new styles mixed up in the warehouse and nobody cares to find the correct new style shoe . Unfortunatly they are sold by amazon itself . More time wasted Andre-package two wrong orders and stand in line to drop off the package at the post office .
 Went on a day trip with my new Sebago mens spinnaker boat shoes . By the end of the day my right foot was very red and almost bleeding . On looking at the shoe the stiching inside the right shoe was bunched up and causing the shoe nto rub against my foot . Further investigation showed that the right shoe actually was a different shade than the other . Come to find out it was the last pair available . I believe the shoes were returned and than sold to me . How could anyone with a conscience offer a product like that .
 Ignoring the comments of one of the reviewer , I went ahead and ordered these shoes , being captivated by their beauty . The item arrived as promised , and looked as good as the picture.However , a 5 minute walk with these shoes made the upper part of the heels -LRB- tendons -RRB- bleed profusely . I actually did n't realize that the pain I was feeling was already being accompanied by bleeding.I would suggest the manufacturer to look into this , and improve the shoe design from the back , seems the shoe protrudes too much towards the inside and hurts -LRB- actually ruptures -RRB- the tendons .
 I tried on a party , I felt hurt on both feet and the edge of the shoe cuts my skin and bleeding.The style is nice but it causes so much trouble to me while I couldnt feel comfortable on wearing it.I woulent recommend people buying this shoe .
 I found the shoes unconfortable , very hard for nubuck leather , they are not what these shoes use to be , sebago should look at a better manufacture
 Ordered my usual size 11 , was too long , heel was rock stiff , figured it might be okay after some break in time . Returned it and got a 10.5 , front was too tight , too narrow , heel was as usual , rock stiff , wore it for 2 hours an decided to return it , feet was crying for help , pain at the heels were excruciating . Colors may be attractive but it is n't worth it , stick with sperrys ...
 The first few times I wore them my feet were pretty much raw . I just thought that I had to wear them in but after 4 tries -LRB- I really wanted this to work ! -RRB- I just could not deal with them again . The style is nice , but wearing these things without socks is terrible .
 Shoe color was not the same as the image on Amazon . The show was very stiff and did not fit well ; caused blisters on my feet within 15 minutes . I recommend a different brand if you are on the market for boat shoes .
 I 'm sorry , I was n't satisfied , I ordered and expecting it was a leather as it states in the order online but unfortunately it was made of suade ... very disappointed.Amazon gave me a replica ; I wo n't be ordering shoes anymore online . .
 shoes , hard , rough , uncomfortable to use , they have hurt my feet , and I have almost no use them ; regret that a brand like SEBAGO have concessions that discredit , I hope they give me some alternative change , thanks .

 I bought these shoes for a specific occasion and they served their purpose for that occasion . The shoes were painful to walk in and left blisters on my feet and have since gone in the trash . These were really cute and I was hoping the quality would be better .
 With the title of `` Walking Cradle '' I was expecting a comfortable walking sandal . I bought these for my trip to Disney . I could n't wear them more than a short time without them being uncomfortable . No way I could use them for the hours of walking in Disney World as I had hoped . They also squeeked ! Sorry , these are pretty , but definitely not the comfortable walking sandal I was expecting when I purchased .
 I ordered the 3.5 big kid shoe based on the sizing chart in inches . The size states that it is 8 5/8 inches and the shoe is actually 8 inches long .
 I got these shoes in a 9 and they were just too big . I have to wear two pairs of socks . They are also very heavy .
 These shoes run very small to size . Ordered size 8.5 2E and seems more like a 7 - 7.5 w. . . certainly NOT extra wide and not a size 8.5 . Have n't returned yet , so not sure how THAT will go . I 'm quite leery of trying for an exchange ... what if THAT does n't fit either ? Am I going to be charged for returning ? twice ? Uh , uh ... I 'm thinking just return and cut my losses . Also , both boxes -LRB- outer shipping and inner shoe box -RRB- were crushed upon delivery . This had BETTER not cause a problem with a return and refund !

 I ordered the size I always wear in Easy Spirit shoes and found them too long , too loose in the heel and a bit tight across the widest part of my foot . Not up to Easy Spirit 's usual standards .
 Gave my mother these shoes for Christmas last year . Recently when I met her again , she said that she had not worn the shoes at all as the top of the shoe was hurting her foot so badly that she ca n't even wear it out the front door . The size is correct as the width and length of the shoe fits perfectly .
 EVEN AFTER READING SOME OF THE POOR REVIEWS I WENT AHEAD AND PURCHASED THESE SHOES BECAUSE OF THE PRICE AND THE REPUTATION OF EASY SPIRIT . BUT THEY WERE RIGHT ; THE SHOES ARE ABOUT A SIZE TOO BIG AND THEN ACROSS THE TOP IT IS SOMEWHAT TIGHT . THEY FEEL LIKE CLOWN SHOES SO I 'M SENDING THEM BACK .
 These shoes are at least a size larger than the marked size and they do not live up to the quality that I have found in Easy Spirit shoes in the past.I have several pairs of ES shoes and they are all true to size and a good value for the price -- but these are not a good value even if they had fit -- regardless of the reduced price . I did not return them because with the shipping , etc. , it would not be cost effective to do so . I will donate them to a local charity , and I will think twice about ordering shoes online in the future .
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .
 Product is dated and the little metal rings that the laces go through fell off . They 're not uncomfortable , but I would definitely recommend another brand ! Product took forever to arrive !!!!!
 The sizes are not in U.S. sizes . RUN WAY BIG -LRB- in terms of size -RRB- , BigFlySports expect you to pay the return charge as its not their fault they are too big . Stay away from these boots , as they are low quality and clearly not marked appropriately with regard to size . Read the bad reviews on these boots and stay away from BigFlySport .
 I can not wear it because that is too tight for me . the shoes still lay in my box . so bad .
 I find it has few uses . There is one hole on each side , so it can not be taken on rainy or snowy days . And in summer , it is a little warm to wear it . But it is cheap which is its most advantage .
 These boots were way too big for the size and they smelled . Of course I returned them .
 Then the box arrived I could sell the cigarette smell from outside the box . WOW , the few days I had the box in my car ready to send back my car smelled of stale cigarette smoke .
 started to crack after a week of wear , I should have spent more on something else that would not fall apart so soon .
 When you receive the boots you will notice the craftsmanship is quite sloppy on the sole . Mine looks like they took to pieces and glued them together . There is also a piece of the sole just glued on like a chunk came off . I would n't care so much because I payed 30 dollars but when I placed them on they where way to big . Order a size smaller or maybe even two and the shoes should fit fine . What I ended up doing is going to walmart and they have a very similar shoe that is a lot more comfortable that costs 31.32 with tax and everything . I ended up giving these to goodwill about a week after I received them .
 I bought these for my teenager , and he wore them to school for 2 weeks , when the sole began seperating from the shoe . I guess you get what you pay for - by the end of the 3rd week , they had to be thrown out - beyond salvage
 I am a recreational hunter , paintball player and overall gun enthusiast . I wanted these boots just like you did for probably all the same reasons that you are looking at them now . And I really hoped they would be good enough for me for as cheap as they are . THEY 'RE NOT!Overall , they 're not horrible boots , if you 're very light on them . I 've had them for about a month and I 've used them in a simple , recreational environment and the soles are already starting to peel off . The metal eyelets for the shoelaces have broken loose and 2 have already broken off . I will mention that I have not checked the manufacturers warranty claim to inspect what it `` covers '' but I fear that the boots in this dilapidated of condition wo n't be repaired or replaced.I have a history of being able to keep my possessions in good/great condition but the cheaply made and overall disappointing quality of these boots have me getting ready to throw them away in a matter of a month . Which is very disappointing to me because I am familiar with rothco and own some of their equipment . I really , honestly wanted this to just be a great deal , a good price for decent boots.Ultimately , I recommend saving your money , passing on these cheap pieces of crap and choosing more wisely than I did .
 after only a couple months the sole of the boots split open on both of them in the middle . it started with a crack , than split . i dont know what these soles are made with but they do n't last worth anything ...
 these heels are made for narrow feet , like women from the 1900s they do not look like the picture , if you have wide feet in the slightest bit , do not order these shoes the side of your foot will hang over and look rediculous ! had to return them and they do not offer wide sizes , go to cirilas.com to find same style of shoe , wayyy cuter . I still cant belive how unlike the picture they were , i needed my shoes for an NCP bikini comp and these were not it at all .
 The pic looked nothing like the actual shoe . The plastic part on top of the shoe came so low toward the toes that it dug in and was uncomfortable . Also , I had read other reviews before purchasing , and many folks said to get a size smaller than you normally would wear . This was not a good idea . They were way too tight . They sit in my closet .
 While I 've been warned by other bikini competitors that these types of shoes will be tight at first until they stretch , these are not only way tight and uncomfortable ... the toe is shaped extremely odd and extends way out in a pointy fashion . The strap across the toes is even more odd and seems like the shoes are rejects ??? Not pleased at all . And of course , I 'm expected to pay the return shipping .
 I just got my shoes two days ago and I have to return them . They do n't look like the picture at all . The shoe is very pointed in the front , the clear strap dose n't cover any of your toes at all because it 's so high up on your foot ... you have the clear strap that goes around your ankle and then like right under it is the other thick strap . You see how in the picture some of her toes are coverd by the shoe , the shoes I got ar n't like that , every single toe is all the way out . . even my little pinky toe , it 's all out . It 's hard to really describe but it seems like they made the shoe wrong or something because the design dose n't make sense . I do n't like the shoe and it would n't be such an issue if the shoe was the same as the picture but it 's a whole different shoe and I hate it . Grrrr SO UGLY
 Magnums have been the boots to buy since I was a kid . After the Stealth became the Stealth II , I figured I would try the Phantom 8 '' for a change.While they are incredibly comfortable shoes , -LRB- an improvement over the previous Magnums I 've owned -RRB- they are severely lacking in durability . I was a bit confused when a zipper pull came off in my hand about three months after I bought them . Where original Magnum boots had a beefy , straight zipper which -LRB- aside from being more fucntional -RRB- was virtually immune to breaking and easy enough to repair , these have some kid of thin threaded metal thing that , once bent is completely fubar.Wearing boots every day , a good pair should last 2-3 years . Now my Phantoms are barely a year old and have no soles on the heels , no zippers , a second pair of laces , shredded insoles and , most annoying of all , a complete separation of the ankle canvas from the leather heel . They might as well be sandals at this point.I will recomend Magnum as a brand . Hands down , they have sold me the best and most comfortable work boots with flexable , sneaker-like soles that I have ever seen . And they 're affordable . Unfortunately , these new construction Phantoms , with the thin curved zipper , and apparently weaker materials are not worth the money . Stick to the original Stealth Side-Zip or try another brand .
 the asics mexico 66 are the nicest trainers i have ever had - which is why i was so desparate to get hold of another pair - and when the black/grey/gold ones appeared not to be available in the uk i decided to buy them over the internet - sadly eastbay sent me the wrong colour - and whilst they have refunded me the value of the shoes - they have n't done the same with the duty and postage costs which are more than i paid for the shoes themselves . I have also now spent quite alot of money chasing up and trying to get this money back as eastbay assured me i was entitled to it ... and am just about to start the process all over again ... if shopping with them i hope you have a better experience ... second time round i have been impressed by the friendliness and efficiency of the eastbay staff - do n't know whether i 'll get the $ 116 -LRB- not including the purchase price which has been refunded now -RRB- that i am owed ... i think thats down to amazon ... fingers crossed i guess
 I bought these shoes from Eastbay . They are the worst pair of shoes that I have ever worn in my life . After wearing them for less than a week , I have identical cuts on both of my ankles from where the shoe jabbed into my skin . There is a flexible backing on the shoe which is sewn to the inside right where your ankle goes . As you walk , it grinds into your ankle and makes walking extremely uncomfortable . I HIGHLY recommend not buying this product .

 It was delivered at time . And seemed to be a good deal at the first glance ; however , it was n't . When I started wearing that Ferrari shoe , which is the reason why I bought it , the edge of the rubber bottom started to loose its ability to be stuck to upper leather and exibit a bad apearance . Maybe because the product was stored in stock for a long time or maybe for other reasons . Any way , the prodoct was n't the same value or quality of pumma 's shoes that I have bought in the past .
 Unfortunately , I did not received this product on time so I had to wear something else . This will not stop me from ordering from Amazon again . When I receive it I will give a further review .

 These shoes are the squeakiest shoes I 've ever seen , mine or otherwise ! They are embarrasing to wear because they are so loud . I would not recommend .

 I gave 2 stars because the shoes are cute and I received them quickly . Those are the only positive things I can say about them . I ordered the size that was supposed to fit my feet - the shoes were too short . Had I kept them and worn them , my big toe would have poked a hole in the tips of the shoes - probably sooner rather than later . The knit upper is thin giving the shoes a very cheap look - I could see my skin through the weave . There was absolutely no arch support - none . I 've had better arch support in a bedroom slipper . To be fair , I have flat feet ; if you have a normal arch - meaning one that does not require orthotics - then this shoe might work for you . I also think that these shoes are overpriced given what appears to be mediocre quality . Suffice it to say , I sent them back almost as quickly as I received them .

 The main problem is that the strap cut into the top of my foot and also created blisters on my toes . I had to return it .
 I 've owned many pairs of Bruno 's and never before have had a pair that tore at my feet . I thought that this was short term and they just needed to be worn in but NO . I guess thats why these are always on sale . They look great but are just about unwearable . Buyer beware .
 I wore these boots for the first time , Halloween night . I did a little dancing and a very little bit of walking and when I get to the last party , the heel on the right boot just snaps off and I almost busted my you know what on some stairs . Cheap cheap cheap , except for the price . I want my money back !
 The company sent me the wrong product and then it took over a month to resolve . This was supposed to be a Halloween costume piece , but too bad . The matter was n't resolved until November . I recommend NEVER purchasing from this store .

 I wore these boots for the first time , Halloween night . I did a little dancing and a very little bit of walking and when I get to the last party , the heel on the right boot just snaps off and I almost busted my you know what on some stairs . Cheap cheap cheap , except for the price . I want my money back !

 the asics mexico 66 are the nicest trainers i have ever had - which is why i was so desparate to get hold of another pair - and when the black/grey/gold ones appeared not to be available in the uk i decided to buy them over the internet - sadly eastbay sent me the wrong colour - and whilst they have refunded me the value of the shoes - they have n't done the same with the duty and postage costs which are more than i paid for the shoes themselves . I have also now spent quite alot of money chasing up and trying to get this money back as eastbay assured me i was entitled to it ... and am just about to start the process all over again ... if shopping with them i hope you have a better experience ... second time round i have been impressed by the friendliness and efficiency of the eastbay staff - do n't know whether i 'll get the $ 116 -LRB- not including the purchase price which has been refunded now -RRB- that i am owed ... i think thats down to amazon ... fingers crossed i guess

 who would make shoes that have a little thingie that sticks in between your toes?That 's an awful way to attach a shoe to a foot .
 May be OK , but looks ordinary and cheap . RE-ordered and received the Urban style , which is better looking and appears more sturdy .
 Very cute skimmers , but very few of us will ever enjoy wearing them , as the crossover elastic straps are cut way too short . Hence the shoes fit so tightly they render the shoes unwearable . And this is quite a verdict , considering it comes from someone who wears a narrow width -LRB- and low arch -RRB- and routinely must put padded insoles in her shoes so they fit even somewhat . After returning my normal size and reordering up a 1/2 size , I thought the larger pair would be tolerably snug though a bit long . Nooooooooo - the straps cut into my feet so much there were red marks after less than a minute of wear . Sadly , I returned the second pair as well . Perhaps those with very flat narrow feet can succeed .
 I had no problem with the quality of the shoe , my complaint is that the sizing was very confusing . I thought I was buying a pair of size 8 shoe for men or a size 6 for women , but it turned out the other way around . I have tor return these . You need to clarify the sizing of your shoes .

 Extremely poor sizing - have tried 2 increased sizes . I went up a full size and struggled to get them on past the opening . A very disappointing progression for Merrell . I have worn out several pairs of the non-Gore Tex.Definitely do not buy this model .

 Bought a pair of these shoes a few years ago , thinking that they might be an improvement over the original Stan Smiths , which I 'd been wearing for years.It 's a very comfortable shoe , lightweight with adequate support but the seams started to split on the show -LRB- left shoe , inner side , on the upper -RRB- long before the sole started to wear out . Having literally gone through over a dozen pairs of the original Stan Smiths , I 'd always worn out the soles long before the uppers wore out . It was a disappointment to have to throw out the Millennium version while there was still plenty of tread on the soles . Am back to wearing the original Stan Smiths , and Rod Lavers .
 I have owned a few of these shoes and appears each one is made by someone on the line who ca n't put a shoe together . Either the tip of the toe separates from the sole 's tip or the toungue of the shoe is offset , or in this case the shoe has an oblonged look like that of a whale . I give it two because its comfy and do n't care too much if all I do is use these to work out in the garden . There are many other shoes I 've read reviews on that are as comfy and not as poorly made .

 The boots dig into the heel of the foot . The leather is very stiff and the boots are not very comfortable.NOT RECOMMENDED

 the product did not hold up to the standards of the manufacture it ripped in the seam in four weeks .
 Returned these . EE is narrower than some D boots I 've had . insole is uncomfortable and no insert is going to fix it . My Ariats fit much better .
 I received this boot and had to return it immediately due to sizing . I have to agree with the other reviewer who wrote that the width is way off on these boots . Ordered an 8.5 M but should 've gotten an EE . The boot was of very good quality and the price was right . But after it cost me $ 19 to return the package , I 'd rather go to Boot Barn which carries this same model for about $ 5 more . That way I can try them on and carry them out . I did call Barebones Workwear to ask if they 'd refund my return shipping fee as well as send me an 8.5 EE but they refused to refund so I guess I learned a few things from this experience . First off I 'm done buying clothing especially footwear online . Secondly I will probably not use any non Amazon Vendors that way my return shipping will always be covered . If you do decide to continue your purchase with Barebones Workwear , use caution in choosing the width as to what you normally would wear . If they do n't fit when you get them it will cost a good bit to return . Best of Luck hope this helps somebody .

 I love Havaianas , and have a few pairs of the original and slim . Decided I needed a bit of a lift in my shoe for long dresses . For the first couple of hours they were fine , but after a full day , and not much walking , they rubbed my foot raw . The straps on these are just not as soft and comfortable . i do n't know what it is , but my foot was bleeding in two places where the straps hit them .
 I wore these boots for the first time , Halloween night . I did a little dancing and a very little bit of walking and when I get to the last party , the heel on the right boot just snaps off and I almost busted my you know what on some stairs .

 I am not satisfied bad quality unbearable when walkingwasted money
 I bought a pair of Eastland 10 years ago and they were fantastic shoes , comfortable and long lasting , they finally died . I then purchased 2 pairs of the newer version of the shoe shown here , not as comfortable as the original -LRB- the others looked better for the work place too -RRB- but I broken them in and they were acceptable . Now a year later the sole of the shoe has split in two . Definitely not as well constructed as the last pair but they cost the same . Actually the interior of the heel of one of the shoes broke very shortly after I started using them . Right now it would seem I would get about as much usage from a pair costing 1/3 as much . One of the reasons for going to these was because the cheaper shoes die after about a year of wear . The quality has really degraded . You might want to look elsewhere .
 I purchased this shoe in the usual size I take in Eastland shoes and I could hardly get my foot into the shoe . Once on , with the use of a shoehorn , the shoe was long enough but too tight overall . Too uncomfortable on , it was immediately apparent they had to go back . Disappointed as the shoe is good looking and I have had very good luck with Eastland shoes otherwise . Plus had to pay return shipping . : -LRB-
 I 've owned 3 pair of these shoes . Comfort is great , good support , roomy toe box and easy to get on and off . But the soles and heel crack and split long before the leather uppers show wear . The inside lining material wears and becomes shabby quickly . I would pay twice the price for better quality for a longer wear . The design is great but the material inside and the sole/heel is inferior . I 'd buy again IF the price reflects the material quality .
 I , too , had the same shoe for years but the material at the top was starting to wear so I replaced it with this new shoe . The new shoe was not as comfortable at first , but after time has become more comfortable . After just over a year , I , too , have had the same problem with this replacement pair as other reviewers . The bottom of the shoe has split on both shoes . This is very troubling since my previous pair lasted for years with much more wear .

 I wore these boots for the first time , Halloween night . I did a little dancing and a very little bit of walking and when I get to the last party , the heel on the right boot just snaps off and I almost busted my you know what on some stairs . Cheap cheap cheap , except for the price . I want my money back !
 The company sent me the wrong product and then it took over a month to resolve . This was supposed to be a Halloween costume piece , but too bad . The matter was n't resolved until November . I recommend NEVER purchasing from this store .

First off I 'm done buying clothing especially footwear online . Secondly I will probably not use any non Amazon Vendors that way my return shipping will always be covered . If you do decide to continue your purchase with Barebones Workwear , use caution in choosing the width as to what you normally would wear . If they do n't fit when you get them it will cost a good bit to return . Best of Luck hope this helps somebody .

 Returned these . EE is narrower than some D boots I 've had . insole is uncomfortable and no insert is going to fix it . My Ariats fit much better .
 I received this boot and had to return it immediately due to sizing . I have to agree with the other reviewer who wrote that the width is way off on these boots . Ordered an 8.5 M but should 've gotten an EE . The boot was of very good quality and the price was right .

 I have heard people talk about these flip-flops being comfy and since I norally wear flip flops all summer long - I thought I would love them for my Mexico vacation . They were not at all comfy and probably the least comfy pair I have . I would not recomend these rubber flip flops .

 I bought a pair of these for use as a firefigter/EMT under a year ago , and had the zipper on one boot fail during duty . I have the 6 '' version of these as well , and both zippers are starting to tear away from the uppers . Very comfortable , lightweight boots , but the zippers are terrible ! If you do n't need quick on/off , buy the non zippered version of these , and you will probably be fine .
 I bought this Kamik Rocket winter boots for my 6 year old son and he worn it just one month and it already had opened stitches and the opened holes along the Velcro lines . The water got inside when it rained . It was not good quality at all . Spent almost -LSB- ... -RSB- when it was on sales but lasted only one month . It was said on the tags attached to the boots as `` MADE IN CANADA '' with high quality but it was not as what it said . I was so regretted to buy it and to prefer to my sister to buy it for her son .

 Not very heavy-duty as the last pair . Rather light weight and seem to have a lack of quality .
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .
 I had no problem with the quality of the shoe , my complaint is that the sizing was very confusing . I thought I was buying a pair of size 8 shoe for men or a size 6 for women , but it turned out the other way around . I have tor return these . You need to clarify the sizing of your shoes .

 Decorative and lightweight . But it 's nothing more than a very large , waterproof gift bag . It 's stiff and crinkly -LRB- and loud -RRB- . For the price , you can find something better as a beach bag .
 This is a huge bag ... but the one they delivered is not the one I ordered . In fact , the pattern I received was not even pictured on the Amazon description . Quality control issues .
 I loved this bag . It was exactly what I wanted ... lightweight , roomy , water resistant . I was so disappointed to realize that after less than a month the material right next to the straps was ripping on three of the four straps ! I was using it as a pool bag so it was packed with several towels , goggles , sunscreen . Nothing heavy that would have stressed the material too much . Returned it for a refund .

 I was very disapointed when I recieved the shoes with the ink tag still on them . From what I understand it happens a lot with this company . Then to learn I would have to return the shoes , wait for them to crdit my account , and re purchase them . Instead of the company just removing the ink tag .

 I was so excited to get these shoes . The style and price were great . Although , when I recieved them the left shoe was quite a bit larger than the right foot . Unfortunately , I have not worn tthem very much because of the size difference . I should have exchanged them , so make sure you are satisfied before throwing everything away . I never even tried them on until I had a whole outfit prepared .

 The shoe looks cool on amazon.com but when it arives at your house it has white laces and does not look as good as it does on the web .

 I searched and searched for a great pair of shoes for my husband . He has always worn Johnston & Murphy and everyone said these were better . He is on his feet constantly and needs something durable and comfortable . He wore holes in the bottoms of these shoes in two months . We did n't even bother sending them in to get fixed , they were always stiff , they scratched really easily and just were n't great . He went back to a cheaper pair of Johnston & Murphy shoes and they have held up really well and are a lot more comfortable for him . He has a narrow foot and he finds them a lot more comfortable for him than the Allen Edmond 's shoes .
 I bought a pair online from Nordstrom . The shoes fit perfectly and were very handsome . However , the leather quality was not so good and I felt like I was holding a $ 300 hunk of cardboard . The upper started crinkling up badly when I bent it slightly to insert the shoe lace . I was afraid of what they would look like after a couple wearings . I wanted to have a pair of dress shoes but did not feel these would still look good past a couple wearings . The sides of the soles were sloppy and reminded me of the Bass Weejun pennyloafers I wore when I was in my 20 's . When I took them back to my local Nordstrom store , the sales associate likened them to Birkenstocks . I think these shoes are better as office workhorses than dress shoes . If you are willing to spend 300 bucks for workhorses , these are just the thing for you.imo , for the texture and feel , definitely not worth 300 bucks . I do n't think I 'd pay $ 100 for them either. : -LRB-
 We returned the item because there was hard dryed glue that oozed up in the toe area of the insole and made them uncomfortable to wear . It gives the impression they could be seconds and the price was the same as if we bought them in the store .
 Many many many problems and issues with these shoes . This is why they do n't make shoes in America anymore . There seems to be no standard in any Allen Edmonds shoes . None seemed to fit right , they were all different . The quality and workmanship are very poor . There are many small defects . Very uncomfortable and stiff shoes . Shoe run very narrow . NOT WORTH THE MONEY !!!
 Firstly , the shoe looks great . Found the right size for the AE # 5 last
 The heel fell apart after only about 3 months - not what I had expected from a $ 300 + pair of shoes . Poor quality - definitely not worth the money .

 As fast as little ones grow out of their shoes , I did not want to spend a ton of money on new shoes for my son . These actually fit the bill for summmer foot wear . Against my better judgement I had purchased them anyways ... when they finally arrived I was excited to get them ! My son wore them 2 times and the `` Columbia '' emblems and writing was all but gone and the dark blue had gone to a lighter blue . I ended up going out and getting him another pair of sandles .
 I ordered these for my 4 year old son because I have had such good luck with the durability of boys Columbia sandals in the past -LRB- 3 pair -RRB- . I am thoroughly disappointed with these . After just a few days of normal wear the top layer of color on all the blue straps as well as the logos has worn off leaving behind an unattractive gray fuzzy appearance . Some of the stitching started pulling out after only a couple of weeks . Not what I would expect from an almost $ 40 pair of kids sandals !! In retrospect I should have returned them as soon as the color started to flake off , but unfortunately I am stuck with them now . It will be the last pair of Columbia sandals I buy for him , for sure !
 I love Columbia products , these were nice looking but a little too hard for my 2yr old . Would not recommend .

 the shoes are the exact ones pictured , however they dont have the blue indego laces that are pictured . instead they sent me the shoes with white laces when I complained , their customer service reps lied and told me that the laces were in the mail but they never arrived , after I called them again , they overnighted me the same white laces I already had . they did eventually let me return the shoes at thier store in the city next to mine and sent me a gift card to fix the problem but they will not be fixing the picture or the description .
 Took over a month to get product.Think compensation should be given when you ar guaranteed to get the product by a certain date .
 The website said size 6 Mens , the shoes were size 6 Womens , and the return process was designed so that i could n't actually return them for shoes in the right size .
 I 'm very disappointed as this shoe must have some undisclosed latex in it . It was comfy true , but that does me little good !
 I own a pair of reefs other than these . Bought both the Black & Brown . If you want a flip flop to bum around the house with , these are ok . But do n't expect to get any sort of support if you plan to walk around for a long time they will hurt your feet . For the money not worth the brand name .
 Is not true to size , a 9 is more like an 8 1/2 and the straps ride really really weird ...
 These sandals are pretty . That 's the only good thing I can say . Their shape is VERY weird . The sandal is VERY long from the toe piece forward and sticks out way beyond my toes . Then the shoe is way too short from the instep back . The straps are twisted and dig into my instep and the sides are taller than the middle . I 've worn flip flops all my life . I do n't know how this manufacturer thinks they can charge almost $ 20 for a shoe like this .
 I ordered these flip flops in blue and in black . The black pair fits well and are comfortable ... The blue pair are the worst flip flops ever ! They hurt my feet and feel too small ... I 'm not sure how the same shoe can have two different fits ! I love reefs and have been wearing them year round for 15 years now but I am very disapointed in these .
 I 'm size 7 and this feels like size 6.5 . The front tho . . seemed right length but the back seems a bit short , and the straps were too tight . Not sure if the straps would be comfortable even if it was n't tight tho ... The sole padding feels just ok but the material they use should be questioned ... I dont think its comfortable on the skin at all . And its true the bottom can be slippery coz it 's pretty much flat . I do n't think it 's worth the money . If it was $ 13 bux I would get an exchange for a bigger size.My questions is why the hell do these companies make sandals that are uncomfortable and charge us what it 's to worth ??? That is plain stupid . It is OBVIOUS they didnt use a shoe model ... Thank god for amazon tho I can just get a refund hassle free .
 Although these flip flops look very nice , the toe bed is too long , I end up catching them on stairs and such , ca n't even consider wearing them at a rocky beach I 'd be flat on my face . The width is also for a narrow foot , the straps are tight ... If I had n't worn them , I would have sent them back .
 These sandals were ordered in a size 10 , and they did not fit . I went into a store that sells them here and tried on a different style of reef sandals and they fit perfectly ... I do n't know why these did n't fit , but they were very uncomfortable because of that !! I gave them to someone else , who wears 9 1/2 and they fit her fine ... I would recommend ordering a size up if possible ...
 Do not buy this product . I bought it in good faith and my feet are all covered in shoebites . I have thrown the original box always so I m stuck with it but let me tell u it 's not even a week and it 's dreadful
 Based on previous reviews , I purchased this and after wearing them for the whole summer I have to say I am a bit disappointed because they lack enough shock support for just general walking around & shopping . By the end of the day , your feet will hurt . I have a different pair of flip flops made by Crocs which I bought at a shoe warehouse that have the same thickness but with a much better shock absorption than the Reef sandals . Must have a different composition . As a bonus , the Crocs have tiny knobs on their sandals ' foot bed which does make walking in them feel good to the skin , and at the end of the day in those , my feet do n't hurt as much as if I 'd spent the day in the Reefs .
 I like the feel of this shoe since it is cushiony but where the back strap is attached to shoe it is bulky and very uncomfortable on my foot and I do n't have picky feet.I hate returning things so they will sit in my closet until I get rid of them which is a shame because they are nice shoes but not worth having blisters on my feet : -LRB-
 I had yet to find a Reef sandal I did n't like , until this one . The straps of the sandals are attached really far back on the foot bed . So far , that when I walk , it pushes on my arch . I 've also noticed that when I walk my toes start to hurt after a while . I do n't know if that has anything to do with the way the strap is pushing on my arch or what . I was hoping for more cushion as well . I am really disappointed with this sandal . I 'll wear it to the mailbox , etc. but I 'll keep looking for another all-day sandal . I am a size 7 .
 I wanted to love this - it is a baggallini - how could I not love it ? Well , it is n't up to the usual design and quality standards.The extendable handle is flimsy - this is not something you want to break in mid-trip . It is also surprisingly awkward to get the handle in and out of its section . This is more annoying than it seems if you travel a lot and you tend to leave the handle sticking out a bit - I can just hear it snapping off now.The straps are sort of useless - they are not padded so hurt my when hands and are too long for a petite person to hold with arm fully extended but too short to use over your shoulder.It looks like it would fit a lot of stuff , but I wanted something that would fit under a seat in a pinch and something that I could roll in airports but also carry when there were steps or snow or whatever . It might fit under some seats , but the design is more rigid than I thought it would be , so the is n't really the soft-sided smushable type of bag I expected . If you are in a smaller plane or there are electronic boxes this is not going to fit under the seat . That is not a deal breaker for everyone , but it is something to take into account.There is some fairly good organization and it is relatively lightweight for luggage with wheels , but it is going back
 The telescoping handle takes up much of the room in the ` largest ' compartment , therefore packing even for overnight -LRB- particularly heavy clothing -RRB- is not easy ... in addition this product -LRB- supposedly designed by stewardesses ? -RRB- was too wide to roll down the aisle of an average airplane -LRB- Airbus 3 and 3 seat -RRB-
 This is a very well constructed rolling tote , that is not the problem . It is poorly engineered and will not stand on it 's little wheels . I took it on a trip to Alaska right after I bought it , and it fell over 9 times out of ten . If you are one to not completely fill your tote , this might work better but I do n't see why it would be a benefit to have a bag that only worked when partially full .
 I have several Baggallini products which I love . I bought this 2/09 for an upcoming trip . There were only a few items in the bag , yet the clothes compartment zipper came apart before I got to the airport ! Rezipped several times - zipper came open each time . Rather stressful having one 's underwear on display at the airport & taxi stand . Even 1/4 full it is too large for under the seat . On the return trip I checked the empty bag with its opened zipper . Returned it & got my money back . Other sites have reviews that cite the same problem .
 I purchased the rolling tote bag on December 15th . I used it for 2 months -LRB- not daily and primarily as a laptop case -RRB- when the telescoping handle broke.It was n't like I was using it daily on airplanes - nor that I am hard on luggage ... very perplexed and extremely disappointed ,
 Being a Baaggallini fan who owns and enjoys five different bags , I was very disappointed in the Rolling Tote Bag . It is heavy to lift when it is empty and could never fit under the front seat of a plane even if you jammed it . The flight attendant was holding back a smile when I told her it was `` supposed '' to slip under the seat in front of me . So keep in mind that it is cute , rolls well but will NOT ever fit under any seat on any plane and it is very heavy to lift into the overhead .
 Although I love the form and function of this bag , the bag has had zipper issues since day one . The plastic zippers get stuck in place . And the bag is not overfull . Vaseline helps !
 The shoe looks cool on amazon.com but when it arives at your house it has white laces and does not look as good as it does on the web . I contacted footlocker/champ sports and it was a huge hassle anyway I did eventually get my money back and a $ 50 gift card for footlocker wich I used to replace these shoes with a much more expensive pair . you should think if you would like this shoe with white laces then this may be the shoe for you !

 the shoes are the exact ones pictured , however they dont have the blue indego laces that are pictured . instead they sent me the shoes with white laces when I complained , their customer service reps lied and told me that the laces were in the mail but they never arrived , after I called them again , they overnighted me the same white laces I already had . they did eventually let me return the shoes at thier store in the city next to mine and sent me a gift card to fix the problem but they will not be fixing the picture or the description .

 Although I am still loyal to the Asics brand , I have to say that the 2120 is very different to the previous models of the 2000 series . I noticed differences in the support -LRB- if you 're overpronated -RRB- when I started to get knee pains after the first day in them and now after only 5 months I can see the inner lining of the shoe start to wear away . I still own and use my GT 2110 which has no wear and tear although it has had more mileage put on it . My advice is to wait for the GT 2130 and hope that Asics made the necessary improvements to make that a comparable model to the GT 2110 . Chances are if you are n't going to put that many miles on the shoe that it might meet your running need but for that price , why settle !
 I have been running for a few years and loved my asics 2110 's . So , I was really excited when the 2120 came out . However , they do n't fit as well as the 2110 and my knees have started to hurt with them . I never had a knee problem with the 2110 . I am thinking of switching to the kayano line to see if those are better shoes for me .
 I have been wearing the GT 2080s and the GT 2110s for years now . These shoes are a big disappointment . The heel slips and they are not comfortable . I would advise choosing something different if you loved the 2110s . These shoes are a big let down .
 I have very true width EE feet and its been very difficult to find shoes that fit . Was hoping these would fit that deal and well the 6.5 fit ok but to tight at the toes do to the pointy-ness of them . So I sent them back hoping that the 7 's would fit better and more comfortable well major let down to me they feel much more narrow than the 6.5 s. I am debating on keeping these and just trying to break them in enough to wear them otherwise its not what I was hoping for . I have such wide but yet short feet and its so hard to find shoes that fit its ridiculous , especially when you have to spend so much money to get them . I am to young for this problem , with a low budget arthritis to boot in booth feet I am still gon na keep looking .
 Twice I received men 's shoes instead of womens . I returned them both and received a refund . I was told by the Amazon Representative that he was going to check into the situation and he would get back to me . I have not heard from him . I did order the womens shoes , not the mens in 9M . I would like to order them again , however , I am afraid of getting men 's shoes once again . I ordered the Breeze Walker the first time and I believe the Stability Walker the second time . Again , I reiterate , both times I was sent men 's shoes and they were advertised as Propet Women 's . The representative was going to check with the warehouse regarding this and was , as I previously stated , going to get back to me . Thank you . Barbara Simington
 I worked an 8 hour shift , and the shoe itself was hard and lacked support.Your heel strike was like walking on concrete , with bare feet.I also felt that the over all fit too big , and not true to size.I gave the shoes to a friend and she could not tolerate as well . Sorry I had high hopes .
 I could n't really tell from the pictures , but the toe area on this shoe is very narrow . And I even purchased the wide ones . I 'm on my feet all day and ca n't have my toes all squished up , it 's uncomfortable and just asking for trouble.More importantly , and if you 're thinking of buying these please pay close attention , the way the decorative leather pieces overlap just at the side of your small toe , cause a sharp painful rubbing right where you DO N'T want it.I tried on the right shoe , tied it up , felt the sharp rubbing on my baby toe , and that 's all she wrote . These went back in the box and back to Amazon immediately . Thank goodness they have such a hassle free return policy . Thanks Amazon !
 I have purchased Propet for about 15 years . Recently the brand changed styles , these are not nearly as comfortable as the Propet 's I was wearing about 4 years ago . I am having a hard time breaking these in . I work on my feet all day , and so far I ca n't wear these a full day yet . I think I will have to buy some other brand . They are very stiff .
 I owned a pair of Propet walkers about 15 years ago & loved them ! I thought these might be of the same quality -LRB- they appear to be -RRB- but actually , are NOT . They are cheap & squeaky & made of a strange plastic material that stinks . The squeaking is so bad I dare not wear them outside or people would STARE . I use them on my treadmill & I hope they will wear out fast .
 I looked at the number of good reviews without reading any of them , my fault . I wore them to work for 5 days . My back , hip , legs and feet were so sore I could barely walk by the time I got home from work . The right shoe rubbed my little toe to a blister . I ended up getting myself a different brand of new shoes , which I put on right away without any problem . This new pair of Propet 's is going to Goodwill . Will never buy another pair again .
 I had to return the shoes . Even though I ordered a D width it was still too narrow for my feet . The shoe appeared to be of good quality , but because I have very difficult feet to fit it 's better if I go to a store to try shoes on before purchasing .
 I ordered these shoes for work as a nurse . They are not white as the picture shows but sports white or as I discovered tan . They look very comfortable so I am very disappointed that I have to send them back .
 This shoe runs about a 1/2 size small . While the narrow width was really good for me it was to small . The shoes were very stiff and hard . I wore them to work 1 day and they put a blister on one of my toes . I could not return them because I had woren them , so I gave them away.I would not buy these shoes again .
 I am so far pleased with this product . It appears durable and all that was advertised . It comes with a 1000 mile sole guarantee . That was my original opinion of the product when it arrived . The shoes are falling apart after 3 months , of light everyday wear . The stitching on the right toe area has come undone , and the tread is worn down on the bottom . Sorry I purchased them .
 Returned this pair . Sizing was way too big . The width was wide , but the length felt 1 size over .

 when i walk in these shoes they make a lot of noise maybe because of the leather ! i have leather shoes but they dont sound like this ! its embarrassing so i gave them away but my cousin wants to give them back go figure !

 Returned this pair . Sizing was way too big . The width was wide , but the length felt 1 size over .
 I had to return the shoes . Even though I ordered a D width it was still too narrow for my feet . The shoe appeared to be of good quality , but because I have very difficult feet to fit it 's better if I go to a store to try shoes on before purchasing .
 I ordered these shoes for work as a nurse . They are not white as the picture shows but sports white or as I discovered tan . They look very comfortable so I am very disappointed that I have to send them back .
 This shoe runs about a 1/2 size small . While the narrow width was really good for me it was to small . The shoes were very stiff and hard . I wore them to work 1 day and they put a blister on one of my toes . I could not return them because I had woren them , so I gave them away.I would not buy these shoes again .
 I am so far pleased with this product . It appears durable and all that was advertised . It comes with a 1000 mile sole guarantee . That was my original opinion of the product when it arrived . The shoes are falling apart after 3 months , of light everyday wear . The stitching on the right toe area has come undone , and the tread is worn down on the bottom . Sorry I purchased them .
 I worked an 8 hour shift , and the shoe itself was hard and lacked support.Your heel strike was like walking on concrete , with bare feet.I also felt that the over all fit too big , and not true to size.I gave the shoes to a friend and she could not tolerate as well . Sorry I had high hopes .
 Twice I received men 's shoes instead of womens . I returned them both and received a refund . I was told by the Amazon Representative that he was going to check into the situation and he would get back to me . I have not heard from him . I did order the womens shoes , not the mens in 9M . I would like to order them again , however , I am afraid of getting men 's shoes once again . I ordered the Breeze Walker the first time and I believe the Stability Walker the second time . Again , I reiterate , both times I was sent men 's shoes and they were advertised as Propet Women 's . The representative was going to check with the warehouse regarding this and was , as I previously stated , going to get back to me . Thank you . Barbara Simington
 I have very true width EE feet and its been very difficult to find shoes that fit . Was hoping these would fit that deal and well the 6.5 fit ok but to tight at the toes do to the pointy-ness of them . So I sent them back hoping that the 7 's would fit better and more comfortable well major let down to me they feel much more narrow than the 6.5 s. I am debating on keeping these and just trying to break them in enough to wear them otherwise its not what I was hoping for . I have such wide but yet short feet and its so hard to find shoes that fit its ridiculous , especially when you have to spend so much money to get them . I am to young for this problem , with a low budget arthritis to boot in booth feet I am still gon na keep looking .

 I could n't really tell from the pictures , but the toe area on this shoe is very narrow . And I even purchased the wide ones . I 'm on my feet all day and ca n't have my toes all squished up , it 's uncomfortable and just asking for trouble.More importantly , and if you 're thinking of buying these please pay close attention , the way the decorative leather pieces overlap just at the side of your small toe , cause a sharp painful rubbing right where you DO N'T want it.I tried on the right shoe , tied it up , felt the sharp rubbing on my baby toe , and that 's all she wrote . These went back in the box and back to Amazon immediately . Thank goodness they have such a hassle free return policy . Thanks Amazon !
 I have purchased Propet for about 15 years . Recently the brand changed styles , these are not nearly as comfortable as the Propet 's I was wearing about 4 years ago . I am having a hard time breaking these in . I work on my feet all day , and so far I ca n't wear these a full day yet . I think I will have to buy some other brand . They are very stiff .
 I owned a pair of Propet walkers about 15 years ago & loved them ! I thought these might be of the same quality -LRB- they appear to be -RRB- but actually , are NOT . They are cheap & squeaky & made of a strange plastic material that stinks . The squeaking is so bad I dare not wear them outside or people would STARE . I use them on my treadmill & I hope they will wear out fast .
 I looked at the number of good reviews without reading any of them , my fault . I wore them to work for 5 days . My back , hip , legs and feet were so sore I could barely walk by the time I got home from work . The right shoe rubbed my little toe to a blister . I ended up getting myself a different brand of new shoes , which I put on right away without any problem . This new pair of Propet 's is going to Goodwill . Will never buy another pair again .
 The shoe looks cool on amazon.com but when it arives at your house it has white laces and does not look as good as it does on the web . I contacted footlocker/champ sports and it was a huge hassle anyway I did eventually get my money back and a $ 50 gift card for footlocker wich I used to replace these shoes with a much more expensive pair . you should think if you would like this shoe with white laces then this may be the shoe for you !

 the shoes are the exact ones pictured , however they dont have the blue indego laces that are pictured . instead they sent me the shoes with white laces when I complained , their customer service reps lied and told me that the laces were in the mail but they never arrived , after I called them again , they overnighted me the same white laces I already had . they did eventually let me return the shoes at thier store in the city next to mine and sent me a gift card to fix the problem but they will not be fixing the picture or the description .
 ordered size 13 they were clown shoes at least 3 sizes too big.ordered size 12 after sending those back and again too large.i normally take a sizeb 12.5 . these shoes are missized when made.i have now returned both pair and give up . I 'll go to the store and try them on first !
 These shoes look great and are extremely comfortable ... but be forewarned . The outer leather and sole of these shoes are ridiculously thin . I am unaware if this is trendy or not , but for those of you looking for an everyday shoe , this may not be the proper choice . I truly believed that I was going to tear the eyelets the first time that I laced them up and I am not kidding when I say that the sole of these shoes are comparable to moccasins . Like I said , they look great and the price is right but do not plan on wearing these more than every once in a while .
 I have several pairs of Birkenstocks , size 39 . I ordered these in size 39 , and when they came they were HUGE ! I returned them , thinking that I must have ordered a men 's shoe or something by mistake , but according to the size chart the sizing is the same for all Birkenstocks . I do n't understand why the shoes were three inches too long , and I 'm pissed that I had to pay eight dollars of shipping charges to return them . I still want the shoes , but am now too afraid to order them off of Amazon .
 I go through shoes unfortunately quick , which is why I have eschewed traditional footwear for hopefully rugged boots . I am a big fan of Merrel and Timberland , and I have found that full leather uppers and solid soles last the longest.So , having heard all the buzz about Dr. Martens , I decided to scrounge for a pair similar to what has worked for me in the past . I got them in and was somewhat disappointed before I ever even tried them on . The full leather uppers are quite supple , and by supple I mean thin . The soles seemed to be very soft , which is great for comfort but seemingly not so for durability.As far as the shoe goes , I have had them for close to a month now , and they are ok , but not something that I would stand up and preach about . There is noticeable wear on the soles and for some strange reason my feet get really cold while wearing them , though I knew upon purchasing them that they were not insulated.Overall , they are fine if you want a casual summer boot , but for serious trail use , go for something that is sturdier .
 I had high hopes for this shoe , especially in the green color . But when I tried it on , it felt super heavy and awkward ... not a good feeling when you try on a cute summer shoe . The size was okay , but overall this was not for me . I returned it and I am still looking for a green sandal .
 I searched every where for a blue dress shoe . At the time shoes just were n't that colorful . Everything seemed to be black or white . I came across these and decided to try them . They 're really cute but they are the most uncomfortable shoes ever . I actually ended up not wearing them at all .
 A good trail shoe has a shank that will help navigate rocky/boulder type terrain . The previous model called the Sawtooth had the shank , and the Tigertooth does not . I recommend an all terrain tennis shoe before this shoe.By the way , I just loved the Sawtooth from Columbia . The business decision to drop the Sawtooth was a mistake . The shoe was great for Rocky desert hiking . I convinced 6 of my friends to buy it .
 I purchased these 3 years back but rarely wore them . Recently I figured out why I did n't , the sole wears unevenly toward the back first and while the tops looks near new the bottom looks well used like a regularly worn everyday shoe . I 've worn another pair of shoes purchased at the same time nearly every day the last 3 years . While the top is worn pretty good the bottom is still in better shape than these trail shoes . I know these replaced another model but it sounds like every one wants the old model back because they were much better than this `` new version '' . I 'm guessing this is why no one sells them on amazon anymore but they are available if you want to try your luck . Personally I ca n't recommend buying these unless you like to throw your money at something you can wear short term at best unless you only use them on grass ...
 This shoe is great in theory but it 's nearly impossible for me to wear . I ca n't seem to balance my weight on the teensy heel and my toes go poking through the little straps . As I have previously stated , the ankle straps make this shoe a lot more wearable .
 They looked cute on the web , great heel and strap , but the front of the shoe is too long and pointy . The straps at the front show the toes with about an inch in front of them left of shoe . So they look too big even though the size of the shoe was correct .
 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .
 those are a good shoes , but the delivery provide service is the worst , i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day , i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail , bad deal to me !
 I usually wear a 7 or 7 1/2 but these felt a whole size too small ! They 'd probably be perfect for someone who wears a 6 or 6 1/2 .
 I bought these shoes from Eastbay . They are the worst pair of shoes that I have ever worn in my life . After wearing them for less than a week , I have identical cuts on both of my ankles from where the shoe jabbed into my skin . There is a flexible backing on the shoe which is sewn to the inside right where your ankle goes . As you walk , it grinds into your ankle and makes walking extremely uncomfortable . I HIGHLY recommend not buying this product .
 I could n't really tell from the pictures , but the toe area on this shoe is very narrow . And I even purchased the wide ones . I 'm on my feet all day and ca n't have my toes all squished up , it 's uncomfortable and just asking for trouble.More importantly , and if you 're thinking of buying these please pay close attention , the way the decorative leather pieces overlap just at the side of your small toe , cause a sharp painful rubbing right where you DO N'T want it.I tried on the right shoe , tied it up , felt the sharp rubbing on my baby toe , and that 's all she wrote .

 I bought these shoes for softball . I had only played about 4 games as we had issues getting the number of players together.However , in the short amount of time I had the shoes , the strips on the inside edging of the shoes had already come loose . One would expect this to happy after a full season of wear and tear , but not after 4 short games on fairly smooth grass play . Also , I would like to note the shoes are a nice fit , but can get quite hot inside.Overall , I am not a happy consumer ... when combined with the fact another pair of KC shoes -LRB- $ 180 -RRB- falling apart after 1 month -LRB- the sole LITERALLY peeled apart into two -RRB- , I will never buy any Kenneth Cole apparel again .
 For this price , this product is with low quality . It is no better than one from Walmart . My feet are like in oven when I wear it . Do not buy this one . I have thrown it away in my storage room .
 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .

 I am a Banquet Food Server and was looking for a good work shoes ! ... well after purchasing these shoes , I am still looking !!! 1st these are Heavy shoes2nd my feet NEVER hurt so bad after using these shoesI started to break them in doing some none banquet work -LRB- desk job -RRB- , I then had 1 banquet shift and they seemed fine . but the next week I had a week of doubles -LRB- Breakfast & Lunches -RRB- . The 1st day my feet were sore , the 2nd day it was worse , and the 3rd day I could barely walk to the car . The pain in the balls/pads of my feet was unbelievable . I switched back to my 2 year old shoes for the final 2 days of work and my feet were fine . The spring in the balls of your feet must of caused this as the soles are plenty thick -LRB- an inch and a half thick -RRB- . I must note that I had put inserts in these shoes for additional padding when I had this pain , ca n't imagine how bad it would have been if I had no inserts!The only good thing I can say about then is that my arches -LRB- plantar fasciitis -RRB- did not bother me at all .
 I have purchased 5 pairs of spira shoes and will not waste anymore money on them.They have a good idea and work good on cement with comfort for bad knees and back but the quality is junk.Spira measures quality by milage and believe mese willnot make it out of the house , i have to keep glueing the soles back together one place after another maybe i will get them completly re glued and they will work.I HAVE WATCHED THE QUALITY KEEP DECLINEING OVER THE PAST 4YEARS TRYING DIFFERENT STYLES AND THEY KEEP DECLINING DO YOU SELF A FAVOR AND BUY SOME OTHER BRAND .
 In there ad they claim because of the steel springs the sloes do not compress as much as conventional shoes . I supinate with my right foot and she shoes compressed on the outside a lot on my first use . It 's the only time I was able to wear them . They were uncomfortable and gave me ankle pain .
 This shoe is basically a gimmick . Very cheaply made , wears out very fast . For the price I was amazed at how poorly constructed it was . I was not impressed with this product at all . A little over a month the sole was wearing down , the top looked very worn , and I think the spring inside broke because the shoe started to lean to one side . I attempted to contact the manufacturer who only told me to return it to the place of purchase . When I told them that it was past 30 days and I could n't send it back they essentially told me that I was out of luck . I will never buy a shoe made by this company again .
 I recently bought this sneaker , the fit was great right out of the box . I am an RN and have knee issues . When I put the sneakers on they felt comfortable . I walked around for one day with them . That night my knees became swollen and painful . Two weeks have passed and my knees still hurt . I attempted to return the sneakers but they were sent back to me . I am very upset and disappointed with this company and would not recommend this sneaker or this company to anyone . The company also advertised a 100 % satisfaction guarentee . It appears they will not honor this statement .
 I bought these shoes because of all of the hype that they are comfortable . I am on my feet most of the day . I wore them for 2 days and I had to take them off because the shoes only caused pain and agony to my feet . The concept is good about the springs . The reality is that the springs are very hard and have no give . I tried these shoes off and on for a month . I even went to the store and bought padded inserts . The inserts did n't help either . I tried everything I could think of to help make them comfortable . Nothing worked ! I just did n't want to throw away a pair of shoes that I had spent so much money on . The bottom line is that I would never buy another pair of Spira shoes .
 Does n't fit the way I want it to . Since I had to wear them and the return policy said they had to be unopened or unused , I can not return them .
 ITried them on and sent them right back.To tight hurt my foot I need a big EEEE width this felt like a 2E
 usually they are great ... this last order ... shoes were too short and too tight ... same size as previous shoe ... defected ... had too to take to a shoe repair and had them strecth ... still too short and too tight ... this has NEVER happen before ... this is about my husband 10th pair ... what happen ????
 I am on my feet 10-12 hours aday at work . I was looking for a pair of shoes that would be comfortable throughout the day . So I bought a pair of Spira Classic men 's shoes . After wearing them 3-4 hours , I had to switch back to wearing my old ones . The springs in the front of the shoes began to hurt . I thought at first I needed to give it some time and allow the shoes to break in and to allow the my feet to adjust to the shoes . I then was going to give it a month for the break-in period , but after wearing them for 3-4 hours for 2 days my feet were in very painful . I had to stop wearing them . I then tried wearing them once a week for 3-4 hours . Once again my feet became painful and I had to switch back to my old shoes . I believe the problem with the shoes is in the springs . The springs are much to hard to walk on and that there is no give . I would NOT recommend buying a pair of these shoes .
 I own a pair of reefs other than these . Bought both the Black & Brown . If you want a flip flop to bum around the house with , these are ok . But do n't expect to get any sort of support if you plan to walk around for a long time they will hurt your feet . For the money not worth the brand name .
 Took over a month to get product.Think compensation should be given when you ar guaranteed to get the product by a certain date .
 The website said size 6 Mens , the shoes were size 6 Womens , and the return process was designed so that i could n't actually return them for shoes in the right size .
 I 'm very disappointed as this shoe must have some undisclosed latex in it . It was comfy true , but that does me little good !
 I 'm size 7 and this feels like size 6.5 . The front tho . . seemed right length but the back seems a bit short , and the straps were too tight . Not sure if the straps would be comfortable even if it was n't tight tho ... The sole padding feels just ok but the material they use should be questioned ... I dont think its comfortable on the skin at all . And its true the bottom can be slippery coz it 's pretty much flat . I do n't think it 's worth the money . If it was $ 13 bux I would get an exchange for a bigger size.My questions is why the hell do these companies make sandals that are uncomfortable and charge us what it 's to worth ??? That is plain stupid . It is OBVIOUS they didnt use a shoe model ... Thank god for amazon tho I can just get a refund hassle free .
 Is not true to size , a 9 is more like an 8 1/2 and the straps ride really really weird ...
 These sandals are pretty . That 's the only good thing I can say . Their shape is VERY weird . The sandal is VERY long from the toe piece forward and sticks out way beyond my toes . Then the shoe is way too short from the instep back . The straps are twisted and dig into my instep and the sides are taller than the middle . I 've worn flip flops all my life . I do n't know how this manufacturer thinks they can charge almost $ 20 for a shoe like this .
 I ordered these flip flops in blue and in black . The black pair fits well and are comfortable ... The blue pair are the worst flip flops ever ! They hurt my feet and feel too small ... I 'm not sure how the same shoe can have two different fits ! I love reefs and have been wearing them year round for 15 years now but I am very disapointed in these .
 Although these flip flops look very nice , the toe bed is too long , I end up catching them on stairs and such , ca n't even consider wearing them at a rocky beach I 'd be flat on my face . The width is also for a narrow foot , the straps are tight ... If I had n't worn them , I would have sent them back .
 These sandals were ordered in a size 10 , and they did not fit . I went into a store that sells them here and tried on a different style of reef sandals and they fit perfectly ... I do n't know why these did n't fit , but they were very uncomfortable because of that !! I gave them to someone else , who wears 9 1/2 and they fit her fine ... I would recommend ordering a size up if possible ...
 Do not buy this product . I bought it in good faith and my feet are all covered in shoebites . I have thrown the original box always so I m stuck with it but let me tell u it 's not even a week and it 's dreadful
 Based on previous reviews , I purchased this and after wearing them for the whole summer I have to say I am a bit disappointed because they lack enough shock support for just general walking around & shopping . By the end of the day , your feet will hurt . I have a different pair of flip flops made by Crocs which I bought at a shoe warehouse that have the same thickness but with a much better shock absorption than the Reef sandals . Must have a different composition . As a bonus , the Crocs have tiny knobs on their sandals ' foot bed which does make walking in them feel good to the skin , and at the end of the day in those , my feet do n't hurt as much as if I 'd spent the day in the Reefs .
 I like the feel of this shoe since it is cushiony but where the back strap is attached to shoe it is bulky and very uncomfortable on my foot and I do n't have picky feet.I hate returning things so they will sit in my closet until I get rid of them which is a shame because they are nice shoes but not worth having blisters on my feet : -LRB-
 I had yet to find a Reef sandal I did n't like , until this one . The straps of the sandals are attached really far back on the foot bed . So far , that when I walk , it pushes on my arch . I 've also noticed that when I walk my toes start to hurt after a while . I do n't know if that has anything to do with the way the strap is pushing on my arch or what . I was hoping for more cushion as well . I am really disappointed with this sandal . I 'll wear it to the mailbox , etc. but I 'll keep looking for another all-day sandal . I am a size 7 .
 I bought these shoes from Eastbay . They are the worst pair of shoes that I have ever worn in my life . After wearing them for less than a week , I have identical cuts on both of my ankles from where the shoe jabbed into my skin . There is a flexible backing on the shoe which is sewn to the inside right where your ankle goes . As you walk , it grinds into your ankle and makes walking extremely uncomfortable . I HIGHLY recommend not buying this product .
 Warning , do not buy these if you have flat feet . The way they designed these shoes causes extreme pain . I bought these for my son who has flat feet . He ca n't wear them more than 10 minutes . A coworker 's son has the same problem . I did a Google search and found more cases of people with flat feet having problems with this shoe . ** UPDATE ** My youngest son 's feet finally grew to the size of these shoes and he started wearing them . He has normal arches and he loved them ! He wore them out actually .
 These shoes are a joke ! My 16 year old son plays varsity for his high school and on 2 Select teams . As it is for everyone , money is tight but , we bought these for him . -LRB- Did not buy from Amazon , purchased locally at a soccer store . -RRB- One of the cleats `` stripped '' in the first 3 weeks making the shoes totally worthless . I contacted Addidas and they have seen no reason to talk to us . Took them back to the store where they were bought and they were going to `` fix '' them . Told them not to bother . We got a different , better pair of shoes and a gift card for the trouble . I do n't care how much my son might believe in another pair of Addidas but , I refuse to buy any of their products ever again because they have NO customer service .
 I have been wearing New Balance sneakers for over ten years and this is not their finest product . I purchased these for just strolling around the park with the kids , no long distances , but they were quite annoying . The sole is recessed and there is an odd portion on the end of the shoe that rubs your heel as you step . Unfortunately , I tried to go up a size and had the same result.They look really nice but they 're not worth the discomfort . I suggest that you take a good walk around a footwear store with these on before you add to the unwanted shoes in your closet .
 The notes from the manufacturer on the Amazon page say you get 4 plugs plus a nylon travel pouch for your $ 10 . In fact , what was in the package that just arrived was just one plug and no travel pouch . The plug looks like a good one , but we feel we were very much mislead by the product description .
 They are a little stiff , should have smoother edges around the area you slide you foot in . Not very comfortable .

 This is a deceptively , adorable looking shoe & not cheap . I rate it 5 stars for looks and 0 stars for fit .1 - the footbed is too narrow , it 's designed for very slim feet ! 2 - the footbed is slippery so when walking , the foot slides to the front , causing your toes to hang over the edge3 - the shoe is flat with no flexability , therefore walking is restraining , it 's not an easy task -LRB- wow - what a concept , walking in sandals ?! Shame on you Kenneth Cole , why did n't you think of that ! -RRB- Although these are beautiful looking sandals , I do not recommend them .

 Twice I received men 's shoes instead of womens . I returned them both and received a refund . I was told by the Amazon Representative that he was going to check into the situation and he would get back to me . I have not heard from him . I did order the womens shoes , not the mens in 9M . I would like to order them again , however , I am afraid of getting men 's shoes once again . I ordered the Breeze Walker the first time and I believe the Stability Walker the second time . Again , I reiterate , both times I was sent men 's shoes and they were advertised as Propet Women 's . The representative was going to check with the warehouse regarding this and was , as I previously stated , going to get back to me . Thank you . Barbara Simington
 I have very true width EE feet and its been very difficult to find shoes that fit . Was hoping these would fit that deal and well the 6.5 fit ok but to tight at the toes do to the pointy-ness of them . So I sent them back hoping that the 7 's would fit better and more comfortable well major let down to me they feel much more narrow than the 6.5 s. I am debating on keeping these and just trying to break them in enough to wear them otherwise its not what I was hoping for . I have such wide but yet short feet and its so hard to find shoes that fit its ridiculous , especially when you have to spend so much money to get them . I am to young for this problem , with a low budget arthritis to boot in booth feet I am still gon na keep looking .
 I worked an 8 hour shift , and the shoe itself was hard and lacked support.Your heel strike was like walking on concrete , with bare feet.I also felt that the over all fit too big , and not true to size.I gave the shoes to a friend and she could not tolerate as well . Sorry I had high hopes .
 I could n't really tell from the pictures , but the toe area on this shoe is very narrow . And I even purchased the wide ones . I 'm on my feet all day and ca n't have my toes all squished up , it 's uncomfortable and just asking for trouble.More importantly , and if you 're thinking of buying these please pay close attention , the way the decorative leather pieces overlap just at the side of your small toe , cause a sharp painful rubbing right where you DO N'T want it.I tried on the right shoe , tied it up , felt the sharp rubbing on my baby toe , and that 's all she wrote . These went back in the box and back to Amazon immediately . Thank goodness they have such a hassle free return policy . Thanks Amazon !
 I have purchased Propet for about 15 years . Recently the brand changed styles , these are not nearly as comfortable as the Propet 's I was wearing about 4 years ago . I am having a hard time breaking these in . I work on my feet all day , and so far I ca n't wear these a full day yet . I think I will have to buy some other brand . They are very stiff .
 I owned a pair of Propet walkers about 15 years ago & loved them ! I thought these might be of the same quality -LRB- they appear to be -RRB- but actually , are NOT . They are cheap & squeaky & made of a strange plastic material that stinks . The squeaking is so bad I dare not wear them outside or people would STARE . I use them on my treadmill & I hope they will wear out fast .
 I looked at the number of good reviews without reading any of them , my fault . I wore them to work for 5 days . My back , hip , legs and feet were so sore I could barely walk by the time I got home from work . The right shoe rubbed my little toe to a blister . I ended up getting myself a different brand of new shoes , which I put on right away without any problem . This new pair of Propet 's is going to Goodwill . Will never buy another pair again .
 Returned this pair . Sizing was way too big . The width was wide , but the length felt 1 size over .
 I had to return the shoes . Even though I ordered a D width it was still too narrow for my feet . The shoe appeared to be of good quality , but because I have very difficult feet to fit it 's better if I go to a store to try shoes on before purchasing .
 I ordered these shoes for work as a nurse . They are not white as the picture shows but sports white or as I discovered tan . They look very comfortable so I am very disappointed that I have to send them back .
 This shoe runs about a 1/2 size small . While the narrow width was really good for me it was to small . The shoes were very stiff and hard . I wore them to work 1 day and they put a blister on one of my toes . I could not return them because I had woren them , so I gave them away.I would not buy these shoes again .
 I am so far pleased with this product . It appears durable and all that was advertised . It comes with a 1000 mile sole guarantee . That was my original opinion of the product when it arrived . The shoes are falling apart after 3 months , of light everyday wear . The stitching on the right toe area has come undone , and the tread is worn down on the bottom . Sorry I purchased them .

 These boots were the most uncomfortable I have ever tried . I bought a pair for myself and for my child . I was fortunate that the vendor was out of the Itasca Tahoe for my child and offered a replacement boot that turned out to be superb . So do judge this vendor by this specific boot , rather decide if you want a pair of boots that make you lean forward as if you are on skis .

 I run six days a week 5 to 10 miles a day . I wear Asics Gel Kayano 's . I read about this brand and was really hoping this would be great to increase my endurance without causing fatigue in my legs . I put these on and thought I was standing on concrete . Totally stiff and hard . My right foot felt like it was rolling out just standing . I ran in them one time and finished with a shin splint ! I have not had one of those in over a year . I tried to wear them again the next day and took them off after 20 minutes , putting my old Asics on and felt relief . I can say when you switch back to a `` normal '' running shoe you can actually tell the spring was in there . But I noticed nothing different than my other shoes except discomfort . I am sending them back and not going to try them again .
 Shoe was great condition but only gave 1 star because box said 10 wide but shoe was just a 10 . . kept because fit ok .
 I ordered this bag to make a gift for a future bride . I am so disappointed with how cheap and flimsy it is . This is a small step up from the $ 1 reusable shopping bags they sell in grocery stores . I do n't think I will be giving this as a gift .
 I really love Dr. Scholls products because of their style and comfort . I was excited to receive these sandals for that reason , but was very dissapointed in the comfort . They are very high on style , but are not very comfortable like all of my other Dr. Scholls . For that reason , I can wear them for only a limited amount of time and ca n't walk around in them alot like my other Dr. Scholls and do not give them a very high rating . These shoes are supposed to be comfortable !
 I own many much pair of Clark 's shoes and this style is narrower than the average Clark shoes . The center decoration that holds the shoe upper together makes the show have less flexibility than normal Clarks . If your foot is slightlynarrorer than a medium width , this is the shoe for you .
 Pretty to look at but very uncomfortable on . Foot pulls off to side . Had a great experience with other Clarks but this was a waste of money .
 I ordered size 7.5 for myself , but did n't fit me at all . My mother in law wears size 6.5 and they fit her perfectly .
 Los zapatos llegaron en muy malas condiciones . Se podia apreciar con facilidad que los zapatos estaban usados .
 I want to return that item because I received a wrong size . Since now i did n't have a chance to contact to the seller , I hope someone can help me to change this item with the right size that I ordered . By the way I ordered size 11 and got something like size 9 .

 These sandals are advertised as having leather uppers . They do not . Shame on Amazon .
 In the description , it says `` Black is made of a leather that has a classic smooth finish '' . Imagine my surprise when the shoes arrived and saw that they have a microfiber -LRB- i.e. synthetic -RRB- upper . I tried to contact Amazon to ask if they accidentally shipped the wrong shoes . Instead , Amazon 's return system automatically sent me another pair of the same shoes and asked me to return the originals . Did n't really help my case much . Anyway , beware ... if you buy the black `` leather '' sandals , that 's not really what you 're going to get .
 There is virtually no protection from the cold . These shoes are lined with rabbit fur which matts immediately and offers little insulation . Stay with the rubber booties . These are a waste of money .

 This shoe has made my big toes cry out in pain . I wore them for two days at work several weeks ago and my toes are still hurting . It is all in the cut of the front of the shoe - it seems to become more narrow too soon . This is funny to me because I wear AAA width shoes and these were too narrow for my toes -LRB- wore their regular width shoe -RRB- !!!! They are the worst .
 These boots have 5 '' heels , and the seller described it as having 3 '' heels . It was very hard to walk in because the boots have very little to no bend . I ended up returning and getting a similar product with 3 '' heels by Pleaser .
 Personally I do n't like them ... and I changed my mind about wearing them so I am going to donate them to the church .
 These look great . I 've ordered Sorels for my kids now twice . Both times I had to send them back because they can not get their feet into them . My 5 year old is skinny with ` normal ' feet . Even if I push , shove and twist his foot , I can not get them on in a size that is probably 1/2 to a size too big . I just do n't get it . My 3 year old was the same story.I tried them again just in case the first time was a fluke , and because they LOOK so perfect ... waterproof and warm with good tread . But back they went . Sigh .
 I have the same problem one of the other reviewers mentioned
 I was looking for a sneaker with excellent support for impact and a different look . These sneakers feel like they have good shock abaorption but run small . I had to pay to return them , did want to go through the exhange game , and refund not received yet -LRB- about 2-weeks post return date -RRB- . After a month I did receive my refund .
 I have heard about rainbow sandals for years and I was very excited to finally invest in a pair of nice hemp sandals . I wear a size 10.5 so I was expecting that their size L -LRB- 9.5-10 .5 -RRB- would be a perfect fit for me . When they arrived I was disapointed to find that they were way too small . Unfortunatley , Rainbow is interested in milking their customers for every last cent and I had to pay 5 bucks to ship it back , plus 7 bucks for them to send me the next size up . Most companies I 've delt with are happy to cover shipping on returns and would gladly have exchanged my sandals for free . Now the new size is here -LRB- XL -RRB- and they are way too big ! Beware if you are on the cusp of any of the size distinctions , there will be problems ! So now to return them , I have to pay another 5 bucks . So , when i finally get the $ 40 I spent on the sandals back , it will be less $ 17 , just to deal with this company . Oh , and another thing that really rubs me the wrong way is how Rainbow markets themselves as a small eco-friendly company out of southern California , but their sandals are in fact made in China . I do not recommend dealing with this company , and in the future my money will be better spent on the several other comanies that actually produce quality , american-made , eco-friendly shoes .
 Rainbow are the most comfortable men 's sandal , but they were not the right one 's that my son wanted . But overall they are a comfortable sandal .
 I wanted some cute flip flops to wear to the carribean . I wore them there and then never again . They cut into my feet so efficiently that after wearing them for maybe 12 hours -LRB- on an off , you know , because of the pain -RRB- , I had to wear band aids on my index toes for the remained of the trip . Not even remotely worth the purchase .
 I own these shoes in 3 colors . They are the most comfortable shoe , however this particular pair is so narrow at the instep it hurt my feet to wear them . Unfortunately I had to return them .
 I first purchased Softspots Tatianna style shoes in 2008 in white and navy . The quickly became my go to shoes . I wore them everywhere and received multiple compliments . There was never a breaking in period and the cushion and heel back area was incredible comfortable . I purchased a new navy pair and a black pair earlier this year for the spring season and the quality of the shoe has changed . Not only did I get blisters and blood stains on the shoes but the material is obviously different in the heel back area . I have tried wearing them around the house to break them in but I can only take them for about 15 minutes at a time . Wish I could return shoes that do that to my feet . It is like they get your money and see you later ! Do not recommend which is too bad . Softspots were my favorite . I have switched to Born which have n't failed me and I hope they never do !
 not a fan ! Got these shoes and could n't wear them ! The soles are very hard and the straps are rough . that combo made it impossible to walk around in comfortable . I would n't recommend this at all !
 I like the style of shoes but It really troublesome for me . It get dirty so quick and hard to clean it . If I knew about it , I would n't buy it . the color of black trim will come out so easyly when it touch with water . After that , it makes the leather dirty and so hard to clean it.Just dont wear it when it is raining . Any way , I hate to clean it everytime .
 I like Vaneli styles , and I own other shoes from this company , but these were unusually cheap . They were unlined ! I looked at the other Vaneli shoes in my closet , and they are lined . The suede will certainly stretch out of shape very quickly without any type of lining . In addition , the heel plates are cheap , hard plastic . My experience with this type of heel plate is that it crack and even falls off . My other complaint is the excessive shipping charges . FootSmart charged me $ 12.99 to ship the shoes , and because I am mailing them back due to their cheap construction , they are charging me $ 6.99 more using the barcode return label . Thus I spent $ 20 to try on cheap shoes . I do n't think I will buy Vaneli online anymore , and I wo n't order from FootSmart . Many other shoe vendors charge much less or even zero -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- ! -RRB- .
 Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot , however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out .
 Life Stride is usually a winner for me but these little beaut 's hurt my toes after about an hours wear . This is very unusual for me with this brand .
 Several years ago , I had foot issues and a pair of Life Strides was the only shoe I could wear with any comfort . Since then , I rarely buy anything but Life Strides . Life Strides are comfortable from the first wear , as was this style . It looks great , very versatile , very reasonably priced .

 Nice looking boots - I got them in the mail yesterday . I wear size 11 1/2 for every other brand and can sometimes comfortably wear a size 11 , but these are waaayyyyy too tight . I am going to need to send them back for a larger size . I am going to try a size 12 , but am afraid that they 'll still be a little small .
 This shoe was not cushioned as promised and the arch placement was not comfortable , even for a wide shoe .
 I had never worn Saucony so when they were recommended , I decided to try . I ran on the store 's treadmill and they felt fine , but I really should have taken the time to run longer.They boast that there is cushion , but there is n't enough cushion -LRB- or the shoe breaks down REALLY fast -RRB- . My feet ached after I ran only about 20 miles in these shoes -LRB- I run about 3 miles at a time -RRB- . The toe box is big and too roomy for me.My advice ? Keep a journal on your activity and what your feet felt like during and after and maybe even how they feel the next day . Go to a store that knows running shoes and take your time deciding . Hoping for better luck next time .
 my 9-month-old daughter is starting day care and needs shoes . she 's a cruiser and starting to take steps with help . i thought these sneakers would provide some grip to keep her from slipping on the tile/linoleum floor but no luck . there are tiny little dots on the soles which would be fine on carpeting but unfortunately , they do nothing to keep her feet from sliding from under her on a smooth surface . adorable , but i 'm sending these back .
 I did n't like the look of the shoe - it was more appealing in the website than seeing it live - guess , that what 's you get if you are web buyer .
 The upper portion of the boots which is supposed to hug your calf is ridiculously huge . The shoe portion fit . I have relatively normal-sized calves and I was swimming in these boots . I immediately returned tham .
 I 've ordered Ked 's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality . The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $ 5 . No support , thin canvas - just junk . I 'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe . I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to . No support , no padding , more narrow , thinner canvas . I 've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference . Save your money . You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $ 5 - $ 8 , it just wo n't have a Keds tag . This is no longer the bargain it once was . Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator . What 's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe do n't even know it 's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago .
 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?
 I bought this sneaker from my Mom who has worn the same style for years . I 'm sorry to say that we were not happy with our purchase - it seems that the mold for the shoe has changed - the stitching on the top of the shoe is in a different place and does not make this a comfortable shoe for my mom .
 I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them . They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them . I will not purchase any Keds in the future .
 The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem . The shoes that arrived had been worn . I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had . He made a good offer however , I decided to wash the shoes and keep them , which I did . Now , I have an infection on my toe . Not good .
 I almost always wear a size 6 but as soon as I put these on , they hurt my feet . They are extremely narrow - returned right away .
 Well in one of the descriptive pictures the bottom of the shoe is all black ! The shoes I received were a brown rubber color on the bottom of the shoe . Also in another picture , the shoe inside is white and the shoes I received were blue inside . They are not as comfortable as a pair of keds that I owned years before .
 I ordered a pair of black and white keds and was sent a pair of plain black keds . In my opinion they are not nearly as cute as the black and white ones . Also , I ordered a narrow pair because I have really narrow feet , but the narrow pair is pretty tight on me . I ca n't imagine how they have extra narrow pairs because the narrow ones looked abnormally skinny . So be warned . I would have returned them but I had to wear them to a wedding as part of my bridesmaid outfit a week from the time they arrived . I probably will not be wearing them again and I wish I could return them for the black and white pair I had ordered .
 Do not buy ! The Keds quality has become garbage ! Much narrower , cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price !! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart . Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end .
 I ordered these Navy Keds tennis shoes for my daughter . The color shows navy , but when they arrived they looked black ... the box said navy ! Had to return because of the shade .
 These Navy blue Keds were more black than navy blue . The picture of the shoes on Amazon was very different than the one I received . I put them next to my black keds and you could not tell the difference between the navy blue and the black keds . Very disappointing .
 These shoes are not as good as they used to be . Very little support . The sole is very thin . Definetly not worth the price .
 In any shoe I ideally I wear a 7 1/2 W. I usually end up with an 8 M because there is no wide width offered . This summer I wanted canvas tennis shoes for summer and decided to try some Keds . There seems to be no consistency of sizing , however , between colors or styles , and I have had to try different colors and styles due to `` not available '' items . Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug . So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long , but wide enough . I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W -LRB- no Chambray available in 7 W -RRB- and it was waaay too short and very tight . I do n't think a size 8 W would even fit . This idea of shoes `` running small '' or `` running large '' makes no sense to me . Just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it .
 I was so disappointed with these shoes . In fact , I returned them . The quality is not that of the Ked 's that I grew up wearing !
 I bought these shoes in black to match my work uniform only to receive them in the mail to discover that they are super narrow . It 's like these shoes are designed for rabbits or something . Thankfully amazon has very easy returns . If you decide to buy these shoes online try them on first , or read the return policy .
 I bought the white leather sneakers for $ 38 at a DSW store awhile ago . Let me tell you , they do NOT last . I bought Keds hoping for a quality , practical , and stylish shoe that I could wear with anything for a few years . This is what you could expect a few years ago , that Keds were STRONG shoes . Well surprise , they barely lasted one season . The bottom sole of the shoe came unglue from the rest of the shoe , and most of the white leather chipped off leaving patches of brown . Looks terrible , no way worth my $ 40 .
 3 weeks after buying these shoes , i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined . This never happened to the cheap Target brand we bought . I have to throw them away . The insole does n't come out so I ca n't even try to bleach them .

I probably will not be wearing them again and I wish I could return them for the black and white pair I had ordered .
 Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return !!
 the style was wonderful however even tho it said 9 med it was a trifle small-thought it might be an 8 instead-win some you lose some
 I got these shoes in December and they are VERY cheap . NOT worth the money . I could have gone to a local store and paid a lot less . Additionally , the shoes I received did not look like the shoe in the photo . The shoe i received was more of a sketcher type shoe with a longer top . I would NOT recommend them to a friend or relative . They are not what i expected . the top of the shoe is already coming apart . I 've had Keds before and I do n't know if it was just this pair , but I will not buy shoes this way again .
 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .
 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 I bought my black Keds last winter . Within 6 months , there was a hole in the canvas above the toe of the left shoe . -LRB- Not because the shoe was too small , but because the canvas was extremely thin . -RRB- Also , the soles look much thicker in the photos than in reality .
 My new sneakers broke my heart ! They have been making subtle changes for the past several years . This last one was too much . I have been wearing Keds sneakers for about 60 years and absolutely loved them . Several years ago they came out with flared soles , -LRB- I said to myself , I guess I can live with that . -RRB- Then they began making the toes more pointed . Did n't really like that . What 's wrong with toe room ? Time for new ones - pictures showed the flared soles were gone -LRB- GREAT -RRB- . Ordered a pair . The toes are still too pointed , but the insole is as hard as a rock -LRB- maybe not quite -RRB- and the built in arch support was gone ! They had a perfect product and really ruined it . I could just cry . I returned my shoes and they were very kind and gave me a full refund .
 If you order these Keds sneakers today you will NOT be getting the same sneaker that has reviews from a year or more ago . Believe me , they are entirely different.Well , darn . As an almost life-long Keds wearer I can say with some authority that what I received are NOTHING like any pair of Keds sneakers I 've ever had before.Previously there was at least light arch support even in the most basic of their sneaker styles , this pair has none . The sole is stiff and clunky , the canvas fabric is thin and poor quality and they are in general , junk . No quality of any kind left in this previously reliable brand.My usual size in these is a 7 and that has always been 100 % comfortable and a perfect fit when worn with a pair of sport socks . This pair is saggy and baggy on top even when tied and the sides bagged out too.They WILL be going back.Save yourself time and aggravation and pass these by .
 Avoid doing business with Shoemall ! Check their feedback ! I 've made two orders with Shoemall and both times they do n't have my items in stock . It seems they do n't update on Amazon regularly . I 'll never buy from them again . Beware , they 'll charge & send you the accessory to an item and later contact you that the main item is out of stock . This happened to me both times I 've ordered . Really bad business practices !
 I have an old pair of these shoes that I have loved for a long time , but needed to replace . I ordered this pair and was very disappointed in the quality . I have only worn these shoes perhaps a dozen times and the sole is already coming apart . They also have this weird squeak with every step that I take . I will be replacing these , but will not purchase another Keds shoe .
 After reading some of the other reviews , I hesitated to purchase these Keds but decided to take a chance anyway . That was a mistake . The Keds that arrived the other day are nothing like I remember -LRB- and I lived in Keds for many years -RRB- . These are a very cheap version of the sturdy , supportive Keds of yesteryear that fit like a glove and lasted forever . The new ones are also quite a bit narrower , thinner , pointed in the toe , and feel like something you 'd get at a dollar store for a few bucks . Returning this product for a refund and wo n't be purchasing Keds in the future .
 I wore these about twice a week for about 5 weeks before they began splitting apart . To late too return them now so it was a waste of money . Very disappointed in the quality . I wore Keds for years and never had any problems with quality . Will not buy this brand again .

 I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them . Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable . Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now . Some stuff should be left in the 80s !!
 They sent the wrong color LEDs , I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked .
 Even though I ordered my normal size , these shoes pinched my toes painfully . I ended up throwing them in a donation box .
 The shoes were an amazing fit , but when I washed them -- in cold water , I might add -- the blue dye from the soles bled out onto the white canvas . Perhaps , it will wash away next time , but I was more than miffed .
 Not only is the canvas cheap & lightweight , it has a bluish tinge to it . The tongue of the shoe is only sewn halfway ... i.e. , the inside is merely the raw cut . The first time I washed them -LRB- in cold water -RRB- , the blue dye from the inside bled thru to the white upper . Very disappointed in what was formerly a great basic sneaker ... I suppose Keds has succombed to the Chinese influence . Very sad indeed .
 I bought these in both white and stone . I really like the stone , as it does n't seem to stand out as much as the white . Also , it 's a nice change from white all the time . My mom liked the stone color when she saw mine , so I ordered a pair for her as well.We 've noticed there is a change in the way Keds have been made since the 90s . They are not as comfortable . The arch can be `` bumpy '' or nonexistent , and they run a little small . I wear a size 8 , and the stone pair are tight on me . Tighter than the white for some reason . I 'm sure they will get better as they break in , but I 've never had a pair of Keds that is this tight . My feet actually hurt the first day I wore them . That never happened to me with Keds . And I have narrow feet . Someone with a wider foot could n't wear these comfortably , at all . The sneakers also do n't last as long as they used to . I wore Keds a lot when I was in high school , and one pair would last me a long time . Now , I notice the edges at the bottom of the shoes start to come apart with much less wear , and the footbed becomes very flat and uncomfortable . They do n't feel as cushiony as they used to , even when brand new . Very different . Wearable , and I like them , but they are not as good as they used to be . I suspect they were not made in China a decade + ago . I think they are made smaller than they used to be , because even looking at my feet while wearing them , I noticed they make my feet look smaller . I like that , but , not at the expense of comfort . I might try an 8 1/2 next time . The white fit better for some reason , not so small.Update
 I have worn Keds sneakers for many years , always ordering size 6.5 . The label in the sneaker and the box are labeled 6.5 , but this sneaker is at most size 5 , or it is a child 's sneaker.Very disappointed .
 Eh . I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap , but I should have paid more attention to the reviews . The quality is way low with these shoes . They 're super uncomfortable and make your toes feel like they 're packed in sardines . -LRB- And I have really small feet - I 'm a women 's 5.5 -RRB- Now that I see them on my feet , they do n't even look that cute . Anyone who buys KEDS for the first time ONLINE should realize that they are exactly what they seem
 The shipping cost was less than what it would have cost me in gas to go the store to buy

I will be replacing these , but will not purchase another Keds shoe .
 After reading some of the other reviews , I hesitated to purchase these Keds but decided to take a chance anyway . That was a mistake . The Keds that arrived the other day are nothing like I remember -LRB- and I lived in Keds for many years -RRB- . These are a very cheap version of the sturdy , supportive Keds of yesteryear that fit like a glove and lasted forever . The new ones are also quite a bit narrower , thinner , pointed in the toe , and feel like something you 'd get at a dollar store for a few bucks . Returning this product for a refund and wo n't be purchasing Keds in the future .
 I wore these about twice a week for about 5 weeks before they began splitting apart . To late too return them now so it was a waste of money . Very disappointed in the quality . I wore Keds for years and never had any problems with quality . Will not buy this brand again .
 Avoid doing business with Shoemall ! Check their feedback ! I 've made two orders with Shoemall and both times they do n't have my items in stock . It seems they do n't update on Amazon regularly . I 'll never buy from them again . Beware , they 'll charge & send you the accessory to an item and later contact you that the main item is out of stock . This happened to me both times I 've ordered . Really bad business practices !
 Well in one of the descriptive pictures the bottom of the shoe is all black ! The shoes I received were a brown rubber color on the bottom of the shoe . Also in another picture , the shoe inside is white and the shoes I received were blue inside . They are not as comfortable as a pair of keds that I owned years before .
 I ordered a pair of black and white keds and was sent a pair of plain black keds . In my opinion they are not nearly as cute as the black and white ones . Also , I ordered a narrow pair because I have really narrow feet , but the narrow pair is pretty tight on me . I ca n't imagine how they have extra narrow pairs because the narrow ones looked abnormally skinny . So be warned . I would have returned them but I had to wear them to a wedding as part of my bridesmaid outfit a week from the time they arrived . I probably will not be wearing them again and I wish I could return them for the black and white pair I had ordered .
 Do not buy ! The Keds quality has become garbage ! Much narrower , cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price !! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart . Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end .
 The shoes were an amazing fit , but when I washed them -- in cold water , I might add -- the blue dye from the soles bled out onto the white canvas . Perhaps , it will wash away next time , but I was more than miffed .
 Not only is the canvas cheap & lightweight , it has a bluish tinge to it . The tongue of the shoe is only sewn halfway ... i.e. , the inside is merely the raw cut . The first time I washed them -LRB- in cold water -RRB- , the blue dye from the inside bled thru to the white upper . Very disappointed in what was formerly a great basic sneaker ... I suppose Keds has succombed to the Chinese influence . Very sad indeed .
 I bought these in both white and stone . I really like the stone , as it does n't seem to stand out as much as the white . Also , it 's a nice change from white all the time . My mom liked the stone color when she saw mine , so I ordered a pair for her as well.We 've noticed there is a change in the way Keds have been made since the 90s . They are not as comfortable . The arch can be `` bumpy '' or nonexistent , and they run a little small . I wear a size 8 , and the stone pair are tight on me . Tighter than the white for some reason . I 'm sure they will get better as they break in , but I 've never had a pair of Keds that is this tight . My feet actually hurt the first day I wore them . That never happened to me with Keds . And I have narrow feet . Someone with a wider foot could n't wear these comfortably , at all . The sneakers also do n't last as long as they used to . I wore Keds a lot when I was in high school , and one pair would last me a long time . Now , I notice the edges at the bottom of the shoes start to come apart with much less wear , and the footbed becomes very flat and uncomfortable . They do n't feel as cushiony as they used to , even when brand new . Very different . Wearable , and I like them , but they are not as good as they used to be . I suspect they were not made in China a decade + ago . I think they are made smaller than they used to be , because even looking at my feet while wearing them , I noticed they make my feet look smaller . I like that , but , not at the expense of comfort . I might try an 8 1/2 next time . The white fit better for some reason , not so small.Update
 I have worn Keds sneakers for many years , always ordering size 6.5 . The label in the sneaker and the box are labeled 6.5 , but this sneaker is at most size 5 , or it is a child 's sneaker.Very disappointed .
 I ordered these Navy Keds tennis shoes for my daughter . The color shows navy , but when they arrived they looked black ... the box said navy ! Had to return because of the shade .
 These Navy blue Keds were more black than navy blue . The picture of the shoes on Amazon was very different than the one I received . I put them next to my black keds and you could not tell the difference between the navy blue and the black keds . Very disappointing .
 I 've ordered Ked 's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality . The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $ 5 . No support , thin canvas - just junk . I 'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe . I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to . No support , no padding , more narrow , thinner canvas . I 've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference . Save your money . You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $ 5 - $ 8 , it just wo n't have a Keds tag . This is no longer the bargain it once was . Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator . What 's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe do n't even know it 's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago .
 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?
 I bought this sneaker from my Mom who has worn the same style for years . I 'm sorry to say that we were not happy with our purchase - it seems that the mold for the shoe has changed - the stitching on the top of the shoe is in a different place and does not make this a comfortable shoe for my mom .
 I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them . They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them . I will not purchase any Keds in the future .
 The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem . The shoes that arrived had been worn . I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had . He made a good offer however , I decided to wash the shoes and keep them , which I did . Now , I have an infection on my toe . Not good .
 They sent the wrong color LEDs , I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked .
 Even though I ordered my normal size , these shoes pinched my toes painfully . I ended up throwing them in a donation box .
 I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them . Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable . Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now . Some stuff should be left in the 80s !!
 Eh . I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap , but I should have paid more attention to the reviews . The quality is way low with these shoes . They 're super uncomfortable and make your toes feel like they 're packed in sardines . -LRB- And I have really small feet - I 'm a women 's 5.5 -RRB- Now that I see them on my feet , they do n't even look that cute . Anyone who buys KEDS for the first time ONLINE should realize that they are exactly what they seem
 The shipping cost was less than what it would have cost me in gas to go the store to buy
 I got these shoes in December and they are VERY cheap . NOT worth the money . I could have gone to a local store and paid a lot less . Additionally , the shoes I received did not look like the shoe in the photo . The shoe i received was more of a sketcher type shoe with a longer top . I would NOT recommend them to a friend or relative . They are not what i expected . the top of the shoe is already coming apart . I 've had Keds before and I do n't know if it was just this pair , but I will not buy shoes this way again .
 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .
 In any shoe I ideally I wear a 7 1/2 W. I usually end up with an 8 M because there is no wide width offered . This summer I wanted canvas tennis shoes for summer and decided to try some Keds . There seems to be no consistency of sizing , however , between colors or styles , and I have had to try different colors and styles due to `` not available '' items . Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug . So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long , but wide enough . I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W -LRB- no Chambray available in 7 W -RRB- and it was waaay too short and very tight . I do n't think a size 8 W would even fit . This idea of shoes `` running small '' or `` running large '' makes no sense to me . Just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it .
 I was so disappointed with these shoes . In fact , I returned them . The quality is not that of the Ked 's that I grew up wearing !
 I bought these shoes in black to match my work uniform only to receive them in the mail to discover that they are super narrow . It 's like these shoes are designed for rabbits or something . Thankfully amazon has very easy returns . If you decide to buy these shoes online try them on first , or read the return policy .
 I bought the white leather sneakers for $ 38 at a DSW store awhile ago . Let me tell you , they do NOT last . I bought Keds hoping for a quality , practical , and stylish shoe that I could wear with anything for a few years . This is what you could expect a few years ago , that Keds were STRONG shoes . Well surprise , they barely lasted one season . The bottom sole of the shoe came unglue from the rest of the shoe , and most of the white leather chipped off leaving patches of brown . Looks terrible , no way worth my $ 40 .
 3 weeks after buying these shoes , i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined . This never happened to the cheap Target brand we bought . I have to throw them away . The insole does n't come out so I ca n't even try to bleach them .
 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 I almost always wear a size 6 but as soon as I put these on , they hurt my feet . They are extremely narrow - returned right away .

 Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return !!
 the style was wonderful however even tho it said 9 med it was a trifle small-thought it might be an 8 instead-win some you lose some
 Well in one of the descriptive pictures the bottom of the shoe is all black ! The shoes I received were a brown rubber color on the bottom of the shoe .

 I bought my black Keds last winter . Within 6 months , there was a hole in the canvas above the toe of the left shoe . -LRB- Not because the shoe was too small , but because the canvas was extremely thin . -RRB- Also , the soles look much thicker in the photos than in reality .
 My new sneakers broke my heart ! They have been making subtle changes for the past several years . This last one was too much . I have been wearing Keds sneakers for about 60 years and absolutely loved them . Several years ago they came out with flared soles , -LRB- I said to myself , I guess I can live with that . -RRB- Then they began making the toes more pointed . Did n't really like that . What 's wrong with toe room ? Time for new ones - pictures showed the flared soles were gone -LRB- GREAT -RRB- . Ordered a pair . The toes are still too pointed , but the insole is as hard as a rock -LRB- maybe not quite -RRB- and the built in arch support was gone ! They had a perfect product and really ruined it . I could just cry . I returned my shoes and they were very kind and gave me a full refund .
 If you order these Keds sneakers today you will NOT be getting the same sneaker that has reviews from a year or more ago . Believe me , they are entirely different.Well , darn . As an almost life-long Keds wearer I can say with some authority that what I received are NOTHING like any pair of Keds sneakers I 've ever had before.Previously there was at least light arch support even in the most basic of their sneaker styles , this pair has none . The sole is stiff and clunky , the canvas fabric is thin and poor quality and they are in general , junk . No quality of any kind left in this previously reliable brand.My usual size in these is a 7 and that has always been 100 % comfortable and a perfect fit when worn with a pair of sport socks . This pair is saggy and baggy on top even when tied and the sides bagged out too.They WILL be going back.Save yourself time and aggravation and pass these by .

 I was n't looking for a good walking shoe , just a specific look ; -LRB- surprisingly hard to find simple plain blue sneakers -RRB- . Since newer reviews seemed generally positive , I thought I would take a shot . Unfortunately , these are n't acceptable even for light use . Very tight and feel like cardboard . Note
 The upper portion of the boots which is supposed to hug your calf is ridiculously huge . The shoe portion fit . I have relatively normal-sized calves and I was swimming in these boots . I immediately returned tham .

 I owned a pair of Doc Martens for 10 years and when they gave out I ordered this pair . Unlike my last pair , these were extremely uncomfortable . I could n't wear them without pain , so I returned them .
 shoe size was wrong , felt like the shoes were seconds . Sent them back for a replacement , or refund on the 26th of Dec. today is the 19th of Jan. and still have not received any new shoes , or heard from anyone via , e-mail , or phone . Customer service sucks since they already received payment from credit card . But the shoes look really nice ... if they fit anyone from america ??

This happened to me both times I 've ordered . Really bad business practices !
 I have an old pair of these shoes that I have loved for a long time , but needed to replace . I ordered this pair and was very disappointed in the quality . I have only worn these shoes perhaps a dozen times and the sole is already coming apart . They also have this weird squeak with every step that I take . I will be replacing these , but will not purchase another Keds shoe .
 After reading some of the other reviews , I hesitated to purchase these Keds but decided to take a chance anyway . That was a mistake . The Keds that arrived the other day are nothing like I remember -LRB- and I lived in Keds for many years -RRB- . These are a very cheap version of the sturdy , supportive Keds of yesteryear that fit like a glove and lasted forever . The new ones are also quite a bit narrower , thinner , pointed in the toe , and feel like something you 'd get at a dollar store for a few bucks . Returning this product for a refund and wo n't be purchasing Keds in the future .
 I wore these about twice a week for about 5 weeks before they began splitting apart . To late too return them now so it was a waste of money . Very disappointed in the quality . I wore Keds for years and never had any problems with quality . Will not buy this brand again .

 These Navy blue Keds were more black than navy blue . The picture of the shoes on Amazon was very different than the one I received . I put them next to my black keds and you could not tell the difference between the navy blue and the black keds . Very disappointing .
 I ordered these Navy Keds tennis shoes for my daughter . The color shows navy , but when they arrived they looked black ... the box said navy ! Had to return because of the shade .
 Do not buy ! The Keds quality has become garbage ! Much narrower , cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price !! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart . Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end .
 I almost always wear a size 6 but as soon as I put these on , they hurt my feet . They are extremely narrow - returned right away .
 Well in one of the descriptive pictures the bottom of the shoe is all black ! The shoes I received were a brown rubber color on the bottom of the shoe . Also in another picture , the shoe inside is white and the shoes I received were blue inside . They are not as comfortable as a pair of keds that I owned years before .
 I ordered a pair of black and white keds and was sent a pair of plain black keds . In my opinion they are not nearly as cute as the black and white ones . Also , I ordered a narrow pair because I have really narrow feet , but the narrow pair is pretty tight on me . I ca n't imagine how they have extra narrow pairs because the narrow ones looked abnormally skinny . So be warned . I would have returned them but I had to wear them to a wedding as part of my bridesmaid outfit a week from the time they arrived . I probably will not be wearing them again and I wish I could return them for the black and white pair I had ordered .
 3 weeks after buying these shoes , i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined . This never happened to the cheap Target brand we bought . I have to throw them away . The insole does n't come out so I ca n't even try to bleach them .
 In any shoe I ideally I wear a 7 1/2 W. I usually end up with an 8 M because there is no wide width offered . This summer I wanted canvas tennis shoes for summer and decided to try some Keds . There seems to be no consistency of sizing , however , between colors or styles , and I have had to try different colors and styles due to `` not available '' items . Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug . So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long , but wide enough . I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W -LRB- no Chambray available in 7 W -RRB- and it was waaay too short and very tight . I do n't think a size 8 W would even fit . This idea of shoes `` running small '' or `` running large '' makes no sense to me . Just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it .
 I was so disappointed with these shoes . In fact , I returned them . The quality is not that of the Ked 's that I grew up wearing !
 I bought these shoes in black to match my work uniform only to receive them in the mail to discover that they are super narrow . It 's like these shoes are designed for rabbits or something . Thankfully amazon has very easy returns . If you decide to buy these shoes online try them on first , or read the return policy .
 I bought the white leather sneakers for $ 38 at a DSW store awhile ago . Let me tell you , they do NOT last . I bought Keds hoping for a quality , practical , and stylish shoe that I could wear with anything for a few years . This is what you could expect a few years ago , that Keds were STRONG shoes . Well surprise , they barely lasted one season . The bottom sole of the shoe came unglue from the rest of the shoe , and most of the white leather chipped off leaving patches of brown . Looks terrible , no way worth my $ 40 .
 Eh . I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap , but I should have paid more attention to the reviews . The quality is way low with these shoes . They 're super uncomfortable and make your toes feel like they 're packed in sardines . -LRB- And I have really small feet - I 'm a women 's 5.5 -RRB- Now that I see them on my feet , they do n't even look that cute . Anyone who buys KEDS for the first time ONLINE should realize that they are exactly what they seem
 The shipping cost was less than what it would have cost me in gas to go the store to buy
 Even though I ordered my normal size , these shoes pinched my toes painfully . I ended up throwing them in a donation box .
 They sent the wrong color LEDs , I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked .
 I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them . Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable . Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now . Some stuff should be left in the 80s !!
 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 I bought this sneaker from my Mom who has worn the same style for years . I 'm sorry to say that we were not happy with our purchase - it seems that the mold for the shoe has changed - the stitching on the top of the shoe is in a different place and does not make this a comfortable shoe for my mom .
 I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them . They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them . I will not purchase any Keds in the future .
 The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem . The shoes that arrived had been worn . I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had . He made a good offer however , I decided to wash the shoes and keep them , which I did . Now , I have an infection on my toe . Not good .
 I 've ordered Ked 's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality . The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $ 5 . No support , thin canvas - just junk . I 'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe . I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to . No support , no padding , more narrow , thinner canvas . I 've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference . Save your money . You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $ 5 - $ 8 , it just wo n't have a Keds tag . This is no longer the bargain it once was . Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator . What 's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe do n't even know it 's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago .
 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?
 I got these shoes in December and they are VERY cheap . NOT worth the money . I could have gone to a local store and paid a lot less . Additionally , the shoes I received did not look like the shoe in the photo . The shoe i received was more of a sketcher type shoe with a longer top . I would NOT recommend them to a friend or relative . They are not what i expected . the top of the shoe is already coming apart . I 've had Keds before and I do n't know if it was just this pair , but I will not buy shoes this way again .
 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .

 I bought my black Keds last winter . Within 6 months , there was a hole in the canvas above the toe of the left shoe . -LRB- Not because the shoe was too small , but because the canvas was extremely thin . -RRB- Also , the soles look much thicker in the photos than in reality .
 My new sneakers broke my heart ! They have been making subtle changes for the past several years . This last one was too much . I have been wearing Keds sneakers for about 60 years and absolutely loved them . Several years ago they came out with flared soles , -LRB- I said to myself , I guess I can live with that . -RRB- Then they began making the toes more pointed . Did n't really like that . What 's wrong with toe room ? Time for new ones - pictures showed the flared soles were gone -LRB- GREAT -RRB- . Ordered a pair . The toes are still too pointed , but the insole is as hard as a rock -LRB- maybe not quite -RRB- and the built in arch support was gone ! They had a perfect product and really ruined it . I could just cry . I returned my shoes and they were very kind and gave me a full refund .
 If you order these Keds sneakers today you will NOT be getting the same sneaker that has reviews from a year or more ago . Believe me , they are entirely different.Well , darn . As an almost life-long Keds wearer I can say with some authority that what I received are NOTHING like any pair of Keds sneakers I 've ever had before.Previously there was at least light arch support even in the most basic of their sneaker styles , this pair has none . The sole is stiff and clunky , the canvas fabric is thin and poor quality and they are in general , junk . No quality of any kind left in this previously reliable brand.My usual size in these is a 7 and that has always been 100 % comfortable and a perfect fit when worn with a pair of sport socks . This pair is saggy and baggy on top even when tied and the sides bagged out too.They WILL be going back.Save yourself time and aggravation and pass these by .

 These shoes are not as good as they used to be . Very little support . The sole is very thin . Definetly not worth the price .
 The shoes were an amazing fit , but when I washed them -- in cold water , I might add -- the blue dye from the soles bled out onto the white canvas . Perhaps , it will wash away next time , but I was more than miffed .
 Not only is the canvas cheap & lightweight , it has a bluish tinge to it . The tongue of the shoe is only sewn halfway ... i.e. , the inside is merely the raw cut . The first time I washed them -LRB- in cold water -RRB- , the blue dye from the inside bled thru to the white upper . Very disappointed in what was formerly a great basic sneaker ... I suppose Keds has succombed to the Chinese influence . Very sad indeed .
 I bought these in both white and stone . I really like the stone , as it does n't seem to stand out as much as the white . Also , it 's a nice change from white all the time . My mom liked the stone color when she saw mine , so I ordered a pair for her as well.We 've noticed there is a change in the way Keds have been made since the 90s . They are not as comfortable . The arch can be `` bumpy '' or nonexistent , and they run a little small . I wear a size 8 , and the stone pair are tight on me . Tighter than the white for some reason . I 'm sure they will get better as they break in , but I 've never had a pair of Keds that is this tight . My feet actually hurt the first day I wore them . That never happened to me with Keds . And I have narrow feet . Someone with a wider foot could n't wear these comfortably , at all . The sneakers also do n't last as long as they used to . I wore Keds a lot when I was in high school , and one pair would last me a long time . Now , I notice the edges at the bottom of the shoes start to come apart with much less wear , and the footbed becomes very flat and uncomfortable . They do n't feel as cushiony as they used to , even when brand new . Very different . Wearable , and I like them , but they are not as good as they used to be . I suspect they were not made in China a decade + ago . I think they are made smaller than they used to be , because even looking at my feet while wearing them , I noticed they make my feet look smaller . I like that , but , not at the expense of comfort . I might try an 8 1/2 next time . The white fit better for some reason , not so small.Update
 I have worn Keds sneakers for many years , always ordering size 6.5 . The label in the sneaker and the box are labeled 6.5 , but this sneaker is at most size 5 , or it is a child 's sneaker.Very disappointed .
 Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return !!
 the style was wonderful however even tho it said 9 med it was a trifle small-thought it might be an 8 instead-win some you lose some

 I always wanted Keen boots , but all seem to be too short from back to front . Larger sizes of this boot were way too wide , but still too short . It is better to try on at the store .
 I have owned 4 pairs of Keens work boots , spanning a period of years . I recently purchases a pair of their California boots , and this is the current state of their design , manufacturing -- and their Company 's INTEGRITY . Let me also say that over the years I considered Keen 's a quality product . Here is why i no longer believe that : The second time I laced them on , the metallic cast grommet at the top of the lace panel snapped , simply by applying light pressure from the lace . No biggie , right ? That small manufacturing flaw meant the boots could never lace again properly . THE MAJOR DESIGN FLAW in this boot -LRB- II have an engineering background , and in a 34 year career have designed products across a wide range , so I KNOW about design ... -RRB- is simply that every boot has a tongue , and that tongue should be connected to the boot securely by a gusset , which holds the tongue in place under the laces -- and also prevents water from entering the boot and soaking your foot . The designer of this shoe , forgot all about that , as did the company 's design supervisor . This boot got made on a totally LOUSY , flawed design . At M.I.T. , we would call that last sentence ` product assessment ` We just got done with a big hurricane is my town , and I have spent 6 consecutive days , 12 hours / day on average , on different cleanup assignment . The 2 days on which I wore these boots -LRB- you need to rotate your boots under wear and work ... -RRB- -- well , on those 2 days my feet got soaked . After the first time , i applied weatherproof goo , highly effective at waterproofing leather . After the second day of totally wet feet , I made another discovery -- the boots actually leaked water through the top of the synthetic sole , rightnwhere it attachednto the leather . This is an enormous quality control flaw.So , with these plain fact I called the company 's Customer Service -LRB- I have contacted the 3 times in the past week -RRB- asking them for a return authorization -LRB- Amazon , LlL Bean -- any company with any integrity -- would do this instantly . But Keen flat out Refused -- and the customer service person was extremely snide , and had a thick , in my opinion conceited and lazy -- ATTITUDE . To date , I have had no response whatsoever -- from 3 follow-up emails.To may knowledge , the hurricane did not strike Portland , Oregon . What did seem to strike Portland was a complete refusal to take any responsibility to badly flawed design , third-rate materials , no quality control in Manufacturing , and a Corporate stone wall . I define responsibilty very simply
 Have purchased this exact shoe before and had no problems but barely one month later this pair is falling apart . To make matters worse , we are past the 30 day return window so I 'm stuck with them . Have tried to speak with customer service at Amazon to see if I have other options , but can not find any contact information on this site . What a pain.Updated Review
 Had the sole coming apart after 155 miles of trail . Used super glue to hold them together for another section of the AT . Keen , you got ta be kidding me ! Everything else about the boot is fine , but to lose it 's basic function on account of glue ? Just stupid !
 I found these boots to be extremely comfortable straight out of the box . Bought them for a honeymoon trip to NZ and needed something that would tackle all terrain.Problem came on day two in the wet , quite honestly leather soles would have been more useful . They have NO grip in the wet whatsoever and both my wife and I fell several times just walking on a pavement -LRB- sidewalk -RRB- It was not as though we were climbing a mountain ! They are so dangerous in the wet that I have to suggest that people utterly avoid these shoes , I have the bruises all over my legs and arms to prove how bad they are . If I can find a replacement , these are going in the trash
 These boots are comfortable and lightweight , however they are not waterproof . If you are hiking off pavement avoid these boots.Walking 15 minutes in heavy dew resulted in soaked socks in both my boots . I was actually able to ring water out of my socks ! For the rest of the day I had to put up with wet feet which certainly detracted from my hiking experience.I would strongly recommend against purchasing these boots if you plan to do any hiking especially in the back country .
 I 've been wearing these boots in the snow and mud . The front ends -LRB- toe ends -RRB- of the shoes are wet inside after walking in the snow for several miles . I do n't agree with the Keen website that says , `` The shoe is revamped with the KEEN.DRY waterproof breathable membrane to keep your feet dry and comfortable '' nor do I agree with the amazon.com description above that there is a `` waterproof barrier '' . These boots are not waterproof . -LRB- My previous boots had Goretex lining and they were waterproof . -RRB- I bought a bigger size than usual . From the Keen website
 I bought these shoes at a national outdoor store chain 9 days ago . I 've worn them everyday since and I must say they are extremely comfortable . Nice wide toebox , secure lacing system , very waterproof and breathable , aggressive lugs on the sole ... It 's just too bad the sole wo n't stay on . NINE DAYS . That 's it . That 's all I got to wear them before the outsole started separating from the midsole like many of the other reviewers reported.Luckily , the store is nearby , and I was able to walk in and return them . They had one more pair in my size , and I was going to wear the new ones home ... Except I could n't lace them up . The top left shoelace hook on one of these Targhee mids was manufactured BACKWARDS . The hook was facing the front of the shoe , making them impossible to tie.The store offered a refund or exchange for another half size up which was too big . Since I was already 0 for 2 on these Chinese-made Keens , I went with a German-made boot at a $ 75 premium . Here 's hoping for a boot that 'll last more than a week , eh ?
 I have had two pairs of Keen sandals over the years and loved them so I thought I would try a pair of their boots . I do n't wear them a ton , just doing yard work and at the RC track . In short order I found out they are NOT waterproof . Both my feet get wet in the same place on both boots ... right in the corners where the last eyelets are . One of the boots also has a lug that came unglued and flops around now . Since Keen has gone big it appears their quality has gone in the wrong direction . I wo n't buy another pair of Keen anything .
 I got these shoes in December and they are VERY cheap . NOT worth the money . I could have gone to a local store and paid a lot less .

The arch can be `` bumpy '' or nonexistent , and they run a little small . I wear a size 8 , and the stone pair are tight on me . Tighter than the white for some reason . I 'm sure they will get better as they break in , but I 've never had a pair of Keds that is this tight . My feet actually hurt the first day I wore them . That never happened to me with Keds . And I have narrow feet . Someone with a wider foot could n't wear these comfortably , at all . The sneakers also do n't last as long as they used to . I wore Keds a lot when I was in high school , and one pair would last me a long time . Now , I notice the edges at the bottom of the shoes start to come apart with much less wear , and the footbed becomes very flat and uncomfortable . They do n't feel as cushiony as they used to , even when brand new . Very different . Wearable , and I like them , but they are not as good as they used to be . I suspect they were not made in China a decade + ago . I think they are made smaller than they used to be , because even looking at my feet while wearing them , I noticed they make my feet look smaller . I like that , but , not at the expense of comfort . I might try an 8 1/2 next time . The white fit better for some reason , not so small.Update
 Even though I ordered my normal size , these shoes pinched my toes painfully . I ended up throwing them in a donation box .
 I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them . Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable . Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now . Some stuff should be left in the 80s !!
 I bought my black Keds last winter . Within 6 months , there was a hole in the canvas above the toe of the left shoe . -LRB- Not because the shoe was too small , but because the canvas was extremely thin . -RRB- Also , the soles look much thicker in the photos than in reality .
 My new sneakers broke my heart ! They have been making subtle changes for the past several years . This last one was too much . I have been wearing Keds sneakers for about 60 years and absolutely loved them . Several years ago they came out with flared soles , -LRB- I said to myself , I guess I can live with that . -RRB- Then they began making the toes more pointed . Did n't really like that . What 's wrong with toe room ? Time for new ones - pictures showed the flared soles were gone -LRB- GREAT -RRB- . Ordered a pair . The toes are still too pointed , but the insole is as hard as a rock -LRB- maybe not quite -RRB- and the built in arch support was gone ! They had a perfect product and really ruined it . I could just cry . I returned my shoes and they were very kind and gave me a full refund .
 If you order these Keds sneakers today you will NOT be getting the same sneaker that has reviews from a year or more ago . Believe me , they are entirely different.Well , darn . As an almost life-long Keds wearer I can say with some authority that what I received are NOTHING like any pair of Keds sneakers I 've ever had before.Previously there was at least light arch support even in the most basic of their sneaker styles , this pair has none . The sole is stiff and clunky , the canvas fabric is thin and poor quality and they are in general , junk . No quality of any kind left in this previously reliable brand.My usual size in these is a 7 and that has always been 100 % comfortable and a perfect fit when worn with a pair of sport socks . This pair is saggy and baggy on top even when tied and the sides bagged out too.They WILL be going back.Save yourself time and aggravation and pass these by .
 Avoid doing business with Shoemall ! Check their feedback ! I 've made two orders with Shoemall and both times they do n't have my items in stock . It seems they do n't update on Amazon regularly . I 'll never buy from them again . Beware , they 'll charge & send you the accessory to an item and later contact you that the main item is out of stock . This happened to me both times I 've ordered . Really bad business practices !
 I have an old pair of these shoes that I have loved for a long time , but needed to replace . I ordered this pair and was very disappointed in the quality . I have only worn these shoes perhaps a dozen times and the sole is already coming apart . They also have this weird squeak with every step that I take . I will be replacing these , but will not purchase another Keds shoe .
 After reading some of the other reviews , I hesitated to purchase these Keds but decided to take a chance anyway . That was a mistake . The Keds that arrived the other day are nothing like I remember -LRB- and I lived in Keds for many years -RRB- . These are a very cheap version of the sturdy , supportive Keds of yesteryear that fit like a glove and lasted forever . The new ones are also quite a bit narrower , thinner , pointed in the toe , and feel like something you 'd get at a dollar store for a few bucks . Returning this product for a refund and wo n't be purchasing Keds in the future .
 I wore these about twice a week for about 5 weeks before they began splitting apart . To late too return them now so it was a waste of money . Very disappointed in the quality . I wore Keds for years and never had any problems with quality . Will not buy this brand again .

 Eh . I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap , but I should have paid more attention to the reviews . The quality is way low with these shoes . They 're super uncomfortable and make your toes feel like they 're packed in sardines . -LRB- And I have really small feet - I 'm a women 's 5.5 -RRB- Now that I see them on my feet , they do n't even look that cute . Anyone who buys KEDS for the first time ONLINE should realize that they are exactly what they seem
 The shipping cost was less than what it would have cost me in gas to go the store to buy
 3 weeks after buying these shoes , i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined . This never happened to the cheap Target brand we bought . I have to throw them away . The insole does n't come out so I ca n't even try to bleach them .
 In any shoe I ideally I wear a 7 1/2 W. I usually end up with an 8 M because there is no wide width offered . This summer I wanted canvas tennis shoes for summer and decided to try some Keds . There seems to be no consistency of sizing , however , between colors or styles , and I have had to try different colors and styles due to `` not available '' items . Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug . So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long , but wide enough . I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W -LRB- no Chambray available in 7 W -RRB- and it was waaay too short and very tight . I do n't think a size 8 W would even fit . This idea of shoes `` running small '' or `` running large '' makes no sense to me . Just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it .
 I was so disappointed with these shoes . In fact , I returned them . The quality is not that of the Ked 's that I grew up wearing !
 I bought these shoes in black to match my work uniform only to receive them in the mail to discover that they are super narrow . It 's like these shoes are designed for rabbits or something . Thankfully amazon has very easy returns . If you decide to buy these shoes online try them on first , or read the return policy .
 I bought the white leather sneakers for $ 38 at a DSW store awhile ago . Let me tell you , they do NOT last . I bought Keds hoping for a quality , practical , and stylish shoe that I could wear with anything for a few years . This is what you could expect a few years ago , that Keds were STRONG shoes . Well surprise , they barely lasted one season . The bottom sole of the shoe came unglue from the rest of the shoe , and most of the white leather chipped off leaving patches of brown . Looks terrible , no way worth my $ 40 .
 I almost always wear a size 6 but as soon as I put these on , they hurt my feet . They are extremely narrow - returned right away .
 Do not buy ! The Keds quality has become garbage ! Much narrower , cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price !! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart . Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end .
 I ordered these Navy Keds tennis shoes for my daughter . The color shows navy , but when they arrived they looked black ... the box said navy ! Had to return because of the shade .
 These Navy blue Keds were more black than navy blue . The picture of the shoes on Amazon was very different than the one I received . I put them next to my black keds and you could not tell the difference between the navy blue and the black keds . Very disappointing .
 These shoes are not as good as they used to be . Very little support . The sole is very thin . Definetly not worth the price .
 I bought this sneaker from my Mom who has worn the same style for years . I 'm sorry to say that we were not happy with our purchase - it seems that the mold for the shoe has changed - the stitching on the top of the shoe is in a different place and does not make this a comfortable shoe for my mom .
 I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them . They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them . I will not purchase any Keds in the future .
 The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem . The shoes that arrived had been worn . I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had . He made a good offer however , I decided to wash the shoes and keep them , which I did . Now , I have an infection on my toe . Not good .
 I 've ordered Ked 's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality . The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $ 5 . No support , thin canvas - just junk . I 'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe . I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to . No support , no padding , more narrow , thinner canvas . I 've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference . Save your money . You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $ 5 - $ 8 , it just wo n't have a Keds tag . This is no longer the bargain it once was . Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator . What 's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe do n't even know it 's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago .
 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?
 Well in one of the descriptive pictures the bottom of the shoe is all black ! The shoes I received were a brown rubber color on the bottom of the shoe . Also in another picture , the shoe inside is white and the shoes I received were blue inside . They are not as comfortable as a pair of keds that I owned years before .
 I ordered a pair of black and white keds and was sent a pair of plain black keds . In my opinion they are not nearly as cute as the black and white ones . Also , I ordered a narrow pair because I have really narrow feet , but the narrow pair is pretty tight on me . I ca n't imagine how they have extra narrow pairs because the narrow ones looked abnormally skinny . So be warned . I would have returned them but I had to wear them to a wedding as part of my bridesmaid outfit a week from the time they arrived . I probably will not be wearing them again and I wish I could return them for the black and white pair I had ordered .
 Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return !!
 the style was wonderful however even tho it said 9 med it was a trifle small-thought it might be an 8 instead-win some you lose some
 They are a little stiff , should have smoother edges around the area you slide you foot in . Not very comfortable .
 Waiting a half hour for ONE pair of shoes , And after that ordeal they only have a display model that 's been worn by some dirty persons foot . Not to mention it being stretched out half a size ... Unbelievable that such things could come from a business environment . Oh and since you ca n't understand those Nigerians I asked someone else for help and got repremanded for trying to find someone with comprehensible english speaking skills . OVER ALL DONT SHOP THERE DONT WASTE YOUR TIME -LRB- 30 + mins -RRB- OR MONEY ...
 I 've had a number of pairs of Docs over the years , all either 8-eyelet or 6-eyelet padded boots . My last pair of brit-made 6-eyelet boots are 5-6 years old , and getting pretty beat up from bartending in them 5 nights a week for years . I picked up a new pair , and did n't really inspect them much before I bought them , as I 'd owned several pairs before , knew they 'd all fit the same after a little breaking-in , and I was in a hurry.Wearing them the first day , I thought they were awfully tight , but figured they just needed to be worn in a little . At the end of the day , though , my feet hurt - a first for me with docs . So I compared them to my old pair . They 're both size 8s , but the new pair is a good inch shorter , narrower across the heel and instep and pinches in more closely at the toes . Pretty much a full size smaller.The quality is - much - lower than the old pair , too . The leather is thinner and stiffer and clearly wo n't last nearly as long . My old pair is fully lined , with a padded , lined tongue , while the new pair is only lined in the very front of the toe , with a very thin unpadded , unlined tongue . The stitching is much shoddier , with fewer parallel lines , fewer stitches per inch and no reinforcing tacks where the uppers attach to the lowers under the lowest set of eyelets . Speaking of eyelets , the new pair has cheap painted steel rolled two-piece eyelets rather than the flat , brass one-piece eyelets imprinted with `` Dr Martens Air Wair '' of the old pair.All in all , they 're more like a cheap Wal-Mart/discount store knock-off than real Docs . Uncomfortable , shoddy and clearly wo n't take the abuse the England built ones did . Absolutely the last pair I ever buy , and they 're going to the Salvation Army tomorrow .
 I recently ordered a pair of these to replace a pair I bought 5 years . The Dr. Marten brand is no longer manufactured in England and it shows . The leather was marred and the fit was n't nearly as good as my previous pair . To top it off the sole pattern is completely useless . Gone was the hiker boot pattern that would grip into ice and snow , replaced with the ` groove ' pattern that does nothing for traction . I 'm very disappointed . I 've been wearing Docs since the early 90 's . This will be my last pair .
 I will never again purchase shoes via the internet . The shoes may have been fine , but the size was unusually narrow . I 'm guessing it 's a function of them being unisex . Anyway , they were returned and I bought the same brand -LRB- different style -RRB- from a local brick and mortar store . Lesson learned .
 While I 'm incredibly disappointed that my brand new shoes are coming apart after just a month and a half , I 'm more disappointed that I 'll have to pay to ship my shoes to Dr. Marten . They said it 'll be 4-6 weeks for them to decide if the defect was manuf . related or due to wear and tear . As they wo n't return defective shoes and if the defect is n't convincing enough to prove manufacturer defect-I 'll be out the shoes and the money I paid for them . If they do find that the shoe is defective and not by me , they 'll gladly replace the shoe with the same shoe or a comparable one . That 's crazy-why would I accept a `` comparable '' shoe , when I may not like the look and it may not be what I need . This just stinks . I think I 'll just scrap the shoes and purchase from another company . Dr. Marten shoes are n't what they use to be . Very disappointed .
 To echo the reviews of others , I have found these Docs to be quite different from others I have owned . They are now made in China instead of England . Also , the leather is VERY stiff and shoe does not feel that comfortable . I have owned them for a few months and they have started to break in a bit , but normally , Docs should n't take that long.I bought the gaucho -LRB- brown -RRB- Docs on Amazon and they are the ones I am still `` working on . '' However , I purchased a black pair -LRB- same style -RRB- from a local shoe store and they are quite comfortable -LRB- even though they are also made in China -RRB- . So this shoe 's woes may be due to the particular supplier/retailer for Amazon .
 Do some research before buying Dr Martens and DO NOT buy sight-unseen from an online store unless you really know what you are doing . That said , read on ... Dr Martens USED TO BE an amazing shoe company . This is when they were all made in England . If you are fortunate enough to find a pair that say on the inside heel
 I have bought Dr Martens in the past because I never had to worry about width -- wide was their thing ! As far as I know you ca n't buy half-sizes in Dr Martens for this reason . These shoes are the same size as previous models I have bought , but after two weeks of ` wearing them in ' I 'm reluctantly realising that my little toes are never going to be happy in them . This is a tough hard shoe to break in , which is often true of a good quality shoe ; but the lack of width makes that a disadvantage to broader-footed people like me !
 I bought this pair of shoes because my other ones just like it are starting to show marks after 4 years of daily wear . My new ones are not as comfortable as my old ones . -LSB- ... -RSB- Every day that I wear my new pair I have a line across the top of my foot where the -LRB- very slightly -RRB- padded part of the tongue meets the unpadded part of the tongue . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 The soles of these shoes are very comfortable but the padded collar of the shoes need to be broken in very well .
 I have owned docs since the 90 's . I got married in a pair of wingtip docs 13 years ago , but sadly I will never own another pair . The padded collar is made of some cheap thin vinyl and has shredded apart and these are the most uncomfortable shoes I have ever owned . The sole has held up well , but the rest is just one big disappointment after owning the real thing that was made in England .
 I have had plenty of pairs of Doc 's but these are not the best for me ... . they are not comfy and they tend to be a little tough to break in . As soon as I put them on and took ONE STEP -- there right across the top of the shoe is a nice big crease ... . It does not look nice and I am `` ticked '' about that ... plus I didnt expect the laces to have green and maroon colors mixed into the brown laces ... . it looks dorky!Plus I have a manufacturing flaw in them . Inside the heel the seam isnt quite right and it rubs my skin and hurts like heck!Hopefully the next model I get isnt like thses or they are going back ... . Putting up with these for now ...

 I bought my black Keds last winter . Within 6 months , there was a hole in the canvas above the toe of the left shoe . -LRB- Not because the shoe was too small , but because the canvas was extremely thin . -RRB- Also , the soles look much thicker in the photos than in reality .
 My new sneakers broke my heart ! They have been making subtle changes for the past several years . This last one was too much . I have been wearing Keds sneakers for about 60 years and absolutely loved them .

 Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return !!
 the style was wonderful however even tho it said 9 med it was a trifle small-thought it might be an 8 instead-win some you lose some
 The shoes were an amazing fit , but when I washed them -- in cold water , I might add -- the blue dye from the soles bled out onto the white canvas . Perhaps , it will wash away next time , but I was more than miffed .
 Not only is the canvas cheap & lightweight , it has a bluish tinge to it . The tongue of the shoe is only sewn halfway ... i.e. , the inside is merely the raw cut . The first time I washed them -LRB- in cold water -RRB- , the blue dye from the inside bled thru to the white upper . Very disappointed in what was formerly a great basic sneaker ... I suppose Keds has succombed to the Chinese influence . Very sad indeed .
 I bought these in both white and stone . I really like the stone , as it does n't seem to stand out as much as the white . Also , it 's a nice change from white all the time . My mom liked the stone color when she saw mine , so I ordered a pair for her as well.We 've noticed there is a change in the way Keds have been made since the 90s . They are not as comfortable . The arch can be `` bumpy '' or nonexistent , and they run a little small . I wear a size 8 , and the stone pair are tight on me . Tighter than the white for some reason . I 'm sure they will get better as they break in , but I 've never had a pair of Keds that is this tight . My feet actually hurt the first day I wore them . That never happened to me with Keds . And I have narrow feet . Someone with a wider foot could n't wear these comfortably , at all . The sneakers also do n't last as long as they used to . I wore Keds a lot when I was in high school , and one pair would last me a long time . Now , I notice the edges at the bottom of the shoes start to come apart with much less wear , and the footbed becomes very flat and uncomfortable . They do n't feel as cushiony as they used to , even when brand new . Very different . Wearable , and I like them , but they are not as good as they used to be . I suspect they were not made in China a decade + ago . I think they are made smaller than they used to be , because even looking at my feet while wearing them , I noticed they make my feet look smaller . I like that , but , not at the expense of comfort . I might try an 8 1/2 next time . The white fit better for some reason , not so small.Update
 I have worn Keds sneakers for many years , always ordering size 6.5 . The label in the sneaker and the box are labeled 6.5 , but this sneaker is at most size 5 , or it is a child 's sneaker.Very disappointed .
 These shoes are not as good as they used to be . Very little support . The sole is very thin . Definetly not worth the price .
 I 've ordered Ked 's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality . The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $ 5 . No support , thin canvas - just junk . I 'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe . I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to . No support , no padding , more narrow , thinner canvas . I 've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference . Save your money . You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $ 5 - $ 8 , it just wo n't have a Keds tag .

 The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem . The shoes that arrived had been worn . I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had . He made a good offer however , I decided to wash the shoes and keep them , which I did . Now , I have an infection on my toe . Not good .
 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 I got these shoes in December and they are VERY cheap . NOT worth the money . I could have gone to a local store and paid a lot less . Additionally , the shoes I received did not look like the shoe in the photo . The shoe i received was more of a sketcher type shoe with a longer top . I would NOT recommend them to a friend or relative . They are not what i expected . the top of the shoe is already coming apart . I 've had Keds before and I do n't know if it was just this pair , but I will not buy shoes this way again .
 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .
 Eh . I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap , but I should have paid more attention to the reviews . The quality is way low with these shoes . They 're super uncomfortable and make your toes feel like they 're packed in sardines . -LRB- And I have really small feet - I 'm a women 's 5.5 -RRB- Now that I see them on my feet , they do n't even look that cute .

 In any shoe I ideally I wear a 7 1/2 W. I usually end up with an 8 M because there is no wide width offered . This summer I wanted canvas tennis shoes for summer and decided to try some Keds . There seems to be no consistency of sizing , however , between colors or styles , and I have had to try different colors and styles due to `` not available '' items . Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug . So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long , but wide enough . I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W -LRB- no Chambray available in 7 W -RRB- and it was waaay too short and very tight . I do n't think a size 8 W would even fit . This idea of shoes `` running small '' or `` running large '' makes no sense to me . Just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it .
 I was so disappointed with these shoes . In fact , I returned them . The quality is not that of the Ked 's that I grew up wearing !
 I bought these shoes in black to match my work uniform only to receive them in the mail to discover that they are super narrow . It 's like these shoes are designed for rabbits or something . Thankfully amazon has very easy returns . If you decide to buy these shoes online try them on first , or read the return policy .
 I bought the white leather sneakers for $ 38 at a DSW store awhile ago . Let me tell you , they do NOT last . I bought Keds hoping for a quality , practical , and stylish shoe that I could wear with anything for a few years . This is what you could expect a few years ago , that Keds were STRONG shoes . Well surprise , they barely lasted one season . The bottom sole of the shoe came unglue from the rest of the shoe , and most of the white leather chipped off leaving patches of brown . Looks terrible , no way worth my $ 40 .
 3 weeks after buying these shoes , i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined . This never happened to the cheap Target brand we bought . I have to throw them away . The insole does n't come out so I ca n't even try to bleach them .
 I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them . Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable . Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now . Some stuff should be left in the 80s !!
 They sent the wrong color LEDs , I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked .
 Even though I ordered my normal size , these shoes pinched my toes painfully . I ended up throwing them in a donation box .
 These ARE NOT official Minnetonka mocs . I had a pair of a really nice blue shade back in the day and wantd to &#34; get them back &#34; again . These were a letdown . I would have given it no stars if I could have but it does n't allow for such on here . They were tight and my feet could n't even tolerate the try-on ! The color blue was also more of a cloudy blue and not the nice sky blue I had before -LRB- I had the blue ones probably about late 90s -RRB- I returned them asap ! : o -LRB-
 I recieved the black shoes with a brown zipper , my first compliant . Them my second wearing the brown zipper broke . I noticed they are not American made any more . Dont take a chanceand buy these shoes the workmanship is terrible . msskttty@aol.com
 I liked the color and the way the moccasins were made , but they are just way too narrow . Please make them in a wide width . Could n't even get my foot in them and I ordered a half a size larger than what I wear .
 really to narrow couldnt get my foot in i am sending back for a refund sorry make them in wide !!!!
 I 've had a number of pairs of Docs over the years , all either 8-eyelet or 6-eyelet padded boots . My last pair of brit-made 6-eyelet boots are 5-6 years old , and getting pretty beat up from bartending in them 5 nights a week for years . I picked up a new pair , and did n't really inspect them much before I bought them , as I 'd owned several pairs before , knew they 'd all fit the same after a little breaking-in , and I was in a hurry.Wearing them the first day , I thought they were awfully tight , but figured they just needed to be worn in a little . At the end of the day , though , my feet hurt - a first for me with docs . So I compared them to my old pair . They 're both size 8s , but the new pair is a good inch shorter , narrower across the heel and instep and pinches in more closely at the toes . Pretty much a full size smaller.The quality is - much - lower than the old pair , too . The leather is thinner and stiffer and clearly wo n't last nearly as long . My old pair is fully lined , with a padded , lined tongue , while the new pair is only lined in the very front of the toe , with a very thin unpadded , unlined tongue . The stitching is much shoddier , with fewer parallel lines , fewer stitches per inch and no reinforcing tacks where the uppers attach to the lowers under the lowest set of eyelets . Speaking of eyelets , the new pair has cheap painted steel rolled two-piece eyelets rather than the flat , brass one-piece eyelets imprinted with `` Dr Martens Air Wair '' of the old pair.All in all , they 're more like a cheap Wal-Mart/discount store knock-off than real Docs . Uncomfortable , shoddy and clearly wo n't take the abuse the England built ones did . Absolutely the last pair I ever buy , and they 're going to the Salvation Army tomorrow .
 I recently ordered a pair of these to replace a pair I bought 5 years . The Dr. Marten brand is no longer manufactured in England and it shows . The leather was marred and the fit was n't nearly as good as my previous pair . To top it off the sole pattern is completely useless . Gone was the hiker boot pattern that would grip into ice and snow , replaced with the ` groove ' pattern that does nothing for traction . I 'm very disappointed . I 've been wearing Docs since the early 90 's . This will be my last pair .
 I will never again purchase shoes via the internet . The shoes may have been fine , but the size was unusually narrow . I 'm guessing it 's a function of them being unisex . Anyway , they were returned and I bought the same brand -LRB- different style -RRB- from a local brick and mortar store . Lesson learned .
 While I 'm incredibly disappointed that my brand new shoes are coming apart after just a month and a half , I 'm more disappointed that I 'll have to pay to ship my shoes to Dr. Marten . They said it 'll be 4-6 weeks for them to decide if the defect was manuf . related or due to wear and tear . As they wo n't return defective shoes and if the defect is n't convincing enough to prove manufacturer defect-I 'll be out the shoes and the money I paid for them . If they do find that the shoe is defective and not by me , they 'll gladly replace the shoe with the same shoe or a comparable one . That 's crazy-why would I accept a `` comparable '' shoe , when I may not like the look and it may not be what I need . This just stinks . I think I 'll just scrap the shoes and purchase from another company . Dr. Marten shoes are n't what they use to be . Very disappointed .
 To echo the reviews of others , I have found these Docs to be quite different from others I have owned . They are now made in China instead of England . Also , the leather is VERY stiff and shoe does not feel that comfortable . I have owned them for a few months and they have started to break in a bit , but normally , Docs should n't take that long.I bought the gaucho -LRB- brown -RRB- Docs on Amazon and they are the ones I am still `` working on . '' However , I purchased a black pair -LRB- same style -RRB- from a local shoe store and they are quite comfortable -LRB- even though they are also made in China -RRB- . So this shoe 's woes may be due to the particular supplier/retailer for Amazon .
 Do some research before buying Dr Martens and DO NOT buy sight-unseen from an online store unless you really know what you are doing . That said , read on ... Dr Martens USED TO BE an amazing shoe company . This is when they were all made in England . If you are fortunate enough to find a pair that say on the inside heel
 I have bought Dr Martens in the past because I never had to worry about width -- wide was their thing ! As far as I know you ca n't buy half-sizes in Dr Martens for this reason . These shoes are the same size as previous models I have bought , but after two weeks of ` wearing them in ' I 'm reluctantly realising that my little toes are never going to be happy in them . This is a tough hard shoe to break in , which is often true of a good quality shoe ; but the lack of width makes that a disadvantage to broader-footed people like me !
 Waiting a half hour for ONE pair of shoes , And after that ordeal they only have a display model that 's been worn by some dirty persons foot . Not to mention it being stretched out half a size ... Unbelievable that such things could come from a business environment . Oh and since you ca n't understand those Nigerians I asked someone else for help and got repremanded for trying to find someone with comprehensible english speaking skills . OVER ALL DONT SHOP THERE DONT WASTE YOUR TIME -LRB- 30 + mins -RRB- OR MONEY ...
 I have had plenty of pairs of Doc 's but these are not the best for me ... . they are not comfy and they tend to be a little tough to break in . As soon as I put them on and took ONE STEP -- there right across the top of the shoe is a nice big crease ... . It does not look nice and I am `` ticked '' about that ... plus I didnt expect the laces to have green and maroon colors mixed into the brown laces ... . it looks dorky!Plus I have a manufacturing flaw in them . Inside the heel the seam isnt quite right and it rubs my skin and hurts like heck!Hopefully the next model I get isnt like thses or they are going back ... . Putting up with these for now ...
 I bought this pair of shoes because my other ones just like it are starting to show marks after 4 years of daily wear . My new ones are not as comfortable as my old ones . -LSB- ... -RSB- Every day that I wear my new pair I have a line across the top of my foot where the -LRB- very slightly -RRB- padded part of the tongue meets the unpadded part of the tongue . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 The soles of these shoes are very comfortable but the padded collar of the shoes need to be broken in very well .
 I have owned docs since the 90 's . I got married in a pair of wingtip docs 13 years ago , but sadly I will never own another pair . The padded collar is made of some cheap thin vinyl and has shredded apart and these are the most uncomfortable shoes I have ever owned . The sole has held up well , but the rest is just one big disappointment after owning the real thing that was made in England .
 I have worn Keds sneakers for many years , always ordering size 6.5 . The label in the sneaker and the box are labeled 6.5 , but this sneaker is at most size 5 , or it is a child 's sneaker.Very disappointed .
 The shoes were an amazing fit , but when I washed them -- in cold water , I might add -- the blue dye from the soles bled out onto the white canvas . Perhaps , it will wash away next time , but I was more than miffed .
 Not only is the canvas cheap & lightweight , it has a bluish tinge to it . The tongue of the shoe is only sewn halfway ... i.e. , the inside is merely the raw cut . The first time I washed them -LRB- in cold water -RRB- , the blue dye from the inside bled thru to the white upper . Very disappointed in what was formerly a great basic sneaker ... I suppose Keds has succombed to the Chinese influence . Very sad indeed .
 I bought these in both white and stone . I really like the stone , as it does n't seem to stand out as much as the white . Also , it 's a nice change from white all the time . My mom liked the stone color when she saw mine , so I ordered a pair for her as well.We 've noticed there is a change in the way Keds have been made since the 90s . They are not as comfortable . The arch can be `` bumpy '' or nonexistent , and they run a little small . I wear a size 8 , and the stone pair are tight on me . Tighter than the white for some reason . I 'm sure they will get better as they break in , but I 've never had a pair of Keds that is this tight . My feet actually hurt the first day I wore them . That never happened to me with Keds . And I have narrow feet . Someone with a wider foot could n't wear these comfortably , at all . The sneakers also do n't last as long as they used to . I wore Keds a lot when I was in high school , and one pair would last me a long time . Now , I notice the edges at the bottom of the shoes start to come apart with much less wear , and the footbed becomes very flat and uncomfortable . They do n't feel as cushiony as they used to , even when brand new . Very different . Wearable , and I like them , but they are not as good as they used to be . I suspect they were not made in China a decade + ago . I think they are made smaller than they used to be , because even looking at my feet while wearing them , I noticed they make my feet look smaller . I like that , but , not at the expense of comfort . I might try an 8 1/2 next time . The white fit better for some reason , not so small.Update
 Well in one of the descriptive pictures the bottom of the shoe is all black ! The shoes I received were a brown rubber color on the bottom of the shoe . Also in another picture , the shoe inside is white and the shoes I received were blue inside . They are not as comfortable as a pair of keds that I owned years before .
 I ordered a pair of black and white keds and was sent a pair of plain black keds . In my opinion they are not nearly as cute as the black and white ones . Also , I ordered a narrow pair because I have really narrow feet , but the narrow pair is pretty tight on me . I ca n't imagine how they have extra narrow pairs because the narrow ones looked abnormally skinny . So be warned . I would have returned them but I had to wear them to a wedding as part of my bridesmaid outfit a week from the time they arrived . I probably will not be wearing them again and I wish I could return them for the black and white pair I had ordered .
 Do not buy ! The Keds quality has become garbage ! Much narrower , cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price !! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart . Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end .
 Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return !!
 the style was wonderful however even tho it said 9 med it was a trifle small-thought it might be an 8 instead-win some you lose some
 These shoes are not as good as they used to be . Very little support . The sole is very thin . Definetly not worth the price .
 I ordered these Navy Keds tennis shoes for my daughter . The color shows navy , but when they arrived they looked black ... the box said navy ! Had to return because of the shade .
 These Navy blue Keds were more black than navy blue . The picture of the shoes on Amazon was very different than the one I received . I put them next to my black keds and you could not tell the difference between the navy blue and the black keds . Very disappointing .
 I almost always wear a size 6 but as soon as I put these on , they hurt my feet . They are extremely narrow - returned right away .
 I was n't looking for a good walking shoe , just a specific look ; -LRB- surprisingly hard to find simple plain blue sneakers -RRB- . Since newer reviews seemed generally positive , I thought I would take a shot . Unfortunately , these are n't acceptable even for light use . Very tight and feel like cardboard . Note
 I bought my black Keds last winter . Within 6 months , there was a hole in the canvas above the toe of the left shoe . -LRB- Not because the shoe was too small , but because the canvas was extremely thin . -RRB- Also , the soles look much thicker in the photos than in reality .
 My new sneakers broke my heart ! They have been making subtle changes for the past several years . This last one was too much . I have been wearing Keds sneakers for about 60 years and absolutely loved them . Several years ago they came out with flared soles , -LRB- I said to myself , I guess I can live with that . -RRB- Then they began making the toes more pointed . Did n't really like that . What 's wrong with toe room ? Time for new ones - pictures showed the flared soles were gone -LRB- GREAT -RRB- . Ordered a pair . The toes are still too pointed , but the insole is as hard as a rock -LRB- maybe not quite -RRB- and the built in arch support was gone ! They had a perfect product and really ruined it . I could just cry . I returned my shoes and they were very kind and gave me a full refund .
 If you order these Keds sneakers today you will NOT be getting the same sneaker that has reviews from a year or more ago . Believe me , they are entirely different.Well , darn . As an almost life-long Keds wearer I can say with some authority that what I received are NOTHING like any pair of Keds sneakers I 've ever had before.Previously there was at least light arch support even in the most basic of their sneaker styles , this pair has none . The sole is stiff and clunky , the canvas fabric is thin and poor quality and they are in general , junk . No quality of any kind left in this previously reliable brand.My usual size in these is a 7 and that has always been 100 % comfortable and a perfect fit when worn with a pair of sport socks . This pair is saggy and baggy on top even when tied and the sides bagged out too.They WILL be going back.Save yourself time and aggravation and pass these by .
 Avoid doing business with Shoemall ! Check their feedback ! I 've made two orders with Shoemall and both times they do n't have my items in stock . It seems they do n't update on Amazon regularly . I 'll never buy from them again . Beware , they 'll charge & send you the accessory to an item and later contact you that the main item is out of stock . This happened to me both times I 've ordered . Really bad business practices !
 I have an old pair of these shoes that I have loved for a long time , but needed to replace . I ordered this pair and was very disappointed in the quality . I have only worn these shoes perhaps a dozen times and the sole is already coming apart . They also have this weird squeak with every step that I take . I will be replacing these , but will not purchase another Keds shoe .
 After reading some of the other reviews , I hesitated to purchase these Keds but decided to take a chance anyway . That was a mistake . The Keds that arrived the other day are nothing like I remember -LRB- and I lived in Keds for many years -RRB- . These are a very cheap version of the sturdy , supportive Keds of yesteryear that fit like a glove and lasted forever . The new ones are also quite a bit narrower , thinner , pointed in the toe , and feel like something you 'd get at a dollar store for a few bucks . Returning this product for a refund and wo n't be purchasing Keds in the future .
 I wore these about twice a week for about 5 weeks before they began splitting apart . To late too return them now so it was a waste of money . Very disappointed in the quality . I wore Keds for years and never had any problems with quality . Will not buy this brand again .

 Eh . I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap , but I should have paid more attention to the reviews . The quality is way low with these shoes . They 're super uncomfortable and make your toes feel like they 're packed in sardines . -LRB- And I have really small feet - I 'm a women 's 5.5 -RRB- Now that I see them on my feet , they do n't even look that cute . Anyone who buys KEDS for the first time ONLINE should realize that they are exactly what they seem
 The shipping cost was less than what it would have cost me in gas to go the store to buy
 Even though I ordered my normal size , these shoes pinched my toes painfully . I ended up throwing them in a donation box .
 I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them . Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable . Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now . Some stuff should be left in the 80s !!
 In any shoe I ideally I wear a 7 1/2 W. I usually end up with an 8 M because there is no wide width offered . This summer I wanted canvas tennis shoes for summer and decided to try some Keds . There seems to be no consistency of sizing , however , between colors or styles , and I have had to try different colors and styles due to `` not available '' items . Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug . So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long , but wide enough . I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W -LRB- no Chambray available in 7 W -RRB- and it was waaay too short and very tight . I do n't think a size 8 W would even fit . This idea of shoes `` running small '' or `` running large '' makes no sense to me . Just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it .

 I bought this sneaker from my Mom who has worn the same style for years . I 'm sorry to say that we were not happy with our purchase - it seems that the mold for the shoe has changed - the stitching on the top of the shoe is in a different place and does not make this a comfortable shoe for my mom .
 I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them . They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them . I will not purchase any Keds in the future .
 The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem . The shoes that arrived had been worn . I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had . He made a good offer however , I decided to wash the shoes and keep them , which I did . Now , I have an infection on my toe . Not good .
 I 've ordered Ked 's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality . The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $ 5 . No support , thin canvas - just junk . I 'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe . I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to . No support , no padding , more narrow , thinner canvas . I 've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference . Save your money . You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $ 5 - $ 8 , it just wo n't have a Keds tag . This is no longer the bargain it once was . Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator . What 's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe do n't even know it 's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago .
 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?
 3 weeks after buying these shoes , i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined .

 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 I got these shoes in December and they are VERY cheap . NOT worth the money . I could have gone to a local store and paid a lot less . Additionally , the shoes I received did not look like the shoe in the photo . The shoe i received was more of a sketcher type shoe with a longer top . I would NOT recommend them to a friend or relative . They are not what i expected . the top of the shoe is already coming apart . I 've had Keds before and I do n't know if it was just this pair , but I will not buy shoes this way again .
 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .
 I think theyr ' e ok but the seams tore and ripped and then the inside stuffing came OUT !?!??? I think they were very comfortable at first and then they just started ripping . A lot of my friends got them too and theirs all ripped too .

Now , I notice the edges at the bottom of the shoes start to come apart with much less wear , and the footbed becomes very flat and uncomfortable . They do n't feel as cushiony as they used to , even when brand new . Very different . Wearable , and I like them , but they are not as good as they used to be . I suspect they were not made in China a decade + ago . I think they are made smaller than they used to be , because even looking at my feet while wearing them , I noticed they make my feet look smaller . I like that , but , not at the expense of comfort . I might try an 8 1/2 next time . The white fit better for some reason , not so small.Update
 They sent the wrong color LEDs , I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked .
 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 These shoes are not as good as they used to be . Very little support . The sole is very thin . Definetly not worth the price .
 I bought this sneaker from my Mom who has worn the same style for years . I 'm sorry to say that we were not happy with our purchase - it seems that the mold for the shoe has changed - the stitching on the top of the shoe is in a different place and does not make this a comfortable shoe for my mom .
 I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them . They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them . I will not purchase any Keds in the future .
 The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem . The shoes that arrived had been worn . I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had . He made a good offer however , I decided to wash the shoes and keep them , which I did . Now , I have an infection on my toe . Not good .
 I 've ordered Ked 's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality . The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $ 5 . No support , thin canvas - just junk . I 'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe . I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to . No support , no padding , more narrow , thinner canvas . I 've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference . Save your money . You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $ 5 - $ 8 , it just wo n't have a Keds tag . This is no longer the bargain it once was . Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator . What 's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe do n't even know it 's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago .
 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?
 Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return !!
 the style was wonderful however even tho it said 9 med it was a trifle small-thought it might be an 8 instead-win some you lose some
 Well in one of the descriptive pictures the bottom of the shoe is all black ! The shoes I received were a brown rubber color on the bottom of the shoe . Also in another picture , the shoe inside is white and the shoes I received were blue inside . They are not as comfortable as a pair of keds that I owned years before .
 I ordered a pair of black and white keds and was sent a pair of plain black keds . In my opinion they are not nearly as cute as the black and white ones . Also , I ordered a narrow pair because I have really narrow feet , but the narrow pair is pretty tight on me . I ca n't imagine how they have extra narrow pairs because the narrow ones looked abnormally skinny . So be warned . I would have returned them but I had to wear them to a wedding as part of my bridesmaid outfit a week from the time they arrived . I probably will not be wearing them again and I wish I could return them for the black and white pair I had ordered .
 3 weeks after buying these shoes , i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined . This never happened to the cheap Target brand we bought . I have to throw them away . The insole does n't come out so I ca n't even try to bleach them .
 In any shoe I ideally I wear a 7 1/2 W. I usually end up with an 8 M because there is no wide width offered . This summer I wanted canvas tennis shoes for summer and decided to try some Keds . There seems to be no consistency of sizing , however , between colors or styles , and I have had to try different colors and styles due to `` not available '' items . Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug . So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long , but wide enough . I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W -LRB- no Chambray available in 7 W -RRB- and it was waaay too short and very tight . I do n't think a size 8 W would even fit . This idea of shoes `` running small '' or `` running large '' makes no sense to me . Just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it .
 I was so disappointed with these shoes . In fact , I returned them . The quality is not that of the Ked 's that I grew up wearing !
 I bought these shoes in black to match my work uniform only to receive them in the mail to discover that they are super narrow . It 's like these shoes are designed for rabbits or something . Thankfully amazon has very easy returns . If you decide to buy these shoes online try them on first , or read the return policy .
 I bought the white leather sneakers for $ 38 at a DSW store awhile ago . Let me tell you , they do NOT last . I bought Keds hoping for a quality , practical , and stylish shoe that I could wear with anything for a few years . This is what you could expect a few years ago , that Keds were STRONG shoes . Well surprise , they barely lasted one season . The bottom sole of the shoe came unglue from the rest of the shoe , and most of the white leather chipped off leaving patches of brown . Looks terrible , no way worth my $ 40 .
 Do not buy ! The Keds quality has become garbage ! Much narrower , cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price !! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart . Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end .
 I almost always wear a size 6 but as soon as I put these on , they hurt my feet . They are extremely narrow - returned right away .
 These Navy blue Keds were more black than navy blue . The picture of the shoes on Amazon was very different than the one I received . I put them next to my black keds and you could not tell the difference between the navy blue and the black keds . Very disappointing .
 I ordered these Navy Keds tennis shoes for my daughter . The color shows navy , but when they arrived they looked black ... the box said navy ! Had to return because of the shade .
 Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return !!

 I bought my black Keds last winter . Within 6 months , there was a hole in the canvas above the toe of the left shoe . -LRB- Not because the shoe was too small , but because the canvas was extremely thin . -RRB- Also , the soles look much thicker in the photos than in reality .
 My new sneakers broke my heart ! They have been making subtle changes for the past several years . This last one was too much . I have been wearing Keds sneakers for about 60 years and absolutely loved them . Several years ago they came out with flared soles , -LRB- I said to myself , I guess I can live with that . -RRB- Then they began making the toes more pointed . Did n't really like that . What 's wrong with toe room ? Time for new ones - pictures showed the flared soles were gone -LRB- GREAT -RRB- . Ordered a pair . The toes are still too pointed , but the insole is as hard as a rock -LRB- maybe not quite -RRB- and the built in arch support was gone ! They had a perfect product and really ruined it . I could just cry . I returned my shoes and they were very kind and gave me a full refund .
 If you order these Keds sneakers today you will NOT be getting the same sneaker that has reviews from a year or more ago . Believe me , they are entirely different.Well , darn . As an almost life-long Keds wearer I can say with some authority that what I received are NOTHING like any pair of Keds sneakers I 've ever had before.Previously there was at least light arch support even in the most basic of their sneaker styles , this pair has none . The sole is stiff and clunky , the canvas fabric is thin and poor quality and they are in general , junk . No quality of any kind left in this previously reliable brand.My usual size in these is a 7 and that has always been 100 % comfortable and a perfect fit when worn with a pair of sport socks . This pair is saggy and baggy on top even when tied and the sides bagged out too.They WILL be going back.Save yourself time and aggravation and pass these by .
 Avoid doing business with Shoemall ! Check their feedback ! I 've made two orders with Shoemall and both times they do n't have my items in stock . It seems they do n't update on Amazon regularly . I 'll never buy from them again . Beware , they 'll charge & send you the accessory to an item and later contact you that the main item is out of stock . This happened to me both times I 've ordered . Really bad business practices !
 I have an old pair of these shoes that I have loved for a long time , but needed to replace . I ordered this pair and was very disappointed in the quality . I have only worn these shoes perhaps a dozen times and the sole is already coming apart . They also have this weird squeak with every step that I take . I will be replacing these , but will not purchase another Keds shoe .
 After reading some of the other reviews , I hesitated to purchase these Keds but decided to take a chance anyway . That was a mistake . The Keds that arrived the other day are nothing like I remember -LRB- and I lived in Keds for many years -RRB- . These are a very cheap version of the sturdy , supportive Keds of yesteryear that fit like a glove and lasted forever . The new ones are also quite a bit narrower , thinner , pointed in the toe , and feel like something you 'd get at a dollar store for a few bucks . Returning this product for a refund and wo n't be purchasing Keds in the future .
 I wore these about twice a week for about 5 weeks before they began splitting apart . To late too return them now so it was a waste of money . Very disappointed in the quality . I wore Keds for years and never had any problems with quality . Will not buy this brand again .

 Eh . I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap , but I should have paid more attention to the reviews . The quality is way low with these shoes . They 're super uncomfortable and make your toes feel like they 're packed in sardines . -LRB- And I have really small feet - I 'm a women 's 5.5 -RRB- Now that I see them on my feet , they do n't even look that cute . Anyone who buys KEDS for the first time ONLINE should realize that they are exactly what they seem
 The shipping cost was less than what it would have cost me in gas to go the store to buy
 I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them . Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable . Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now . Some stuff should be left in the 80s !!
 Even though I ordered my normal size , these shoes pinched my toes painfully . I ended up throwing them in a donation box .
 They sent the wrong color LEDs , I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked .
 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 The shoes were an amazing fit , but when I washed them -- in cold water , I might add -- the blue dye from the soles bled out onto the white canvas . Perhaps , it will wash away next time , but I was more than miffed .
 Not only is the canvas cheap & lightweight , it has a bluish tinge to it . The tongue of the shoe is only sewn halfway ... i.e. , the inside is merely the raw cut . The first time I washed them -LRB- in cold water -RRB- , the blue dye from the inside bled thru to the white upper . Very disappointed in what was formerly a great basic sneaker ... I suppose Keds has succombed to the Chinese influence . Very sad indeed .
 I bought these in both white and stone . I really like the stone , as it does n't seem to stand out as much as the white . Also , it 's a nice change from white all the time . My mom liked the stone color when she saw mine , so I ordered a pair for her as well.We 've noticed there is a change in the way Keds have been made since the 90s . They are not as comfortable . The arch can be `` bumpy '' or nonexistent , and they run a little small . I wear a size 8 , and the stone pair are tight on me . Tighter than the white for some reason . I 'm sure they will get better as they break in , but I 've never had a pair of Keds that is this tight . My feet actually hurt the first day I wore them . That never happened to me with Keds . And I have narrow feet . Someone with a wider foot could n't wear these comfortably , at all . The sneakers also do n't last as long as they used to . I wore Keds a lot when I was in high school , and one pair would last me a long time .

 I got these shoes in December and they are VERY cheap . NOT worth the money . I could have gone to a local store and paid a lot less . Additionally , the shoes I received did not look like the shoe in the photo . The shoe i received was more of a sketcher type shoe with a longer top . I would NOT recommend them to a friend or relative . They are not what i expected . the top of the shoe is already coming apart . I 've had Keds before and I do n't know if it was just this pair , but I will not buy shoes this way again .
 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .
 I have worn Keds sneakers for many years , always ordering size 6.5 . The label in the sneaker and the box are labeled 6.5 , but this sneaker is at most size 5 , or it is a child 's sneaker.Very disappointed .
 I ordered these Navy Keds tennis shoes for my daughter . The color shows navy , but when they arrived they looked black ... the box said navy ! Had to return because of the shade .

 Do not buy ! The Keds quality has become garbage ! Much narrower , cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price !! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart . Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end .

 Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return !!
 the style was wonderful however even tho it said 9 med it was a trifle small-thought it might be an 8 instead-win some you lose some
 These shoes are not as good as they used to be . Very little support . The sole is very thin . Definetly not worth the price .
 They sent the wrong color LEDs , I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked .
 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 I bought this sneaker from my Mom who has worn the same style for years . I 'm sorry to say that we were not happy with our purchase - it seems that the mold for the shoe has changed - the stitching on the top of the shoe is in a different place and does not make this a comfortable shoe for my mom .
 I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them . They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them . I will not purchase any Keds in the future .
 The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem . The shoes that arrived had been worn . I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had . He made a good offer however , I decided to wash the shoes and keep them , which I did . Now , I have an infection on my toe . Not good .
 I 've ordered Ked 's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality . The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $ 5 . No support , thin canvas - just junk . I 'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe . I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to . No support , no padding , more narrow , thinner canvas . I 've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference . Save your money . You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $ 5 - $ 8 , it just wo n't have a Keds tag . This is no longer the bargain it once was . Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator . What 's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe do n't even know it 's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago .
 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?
 I got these shoes in December and they are VERY cheap . NOT worth the money . I could have gone to a local store and paid a lot less . Additionally , the shoes I received did not look like the shoe in the photo . The shoe i received was more of a sketcher type shoe with a longer top . I would NOT recommend them to a friend or relative . They are not what i expected . the top of the shoe is already coming apart . I 've had Keds before and I do n't know if it was just this pair , but I will not buy shoes this way again .
 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .
 Eh . I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap , but I should have paid more attention to the reviews . The quality is way low with these shoes . They 're super uncomfortable and make your toes feel like they 're packed in sardines . -LRB- And I have really small feet - I 'm a women 's 5.5 -RRB- Now that I see them on my feet , they do n't even look that cute . Anyone who buys KEDS for the first time ONLINE should realize that they are exactly what they seem
 The shipping cost was less than what it would have cost me in gas to go the store to buy
 Even though I ordered my normal size , these shoes pinched my toes painfully . I ended up throwing them in a donation box .
 I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them . Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable . Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now . Some stuff should be left in the 80s !!
 3 weeks after buying these shoes , i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined . This never happened to the cheap Target brand we bought . I have to throw them away . The insole does n't come out so I ca n't even try to bleach them .
 In any shoe I ideally I wear a 7 1/2 W. I usually end up with an 8 M because there is no wide width offered . This summer I wanted canvas tennis shoes for summer and decided to try some Keds . There seems to be no consistency of sizing , however , between colors or styles , and I have had to try different colors and styles due to `` not available '' items . Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug . So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long , but wide enough . I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W -LRB- no Chambray available in 7 W -RRB- and it was waaay too short and very tight . I do n't think a size 8 W would even fit . This idea of shoes `` running small '' or `` running large '' makes no sense to me . Just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it .
 I was so disappointed with these shoes . In fact , I returned them . The quality is not that of the Ked 's that I grew up wearing !
 I bought these shoes in black to match my work uniform only to receive them in the mail to discover that they are super narrow . It 's like these shoes are designed for rabbits or something . Thankfully amazon has very easy returns . If you decide to buy these shoes online try them on first , or read the return policy .
 I bought the white leather sneakers for $ 38 at a DSW store awhile ago . Let me tell you , they do NOT last . I bought Keds hoping for a quality , practical , and stylish shoe that I could wear with anything for a few years . This is what you could expect a few years ago , that Keds were STRONG shoes . Well surprise , they barely lasted one season . The bottom sole of the shoe came unglue from the rest of the shoe , and most of the white leather chipped off leaving patches of brown . Looks terrible , no way worth my $ 40 .
 I love the way my shoes look and fit . However , the right sole came unglued within 2 weeks . I was very disappointed because they are unwearable . I usually have good luck with Roos , and maybe I got a bad pair , but do n't say you were n't warned !

 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .
 They sent the wrong color LEDs , I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked .
 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them . Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable . Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now . Some stuff should be left in the 80s !!

 I 've ordered Ked 's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality . The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $ 5 . No support , thin canvas - just junk . I 'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe . I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to . No support , no padding , more narrow , thinner canvas . I 've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference . Save your money . You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $ 5 - $ 8 , it just wo n't have a Keds tag . This is no longer the bargain it once was . Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator . What 's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe do n't even know it 's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago .
 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?
 I bought this sneaker from my Mom who has worn the same style for years . I 'm sorry to say that we were not happy with our purchase - it seems that the mold for the shoe has changed - the stitching on the top of the shoe is in a different place and does not make this a comfortable shoe for my mom .
 I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them . They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them . I will not purchase any Keds in the future .
 The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem . The shoes that arrived had been worn . I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had . He made a good offer however , I decided to wash the shoes and keep them , which I did . Now , I have an infection on my toe . Not good .
 3 weeks after buying these shoes , i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined . This never happened to the cheap Target brand we bought . I have to throw them away . The insole does n't come out so I ca n't even try to bleach them .

 I almost always wear a size 6 but as soon as I put these on , they hurt my feet . They are extremely narrow - returned right away .
 The shoes were an amazing fit , but when I washed them -- in cold water , I might add -- the blue dye from the soles bled out onto the white canvas . Perhaps , it will wash away next time , but I was more than miffed .
 Not only is the canvas cheap & lightweight , it has a bluish tinge to it . The tongue of the shoe is only sewn halfway ... i.e. , the inside is merely the raw cut . The first time I washed them -LRB- in cold water -RRB- , the blue dye from the inside bled thru to the white upper . Very disappointed in what was formerly a great basic sneaker ... I suppose Keds has succombed to the Chinese influence . Very sad indeed .
 I bought these in both white and stone . I really like the stone , as it does n't seem to stand out as much as the white . Also , it 's a nice change from white all the time . My mom liked the stone color when she saw mine , so I ordered a pair for her as well.We 've noticed there is a change in the way Keds have been made since the 90s . They are not as comfortable . The arch can be `` bumpy '' or nonexistent , and they run a little small . I wear a size 8 , and the stone pair are tight on me . Tighter than the white for some reason . I 'm sure they will get better as they break in , but I 've never had a pair of Keds that is this tight . My feet actually hurt the first day I wore them . That never happened to me with Keds . And I have narrow feet . Someone with a wider foot could n't wear these comfortably , at all . The sneakers also do n't last as long as they used to . I wore Keds a lot when I was in high school , and one pair would last me a long time . Now , I notice the edges at the bottom of the shoes start to come apart with much less wear , and the footbed becomes very flat and uncomfortable . They do n't feel as cushiony as they used to , even when brand new . Very different . Wearable , and I like them , but they are not as good as they used to be . I suspect they were not made in China a decade + ago . I think they are made smaller than they used to be , because even looking at my feet while wearing them , I noticed they make my feet look smaller . I like that , but , not at the expense of comfort . I might try an 8 1/2 next time . The white fit better for some reason , not so small.Update
 I have worn Keds sneakers for many years , always ordering size 6.5 . The label in the sneaker and the box are labeled 6.5 , but this sneaker is at most size 5 , or it is a child 's sneaker.Very disappointed .
 These Navy blue Keds were more black than navy blue . The picture of the shoes on Amazon was very different than the one I received . I put them next to my black keds and you could not tell the difference between the navy blue and the black keds . Very disappointing .
 I ordered these Navy Keds tennis shoes for my daughter . The color shows navy , but when they arrived they looked black ... the box said navy ! Had to return because of the shade .
 I bought my black Keds last winter . Within 6 months , there was a hole in the canvas above the toe of the left shoe . -LRB- Not because the shoe was too small , but because the canvas was extremely thin . -RRB- Also , the soles look much thicker in the photos than in reality .
 My new sneakers broke my heart ! They have been making subtle changes for the past several years . This last one was too much . I have been wearing Keds sneakers for about 60 years and absolutely loved them . Several years ago they came out with flared soles , -LRB- I said to myself , I guess I can live with that . -RRB- Then they began making the toes more pointed . Did n't really like that . What 's wrong with toe room ? Time for new ones - pictures showed the flared soles were gone -LRB- GREAT -RRB- . Ordered a pair . The toes are still too pointed , but the insole is as hard as a rock -LRB- maybe not quite -RRB- and the built in arch support was gone ! They had a perfect product and really ruined it . I could just cry . I returned my shoes and they were very kind and gave me a full refund .
 If you order these Keds sneakers today you will NOT be getting the same sneaker that has reviews from a year or more ago . Believe me , they are entirely different.Well , darn . As an almost life-long Keds wearer I can say with some authority that what I received are NOTHING like any pair of Keds sneakers I 've ever had before.Previously there was at least light arch support even in the most basic of their sneaker styles , this pair has none . The sole is stiff and clunky , the canvas fabric is thin and poor quality and they are in general , junk . No quality of any kind left in this previously reliable brand.My usual size in these is a 7 and that has always been 100 % comfortable and a perfect fit when worn with a pair of sport socks . This pair is saggy and baggy on top even when tied and the sides bagged out too.They WILL be going back.Save yourself time and aggravation and pass these by .
 Avoid doing business with Shoemall ! Check their feedback ! I 've made two orders with Shoemall and both times they do n't have my items in stock . It seems they do n't update on Amazon regularly . I 'll never buy from them again . Beware , they 'll charge & send you the accessory to an item and later contact you that the main item is out of stock . This happened to me both times I 've ordered . Really bad business practices !
 I have an old pair of these shoes that I have loved for a long time , but needed to replace . I ordered this pair and was very disappointed in the quality . I have only worn these shoes perhaps a dozen times and the sole is already coming apart . They also have this weird squeak with every step that I take . I will be replacing these , but will not purchase another Keds shoe .
 After reading some of the other reviews , I hesitated to purchase these Keds but decided to take a chance anyway . That was a mistake . The Keds that arrived the other day are nothing like I remember -LRB- and I lived in Keds for many years -RRB- . These are a very cheap version of the sturdy , supportive Keds of yesteryear that fit like a glove and lasted forever . The new ones are also quite a bit narrower , thinner , pointed in the toe , and feel like something you 'd get at a dollar store for a few bucks . Returning this product for a refund and wo n't be purchasing Keds in the future .
 I wore these about twice a week for about 5 weeks before they began splitting apart . To late too return them now so it was a waste of money . Very disappointed in the quality . I wore Keds for years and never had any problems with quality . Will not buy this brand again .

 I was n't looking for a good walking shoe , just a specific look ; -LRB- surprisingly hard to find simple plain blue sneakers -RRB- . Since newer reviews seemed generally positive , I thought I would take a shot . Unfortunately , these are n't acceptable even for light use . Very tight and feel like cardboard . Note
 These shoes are not as good as they used to be . Very little support . The sole is very thin . Definetly not worth the price .
 Do not buy ! The Keds quality has become garbage ! Much narrower , cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price !! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart . Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end .
 Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return !!
 the style was wonderful however even tho it said 9 med it was a trifle small-thought it might be an 8 instead-win some you lose some
 Well in one of the descriptive pictures the bottom of the shoe is all black ! The shoes I received were a brown rubber color on the bottom of the shoe . Also in another picture , the shoe inside is white and the shoes I received were blue inside . They are not as comfortable as a pair of keds that I owned years before .
 I ordered a pair of black and white keds and was sent a pair of plain black keds . In my opinion they are not nearly as cute as the black and white ones . Also , I ordered a narrow pair because I have really narrow feet , but the narrow pair is pretty tight on me . I ca n't imagine how they have extra narrow pairs because the narrow ones looked abnormally skinny . So be warned . I would have returned them but I had to wear them to a wedding as part of my bridesmaid outfit a week from the time they arrived . I probably will not be wearing them again and I wish I could return them for the black and white pair I had ordered .
 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .
 These black pumps were not at all my favorite pumps to wear ; after one hour I had to take them off and that 's with a gel shoe pad in them . The size runs weirdly long but small . However , I still love Charles David for all my dressy shoe needs and will give them a second chance .

 Even though I ordered my normal size , these shoes pinched my toes painfully . I ended up throwing them in a donation box .
 They sent the wrong color LEDs , I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked .
 I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them . Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable . Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now . Some stuff should be left in the 80s !!

 In any shoe I ideally I wear a 7 1/2 W. I usually end up with an 8 M because there is no wide width offered . This summer I wanted canvas tennis shoes for summer and decided to try some Keds . There seems to be no consistency of sizing , however , between colors or styles , and I have had to try different colors and styles due to `` not available '' items . Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug . So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long , but wide enough . I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W -LRB- no Chambray available in 7 W -RRB- and it was waaay too short and very tight . I do n't think a size 8 W would even fit . This idea of shoes `` running small '' or `` running large '' makes no sense to me . Just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it .
 I was so disappointed with these shoes . In fact , I returned them . The quality is not that of the Ked 's that I grew up wearing !
 I bought these shoes in black to match my work uniform only to receive them in the mail to discover that they are super narrow . It 's like these shoes are designed for rabbits or something . Thankfully amazon has very easy returns . If you decide to buy these shoes online try them on first , or read the return policy .
 I bought the white leather sneakers for $ 38 at a DSW store awhile ago . Let me tell you , they do NOT last . I bought Keds hoping for a quality , practical , and stylish shoe that I could wear with anything for a few years . This is what you could expect a few years ago , that Keds were STRONG shoes . Well surprise , they barely lasted one season . The bottom sole of the shoe came unglue from the rest of the shoe , and most of the white leather chipped off leaving patches of brown . Looks terrible , no way worth my $ 40 .
 3 weeks after buying these shoes , i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined . This never happened to the cheap Target brand we bought . I have to throw them away . The insole does n't come out so I ca n't even try to bleach them .
 I got these shoes in December and they are VERY cheap . NOT worth the money . I could have gone to a local store and paid a lot less . Additionally , the shoes I received did not look like the shoe in the photo . The shoe i received was more of a sketcher type shoe with a longer top . I would NOT recommend them to a friend or relative . They are not what i expected . the top of the shoe is already coming apart . I 've had Keds before and I do n't know if it was just this pair , but I will not buy shoes this way again .
 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .
 I 've ordered Ked 's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality . The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $ 5 . No support , thin canvas - just junk . I 'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe . I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to . No support , no padding , more narrow , thinner canvas . I 've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference . Save your money . You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $ 5 - $ 8 , it just wo n't have a Keds tag . This is no longer the bargain it once was . Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator . What 's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe do n't even know it 's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago .
 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?
 I bought this sneaker from my Mom who has worn the same style for years . I 'm sorry to say that we were not happy with our purchase - it seems that the mold for the shoe has changed - the stitching on the top of the shoe is in a different place and does not make this a comfortable shoe for my mom .
 I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them . They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them . I will not purchase any Keds in the future .
 The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem . The shoes that arrived had been worn . I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had . He made a good offer however , I decided to wash the shoes and keep them , which I did . Now , I have an infection on my toe . Not good .
 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 I love the way my shoes look and fit . However , the right sole came unglued within 2 weeks . I was very disappointed because they are unwearable . I usually have good luck with Roos , and maybe I got a bad pair , but do n't say you were n't warned !

 These shoes are not as good as they used to be . Very little support . The sole is very thin . Definetly not worth the price .
 In any shoe I ideally I wear a 7 1/2 W. I usually end up with an 8 M because there is no wide width offered . This summer I wanted canvas tennis shoes for summer and decided to try some Keds . There seems to be no consistency of sizing , however , between colors or styles , and I have had to try different colors and styles due to `` not available '' items . Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug . So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long , but wide enough .

 Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return !!
 the style was wonderful however even tho it said 9 med it was a trifle small-thought it might be an 8 instead-win some you lose some
 Well in one of the descriptive pictures the bottom of the shoe is all black ! The shoes I received were a brown rubber color on the bottom of the shoe . Also in another picture , the shoe inside is white and the shoes I received were blue inside . They are not as comfortable as a pair of keds that I owned years before .
 I ordered a pair of black and white keds and was sent a pair of plain black keds . In my opinion they are not nearly as cute as the black and white ones . Also , I ordered a narrow pair because I have really narrow feet , but the narrow pair is pretty tight on me . I ca n't imagine how they have extra narrow pairs because the narrow ones looked abnormally skinny . So be warned . I would have returned them but I had to wear them to a wedding as part of my bridesmaid outfit a week from the time they arrived . I probably will not be wearing them again and I wish I could return them for the black and white pair I had ordered .
 Do not buy ! The Keds quality has become garbage ! Much narrower , cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price !! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart . Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end .
 I almost always wear a size 6 but as soon as I put these on , they hurt my feet . They are extremely narrow - returned right away .
 These Navy blue Keds were more black than navy blue . The picture of the shoes on Amazon was very different than the one I received . I put them next to my black keds and you could not tell the difference between the navy blue and the black keds . Very disappointing .
 I ordered these Navy Keds tennis shoes for my daughter . The color shows navy , but when they arrived they looked black ... the box said navy ! Had to return because of the shade .

 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?
 I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them . Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable . Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now . Some stuff should be left in the 80s !!
 Even though I ordered my normal size , these shoes pinched my toes painfully . I ended up throwing them in a donation box .
 I have worn Keds sneakers for many years , always ordering size 6.5 . The label in the sneaker and the box are labeled 6.5 , but this sneaker is at most size 5 , or it is a child 's sneaker.Very disappointed .
 The shoes were an amazing fit , but when I washed them -- in cold water , I might add -- the blue dye from the soles bled out onto the white canvas . Perhaps , it will wash away next time , but I was more than miffed .
 Not only is the canvas cheap & lightweight , it has a bluish tinge to it . The tongue of the shoe is only sewn halfway ... i.e. , the inside is merely the raw cut . The first time I washed them -LRB- in cold water -RRB- , the blue dye from the inside bled thru to the white upper . Very disappointed in what was formerly a great basic sneaker ... I suppose Keds has succombed to the Chinese influence . Very sad indeed .
 I bought these in both white and stone . I really like the stone , as it does n't seem to stand out as much as the white . Also , it 's a nice change from white all the time . My mom liked the stone color when she saw mine , so I ordered a pair for her as well.We 've noticed there is a change in the way Keds have been made since the 90s . They are not as comfortable . The arch can be `` bumpy '' or nonexistent , and they run a little small . I wear a size 8 , and the stone pair are tight on me . Tighter than the white for some reason . I 'm sure they will get better as they break in , but I 've never had a pair of Keds that is this tight . My feet actually hurt the first day I wore them . That never happened to me with Keds . And I have narrow feet . Someone with a wider foot could n't wear these comfortably , at all . The sneakers also do n't last as long as they used to . I wore Keds a lot when I was in high school , and one pair would last me a long time . Now , I notice the edges at the bottom of the shoes start to come apart with much less wear , and the footbed becomes very flat and uncomfortable . They do n't feel as cushiony as they used to , even when brand new . Very different . Wearable , and I like them , but they are not as good as they used to be . I suspect they were not made in China a decade + ago . I think they are made smaller than they used to be , because even looking at my feet while wearing them , I noticed they make my feet look smaller . I like that , but , not at the expense of comfort . I might try an 8 1/2 next time . The white fit better for some reason , not so small.Update
 Eh . I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap , but I should have paid more attention to the reviews . The quality is way low with these shoes . They 're super uncomfortable and make your toes feel like they 're packed in sardines . -LRB- And I have really small feet - I 'm a women 's 5.5 -RRB- Now that I see them on my feet , they do n't even look that cute . Anyone who buys KEDS for the first time ONLINE should realize that they are exactly what they seem
 The shipping cost was less than what it would have cost me in gas to go the store to buy
 I bought my black Keds last winter . Within 6 months , there was a hole in the canvas above the toe of the left shoe . -LRB- Not because the shoe was too small , but because the canvas was extremely thin . -RRB- Also , the soles look much thicker in the photos than in reality .
 My new sneakers broke my heart ! They have been making subtle changes for the past several years . This last one was too much . I have been wearing Keds sneakers for about 60 years and absolutely loved them . Several years ago they came out with flared soles , -LRB- I said to myself , I guess I can live with that . -RRB- Then they began making the toes more pointed . Did n't really like that . What 's wrong with toe room ? Time for new ones - pictures showed the flared soles were gone -LRB- GREAT -RRB- . Ordered a pair . The toes are still too pointed , but the insole is as hard as a rock -LRB- maybe not quite -RRB- and the built in arch support was gone ! They had a perfect product and really ruined it . I could just cry . I returned my shoes and they were very kind and gave me a full refund .
 If you order these Keds sneakers today you will NOT be getting the same sneaker that has reviews from a year or more ago . Believe me , they are entirely different.Well , darn . As an almost life-long Keds wearer I can say with some authority that what I received are NOTHING like any pair of Keds sneakers I 've ever had before.Previously there was at least light arch support even in the most basic of their sneaker styles , this pair has none . The sole is stiff and clunky , the canvas fabric is thin and poor quality and they are in general , junk . No quality of any kind left in this previously reliable brand.My usual size in these is a 7 and that has always been 100 % comfortable and a perfect fit when worn with a pair of sport socks . This pair is saggy and baggy on top even when tied and the sides bagged out too.They WILL be going back.Save yourself time and aggravation and pass these by .
 Avoid doing business with Shoemall ! Check their feedback ! I 've made two orders with Shoemall and both times they do n't have my items in stock . It seems they do n't update on Amazon regularly . I 'll never buy from them again . Beware , they 'll charge & send you the accessory to an item and later contact you that the main item is out of stock . This happened to me both times I 've ordered . Really bad business practices !
 I have an old pair of these shoes that I have loved for a long time , but needed to replace . I ordered this pair and was very disappointed in the quality . I have only worn these shoes perhaps a dozen times and the sole is already coming apart . They also have this weird squeak with every step that I take . I will be replacing these , but will not purchase another Keds shoe .
 After reading some of the other reviews , I hesitated to purchase these Keds but decided to take a chance anyway . That was a mistake . The Keds that arrived the other day are nothing like I remember -LRB- and I lived in Keds for many years -RRB- . These are a very cheap version of the sturdy , supportive Keds of yesteryear that fit like a glove and lasted forever . The new ones are also quite a bit narrower , thinner , pointed in the toe , and feel like something you 'd get at a dollar store for a few bucks . Returning this product for a refund and wo n't be purchasing Keds in the future .
 I wore these about twice a week for about 5 weeks before they began splitting apart . To late too return them now so it was a waste of money . Very disappointed in the quality . I wore Keds for years and never had any problems with quality . Will not buy this brand again .

 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .
 They sent the wrong color LEDs , I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked .
 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 They may be called Doc Martens , but the fit and the quality is just not there . They are noticebly shorter in length than any of my older steel toed gibsons , and the toe box is smaller . I love all my older pairs of these , so I bought a new pair because mine are showing a lot of wear . After wearing Doc martens for over 10 years without a complaint , I will NEVER buy another pair of these . CHEAPLY MADE , TIGHT-FITTING JUNK
 I 've owned a lot of doc martens in my life and I was really disappointed with this shoe . My toes were boxed in really tight and the back of the shoe was so rough and rigid that my heel was rubbed raw within an hour . If you 're looking for a long term , comfortable shoe - this is n't it . I went back to my 5-eye padded collar and have n't looked back .
 I bought these because they are an iconic look and high quality construction . This is the last pair I 'd buy . After 6 months of walking in them and thinking &#34; gosh , I thought they 'd be more comfortable , but I guess I just do n't know &#34; , and countless blisters on the back from the relatively thin material with no padding in the back , I decided to go for a pair of RedWings.Wow , I 'll never go back . The RedWings look nearly as good but boyyyyyyyyyyy are they more comfortable . Not even in the same ballpark . I 've got a 3 year old pair of wings that I 've worn every day at work and the soles are starting to wear through , and they 're still a lot more comfortable than the Docs ever were ...
 I had a pair of Doc Martins they lasted me for 3 years they were so comfortable and durable . I needed a pair of steel toe shoes for work so I decided to give them a try they were the worst pair of shoes I 've ever had . They blistered my feet and they didnt even last a year . I do n't know if Doc Martin just went to a lower quality or what but please do n't waste your time on these shoes . Check some of the other shoes with better ratings .
 I almost always wear a size 6 but as soon as I put these on , they hurt my feet . They are extremely narrow - returned right away .

 I was n't looking for a good walking shoe , just a specific look ; -LRB- surprisingly hard to find simple plain blue sneakers -RRB- . Since newer reviews seemed generally positive , I thought I would take a shot . Unfortunately , these are n't acceptable even for light use . Very tight and feel like cardboard . Note
 The shoes were an amazing fit , but when I washed them -- in cold water , I might add -- the blue dye from the soles bled out onto the white canvas . Perhaps , it will wash away next time , but I was more than miffed .

 I 've ordered Ked 's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality . The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $ 5 . No support , thin canvas - just junk . I 'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe . I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to . No support , no padding , more narrow , thinner canvas . I 've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference . Save your money . You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $ 5 - $ 8 , it just wo n't have a Keds tag . This is no longer the bargain it once was . Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator . What 's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe do n't even know it 's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago .
 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?
 I bought this sneaker from my Mom who has worn the same style for years . I 'm sorry to say that we were not happy with our purchase - it seems that the mold for the shoe has changed - the stitching on the top of the shoe is in a different place and does not make this a comfortable shoe for my mom .
 I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them . They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them . I will not purchase any Keds in the future .
 The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem . The shoes that arrived had been worn . I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had . He made a good offer however , I decided to wash the shoes and keep them , which I did . Now , I have an infection on my toe . Not good .

I 've had Keds before and I do n't know if it was just this pair , but I will not buy shoes this way again .
 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .
 3 weeks after buying these shoes , i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined . This never happened to the cheap Target brand we bought . I have to throw them away . The insole does n't come out so I ca n't even try to bleach them .
 They sent the wrong color LEDs , I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked .
 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them . Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable . Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now . Some stuff should be left in the 80s !!
 Even though I ordered my normal size , these shoes pinched my toes painfully . I ended up throwing them in a donation box .
 Eh . I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap , but I should have paid more attention to the reviews . The quality is way low with these shoes . They 're super uncomfortable and make your toes feel like they 're packed in sardines . -LRB- And I have really small feet - I 'm a women 's 5.5 -RRB- Now that I see them on my feet , they do n't even look that cute . Anyone who buys KEDS for the first time ONLINE should realize that they are exactly what they seem
 The shipping cost was less than what it would have cost me in gas to go the store to buy
 In any shoe I ideally I wear a 7 1/2 W. I usually end up with an 8 M because there is no wide width offered . This summer I wanted canvas tennis shoes for summer and decided to try some Keds . There seems to be no consistency of sizing , however , between colors or styles , and I have had to try different colors and styles due to `` not available '' items . Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug . So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long , but wide enough . I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W -LRB- no Chambray available in 7 W -RRB- and it was waaay too short and very tight . I do n't think a size 8 W would even fit . This idea of shoes `` running small '' or `` running large '' makes no sense to me . Just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it .
 I was so disappointed with these shoes . In fact , I returned them . The quality is not that of the Ked 's that I grew up wearing !
 I bought these shoes in black to match my work uniform only to receive them in the mail to discover that they are super narrow . It 's like these shoes are designed for rabbits or something . Thankfully amazon has very easy returns . If you decide to buy these shoes online try them on first , or read the return policy .
 I bought the white leather sneakers for $ 38 at a DSW store awhile ago . Let me tell you , they do NOT last . I bought Keds hoping for a quality , practical , and stylish shoe that I could wear with anything for a few years . This is what you could expect a few years ago , that Keds were STRONG shoes . Well surprise , they barely lasted one season . The bottom sole of the shoe came unglue from the rest of the shoe , and most of the white leather chipped off leaving patches of brown . Looks terrible , no way worth my $ 40 .
 They sent the wrong color LEDs , I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked .
 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 I was n't looking for a good walking shoe , just a specific look ; -LRB- surprisingly hard to find simple plain blue sneakers -RRB- . Since newer reviews seemed generally positive , I thought I would take a shot . Unfortunately , these are n't acceptable even for light use . Very tight and feel like cardboard . Note
 I bought my black Keds last winter . Within 6 months , there was a hole in the canvas above the toe of the left shoe . -LRB- Not because the shoe was too small , but because the canvas was extremely thin . -RRB- Also , the soles look much thicker in the photos than in reality .
 My new sneakers broke my heart ! They have been making subtle changes for the past several years . This last one was too much . I have been wearing Keds sneakers for about 60 years and absolutely loved them . Several years ago they came out with flared soles , -LRB- I said to myself , I guess I can live with that . -RRB- Then they began making the toes more pointed . Did n't really like that . What 's wrong with toe room ? Time for new ones - pictures showed the flared soles were gone -LRB- GREAT -RRB- . Ordered a pair . The toes are still too pointed , but the insole is as hard as a rock -LRB- maybe not quite -RRB- and the built in arch support was gone ! They had a perfect product and really ruined it . I could just cry . I returned my shoes and they were very kind and gave me a full refund .
 If you order these Keds sneakers today you will NOT be getting the same sneaker that has reviews from a year or more ago . Believe me , they are entirely different.Well , darn . As an almost life-long Keds wearer I can say with some authority that what I received are NOTHING like any pair of Keds sneakers I 've ever had before.Previously there was at least light arch support even in the most basic of their sneaker styles , this pair has none . The sole is stiff and clunky , the canvas fabric is thin and poor quality and they are in general , junk . No quality of any kind left in this previously reliable brand.My usual size in these is a 7 and that has always been 100 % comfortable and a perfect fit when worn with a pair of sport socks . This pair is saggy and baggy on top even when tied and the sides bagged out too.They WILL be going back.Save yourself time and aggravation and pass these by .
 Avoid doing business with Shoemall ! Check their feedback ! I 've made two orders with Shoemall and both times they do n't have my items in stock . It seems they do n't update on Amazon regularly . I 'll never buy from them again . Beware , they 'll charge & send you the accessory to an item and later contact you that the main item is out of stock . This happened to me both times I 've ordered . Really bad business practices !
 I have an old pair of these shoes that I have loved for a long time , but needed to replace . I ordered this pair and was very disappointed in the quality . I have only worn these shoes perhaps a dozen times and the sole is already coming apart . They also have this weird squeak with every step that I take . I will be replacing these , but will not purchase another Keds shoe .
 After reading some of the other reviews , I hesitated to purchase these Keds but decided to take a chance anyway . That was a mistake . The Keds that arrived the other day are nothing like I remember -LRB- and I lived in Keds for many years -RRB- . These are a very cheap version of the sturdy , supportive Keds of yesteryear that fit like a glove and lasted forever . The new ones are also quite a bit narrower , thinner , pointed in the toe , and feel like something you 'd get at a dollar store for a few bucks . Returning this product for a refund and wo n't be purchasing Keds in the future .
 I wore these about twice a week for about 5 weeks before they began splitting apart . To late too return them now so it was a waste of money . Very disappointed in the quality . I wore Keds for years and never had any problems with quality . Will not buy this brand again .

 I got these shoes in December and they are VERY cheap . NOT worth the money . I could have gone to a local store and paid a lot less . Additionally , the shoes I received did not look like the shoe in the photo . The shoe i received was more of a sketcher type shoe with a longer top . I would NOT recommend them to a friend or relative . They are not what i expected . the top of the shoe is already coming apart .

 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .
 I have worn Keds sneakers for many years , always ordering size 6.5 . The label in the sneaker and the box are labeled 6.5 , but this sneaker is at most size 5 , or it is a child 's sneaker.Very disappointed .
 The shoes were an amazing fit , but when I washed them -- in cold water , I might add -- the blue dye from the soles bled out onto the white canvas . Perhaps , it will wash away next time , but I was more than miffed .
 Not only is the canvas cheap & lightweight , it has a bluish tinge to it . The tongue of the shoe is only sewn halfway ... i.e. , the inside is merely the raw cut . The first time I washed them -LRB- in cold water -RRB- , the blue dye from the inside bled thru to the white upper . Very disappointed in what was formerly a great basic sneaker ... I suppose Keds has succombed to the Chinese influence . Very sad indeed .
 I bought these in both white and stone . I really like the stone , as it does n't seem to stand out as much as the white . Also , it 's a nice change from white all the time . My mom liked the stone color when she saw mine , so I ordered a pair for her as well.We 've noticed there is a change in the way Keds have been made since the 90s . They are not as comfortable . The arch can be `` bumpy '' or nonexistent , and they run a little small . I wear a size 8 , and the stone pair are tight on me . Tighter than the white for some reason . I 'm sure they will get better as they break in , but I 've never had a pair of Keds that is this tight . My feet actually hurt the first day I wore them . That never happened to me with Keds . And I have narrow feet . Someone with a wider foot could n't wear these comfortably , at all . The sneakers also do n't last as long as they used to . I wore Keds a lot when I was in high school , and one pair would last me a long time . Now , I notice the edges at the bottom of the shoes start to come apart with much less wear , and the footbed becomes very flat and uncomfortable . They do n't feel as cushiony as they used to , even when brand new . Very different . Wearable , and I like them , but they are not as good as they used to be . I suspect they were not made in China a decade + ago . I think they are made smaller than they used to be , because even looking at my feet while wearing them , I noticed they make my feet look smaller . I like that , but , not at the expense of comfort . I might try an 8 1/2 next time . The white fit better for some reason , not so small.Update

 I bought this sneaker from my Mom who has worn the same style for years . I 'm sorry to say that we were not happy with our purchase - it seems that the mold for the shoe has changed - the stitching on the top of the shoe is in a different place and does not make this a comfortable shoe for my mom .
 I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them . They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them . I will not purchase any Keds in the future .
 The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem . The shoes that arrived had been worn . I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had . He made a good offer however , I decided to wash the shoes and keep them , which I did . Now , I have an infection on my toe . Not good .
 I 've ordered Ked 's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality . The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $ 5 . No support , thin canvas - just junk . I 'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe . I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to . No support , no padding , more narrow , thinner canvas . I 've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference . Save your money . You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $ 5 - $ 8 , it just wo n't have a Keds tag . This is no longer the bargain it once was . Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator . What 's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe do n't even know it 's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago .
 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?
 3 weeks after buying these shoes , i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined . This never happened to the cheap Target brand we bought . I have to throw them away . The insole does n't come out so I ca n't even try to bleach them .
 I ordered these Navy Keds tennis shoes for my daughter . The color shows navy , but when they arrived they looked black ... the box said navy ! Had to return because of the shade .
 These Navy blue Keds were more black than navy blue . The picture of the shoes on Amazon was very different than the one I received . I put them next to my black keds and you could not tell the difference between the navy blue and the black keds . Very disappointing .
 I almost always wear a size 6 but as soon as I put these on , they hurt my feet . They are extremely narrow - returned right away .
 Well in one of the descriptive pictures the bottom of the shoe is all black ! The shoes I received were a brown rubber color on the bottom of the shoe . Also in another picture , the shoe inside is white and the shoes I received were blue inside . They are not as comfortable as a pair of keds that I owned years before .
 I ordered a pair of black and white keds and was sent a pair of plain black keds . In my opinion they are not nearly as cute as the black and white ones . Also , I ordered a narrow pair because I have really narrow feet , but the narrow pair is pretty tight on me . I ca n't imagine how they have extra narrow pairs because the narrow ones looked abnormally skinny . So be warned . I would have returned them but I had to wear them to a wedding as part of my bridesmaid outfit a week from the time they arrived . I probably will not be wearing them again and I wish I could return them for the black and white pair I had ordered .
 Do not buy ! The Keds quality has become garbage ! Much narrower , cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price !! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart . Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end .
 Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return !!
 the style was wonderful however even tho it said 9 med it was a trifle small-thought it might be an 8 instead-win some you lose some

 I love the way my shoes look and fit . However , the right sole came unglued within 2 weeks . I was very disappointed because they are unwearable . I usually have good luck with Roos , and maybe I got a bad pair , but do n't say you were n't warned !
 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .

 Eh . I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap , but I should have paid more attention to the reviews . The quality is way low with these shoes . They 're super uncomfortable and make your toes feel like they 're packed in sardines . -LRB- And I have really small feet - I 'm a women 's 5.5 -RRB- Now that I see them on my feet , they do n't even look that cute . Anyone who buys KEDS for the first time ONLINE should realize that they are exactly what they seem
 The shipping cost was less than what it would have cost me in gas to go the store to buy
 I was n't looking for a good walking shoe , just a specific look ; -LRB- surprisingly hard to find simple plain blue sneakers -RRB- . Since newer reviews seemed generally positive , I thought I would take a shot . Unfortunately , these are n't acceptable even for light use . Very tight and feel like cardboard . Note

The first time I washed them -LRB- in cold water -RRB- , the blue dye from the inside bled thru to the white upper . Very disappointed in what was formerly a great basic sneaker ... I suppose Keds has succombed to the Chinese influence . Very sad indeed .
 I bought these in both white and stone . I really like the stone , as it does n't seem to stand out as much as the white . Also , it 's a nice change from white all the time . My mom liked the stone color when she saw mine , so I ordered a pair for her as well.We 've noticed there is a change in the way Keds have been made since the 90s . They are not as comfortable . The arch can be `` bumpy '' or nonexistent , and they run a little small . I wear a size 8 , and the stone pair are tight on me . Tighter than the white for some reason . I 'm sure they will get better as they break in , but I 've never had a pair of Keds that is this tight . My feet actually hurt the first day I wore them . That never happened to me with Keds . And I have narrow feet . Someone with a wider foot could n't wear these comfortably , at all . The sneakers also do n't last as long as they used to . I wore Keds a lot when I was in high school , and one pair would last me a long time . Now , I notice the edges at the bottom of the shoes start to come apart with much less wear , and the footbed becomes very flat and uncomfortable . They do n't feel as cushiony as they used to , even when brand new . Very different . Wearable , and I like them , but they are not as good as they used to be . I suspect they were not made in China a decade + ago . I think they are made smaller than they used to be , because even looking at my feet while wearing them , I noticed they make my feet look smaller . I like that , but , not at the expense of comfort . I might try an 8 1/2 next time . The white fit better for some reason , not so small.Update
 I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them . Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable . Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now . Some stuff should be left in the 80s !!
 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .
 I own a pair of Men 's Rockport Waterproof Moc-toe Chukkas Dark Brown , they are so not waterproof ... Rockport proved to be useless against rain . My feet got wet after I took a walk down the street in the rain , and I thought they are supposed to be `` waterproof ? '' I am very disappointed . Maybe they should be labeled `` water repellent '' instead of `` waterproof '' !!!!
 Do not buy ! The Keds quality has become garbage ! Much narrower , cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price !! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart . Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end .
 Well in one of the descriptive pictures the bottom of the shoe is all black ! The shoes I received were a brown rubber color on the bottom of the shoe . Also in another picture , the shoe inside is white and the shoes I received were blue inside . They are not as comfortable as a pair of keds that I owned years before .
 I ordered a pair of black and white keds and was sent a pair of plain black keds . In my opinion they are not nearly as cute as the black and white ones . Also , I ordered a narrow pair because I have really narrow feet , but the narrow pair is pretty tight on me . I ca n't imagine how they have extra narrow pairs because the narrow ones looked abnormally skinny . So be warned . I would have returned them but I had to wear them to a wedding as part of my bridesmaid outfit a week from the time they arrived . I probably will not be wearing them again and I wish I could return them for the black and white pair I had ordered .
 These Navy blue Keds were more black than navy blue . The picture of the shoes on Amazon was very different than the one I received . I put them next to my black keds and you could not tell the difference between the navy blue and the black keds . Very disappointing .
 I ordered these Navy Keds tennis shoes for my daughter . The color shows navy , but when they arrived they looked black ... the box said navy ! Had to return because of the shade .
 In any shoe I ideally I wear a 7 1/2 W. I usually end up with an 8 M because there is no wide width offered . This summer I wanted canvas tennis shoes for summer and decided to try some Keds . There seems to be no consistency of sizing , however , between colors or styles , and I have had to try different colors and styles due to `` not available '' items . Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug . So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long , but wide enough . I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W -LRB- no Chambray available in 7 W -RRB- and it was waaay too short and very tight . I do n't think a size 8 W would even fit . This idea of shoes `` running small '' or `` running large '' makes no sense to me . Just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it .
 I was so disappointed with these shoes . In fact , I returned them . The quality is not that of the Ked 's that I grew up wearing !
 I bought these shoes in black to match my work uniform only to receive them in the mail to discover that they are super narrow . It 's like these shoes are designed for rabbits or something . Thankfully amazon has very easy returns . If you decide to buy these shoes online try them on first , or read the return policy .
 I bought the white leather sneakers for $ 38 at a DSW store awhile ago . Let me tell you , they do NOT last . I bought Keds hoping for a quality , practical , and stylish shoe that I could wear with anything for a few years . This is what you could expect a few years ago , that Keds were STRONG shoes . Well surprise , they barely lasted one season . The bottom sole of the shoe came unglue from the rest of the shoe , and most of the white leather chipped off leaving patches of brown . Looks terrible , no way worth my $ 40 .
 3 weeks after buying these shoes , i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined . This never happened to the cheap Target brand we bought . I have to throw them away . The insole does n't come out so I ca n't even try to bleach them .
 These shoes are not as good as they used to be . Very little support . The sole is very thin . Definetly not worth the price .
 I bought this sneaker from my Mom who has worn the same style for years . I 'm sorry to say that we were not happy with our purchase - it seems that the mold for the shoe has changed - the stitching on the top of the shoe is in a different place and does not make this a comfortable shoe for my mom .
 I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them . They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them . I will not purchase any Keds in the future .
 The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem . The shoes that arrived had been worn . I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had . He made a good offer however , I decided to wash the shoes and keep them , which I did . Now , I have an infection on my toe . Not good .
 I 've ordered Ked 's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality . The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $ 5 . No support , thin canvas - just junk . I 'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe . I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to . No support , no padding , more narrow , thinner canvas . I 've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference . Save your money . You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $ 5 - $ 8 , it just wo n't have a Keds tag . This is no longer the bargain it once was . Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator . What 's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe do n't even know it 's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago .
 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?
 Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return !!
 the style was wonderful however even tho it said 9 med it was a trifle small-thought it might be an 8 instead-win some you lose some
 I got these shoes in December and they are VERY cheap . NOT worth the money . I could have gone to a local store and paid a lot less . Additionally , the shoes I received did not look like the shoe in the photo . The shoe i received was more of a sketcher type shoe with a longer top . I would NOT recommend them to a friend or relative . They are not what i expected . the top of the shoe is already coming apart . I 've had Keds before and I do n't know if it was just this pair , but I will not buy shoes this way again .
 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .
 I have worn Keds sneakers for many years , always ordering size 6.5 . The label in the sneaker and the box are labeled 6.5 , but this sneaker is at most size 5 , or it is a child 's sneaker.Very disappointed .
 The shoes were an amazing fit , but when I washed them -- in cold water , I might add -- the blue dye from the soles bled out onto the white canvas . Perhaps , it will wash away next time , but I was more than miffed .

 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 I almost always wear a size 6 but as soon as I put these on , they hurt my feet . They are extremely narrow - returned right away .
 I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them . Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable . Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now . Some stuff should be left in the 80s !!
 Even though I ordered my normal size , these shoes pinched my toes painfully . I ended up throwing them in a donation box .
 They sent the wrong color LEDs , I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked .
 Eh . I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap , but I should have paid more attention to the reviews . The quality is way low with these shoes . They 're super uncomfortable and make your toes feel like they 're packed in sardines . -LRB- And I have really small feet - I 'm a women 's 5.5 -RRB- Now that I see them on my feet , they do n't even look that cute . Anyone who buys KEDS for the first time ONLINE should realize that they are exactly what they seem
 The shipping cost was less than what it would have cost me in gas to go the store to buy
 I bought my black Keds last winter . Within 6 months , there was a hole in the canvas above the toe of the left shoe . -LRB- Not because the shoe was too small , but because the canvas was extremely thin . -RRB- Also , the soles look much thicker in the photos than in reality .
 My new sneakers broke my heart ! They have been making subtle changes for the past several years . This last one was too much . I have been wearing Keds sneakers for about 60 years and absolutely loved them . Several years ago they came out with flared soles , -LRB- I said to myself , I guess I can live with that . -RRB- Then they began making the toes more pointed . Did n't really like that . What 's wrong with toe room ? Time for new ones - pictures showed the flared soles were gone -LRB- GREAT -RRB- . Ordered a pair . The toes are still too pointed , but the insole is as hard as a rock -LRB- maybe not quite -RRB- and the built in arch support was gone ! They had a perfect product and really ruined it . I could just cry . I returned my shoes and they were very kind and gave me a full refund .
 If you order these Keds sneakers today you will NOT be getting the same sneaker that has reviews from a year or more ago . Believe me , they are entirely different.Well , darn . As an almost life-long Keds wearer I can say with some authority that what I received are NOTHING like any pair of Keds sneakers I 've ever had before.Previously there was at least light arch support even in the most basic of their sneaker styles , this pair has none . The sole is stiff and clunky , the canvas fabric is thin and poor quality and they are in general , junk . No quality of any kind left in this previously reliable brand.My usual size in these is a 7 and that has always been 100 % comfortable and a perfect fit when worn with a pair of sport socks . This pair is saggy and baggy on top even when tied and the sides bagged out too.They WILL be going back.Save yourself time and aggravation and pass these by .
 Avoid doing business with Shoemall ! Check their feedback ! I 've made two orders with Shoemall and both times they do n't have my items in stock . It seems they do n't update on Amazon regularly . I 'll never buy from them again . Beware , they 'll charge & send you the accessory to an item and later contact you that the main item is out of stock . This happened to me both times I 've ordered . Really bad business practices !
 I have an old pair of these shoes that I have loved for a long time , but needed to replace . I ordered this pair and was very disappointed in the quality . I have only worn these shoes perhaps a dozen times and the sole is already coming apart . They also have this weird squeak with every step that I take . I will be replacing these , but will not purchase another Keds shoe .
 After reading some of the other reviews , I hesitated to purchase these Keds but decided to take a chance anyway . That was a mistake . The Keds that arrived the other day are nothing like I remember -LRB- and I lived in Keds for many years -RRB- . These are a very cheap version of the sturdy , supportive Keds of yesteryear that fit like a glove and lasted forever . The new ones are also quite a bit narrower , thinner , pointed in the toe , and feel like something you 'd get at a dollar store for a few bucks . Returning this product for a refund and wo n't be purchasing Keds in the future .
 I wore these about twice a week for about 5 weeks before they began splitting apart . To late too return them now so it was a waste of money . Very disappointed in the quality . I wore Keds for years and never had any problems with quality . Will not buy this brand again .

Additionally , the shoes I received did not look like the shoe in the photo . The shoe i received was more of a sketcher type shoe with a longer top . I would NOT recommend them to a friend or relative . They are not what i expected . the top of the shoe is already coming apart . I 've had Keds before and I do n't know if it was just this pair , but I will not buy shoes this way again .
 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .
 They sent the wrong color LEDs , I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked .
 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 I bought my black Keds last winter . Within 6 months , there was a hole in the canvas above the toe of the left shoe . -LRB- Not because the shoe was too small , but because the canvas was extremely thin . -RRB- Also , the soles look much thicker in the photos than in reality .
 My new sneakers broke my heart ! They have been making subtle changes for the past several years . This last one was too much . I have been wearing Keds sneakers for about 60 years and absolutely loved them . Several years ago they came out with flared soles , -LRB- I said to myself , I guess I can live with that . -RRB- Then they began making the toes more pointed . Did n't really like that . What 's wrong with toe room ? Time for new ones - pictures showed the flared soles were gone -LRB- GREAT -RRB- . Ordered a pair . The toes are still too pointed , but the insole is as hard as a rock -LRB- maybe not quite -RRB- and the built in arch support was gone ! They had a perfect product and really ruined it . I could just cry . I returned my shoes and they were very kind and gave me a full refund .
 If you order these Keds sneakers today you will NOT be getting the same sneaker that has reviews from a year or more ago . Believe me , they are entirely different.Well , darn . As an almost life-long Keds wearer I can say with some authority that what I received are NOTHING like any pair of Keds sneakers I 've ever had before.Previously there was at least light arch support even in the most basic of their sneaker styles , this pair has none . The sole is stiff and clunky , the canvas fabric is thin and poor quality and they are in general , junk . No quality of any kind left in this previously reliable brand.My usual size in these is a 7 and that has always been 100 % comfortable and a perfect fit when worn with a pair of sport socks . This pair is saggy and baggy on top even when tied and the sides bagged out too.They WILL be going back.Save yourself time and aggravation and pass these by .
 Avoid doing business with Shoemall ! Check their feedback ! I 've made two orders with Shoemall and both times they do n't have my items in stock . It seems they do n't update on Amazon regularly . I 'll never buy from them again . Beware , they 'll charge & send you the accessory to an item and later contact you that the main item is out of stock . This happened to me both times I 've ordered . Really bad business practices !
 I have an old pair of these shoes that I have loved for a long time , but needed to replace . I ordered this pair and was very disappointed in the quality . I have only worn these shoes perhaps a dozen times and the sole is already coming apart . They also have this weird squeak with every step that I take . I will be replacing these , but will not purchase another Keds shoe .
 After reading some of the other reviews , I hesitated to purchase these Keds but decided to take a chance anyway . That was a mistake . The Keds that arrived the other day are nothing like I remember -LRB- and I lived in Keds for many years -RRB- . These are a very cheap version of the sturdy , supportive Keds of yesteryear that fit like a glove and lasted forever . The new ones are also quite a bit narrower , thinner , pointed in the toe , and feel like something you 'd get at a dollar store for a few bucks . Returning this product for a refund and wo n't be purchasing Keds in the future .
 I wore these about twice a week for about 5 weeks before they began splitting apart . To late too return them now so it was a waste of money . Very disappointed in the quality . I wore Keds for years and never had any problems with quality . Will not buy this brand again .

 I have worn Keds sneakers for many years , always ordering size 6.5 . The label in the sneaker and the box are labeled 6.5 , but this sneaker is at most size 5 , or it is a child 's sneaker.Very disappointed .
 I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them . Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable . Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now . Some stuff should be left in the 80s !!
 The shoes were an amazing fit , but when I washed them -- in cold water , I might add -- the blue dye from the soles bled out onto the white canvas . Perhaps , it will wash away next time , but I was more than miffed .
 Not only is the canvas cheap & lightweight , it has a bluish tinge to it . The tongue of the shoe is only sewn halfway ... i.e. , the inside is merely the raw cut . The first time I washed them -LRB- in cold water -RRB- , the blue dye from the inside bled thru to the white upper . Very disappointed in what was formerly a great basic sneaker ... I suppose Keds has succombed to the Chinese influence . Very sad indeed .
 I bought these in both white and stone . I really like the stone , as it does n't seem to stand out as much as the white . Also , it 's a nice change from white all the time . My mom liked the stone color when she saw mine , so I ordered a pair for her as well.We 've noticed there is a change in the way Keds have been made since the 90s . They are not as comfortable . The arch can be `` bumpy '' or nonexistent , and they run a little small . I wear a size 8 , and the stone pair are tight on me . Tighter than the white for some reason . I 'm sure they will get better as they break in , but I 've never had a pair of Keds that is this tight . My feet actually hurt the first day I wore them . That never happened to me with Keds . And I have narrow feet . Someone with a wider foot could n't wear these comfortably , at all . The sneakers also do n't last as long as they used to . I wore Keds a lot when I was in high school , and one pair would last me a long time . Now , I notice the edges at the bottom of the shoes start to come apart with much less wear , and the footbed becomes very flat and uncomfortable . They do n't feel as cushiony as they used to , even when brand new . Very different . Wearable , and I like them , but they are not as good as they used to be . I suspect they were not made in China a decade + ago . I think they are made smaller than they used to be , because even looking at my feet while wearing them , I noticed they make my feet look smaller . I like that , but , not at the expense of comfort . I might try an 8 1/2 next time . The white fit better for some reason , not so small.Update
 Even though I ordered my normal size , these shoes pinched my toes painfully . I ended up throwing them in a donation box .
 Eh . I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap , but I should have paid more attention to the reviews . The quality is way low with these shoes . They 're super uncomfortable and make your toes feel like they 're packed in sardines . -LRB- And I have really small feet - I 'm a women 's 5.5 -RRB- Now that I see them on my feet , they do n't even look that cute . Anyone who buys KEDS for the first time ONLINE should realize that they are exactly what they seem
 The shipping cost was less than what it would have cost me in gas to go the store to buy
 I bought this sneaker from my Mom who has worn the same style for years . I 'm sorry to say that we were not happy with our purchase - it seems that the mold for the shoe has changed - the stitching on the top of the shoe is in a different place and does not make this a comfortable shoe for my mom .
 I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them . They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them . I will not purchase any Keds in the future .
 The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem . The shoes that arrived had been worn . I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had . He made a good offer however , I decided to wash the shoes and keep them , which I did . Now , I have an infection on my toe . Not good .
 I 've ordered Ked 's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality . The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $ 5 . No support , thin canvas - just junk . I 'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe . I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to . No support , no padding , more narrow , thinner canvas . I 've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference . Save your money . You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $ 5 - $ 8 , it just wo n't have a Keds tag . This is no longer the bargain it once was . Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator . What 's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe do n't even know it 's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago .
 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?
 Do not buy ! The Keds quality has become garbage ! Much narrower , cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price !! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart . Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end .
 I almost always wear a size 6 but as soon as I put these on , they hurt my feet . They are extremely narrow - returned right away .
 These Navy blue Keds were more black than navy blue . The picture of the shoes on Amazon was very different than the one I received . I put them next to my black keds and you could not tell the difference between the navy blue and the black keds . Very disappointing .
 I ordered these Navy Keds tennis shoes for my daughter . The color shows navy , but when they arrived they looked black ... the box said navy ! Had to return because of the shade .
 These shoes are not as good as they used to be . Very little support . The sole is very thin . Definetly not worth the price .
 Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return !!
 the style was wonderful however even tho it said 9 med it was a trifle small-thought it might be an 8 instead-win some you lose some
 3 weeks after buying these shoes , i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined . This never happened to the cheap Target brand we bought . I have to throw them away . The insole does n't come out so I ca n't even try to bleach them .
 Well in one of the descriptive pictures the bottom of the shoe is all black ! The shoes I received were a brown rubber color on the bottom of the shoe . Also in another picture , the shoe inside is white and the shoes I received were blue inside . They are not as comfortable as a pair of keds that I owned years before .
 I ordered a pair of black and white keds and was sent a pair of plain black keds . In my opinion they are not nearly as cute as the black and white ones . Also , I ordered a narrow pair because I have really narrow feet , but the narrow pair is pretty tight on me . I ca n't imagine how they have extra narrow pairs because the narrow ones looked abnormally skinny . So be warned . I would have returned them but I had to wear them to a wedding as part of my bridesmaid outfit a week from the time they arrived . I probably will not be wearing them again and I wish I could return them for the black and white pair I had ordered .
 In any shoe I ideally I wear a 7 1/2 W. I usually end up with an 8 M because there is no wide width offered . This summer I wanted canvas tennis shoes for summer and decided to try some Keds . There seems to be no consistency of sizing , however , between colors or styles , and I have had to try different colors and styles due to `` not available '' items . Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug . So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long , but wide enough . I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W -LRB- no Chambray available in 7 W -RRB- and it was waaay too short and very tight . I do n't think a size 8 W would even fit . This idea of shoes `` running small '' or `` running large '' makes no sense to me . Just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it .
 I was so disappointed with these shoes . In fact , I returned them . The quality is not that of the Ked 's that I grew up wearing !
 I bought these shoes in black to match my work uniform only to receive them in the mail to discover that they are super narrow . It 's like these shoes are designed for rabbits or something . Thankfully amazon has very easy returns . If you decide to buy these shoes online try them on first , or read the return policy .
 I bought the white leather sneakers for $ 38 at a DSW store awhile ago . Let me tell you , they do NOT last . I bought Keds hoping for a quality , practical , and stylish shoe that I could wear with anything for a few years . This is what you could expect a few years ago , that Keds were STRONG shoes . Well surprise , they barely lasted one season . The bottom sole of the shoe came unglue from the rest of the shoe , and most of the white leather chipped off leaving patches of brown . Looks terrible , no way worth my $ 40 .
 I own this shoe in other colors but received the olive and it had a sharp nailhead coming through the sole . Too much of a hassle to return !!!
 I bought these shoes from Eastbay . They are the worst pair of shoes that I have ever worn in my life . After wearing them for less than a week , I have identical cuts on both of my ankles from where the shoe jabbed into my skin . There is a flexible backing on the shoe which is sewn to the inside right where your ankle goes . As you walk , it grinds into your ankle and makes walking extremely uncomfortable . I HIGHLY recommend not buying this product .
 I work long hours -LRB- 12 a day -RRB- and my other Dr. Martens are great and comfortable . this pair is very small .
 I hate to review these shoes so low , because they do look really good . However , they kill my feet after 30 minutes of wearing them . I have tried them with insoles because my feet and back hurt from just 3 hours of standing with them , and that only made them worse . The little bit of added height made blisters on my toes . The problem is , without them your lower back will kill you if you do walking or standing throughout the day . If you have a desk job they work just fine , but if you have to stand or walk quite a bit I would n't EVER recommend these shoes to anyone .
 Nice shoe , seems like good construction , but the thong part that goes across the top of my foot was really uncomfortable . It is n't made of a very forgiving material , so after a few hours of wear -LRB- especially getting them wet -RRB- was really digging into my tops of my feet , causing blisters/skin to wear off . And yes , I ordered the right size . Might be a better fit if you do n't have big/wide feet ?
 I purchased these about 3 months ago . When I first got them , I was very pleased with the build quality . However , for the first month or so that I wore them , I got blisters/bruises right around the V part of the sandal-where the upper part connects to the bottom part . After wearing them all day for a couple dozen days , they started breaking in and getting comfortable . However , shortly after they were properly broken in , the little piece of fabric that connects the upper part of the shoe to the buttom part half-way broke off . -LRB- It 's really difficult to explain without actually seeing the shoe , but half of the fabric essentially did n't connect to the bottom part of the shoe . The piece of fabric was just poorly glued to the little widget that slides into the groove next to your big toe . -RRB- I was very dissapointed with these shoes . I would strongly suggest that you do not buy these .
 I purchased these sandals as they looked comfortable and were a good price . When I received the sandals I wore them pretty much every day I could . They were uncomfortable at first -LRB- as are all new shoes -RRB- but after a while they were great . That was until one day when I was leaning forward to pick something up and the toe divider snapped off the sandal . I felt pretty ripped off , especially from Columbia .

 I loved the shoe itself , i.e. , the quality of its production and the colors , and in general have had great experiences with new balance in the past , but I ordered the wides and they were not really wide at all.If you are not a wide foot like myself , then this will not really apply to you , and you should read another review .
 Nowhere does it say this shoe has a slip-in insole . I HATE removable insoles so I 'm returning . Also , the box came sealed like new shoes , but one shoe had been laced - rather sloppily leaving twisty creases in the lace - a clear indication this was a return or a store second . Not sure I 'm guaranteed a factory-fresh shoe when I buy thru Amazon , but that 's what I expected . Would n't you ?
 First , these shoes look amazing . The navy suede over the silver really stands out . The N logo on the side even shimmers in the sunlight . So in that regard , they were perfect.As for comfort , they 're as good as any Airwalks or Vans I 've ever worn before . The insole is n't super thick , but it offers some protection from the rocks and whatnot.The durability , unfortunately , does n't seem to be working out for me . One of the shoes , the tighter of the two when I tried them on , has stretched out at least half a size in under a month . It went from rubbing my big toe a bit to my heel suddenly slipping out of the cup . I tried new insoles , that did n't work . I tried the heel lock lacing , and that did n't work . It just seems to be too big for my foot now , a little over a month after the purchase.It 's very frustrating , as I loved the shoes originally , but now my heel is sore from rubbing against the back of the shoe .
 im really so disappointed with this new balance , its really hard to wear it for long hours , my feet hurts , now i dont know what to do with it , i probably just gon na throw it on the trash , i wasted $ 38 , dont be fooled by false reviews , i have the same 574 but i bought it from a local store and its really good , the reason i bought the next one from amazon because it was hard to find the EE size at local stores , i should have a refund for this , i know amazon dont return worn shoes , but i was expecting same comfort as the one i bought from a local store , iam very dissappointed
 Only one color is available for the sale price , and not even in all sizes . It should read `` Sale . $ 39.99 on selected color ... ''
 Bought these for my husband and was wondering why they were so cheap . We love New Balance . But these were made in China !! What 's up New Balance ? We love you cause you 're made in the USA !!!
 Both of these were smaller than any 13 shoe I 've ever worn , especially the right shoe , which is too small to even wear . The silver finish is worn off around the edge like they 'd already been used . Not a good purchase
 Defective product , left shoe too tight and a bit short ! I have had three other pairs of New Balance 574 ' s with out a problem .
 Hard like a rock box label 8.5 ee But 8.5 gave them to Salvation Army not worth your time looking ordering waiting then you still have to buy again . I will be glad when gov takes control
 left one of pair is warped . . I wish I did n't make this purchase.if you do n't see and touch anything you want to buy , do not buy it .
 I was greatly disappointed in fit , very narrow compared with previous New Balace shoes purchased over the last 25 + years . I will not buy NB again .

 3 months with them and my left boot it open in half i think the glue they use is not good i mean 70 bucks for 3 months is not worth it
 Oversize and they pinch my legs . I had to trim the top 1/2 inch off the boots to keep my legs from bleeding they hurt so bad . Cheap Crap but a notch better than Walmart boots .
 This pair of boots are too tight and between sizes is big jump , i do n't know if there is any other way I can stretch them a bit , they are also only made for soft soil , asphalt concrete will finish them too fast
 I 'd ordered these boots based on decent reviews and price . I rarely return purchases to Amazon but I did return these . The boots were fairly heavy , stiff and narrow . I get that new boots will be stiff but both the uppers and lowers were too stiff for me . I returned them and bought Adidas boots with Gore Tex uppers which were much more comfortable , flexible and light with good sole traction .
 I have purchased and worn these boots for years , but since manufacturing has moved to Indonesia the boots are smaller sizes and very narrow . I recently ordered two pairs of these boots in their widest size . Upon arrival I compared them to my old boots that are a `` d '' width . THEY ARE EXACTLY THE SAME ! THERE IS NO WIDE , THEY ARE THE SAME WIDTH !!!!!! I contacted Hi-Tec in regard to the problem because I like to give a person/company a chance to correct the error . Some woman wrote back to me sayin that they were aware of the problems and were currently awaiting another shipment . Nothing about them being sorry for being so stupid as to move the manufacturing from the US . No offer to send me a correct pair . I DO N'T KNOW IF THE CO. . SOLD OR WHAT BUT IF THEY CA N'T TREAT LONG TIME LOYAL CUSTOMERS BETTER THAN THIS THEN i WILL GO SOMEWHERE ELSE ! ANOTHER AMERICAN CO SELLING OUT FOR THE ALMIGHTY DOLLAR-WHAT A SHAME.SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE THAT WILL FIT AMERICAN MENS FEET . SHAME ON YOU HI-TEC !
 I thought how could you go wrong with 270 plus positive reviews but shoes are probably the most difficult thing to review because hardly anyone has the same foot or preferences . And they really need to fit well and feel good or they can ruin what should be a good time . Shoes are one thing you should n't buy just for the price.I bought these for hiking but as soon as I put them on I knew I 'd be in trouble after a day out in these . While the fit is great -LRB- it 's very hard to find boots that come wide -RRB- there is hardly any cushion inside - anywhere . They just did not feel comfortable . I prefer to wear thin socks so that does n't make up the lack of comfort . The lining even feels rough . But the worst is the seam that hits right at the ball of my ankle . Scrape , scrape , scrape , that 's all I could feel . Imagine several hours of that . I also did n't notice any arch support at all.Based on other reviews it also seems that the quality is not consistent . I do n't think that was the problem with mine , they just do n't work with my feet .
 I hike several days a week all year in rough mountain terrain , much of it off-trail and over rocks . I 've gone through several pairs of these Hi-Tec Altitude boots over the years . The factory supplied insoles are comfortable initially , but are made of a compressible closed cell foam that eventually does not rebound from compression well after some months of use . When the foam becomes compressed , the padded effect is lost and my feet begin to hurt . This can be solved by purchasing and installing an aftermarket pair of insoles such as the Sole Softec Ultra foodbeds , or another quality insole.This problem is not exclusive to Hi-Tec , as I 've seen it with other boots and running shoes also . Some aftermarket insoles/footbeds are made of resilient material that does not tend to stay compressed with heavy use . I am not sure why the manufacturers of boots and shoes do n't just use suitable footbeds in the first place , but I assume that they save a little money by doing what they do.Aside from the poor insoles , the boots themselves are comfortable , keep my feet warm in fairly cold weather even though they are not insulated , and the soles provide good traction.UPDATE 2-26-2012My son purchased a pair of these Hi Tec Altitude boots in the last year . After only 100 miles of hiking , the traction lugs on the soles were deteriorating very badly and coming off . Suspect a bad batch of the sole composite material . I purchased some of the very first Hi Tec boots when they first came out and they held up very well . Then , some years ago , our family had backpacked twelve miles into a designated wilderness and the sole of my daughter 's Hi Tec boot completely separated from the upper . Lacking any repair material , I had to hike 12 miles out , drive to town several hours away , purchase a new pair of boots , drive back , and hike twelve miles back in with the new non-Hi Tec boots , just in time to join the family on a 12 mile hike out ! I 'd assumed that perhaps in the years that passed , Hi Tec had solved the quality control issues , that the experience was a fluke , and I went back to them . A mistake , apparently .
 These boots are water proof as advertized but they are not comfortable . I had to get some inserts just to wear them for a day . The lace hooks do not grab the shoe lace and hold so it is a pain just to lace them up . I would not recommend these to anyone .
 Do n't know what all the people who gave these boots a great review were thinking but these are not great boots . They did arrive on time but they are not worth the saved money . First off the boots had spots around the lower edge -LRB- where the boot and the rubber bottom meet -RRB- where there were huge holes where there was missing glue . Tried them on anyway and took them off within 2 minutes off walking around my house . They were the most uncomfortable boots I have ever tired on . They were so bad my feet and ankles hurt for an hour afterwards . The &#34; insole &#34; they put in the shoe is a joke at best . It feels like you are walking on a piece of granite . Would not recommend for anyone looking for any boot that they want to actually wear .
 Lasted about as long as a pair of boots from wally world for half the price . I live a on a small farm and I do some welding and construction . I guess for a city slicker they will last a life time .
 Either the upper was stuffed too full or I got a bad pair ? I wore these for 10 minutes and my achilles was in agony on both ankles . I tried folding the upper down into the shoe and let it sit that way to stretch it a little but it just did n't work .
 Product reviews are very subjective . Based on the reviews of this boot I hoped for a great boot at a fair price . Instead I found the boot to be subpar in terms of comfort . They shoes were stiff and far too ` roomy ' . My feet where floating inside them . I returned them immediately . I 've had far more comfortable boots right out of the box .
 They keep coming untied ! If it was n't for that I would give it 5 stars . The boot is waterproof , it is comfortable , wont give you calluses or corns . But they have hooks for wrapping the laces over at the top that no matter how you try and tie it , they will inevitably become undone ! The first time
 I am writing this review after I confirmed that my first pair of these boots are bad with manufacturing defect . After reading all these excellent reviews about the Altitude IV , I purchased a pair with high expectations . However , my first pair had a defect in the left shoe . It lacked arch support and it was uneven on the bottom which made my foot hurt . At first , I thought it was just the insole which I put in another pair on top of what is in the boots . However , it did not help , and my foot continued to hurt . Today , I went to a retail store and tried out another pair of the same model and size , and the arch support is great in both feet with proper insole cushion . I promptly exchanged my boots.All in all , my point is that I am disappointed with Hi-Tec for making bad shoes and still allowed them to be sold . 5 star for these boots but 1 star for the poor quality control .
 Length :
 The right boot sole was defective , had like a ridge on the outer edge making boot very uncomfortable to walk in . Return and refund procedure was painless . This was the second pair of these boots that had defective sole .
 The shoe seemed nice . I purchased the 2E version since I read in another review that they can be tight . Unfortunately , the top of the tongue bit into my ankle when I tied the shoe . Did n't matter which sock I wore . I had to return .
 Had these boots for a while . First thing i noticed the laces started to fall apart.I 've never seen a boot sole so sparsely treaded a bit like a tyre on your car less rubber on the road less traction and its going to wear out quicker.Because of the sole when your walking the boot seems to fold on top of your toes very annoying . The inner sole has no arch support and not much spring my feet started to ache after 20 mins walking and lay have n't done that before , had to change them.Seems to run a size to big thats not much of a problem just wore thicker socks.Fine to wear in the middle of winter but in the summer just to hot to wear , even when i put on thinest socks i could fine.They do n't seem to breath at all.No tag or loop on the back to help pull them on even my running shoes have them.Buy timberland at least lay are real leather and better soles same price !
 Although the reason I did not like the Hi-tech altitude IVs are subjective , I will at least explain why i did n't like them.First off , there are a bit big and bulky . No so much heavy as just get in your way . I did n't feel like I could have very good freedom of movement in them.they were comfortable , and felt good in terms of cushioning the sole of my foot . it 's not so much soft as much as it is slightly sloped on the medial and lateral sides of the heel the form more of a cradle for the posterior of the foot . most of this cradling is provided by the inserted sockliner.three things I was especially disappointed with were the heel height -LRB- very high , felt like you were wearing a cowboy boot -RRB- , stiff forefoot toe-up bend that made walking feel more like rocking on a semicircle plate rather that the shoe actually flexing and an unnatural overlay under the left big toe beneath the sockliner.When i think about it , it does walk and resemble a cowboy boot sole form -LRB- not tread but actual sole plate shape -RRB- and heel height . comparing them to a walking shoe , sport shoe or even a timberland boot which i compared to these , the forefoot did have much more `` rock '' to it , which i thought felt weird . for instance , the timberland boots ' toe lays flat on the ground . in this shoe , the toe will be slightly elevated off the ground . and the toe box is not very flexible to allow for the more common flattening.The unnatural and bulge under the toe could not have been normal . likely a factory defect of some type that passed unnoticed through quality control . it was not only distracting -LRB- i have a pet peeve about symmetry - each side should feel the same and equally balanced -RRB- but it was painful after a few minutes of walking if you push off your toes at all.from above , i thought the shoe was ugly , which is important to me because that is the part of the shoe you , the wearer , see most . the leather shows markings easily . and i thought the top around the ankle fit either too loose or too tight , depending on how you lace it.I do not know about it 's waterproofing ability ; I did not wear it in wet conditions . insulation to cold is average to below average . it felt about 1/2 size too small.if you are looking for a design like this , with a higher rise and similar stying , it was fairly comfortable . I do not believe the overlay bulge under the toe would be a problem with other shoes of this make and model , just an isolated incident.Amazon shipping was fast and excellent . i enrolled in Amazon Prime free because I am a college student and got 1-day shipping for $ 3.99 . great deal.just did n't like them . not for me . in the process of returning them now . hope this helps .
 The GOOD
 I have owned these boots for years . They are very good Quality and very Comfortable . They lasted me winter after winter . In fact I had to replace the Laces 3 times . Now for the pair I ordered , not good as Hi-Tec has changed their manufacturer . The pair I own and love are made in China and fit like a glove . Assuming they were the same , I purchased a pair from Amazon -LRB- which is priced excellent -RRB- but they did not fit proper at all . The Boot is now made in Malaysia or something ... and are no longer the same . Which is too bad . So as far as Amazon goes ... `` flawless as usual '' Returning them was not a problem . Just beware of these boots . Try them on at your local Store to check the comfort before you buy online.Mark from Thunder Bay ON , CANADA : -RRB-
 I have owned these boots for several years now . They fit well , are quite comfortable , and seem watertight . However , about 1 year ago I was on a hiking trip in Costa Rica . We were on a trail that needed to cross several streams to reach a waterfall . The guide took one look at my boots and told me I would have problems because several past clients had slipped on the wet rocks in similar boots . Other brands of hiking boots did not have the same problems . I noted that anytime you have water and rocks together there are potential problems of slipping , especially if there is moss . Thus , I discounted the warning . Later , at one of the waterfalls it was necessary to step on several wet stones . I found that my boots could not get any kind of grip on the slick rocks . I had never experienced anything so slick . The others in my party did not have the same problems . I usually am one of the most sure-footed hikers , but these boots made it feel like walking on ice in dress shoes . I finally had to take off my boots and go barefoot , which did not pose the same problem of slipping . One of the other men in the group told me that he was a pilot in the US Air Force and that in his squadron these Hi-Tec boots had been prohibited because there were too many injuries coming in and out of the cargo planes when it was wet . Ironically , even though these boots seem to be waterproof , you would not want to use them in a wet area that could also be slick . They seem to work fine on rough ground , even when wet . Finally , after wearing these boots for several seasons -LRB- primarily when I am outside in snow and slush -RRB- , they have developed some very annoying squeaks . So , it is embarrassing walking in a group because my boots make so much noise . Otherwise , these boots have been fine .
 I 've always bought dearforms in the past and have always been satisfied until this time . Both slipprs ripped in the same spot within three days . Last time I buy this type of slippers !!
 While I was looking forward to receiving these slippers , I have serious questions about their production . They look `` beautiful '' and are extremely comfortable ... but after wearing them for three days , the left slipper 's side fabric tore . They are no longer `` Closeback '' . Since they are no longer available from Amazon , customer service could only offer me a refund if I sent them back .

 These boots are water proof as advertized but they are not comfortable . I had to get some inserts just to wear them for a day . The lace hooks do not grab the shoe lace and hold so it is a pain just to lace them up . I would not recommend these to anyone .
 The shoe seemed nice . I purchased the 2E version since I read in another review that they can be tight . Unfortunately , the top of the tongue bit into my ankle when I tied the shoe . Did n't matter which sock I wore . I had to return .

 3 months with them and my left boot it open in half i think the glue they use is not good i mean 70 bucks for 3 months is not worth it
 Oversize and they pinch my legs . I had to trim the top 1/2 inch off the boots to keep my legs from bleeding they hurt so bad . Cheap Crap but a notch better than Walmart boots .
 This pair of boots are too tight and between sizes is big jump , i do n't know if there is any other way I can stretch them a bit , they are also only made for soft soil , asphalt concrete will finish them too fast
 The right boot sole was defective , had like a ridge on the outer edge making boot very uncomfortable to walk in . Return and refund procedure was painless . This was the second pair of these boots that had defective sole .
 Do n't know what all the people who gave these boots a great review were thinking but these are not great boots . They did arrive on time but they are not worth the saved money . First off the boots had spots around the lower edge -LRB- where the boot and the rubber bottom meet -RRB- where there were huge holes where there was missing glue . Tried them on anyway and took them off within 2 minutes off walking around my house . They were the most uncomfortable boots I have ever tired on . They were so bad my feet and ankles hurt for an hour afterwards . The &#34; insole &#34; they put in the shoe is a joke at best . It feels like you are walking on a piece of granite . Would not recommend for anyone looking for any boot that they want to actually wear .
 Lasted about as long as a pair of boots from wally world for half the price . I live a on a small farm and I do some welding and construction . I guess for a city slicker they will last a life time .

I get that new boots will be stiff but both the uppers and lowers were too stiff for me .

 I have owned these boots for several years now . They fit well , are quite comfortable , and seem watertight . However , about 1 year ago I was on a hiking trip in Costa Rica . We were on a trail that needed to cross several streams to reach a waterfall . The guide took one look at my boots and told me I would have problems because several past clients had slipped on the wet rocks in similar boots . Other brands of hiking boots did not have the same problems . I noted that anytime you have water and rocks together there are potential problems of slipping , especially if there is moss . Thus , I discounted the warning . Later , at one of the waterfalls it was necessary to step on several wet stones . I found that my boots could not get any kind of grip on the slick rocks . I had never experienced anything so slick . The others in my party did not have the same problems . I usually am one of the most sure-footed hikers , but these boots made it feel like walking on ice in dress shoes . I finally had to take off my boots and go barefoot , which did not pose the same problem of slipping . One of the other men in the group told me that he was a pilot in the US Air Force and that in his squadron these Hi-Tec boots had been prohibited because there were too many injuries coming in and out of the cargo planes when it was wet . Ironically , even though these boots seem to be waterproof , you would not want to use them in a wet area that could also be slick . They seem to work fine on rough ground , even when wet . Finally , after wearing these boots for several seasons -LRB- primarily when I am outside in snow and slush -RRB- , they have developed some very annoying squeaks . So , it is embarrassing walking in a group because my boots make so much noise . Otherwise , these boots have been fine .
 Do n't know what all the people who gave these boots a great review were thinking but these are not great boots . They did arrive on time but they are not worth the saved money . First off the boots had spots around the lower edge -LRB- where the boot and the rubber bottom meet -RRB- where there were huge holes where there was missing glue . Tried them on anyway and took them off within 2 minutes off walking around my house . They were the most uncomfortable boots I have ever tired on . They were so bad my feet and ankles hurt for an hour afterwards . The &#34; insole &#34; they put in the shoe is a joke at best . It feels like you are walking on a piece of granite . Would not recommend for anyone looking for any boot that they want to actually wear .
 Lasted about as long as a pair of boots from wally world for half the price . I live a on a small farm and I do some welding and construction . I guess for a city slicker they will last a life time .
 Either the upper was stuffed too full or I got a bad pair ? I wore these for 10 minutes and my achilles was in agony on both ankles . I tried folding the upper down into the shoe and let it sit that way to stretch it a little but it just did n't work .
 Product reviews are very subjective . Based on the reviews of this boot I hoped for a great boot at a fair price . Instead I found the boot to be subpar in terms of comfort . They shoes were stiff and far too ` roomy ' . My feet where floating inside them . I returned them immediately . I 've had far more comfortable boots right out of the box .
 They keep coming untied ! If it was n't for that I would give it 5 stars . The boot is waterproof , it is comfortable , wont give you calluses or corns . But they have hooks for wrapping the laces over at the top that no matter how you try and tie it , they will inevitably become undone ! The first time
 I am writing this review after I confirmed that my first pair of these boots are bad with manufacturing defect . After reading all these excellent reviews about the Altitude IV , I purchased a pair with high expectations . However , my first pair had a defect in the left shoe . It lacked arch support and it was uneven on the bottom which made my foot hurt . At first , I thought it was just the insole which I put in another pair on top of what is in the boots . However , it did not help , and my foot continued to hurt . Today , I went to a retail store and tried out another pair of the same model and size , and the arch support is great in both feet with proper insole cushion . I promptly exchanged my boots.All in all , my point is that I am disappointed with Hi-Tec for making bad shoes and still allowed them to be sold . 5 star for these boots but 1 star for the poor quality control .

 Had these boots for a while . First thing i noticed the laces started to fall apart.I 've never seen a boot sole so sparsely treaded a bit like a tyre on your car less rubber on the road less traction and its going to wear out quicker.Because of the sole when your walking the boot seems to fold on top of your toes very annoying . The inner sole has no arch support and not much spring my feet started to ache after 20 mins walking and lay have n't done that before , had to change them.Seems to run a size to big thats not much of a problem just wore thicker socks.Fine to wear in the middle of winter but in the summer just to hot to wear , even when i put on thinest socks i could fine.They do n't seem to breath at all.No tag or loop on the back to help pull them on even my running shoes have them.Buy timberland at least lay are real leather and better soles same price !
 These boots are water proof as advertized but they are not comfortable . I had to get some inserts just to wear them for a day . The lace hooks do not grab the shoe lace and hold so it is a pain just to lace them up . I would not recommend these to anyone .
 I thought how could you go wrong with 270 plus positive reviews but shoes are probably the most difficult thing to review because hardly anyone has the same foot or preferences . And they really need to fit well and feel good or they can ruin what should be a good time . Shoes are one thing you should n't buy just for the price.I bought these for hiking but as soon as I put them on I knew I 'd be in trouble after a day out in these . While the fit is great -LRB- it 's very hard to find boots that come wide -RRB- there is hardly any cushion inside - anywhere . They just did not feel comfortable . I prefer to wear thin socks so that does n't make up the lack of comfort . The lining even feels rough . But the worst is the seam that hits right at the ball of my ankle . Scrape , scrape , scrape , that 's all I could feel . Imagine several hours of that . I also did n't notice any arch support at all.Based on other reviews it also seems that the quality is not consistent . I do n't think that was the problem with mine , they just do n't work with my feet .
 The shoe seemed nice . I purchased the 2E version since I read in another review that they can be tight . Unfortunately , the top of the tongue bit into my ankle when I tied the shoe . Did n't matter which sock I wore . I had to return .
 The right boot sole was defective , had like a ridge on the outer edge making boot very uncomfortable to walk in . Return and refund procedure was painless . This was the second pair of these boots that had defective sole .
 When will there be smaller sizes of these shoes available ? i need 8.5 :-LRB- i 've been looking for them all over and there 's no sizes :-LRB- somebody can please help me telling me where can i get these shoes but 8.5 size ?? i will apreciate it very much , thx = -RRB-

 3 months with them and my left boot it open in half i think the glue they use is not good i mean 70 bucks for 3 months is not worth it
 Oversize and they pinch my legs . I had to trim the top 1/2 inch off the boots to keep my legs from bleeding they hurt so bad . Cheap Crap but a notch better than Walmart boots .
 This pair of boots are too tight and between sizes is big jump , i do n't know if there is any other way I can stretch them a bit , they are also only made for soft soil , asphalt concrete will finish them too fast

 I 'd ordered these boots based on decent reviews and price . I rarely return purchases to Amazon but I did return these . The boots were fairly heavy , stiff and narrow . I get that new boots will be stiff but both the uppers and lowers were too stiff for me . I returned them and bought Adidas boots with Gore Tex uppers which were much more comfortable , flexible and light with good sole traction .
 I have purchased and worn these boots for years , but since manufacturing has moved to Indonesia the boots are smaller sizes and very narrow . I recently ordered two pairs of these boots in their widest size . Upon arrival I compared them to my old boots that are a `` d '' width . THEY ARE EXACTLY THE SAME ! THERE IS NO WIDE , THEY ARE THE SAME WIDTH !!!!!! I contacted Hi-Tec in regard to the problem because I like to give a person/company a chance to correct the error . Some woman wrote back to me sayin that they were aware of the problems and were currently awaiting another shipment . Nothing about them being sorry for being so stupid as to move the manufacturing from the US . No offer to send me a correct pair . I DO N'T KNOW IF THE CO. . SOLD OR WHAT BUT IF THEY CA N'T TREAT LONG TIME LOYAL CUSTOMERS BETTER THAN THIS THEN i WILL GO SOMEWHERE ELSE ! ANOTHER AMERICAN CO SELLING OUT FOR THE ALMIGHTY DOLLAR-WHAT A SHAME.SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE THAT WILL FIT AMERICAN MENS FEET . SHAME ON YOU HI-TEC !

 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .

 These boots are water proof as advertized but they are not comfortable . I had to get some inserts just to wear them for a day . The lace hooks do not grab the shoe lace and hold so it is a pain just to lace them up . I would not recommend these to anyone .
 I hike several days a week all year in rough mountain terrain , much of it off-trail and over rocks . I 've gone through several pairs of these Hi-Tec Altitude boots over the years . The factory supplied insoles are comfortable initially , but are made of a compressible closed cell foam that eventually does not rebound from compression well after some months of use . When the foam becomes compressed , the padded effect is lost and my feet begin to hurt . This can be solved by purchasing and installing an aftermarket pair of insoles such as the Sole Softec Ultra foodbeds , or another quality insole.This problem is not exclusive to Hi-Tec , as I 've seen it with other boots and running shoes also . Some aftermarket insoles/footbeds are made of resilient material that does not tend to stay compressed with heavy use . I am not sure why the manufacturers of boots and shoes do n't just use suitable footbeds in the first place , but I assume that they save a little money by doing what they do.Aside from the poor insoles , the boots themselves are comfortable , keep my feet warm in fairly cold weather even though they are not insulated , and the soles provide good traction.UPDATE 2-26-2012My son purchased a pair of these Hi Tec Altitude boots in the last year . After only 100 miles of hiking , the traction lugs on the soles were deteriorating very badly and coming off . Suspect a bad batch of the sole composite material . I purchased some of the very first Hi Tec boots when they first came out and they held up very well . Then , some years ago , our family had backpacked twelve miles into a designated wilderness and the sole of my daughter 's Hi Tec boot completely separated from the upper . Lacking any repair material , I had to hike 12 miles out , drive to town several hours away , purchase a new pair of boots , drive back , and hike twelve miles back in with the new non-Hi Tec boots , just in time to join the family on a 12 mile hike out ! I 'd assumed that perhaps in the years that passed , Hi Tec had solved the quality control issues , that the experience was a fluke , and I went back to them . A mistake , apparently .
 I thought how could you go wrong with 270 plus positive reviews but shoes are probably the most difficult thing to review because hardly anyone has the same foot or preferences . And they really need to fit well and feel good or they can ruin what should be a good time . Shoes are one thing you should n't buy just for the price.I bought these for hiking but as soon as I put them on I knew I 'd be in trouble after a day out in these . While the fit is great -LRB- it 's very hard to find boots that come wide -RRB- there is hardly any cushion inside - anywhere . They just did not feel comfortable . I prefer to wear thin socks so that does n't make up the lack of comfort . The lining even feels rough . But the worst is the seam that hits right at the ball of my ankle . Scrape , scrape , scrape , that 's all I could feel . Imagine several hours of that . I also did n't notice any arch support at all.Based on other reviews it also seems that the quality is not consistent . I do n't think that was the problem with mine , they just do n't work with my feet .
 The right boot sole was defective , had like a ridge on the outer edge making boot very uncomfortable to walk in . Return and refund procedure was painless . This was the second pair of these boots that had defective sole .
 The shoe seemed nice . I purchased the 2E version since I read in another review that they can be tight . Unfortunately , the top of the tongue bit into my ankle when I tied the shoe . Did n't matter which sock I wore . I had to return .
 3 months with them and my left boot it open in half i think the glue they use is not good i mean 70 bucks for 3 months is not worth it
 Oversize and they pinch my legs . I had to trim the top 1/2 inch off the boots to keep my legs from bleeding they hurt so bad . Cheap Crap but a notch better than Walmart boots .
 This pair of boots are too tight and between sizes is big jump , i do n't know if there is any other way I can stretch them a bit , they are also only made for soft soil , asphalt concrete will finish them too fast
 I 'd ordered these boots based on decent reviews and price . I rarely return purchases to Amazon but I did return these . The boots were fairly heavy , stiff and narrow . I get that new boots will be stiff but both the uppers and lowers were too stiff for me . I returned them and bought Adidas boots with Gore Tex uppers which were much more comfortable , flexible and light with good sole traction .
 I have purchased and worn these boots for years , but since manufacturing has moved to Indonesia the boots are smaller sizes and very narrow . I recently ordered two pairs of these boots in their widest size . Upon arrival I compared them to my old boots that are a `` d '' width . THEY ARE EXACTLY THE SAME ! THERE IS NO WIDE , THEY ARE THE SAME WIDTH !!!!!! I contacted Hi-Tec in regard to the problem because I like to give a person/company a chance to correct the error . Some woman wrote back to me sayin that they were aware of the problems and were currently awaiting another shipment . Nothing about them being sorry for being so stupid as to move the manufacturing from the US . No offer to send me a correct pair . I DO N'T KNOW IF THE CO. . SOLD OR WHAT BUT IF THEY CA N'T TREAT LONG TIME LOYAL CUSTOMERS BETTER THAN THIS THEN i WILL GO SOMEWHERE ELSE ! ANOTHER AMERICAN CO SELLING OUT FOR THE ALMIGHTY DOLLAR-WHAT A SHAME.SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE THAT WILL FIT AMERICAN MENS FEET . SHAME ON YOU HI-TEC !
 I ordered the cherry red , and about the only good thing I can say is that they arrived in like 2-3 days . I could immediately see a very tiny white spot on the red leather . The very first time I changed the strap size , a black mark developed on the red strap . The shoes themselves are very lite , which came across to me as cheap . I was surprised in walking around that they come off your heels and make the flip-flop sound . The part of the shoes where the leather is sewn together is very visible , and after a very brief try on , the leather was already warped . The bottom wood part already had a few , albeit small , dents . The wood part and the plastic heel do not join as smoothly as I would expect.The shoes have stickers on the bottom that say made in China , which might explain their shoddiness . I personally prefer not to buy items from China anyway , due to their human rights violations.Because of the dents on the wood and the warping of the leather , I can only imagine what they will look like after a month or two of wearing them . Although I bought these at a considerable discount , it was n't enough of a sale to keep these , and they certainly are not worth the list price . I 'll be looking instead at Nine West 's Ladyville shoes , which Amazon also sells . Those are a similar style and cute , although do n't have the same choice of colors.Also , not sure if this was in the product description or not , but the heels are a little over 2 inches tall .
 I stopped wearing this shoe after 2 weeks . I have n't returned the shoes but I should and soon . I expected the shoes to loosen after wearing about 2 weeks but to no avail . The shoes caused a very painful knot under the front portion of the bottom of my feet . I did n't like these shoes at all so I am again on the hunt for a good work shoe . I am a Hostess/Cashier at a very busy national restaurant and NEED good shoes . These are NOT the shoes .
 Got the shoes nd they are horribly tight , these are def not the size ordered . The material is very cheap . In the process of returning the shoes nd will not buy these again . Far from comfortable .
 I love sketchers I have always bought their athletic shoes until I got Strides . I bought 2 pair of these in late February and the tread came off . Under the extremely thin rubber tread is nothing but cloth .
 I am very disappointed in these shoes as they seem to run narrow and as a result my feet feel cramped and extremely sore . I work on my feet all day and therefore need a good non slip shoe that also offers lots of support . These shoes are great at the non slip part but that 's all . I am now going to have to invest in another pair of shoes asap and consider the money I spent on these Sketchers lost , as I wo n't return after wearing them for a week or so - scuffed and stretched out . My feet hurt at just the thought of putting these shoes on again . I would NOT buy them .
 WAS NOT WHAT THEY HAD SAID , HURT FEET , HAD TO SEE DR. ... NOT FOR WAITRESSING , THEREFORE HAD TO BE RETURNED ... ESPECIALLY AFTER PAYING DR. BILL
 15 months child could not fit his feet into these boots , he has wide feet and high ankles and boots do n't have any opening or zipper . We returned boots back to the company and had to pay shipping both ways .
 These are the worst boots I 've ever worn . I bought my original pair seven years ago at the base PX , and when they finally wore out I tried what I thought was the same thing . They had leather flaps inside that scratch your feet , and they began to deteriorate almost immediately . The stitching is coming undone and the exterior leather looks like I just hacked it off a cow . Even if they did n't have numerous defects , they would be uncomfortable due to the makers not knowing the shape of a human foot .
 This is my perspective as a female trying these boots . First of all , ever since they switched from the black leather boots , I find the sizing of the tan boots to be all over the place , so I ordered these in a 4R , 4.5 R , and 5R . The 5R was kind of tight in the toes , but too long . The 4.5 R was just right for width , but strangely , my toes were touching the end of the shoe . I almost did n't bother trying the 4R , but when I did , it turns out it was the perfect length but a little too much room in the toes . Really bizarre . The problem with all three boots , though , is that I could n't get them to lace-up/tighten up enough to make my foot feel secure . Whereas the black boots had three round eye-holes , this only has two , so you ca n't tighten the base as much before getting to the speed lacing eyelets . At the base where your foot turns into your leg , I had them tightened all the way so they were touching , and it was still loose . Plus when you factor in that you want your two finger spaces at the calf , it ends up loosening even further once you start walking around . They are relatively comfortable , but there 's no way I 'd be able to ruck in these without being able to tighten them correctly .
 The right boot sole was defective , had like a ridge on the outer edge making boot very uncomfortable to walk in . Return and refund procedure was painless . This was the second pair of these boots that had defective sole .
 3 months with them and my left boot it open in half i think the glue they use is not good i mean 70 bucks for 3 months is not worth it
 Oversize and they pinch my legs . I had to trim the top 1/2 inch off the boots to keep my legs from bleeding they hurt so bad . Cheap Crap but a notch better than Walmart boots .

 Do n't know what all the people who gave these boots a great review were thinking but these are not great boots . They did arrive on time but they are not worth the saved money . First off the boots had spots around the lower edge -LRB- where the boot and the rubber bottom meet -RRB- where there were huge holes where there was missing glue . Tried them on anyway and took them off within 2 minutes off walking around my house . They were the most uncomfortable boots I have ever tired on . They were so bad my feet and ankles hurt for an hour afterwards . The &#34; insole &#34; they put in the shoe is a joke at best . It feels like you are walking on a piece of granite . Would not recommend for anyone looking for any boot that they want to actually wear .
 Lasted about as long as a pair of boots from wally world for half the price . I live a on a small farm and I do some welding and construction . I guess for a city slicker they will last a life time .
 Either the upper was stuffed too full or I got a bad pair ? I wore these for 10 minutes and my achilles was in agony on both ankles . I tried folding the upper down into the shoe and let it sit that way to stretch it a little but it just did n't work .
 Product reviews are very subjective . Based on the reviews of this boot I hoped for a great boot at a fair price . Instead I found the boot to be subpar in terms of comfort . They shoes were stiff and far too ` roomy ' . My feet where floating inside them . I returned them immediately . I 've had far more comfortable boots right out of the box .
 These boots are water proof as advertized but they are not comfortable . I had to get some inserts just to wear them for a day . The lace hooks do not grab the shoe lace and hold so it is a pain just to lace them up . I would not recommend these to anyone .

 I have owned these boots for several years now . They fit well , are quite comfortable , and seem watertight . However , about 1 year ago I was on a hiking trip in Costa Rica . We were on a trail that needed to cross several streams to reach a waterfall . The guide took one look at my boots and told me I would have problems because several past clients had slipped on the wet rocks in similar boots . Other brands of hiking boots did not have the same problems . I noted that anytime you have water and rocks together there are potential problems of slipping , especially if there is moss . Thus , I discounted the warning . Later , at one of the waterfalls it was necessary to step on several wet stones . I found that my boots could not get any kind of grip on the slick rocks . I had never experienced anything so slick . The others in my party did not have the same problems . I usually am one of the most sure-footed hikers , but these boots made it feel like walking on ice in dress shoes . I finally had to take off my boots and go barefoot , which did not pose the same problem of slipping . One of the other men in the group told me that he was a pilot in the US Air Force and that in his squadron these Hi-Tec boots had been prohibited because there were too many injuries coming in and out of the cargo planes when it was wet . Ironically , even though these boots seem to be waterproof , you would not want to use them in a wet area that could also be slick . They seem to work fine on rough ground , even when wet . Finally , after wearing these boots for several seasons -LRB- primarily when I am outside in snow and slush -RRB- , they have developed some very annoying squeaks . So , it is embarrassing walking in a group because my boots make so much noise . Otherwise , these boots have been fine .
 The shoe seemed nice . I purchased the 2E version since I read in another review that they can be tight . Unfortunately , the top of the tongue bit into my ankle when I tied the shoe . Did n't matter which sock I wore . I had to return .
 They keep coming untied ! If it was n't for that I would give it 5 stars . The boot is waterproof , it is comfortable , wont give you calluses or corns . But they have hooks for wrapping the laces over at the top that no matter how you try and tie it , they will inevitably become undone ! The first time
 I am writing this review after I confirmed that my first pair of these boots are bad with manufacturing defect . After reading all these excellent reviews about the Altitude IV , I purchased a pair with high expectations . However , my first pair had a defect in the left shoe . It lacked arch support and it was uneven on the bottom which made my foot hurt . At first , I thought it was just the insole which I put in another pair on top of what is in the boots . However , it did not help , and my foot continued to hurt . Today , I went to a retail store and tried out another pair of the same model and size , and the arch support is great in both feet with proper insole cushion . I promptly exchanged my boots.All in all , my point is that I am disappointed with Hi-Tec for making bad shoes and still allowed them to be sold . 5 star for these boots but 1 star for the poor quality control .
 Length :
 Had these boots for a while . First thing i noticed the laces started to fall apart.I 've never seen a boot sole so sparsely treaded a bit like a tyre on your car less rubber on the road less traction and its going to wear out quicker.Because of the sole when your walking the boot seems to fold on top of your toes very annoying . The inner sole has no arch support and not much spring my feet started to ache after 20 mins walking and lay have n't done that before , had to change them.Seems to run a size to big thats not much of a problem just wore thicker socks.Fine to wear in the middle of winter but in the summer just to hot to wear , even when i put on thinest socks i could fine.They do n't seem to breath at all.No tag or loop on the back to help pull them on even my running shoes have them.Buy timberland at least lay are real leather and better soles same price !
 Although the reason I did not like the Hi-tech altitude IVs are subjective , I will at least explain why i did n't like them.First off , there are a bit big and bulky . No so much heavy as just get in your way . I did n't feel like I could have very good freedom of movement in them.they were comfortable , and felt good in terms of cushioning the sole of my foot . it 's not so much soft as much as it is slightly sloped on the medial and lateral sides of the heel the form more of a cradle for the posterior of the foot . most of this cradling is provided by the inserted sockliner.three things I was especially disappointed with were the heel height -LRB- very high , felt like you were wearing a cowboy boot -RRB- , stiff forefoot toe-up bend that made walking feel more like rocking on a semicircle plate rather that the shoe actually flexing and an unnatural overlay under the left big toe beneath the sockliner.When i think about it , it does walk and resemble a cowboy boot sole form -LRB- not tread but actual sole plate shape -RRB- and heel height . comparing them to a walking shoe , sport shoe or even a timberland boot which i compared to these , the forefoot did have much more `` rock '' to it , which i thought felt weird . for instance , the timberland boots ' toe lays flat on the ground . in this shoe , the toe will be slightly elevated off the ground . and the toe box is not very flexible to allow for the more common flattening.The unnatural and bulge under the toe could not have been normal . likely a factory defect of some type that passed unnoticed through quality control . it was not only distracting -LRB- i have a pet peeve about symmetry - each side should feel the same and equally balanced -RRB- but it was painful after a few minutes of walking if you push off your toes at all.from above , i thought the shoe was ugly , which is important to me because that is the part of the shoe you , the wearer , see most . the leather shows markings easily . and i thought the top around the ankle fit either too loose or too tight , depending on how you lace it.I do not know about it 's waterproofing ability ; I did not wear it in wet conditions . insulation to cold is average to below average . it felt about 1/2 size too small.if you are looking for a design like this , with a higher rise and similar stying , it was fairly comfortable . I do not believe the overlay bulge under the toe would be a problem with other shoes of this make and model , just an isolated incident.Amazon shipping was fast and excellent . i enrolled in Amazon Prime free because I am a college student and got 1-day shipping for $ 3.99 . great deal.just did n't like them . not for me . in the process of returning them now . hope this helps .
 The GOOD
 I have owned these boots for years . They are very good Quality and very Comfortable . They lasted me winter after winter . In fact I had to replace the Laces 3 times . Now for the pair I ordered , not good as Hi-Tec has changed their manufacturer . The pair I own and love are made in China and fit like a glove . Assuming they were the same , I purchased a pair from Amazon -LRB- which is priced excellent -RRB- but they did not fit proper at all . The Boot is now made in Malaysia or something ... and are no longer the same . Which is too bad . So as far as Amazon goes ... `` flawless as usual '' Returning them was not a problem . Just beware of these boots . Try them on at your local Store to check the comfort before you buy online.Mark from Thunder Bay ON , CANADA : -RRB-
 I 've always bought dearforms in the past and have always been satisfied until this time . Both slipprs ripped in the same spot within three days . Last time I buy this type of slippers !!
 While I was looking forward to receiving these slippers , I have serious questions about their production . They look `` beautiful '' and are extremely comfortable ... but after wearing them for three days , the left slipper 's side fabric tore . They are no longer `` Closeback '' . Since they are no longer available from Amazon , customer service could only offer me a refund if I sent them back .
 Well in one of the descriptive pictures the bottom of the shoe is all black ! The shoes I received were a brown rubber color on the bottom of the shoe . Also in another picture , the shoe inside is white and the shoes I received were blue inside . They are not as comfortable as a pair of keds that I owned years before .
 I ordered a pair of black and white keds and was sent a pair of plain black keds . In my opinion they are not nearly as cute as the black and white ones . Also , I ordered a narrow pair because I have really narrow feet , but the narrow pair is pretty tight on me . I ca n't imagine how they have extra narrow pairs because the narrow ones looked abnormally skinny . So be warned . I would have returned them but I had to wear them to a wedding as part of my bridesmaid outfit a week from the time they arrived . I probably will not be wearing them again and I wish I could return them for the black and white pair I had ordered .
 Do not buy ! The Keds quality has become garbage ! Much narrower , cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price !! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart . Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end .
 I bought my black Keds last winter . Within 6 months , there was a hole in the canvas above the toe of the left shoe . -LRB- Not because the shoe was too small , but because the canvas was extremely thin . -RRB- Also , the soles look much thicker in the photos than in reality .
 My new sneakers broke my heart ! They have been making subtle changes for the past several years . This last one was too much . I have been wearing Keds sneakers for about 60 years and absolutely loved them . Several years ago they came out with flared soles , -LRB- I said to myself , I guess I can live with that . -RRB- Then they began making the toes more pointed . Did n't really like that . What 's wrong with toe room ? Time for new ones - pictures showed the flared soles were gone -LRB- GREAT -RRB- . Ordered a pair . The toes are still too pointed , but the insole is as hard as a rock -LRB- maybe not quite -RRB- and the built in arch support was gone ! They had a perfect product and really ruined it . I could just cry . I returned my shoes and they were very kind and gave me a full refund .
 If you order these Keds sneakers today you will NOT be getting the same sneaker that has reviews from a year or more ago . Believe me , they are entirely different.Well , darn . As an almost life-long Keds wearer I can say with some authority that what I received are NOTHING like any pair of Keds sneakers I 've ever had before.Previously there was at least light arch support even in the most basic of their sneaker styles , this pair has none . The sole is stiff and clunky , the canvas fabric is thin and poor quality and they are in general , junk . No quality of any kind left in this previously reliable brand.My usual size in these is a 7 and that has always been 100 % comfortable and a perfect fit when worn with a pair of sport socks . This pair is saggy and baggy on top even when tied and the sides bagged out too.They WILL be going back.Save yourself time and aggravation and pass these by .
 Avoid doing business with Shoemall ! Check their feedback ! I 've made two orders with Shoemall and both times they do n't have my items in stock . It seems they do n't update on Amazon regularly . I 'll never buy from them again . Beware , they 'll charge & send you the accessory to an item and later contact you that the main item is out of stock . This happened to me both times I 've ordered . Really bad business practices !
 I have an old pair of these shoes that I have loved for a long time , but needed to replace . I ordered this pair and was very disappointed in the quality . I have only worn these shoes perhaps a dozen times and the sole is already coming apart . They also have this weird squeak with every step that I take . I will be replacing these , but will not purchase another Keds shoe .
 After reading some of the other reviews , I hesitated to purchase these Keds but decided to take a chance anyway . That was a mistake . The Keds that arrived the other day are nothing like I remember -LRB- and I lived in Keds for many years -RRB- . These are a very cheap version of the sturdy , supportive Keds of yesteryear that fit like a glove and lasted forever . The new ones are also quite a bit narrower , thinner , pointed in the toe , and feel like something you 'd get at a dollar store for a few bucks . Returning this product for a refund and wo n't be purchasing Keds in the future .
 I wore these about twice a week for about 5 weeks before they began splitting apart . To late too return them now so it was a waste of money . Very disappointed in the quality . I wore Keds for years and never had any problems with quality . Will not buy this brand again .

 I ordered these Navy Keds tennis shoes for my daughter . The color shows navy , but when they arrived they looked black ... the box said navy ! Had to return because of the shade .
 These Navy blue Keds were more black than navy blue . The picture of the shoes on Amazon was very different than the one I received . I put them next to my black keds and you could not tell the difference between the navy blue and the black keds . Very disappointing .
 These shoes are not as good as they used to be . Very little support . The sole is very thin . Definetly not worth the price .
 I have worn Keds sneakers for many years , always ordering size 6.5 . The label in the sneaker and the box are labeled 6.5 , but this sneaker is at most size 5 , or it is a child 's sneaker.Very disappointed .
 The shoes were an amazing fit , but when I washed them -- in cold water , I might add -- the blue dye from the soles bled out onto the white canvas . Perhaps , it will wash away next time , but I was more than miffed .
 Not only is the canvas cheap & lightweight , it has a bluish tinge to it . The tongue of the shoe is only sewn halfway ... i.e. , the inside is merely the raw cut . The first time I washed them -LRB- in cold water -RRB- , the blue dye from the inside bled thru to the white upper . Very disappointed in what was formerly a great basic sneaker ... I suppose Keds has succombed to the Chinese influence . Very sad indeed .
 I bought these in both white and stone . I really like the stone , as it does n't seem to stand out as much as the white . Also , it 's a nice change from white all the time . My mom liked the stone color when she saw mine , so I ordered a pair for her as well.We 've noticed there is a change in the way Keds have been made since the 90s . They are not as comfortable . The arch can be `` bumpy '' or nonexistent , and they run a little small . I wear a size 8 , and the stone pair are tight on me . Tighter than the white for some reason . I 'm sure they will get better as they break in , but I 've never had a pair of Keds that is this tight . My feet actually hurt the first day I wore them . That never happened to me with Keds . And I have narrow feet . Someone with a wider foot could n't wear these comfortably , at all . The sneakers also do n't last as long as they used to . I wore Keds a lot when I was in high school , and one pair would last me a long time . Now , I notice the edges at the bottom of the shoes start to come apart with much less wear , and the footbed becomes very flat and uncomfortable . They do n't feel as cushiony as they used to , even when brand new . Very different . Wearable , and I like them , but they are not as good as they used to be . I suspect they were not made in China a decade + ago . I think they are made smaller than they used to be , because even looking at my feet while wearing them , I noticed they make my feet look smaller . I like that , but , not at the expense of comfort . I might try an 8 1/2 next time . The white fit better for some reason , not so small.Update
 Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return !!
 the style was wonderful however even tho it said 9 med it was a trifle small-thought it might be an 8 instead-win some you lose some
 I got these shoes in December and they are VERY cheap . NOT worth the money . I could have gone to a local store and paid a lot less . Additionally , the shoes I received did not look like the shoe in the photo . The shoe i received was more of a sketcher type shoe with a longer top . I would NOT recommend them to a friend or relative . They are not what i expected . the top of the shoe is already coming apart . I 've had Keds before and I do n't know if it was just this pair , but I will not buy shoes this way again .
 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .
 I bought this sneaker from my Mom who has worn the same style for years . I 'm sorry to say that we were not happy with our purchase - it seems that the mold for the shoe has changed - the stitching on the top of the shoe is in a different place and does not make this a comfortable shoe for my mom .
 I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them . They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them . I will not purchase any Keds in the future .
 The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem . The shoes that arrived had been worn . I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had . He made a good offer however , I decided to wash the shoes and keep them , which I did . Now , I have an infection on my toe . Not good .
 I 've ordered Ked 's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality . The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $ 5 . No support , thin canvas - just junk . I 'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe . I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to . No support , no padding , more narrow , thinner canvas . I 've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference . Save your money . You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $ 5 - $ 8 , it just wo n't have a Keds tag . This is no longer the bargain it once was . Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator . What 's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe do n't even know it 's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago .
 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?
 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 I almost always wear a size 6 but as soon as I put these on , they hurt my feet . They are extremely narrow - returned right away .
 3 weeks after buying these shoes , i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined . This never happened to the cheap Target brand we bought . I have to throw them away . The insole does n't come out so I ca n't even try to bleach them .
 They sent the wrong color LEDs , I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked .
 Even though I ordered my normal size , these shoes pinched my toes painfully . I ended up throwing them in a donation box .
 I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them . Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable . Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now . Some stuff should be left in the 80s !!
 In any shoe I ideally I wear a 7 1/2 W. I usually end up with an 8 M because there is no wide width offered . This summer I wanted canvas tennis shoes for summer and decided to try some Keds . There seems to be no consistency of sizing , however , between colors or styles , and I have had to try different colors and styles due to `` not available '' items . Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug . So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long , but wide enough . I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W -LRB- no Chambray available in 7 W -RRB- and it was waaay too short and very tight . I do n't think a size 8 W would even fit . This idea of shoes `` running small '' or `` running large '' makes no sense to me . Just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it .
 I was so disappointed with these shoes . In fact , I returned them . The quality is not that of the Ked 's that I grew up wearing !
 I bought these shoes in black to match my work uniform only to receive them in the mail to discover that they are super narrow . It 's like these shoes are designed for rabbits or something . Thankfully amazon has very easy returns . If you decide to buy these shoes online try them on first , or read the return policy .
 I bought the white leather sneakers for $ 38 at a DSW store awhile ago . Let me tell you , they do NOT last . I bought Keds hoping for a quality , practical , and stylish shoe that I could wear with anything for a few years . This is what you could expect a few years ago , that Keds were STRONG shoes . Well surprise , they barely lasted one season . The bottom sole of the shoe came unglue from the rest of the shoe , and most of the white leather chipped off leaving patches of brown . Looks terrible , no way worth my $ 40 .
 Eh . I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap , but I should have paid more attention to the reviews . The quality is way low with these shoes . They 're super uncomfortable and make your toes feel like they 're packed in sardines . -LRB- And I have really small feet - I 'm a women 's 5.5 -RRB- Now that I see them on my feet , they do n't even look that cute . Anyone who buys KEDS for the first time ONLINE should realize that they are exactly what they seem
 The shipping cost was less than what it would have cost me in gas to go the store to buy
 The right boot sole was defective , had like a ridge on the outer edge making boot very uncomfortable to walk in . Return and refund procedure was painless . This was the second pair of these boots that had defective sole .
 Although the reason I did not like the Hi-tech altitude IVs are subjective , I will at least explain why i did n't like them.First off , there are a bit big and bulky . No so much heavy as just get in your way . I did n't feel like I could have very good freedom of movement in them.they were comfortable , and felt good in terms of cushioning the sole of my foot . it 's not so much soft as much as it is slightly sloped on the medial and lateral sides of the heel the form more of a cradle for the posterior of the foot . most of this cradling is provided by the inserted sockliner.three things I was especially disappointed with were the heel height -LRB- very high , felt like you were wearing a cowboy boot -RRB- , stiff forefoot toe-up bend that made walking feel more like rocking on a semicircle plate rather that the shoe actually flexing and an unnatural overlay under the left big toe beneath the sockliner.When i think about it , it does walk and resemble a cowboy boot sole form -LRB- not tread but actual sole plate shape -RRB- and heel height . comparing them to a walking shoe , sport shoe or even a timberland boot which i compared to these , the forefoot did have much more `` rock '' to it , which i thought felt weird . for instance , the timberland boots ' toe lays flat on the ground . in this shoe , the toe will be slightly elevated off the ground . and the toe box is not very flexible to allow for the more common flattening.The unnatural and bulge under the toe could not have been normal . likely a factory defect of some type that passed unnoticed through quality control . it was not only distracting -LRB- i have a pet peeve about symmetry - each side should feel the same and equally balanced -RRB- but it was painful after a few minutes of walking if you push off your toes at all.from above , i thought the shoe was ugly , which is important to me because that is the part of the shoe you , the wearer , see most . the leather shows markings easily . and i thought the top around the ankle fit either too loose or too tight , depending on how you lace it.I do not know about it 's waterproofing ability ; I did not wear it in wet conditions . insulation to cold is average to below average . it felt about 1/2 size too small.if you are looking for a design like this , with a higher rise and similar stying , it was fairly comfortable . I do not believe the overlay bulge under the toe would be a problem with other shoes of this make and model , just an isolated incident.Amazon shipping was fast and excellent . i enrolled in Amazon Prime free because I am a college student and got 1-day shipping for $ 3.99 . great deal.just did n't like them . not for me . in the process of returning them now . hope this helps .
 The GOOD
 I have owned these boots for years . They are very good Quality and very Comfortable . They lasted me winter after winter . In fact I had to replace the Laces 3 times . Now for the pair I ordered , not good as Hi-Tec has changed their manufacturer . The pair I own and love are made in China and fit like a glove . Assuming they were the same , I purchased a pair from Amazon -LRB- which is priced excellent -RRB- but they did not fit proper at all . The Boot is now made in Malaysia or something ... and are no longer the same . Which is too bad . So as far as Amazon goes ... `` flawless as usual '' Returning them was not a problem . Just beware of these boots . Try them on at your local Store to check the comfort before you buy online.Mark from Thunder Bay ON , CANADA : -RRB-
 3 months with them and my left boot it open in half i think the glue they use is not good i mean 70 bucks for 3 months is not worth it
 Oversize and they pinch my legs . I had to trim the top 1/2 inch off the boots to keep my legs from bleeding they hurt so bad . Cheap Crap but a notch better than Walmart boots .
 This pair of boots are too tight and between sizes is big jump , i do n't know if there is any other way I can stretch them a bit , they are also only made for soft soil , asphalt concrete will finish them too fast
 Do n't know what all the people who gave these boots a great review were thinking but these are not great boots . They did arrive on time but they are not worth the saved money . First off the boots had spots around the lower edge -LRB- where the boot and the rubber bottom meet -RRB- where there were huge holes where there was missing glue . Tried them on anyway and took them off within 2 minutes off walking around my house . They were the most uncomfortable boots I have ever tired on . They were so bad my feet and ankles hurt for an hour afterwards . The &#34; insole &#34; they put in the shoe is a joke at best . It feels like you are walking on a piece of granite . Would not recommend for anyone looking for any boot that they want to actually wear .
 Lasted about as long as a pair of boots from wally world for half the price . I live a on a small farm and I do some welding and construction . I guess for a city slicker they will last a life time .
 I 'd ordered these boots based on decent reviews and price . I rarely return purchases to Amazon but I did return these . The boots were fairly heavy , stiff and narrow . I get that new boots will be stiff but both the uppers and lowers were too stiff for me . I returned them and bought Adidas boots with Gore Tex uppers which were much more comfortable , flexible and light with good sole traction .
 I have owned these boots for several years now . They fit well , are quite comfortable , and seem watertight . However , about 1 year ago I was on a hiking trip in Costa Rica . We were on a trail that needed to cross several streams to reach a waterfall . The guide took one look at my boots and told me I would have problems because several past clients had slipped on the wet rocks in similar boots . Other brands of hiking boots did not have the same problems . I noted that anytime you have water and rocks together there are potential problems of slipping , especially if there is moss . Thus , I discounted the warning . Later , at one of the waterfalls it was necessary to step on several wet stones . I found that my boots could not get any kind of grip on the slick rocks . I had never experienced anything so slick . The others in my party did not have the same problems . I usually am one of the most sure-footed hikers , but these boots made it feel like walking on ice in dress shoes . I finally had to take off my boots and go barefoot , which did not pose the same problem of slipping . One of the other men in the group told me that he was a pilot in the US Air Force and that in his squadron these Hi-Tec boots had been prohibited because there were too many injuries coming in and out of the cargo planes when it was wet . Ironically , even though these boots seem to be waterproof , you would not want to use them in a wet area that could also be slick . They seem to work fine on rough ground , even when wet . Finally , after wearing these boots for several seasons -LRB- primarily when I am outside in snow and slush -RRB- , they have developed some very annoying squeaks . So , it is embarrassing walking in a group because my boots make so much noise . Otherwise , these boots have been fine .
 The shoe seemed nice . I purchased the 2E version since I read in another review that they can be tight . Unfortunately , the top of the tongue bit into my ankle when I tied the shoe . Did n't matter which sock I wore . I had to return .
 Either the upper was stuffed too full or I got a bad pair ? I wore these for 10 minutes and my achilles was in agony on both ankles . I tried folding the upper down into the shoe and let it sit that way to stretch it a little but it just did n't work .
 Product reviews are very subjective . Based on the reviews of this boot I hoped for a great boot at a fair price . Instead I found the boot to be subpar in terms of comfort . They shoes were stiff and far too ` roomy ' . My feet where floating inside them . I returned them immediately . I 've had far more comfortable boots right out of the box .
 They keep coming untied ! If it was n't for that I would give it 5 stars . The boot is waterproof , it is comfortable , wont give you calluses or corns . But they have hooks for wrapping the laces over at the top that no matter how you try and tie it , they will inevitably become undone ! The first time
 I am writing this review after I confirmed that my first pair of these boots are bad with manufacturing defect . After reading all these excellent reviews about the Altitude IV , I purchased a pair with high expectations . However , my first pair had a defect in the left shoe . It lacked arch support and it was uneven on the bottom which made my foot hurt . At first , I thought it was just the insole which I put in another pair on top of what is in the boots . However , it did not help , and my foot continued to hurt . Today , I went to a retail store and tried out another pair of the same model and size , and the arch support is great in both feet with proper insole cushion . I promptly exchanged my boots.All in all , my point is that I am disappointed with Hi-Tec for making bad shoes and still allowed them to be sold . 5 star for these boots but 1 star for the poor quality control .
 Length :
 Had these boots for a while . First thing i noticed the laces started to fall apart.I 've never seen a boot sole so sparsely treaded a bit like a tyre on your car less rubber on the road less traction and its going to wear out quicker.Because of the sole when your walking the boot seems to fold on top of your toes very annoying . The inner sole has no arch support and not much spring my feet started to ache after 20 mins walking and lay have n't done that before , had to change them.Seems to run a size to big thats not much of a problem just wore thicker socks.Fine to wear in the middle of winter but in the summer just to hot to wear , even when i put on thinest socks i could fine.They do n't seem to breath at all.No tag or loop on the back to help pull them on even my running shoes have them.Buy timberland at least lay are real leather and better soles same price !
 I have purchased and worn these boots for years , but since manufacturing has moved to Indonesia the boots are smaller sizes and very narrow . I recently ordered two pairs of these boots in their widest size . Upon arrival I compared them to my old boots that are a `` d '' width . THEY ARE EXACTLY THE SAME ! THERE IS NO WIDE , THEY ARE THE SAME WIDTH !!!!!! I contacted Hi-Tec in regard to the problem because I like to give a person/company a chance to correct the error . Some woman wrote back to me sayin that they were aware of the problems and were currently awaiting another shipment . Nothing about them being sorry for being so stupid as to move the manufacturing from the US . No offer to send me a correct pair . I DO N'T KNOW IF THE CO. . SOLD OR WHAT BUT IF THEY CA N'T TREAT LONG TIME LOYAL CUSTOMERS BETTER THAN THIS THEN i WILL GO SOMEWHERE ELSE ! ANOTHER AMERICAN CO SELLING OUT FOR THE ALMIGHTY DOLLAR-WHAT A SHAME.SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE THAT WILL FIT AMERICAN MENS FEET . SHAME ON YOU HI-TEC !
 These boots are water proof as advertized but they are not comfortable . I had to get some inserts just to wear them for a day . The lace hooks do not grab the shoe lace and hold so it is a pain just to lace them up . I would not recommend these to anyone .
 Even though I ordered my normal size , these shoes pinched my toes painfully . I ended up throwing them in a donation box .
 I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them . Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable . Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now . Some stuff should be left in the 80s !!

 I have worn Keds sneakers for many years , always ordering size 6.5 . The label in the sneaker and the box are labeled 6.5 , but this sneaker is at most size 5 , or it is a child 's sneaker.Very disappointed .
 The shoes were an amazing fit , but when I washed them -- in cold water , I might add -- the blue dye from the soles bled out onto the white canvas . Perhaps , it will wash away next time , but I was more than miffed .
 Not only is the canvas cheap & lightweight , it has a bluish tinge to it . The tongue of the shoe is only sewn halfway ... i.e. , the inside is merely the raw cut . The first time I washed them -LRB- in cold water -RRB- , the blue dye from the inside bled thru to the white upper . Very disappointed in what was formerly a great basic sneaker ... I suppose Keds has succombed to the Chinese influence . Very sad indeed .
 I bought these in both white and stone . I really like the stone , as it does n't seem to stand out as much as the white . Also , it 's a nice change from white all the time . My mom liked the stone color when she saw mine , so I ordered a pair for her as well.We 've noticed there is a change in the way Keds have been made since the 90s . They are not as comfortable . The arch can be `` bumpy '' or nonexistent , and they run a little small . I wear a size 8 , and the stone pair are tight on me . Tighter than the white for some reason . I 'm sure they will get better as they break in , but I 've never had a pair of Keds that is this tight . My feet actually hurt the first day I wore them . That never happened to me with Keds . And I have narrow feet . Someone with a wider foot could n't wear these comfortably , at all . The sneakers also do n't last as long as they used to . I wore Keds a lot when I was in high school , and one pair would last me a long time . Now , I notice the edges at the bottom of the shoes start to come apart with much less wear , and the footbed becomes very flat and uncomfortable . They do n't feel as cushiony as they used to , even when brand new . Very different . Wearable , and I like them , but they are not as good as they used to be . I suspect they were not made in China a decade + ago . I think they are made smaller than they used to be , because even looking at my feet while wearing them , I noticed they make my feet look smaller . I like that , but , not at the expense of comfort . I might try an 8 1/2 next time . The white fit better for some reason , not so small.Update
 I got these shoes in December and they are VERY cheap . NOT worth the money . I could have gone to a local store and paid a lot less . Additionally , the shoes I received did not look like the shoe in the photo . The shoe i received was more of a sketcher type shoe with a longer top . I would NOT recommend them to a friend or relative . They are not what i expected . the top of the shoe is already coming apart . I 've had Keds before and I do n't know if it was just this pair , but I will not buy shoes this way again .
 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .
 I was n't looking for a good walking shoe , just a specific look ; -LRB- surprisingly hard to find simple plain blue sneakers -RRB- . Since newer reviews seemed generally positive , I thought I would take a shot . Unfortunately , these are n't acceptable even for light use . Very tight and feel like cardboard . Note
 I bought my black Keds last winter . Within 6 months , there was a hole in the canvas above the toe of the left shoe . -LRB- Not because the shoe was too small , but because the canvas was extremely thin . -RRB- Also , the soles look much thicker in the photos than in reality .
 My new sneakers broke my heart ! They have been making subtle changes for the past several years . This last one was too much . I have been wearing Keds sneakers for about 60 years and absolutely loved them . Several years ago they came out with flared soles , -LRB- I said to myself , I guess I can live with that . -RRB- Then they began making the toes more pointed . Did n't really like that . What 's wrong with toe room ? Time for new ones - pictures showed the flared soles were gone -LRB- GREAT -RRB- . Ordered a pair . The toes are still too pointed , but the insole is as hard as a rock -LRB- maybe not quite -RRB- and the built in arch support was gone ! They had a perfect product and really ruined it . I could just cry . I returned my shoes and they were very kind and gave me a full refund .
 If you order these Keds sneakers today you will NOT be getting the same sneaker that has reviews from a year or more ago . Believe me , they are entirely different.Well , darn . As an almost life-long Keds wearer I can say with some authority that what I received are NOTHING like any pair of Keds sneakers I 've ever had before.Previously there was at least light arch support even in the most basic of their sneaker styles , this pair has none . The sole is stiff and clunky , the canvas fabric is thin and poor quality and they are in general , junk . No quality of any kind left in this previously reliable brand.My usual size in these is a 7 and that has always been 100 % comfortable and a perfect fit when worn with a pair of sport socks . This pair is saggy and baggy on top even when tied and the sides bagged out too.They WILL be going back.Save yourself time and aggravation and pass these by .
 Avoid doing business with Shoemall ! Check their feedback ! I 've made two orders with Shoemall and both times they do n't have my items in stock . It seems they do n't update on Amazon regularly . I 'll never buy from them again . Beware , they 'll charge & send you the accessory to an item and later contact you that the main item is out of stock . This happened to me both times I 've ordered . Really bad business practices !
 I have an old pair of these shoes that I have loved for a long time , but needed to replace . I ordered this pair and was very disappointed in the quality . I have only worn these shoes perhaps a dozen times and the sole is already coming apart . They also have this weird squeak with every step that I take . I will be replacing these , but will not purchase another Keds shoe .
 After reading some of the other reviews , I hesitated to purchase these Keds but decided to take a chance anyway . That was a mistake . The Keds that arrived the other day are nothing like I remember -LRB- and I lived in Keds for many years -RRB- . These are a very cheap version of the sturdy , supportive Keds of yesteryear that fit like a glove and lasted forever . The new ones are also quite a bit narrower , thinner , pointed in the toe , and feel like something you 'd get at a dollar store for a few bucks . Returning this product for a refund and wo n't be purchasing Keds in the future .
 I wore these about twice a week for about 5 weeks before they began splitting apart . To late too return them now so it was a waste of money . Very disappointed in the quality . I wore Keds for years and never had any problems with quality . Will not buy this brand again .

 They sent the wrong color LEDs , I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked .
 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 These shoes are not as good as they used to be . Very little support . The sole is very thin . Definetly not worth the price .
 In any shoe I ideally I wear a 7 1/2 W. I usually end up with an 8 M because there is no wide width offered . This summer I wanted canvas tennis shoes for summer and decided to try some Keds . There seems to be no consistency of sizing , however , between colors or styles , and I have had to try different colors and styles due to `` not available '' items . Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug . So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long , but wide enough . I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W -LRB- no Chambray available in 7 W -RRB- and it was waaay too short and very tight . I do n't think a size 8 W would even fit . This idea of shoes `` running small '' or `` running large '' makes no sense to me . Just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it .
 I was so disappointed with these shoes . In fact , I returned them . The quality is not that of the Ked 's that I grew up wearing !

 Do not buy ! The Keds quality has become garbage ! Much narrower , cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price !! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart . Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end .
 Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return !!
 the style was wonderful however even tho it said 9 med it was a trifle small-thought it might be an 8 instead-win some you lose some
 Well in one of the descriptive pictures the bottom of the shoe is all black ! The shoes I received were a brown rubber color on the bottom of the shoe . Also in another picture , the shoe inside is white and the shoes I received were blue inside . They are not as comfortable as a pair of keds that I owned years before .
 I ordered a pair of black and white keds and was sent a pair of plain black keds . In my opinion they are not nearly as cute as the black and white ones . Also , I ordered a narrow pair because I have really narrow feet , but the narrow pair is pretty tight on me . I ca n't imagine how they have extra narrow pairs because the narrow ones looked abnormally skinny . So be warned . I would have returned them but I had to wear them to a wedding as part of my bridesmaid outfit a week from the time they arrived . I probably will not be wearing them again and I wish I could return them for the black and white pair I had ordered .
 I almost always wear a size 6 but as soon as I put these on , they hurt my feet . They are extremely narrow - returned right away .
 These Navy blue Keds were more black than navy blue . The picture of the shoes on Amazon was very different than the one I received . I put them next to my black keds and you could not tell the difference between the navy blue and the black keds . Very disappointing .
 I ordered these Navy Keds tennis shoes for my daughter . The color shows navy , but when they arrived they looked black ... the box said navy ! Had to return because of the shade .
 3 weeks after buying these shoes , i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined . This never happened to the cheap Target brand we bought . I have to throw them away . The insole does n't come out so I ca n't even try to bleach them .
 I bought this sneaker from my Mom who has worn the same style for years . I 'm sorry to say that we were not happy with our purchase - it seems that the mold for the shoe has changed - the stitching on the top of the shoe is in a different place and does not make this a comfortable shoe for my mom .
 I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them . They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them . I will not purchase any Keds in the future .
 The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem . The shoes that arrived had been worn . I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had . He made a good offer however , I decided to wash the shoes and keep them , which I did . Now , I have an infection on my toe . Not good .
 I 've ordered Ked 's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality . The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $ 5 . No support , thin canvas - just junk . I 'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe . I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to . No support , no padding , more narrow , thinner canvas . I 've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference . Save your money . You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $ 5 - $ 8 , it just wo n't have a Keds tag . This is no longer the bargain it once was . Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator . What 's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe do n't even know it 's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago .
 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?

 I got these shoes in December and they are VERY cheap . NOT worth the money . I could have gone to a local store and paid a lot less . Additionally , the shoes I received did not look like the shoe in the photo . The shoe i received was more of a sketcher type shoe with a longer top . I would NOT recommend them to a friend or relative . They are not what i expected . the top of the shoe is already coming apart . I 've had Keds before and I do n't know if it was just this pair , but I will not buy shoes this way again .
 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .
 I have worn Keds sneakers for many years , always ordering size 6.5 . The label in the sneaker and the box are labeled 6.5 , but this sneaker is at most size 5 , or it is a child 's sneaker.Very disappointed .
 The shoes were an amazing fit , but when I washed them -- in cold water , I might add -- the blue dye from the soles bled out onto the white canvas . Perhaps , it will wash away next time , but I was more than miffed .
 Not only is the canvas cheap & lightweight , it has a bluish tinge to it . The tongue of the shoe is only sewn halfway ... i.e. , the inside is merely the raw cut . The first time I washed them -LRB- in cold water -RRB- , the blue dye from the inside bled thru to the white upper . Very disappointed in what was formerly a great basic sneaker ... I suppose Keds has succombed to the Chinese influence . Very sad indeed .
 I bought these in both white and stone . I really like the stone , as it does n't seem to stand out as much as the white . Also , it 's a nice change from white all the time . My mom liked the stone color when she saw mine , so I ordered a pair for her as well.We 've noticed there is a change in the way Keds have been made since the 90s . They are not as comfortable . The arch can be `` bumpy '' or nonexistent , and they run a little small . I wear a size 8 , and the stone pair are tight on me . Tighter than the white for some reason . I 'm sure they will get better as they break in , but I 've never had a pair of Keds that is this tight . My feet actually hurt the first day I wore them . That never happened to me with Keds . And I have narrow feet . Someone with a wider foot could n't wear these comfortably , at all . The sneakers also do n't last as long as they used to . I wore Keds a lot when I was in high school , and one pair would last me a long time . Now , I notice the edges at the bottom of the shoes start to come apart with much less wear , and the footbed becomes very flat and uncomfortable . They do n't feel as cushiony as they used to , even when brand new . Very different . Wearable , and I like them , but they are not as good as they used to be . I suspect they were not made in China a decade + ago . I think they are made smaller than they used to be , because even looking at my feet while wearing them , I noticed they make my feet look smaller . I like that , but , not at the expense of comfort . I might try an 8 1/2 next time . The white fit better for some reason , not so small.Update
 Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return !!
 the style was wonderful however even tho it said 9 med it was a trifle small-thought it might be an 8 instead-win some you lose some
 These shoes are not as good as they used to be . Very little support . The sole is very thin . Definetly not worth the price .
 I ordered these Navy Keds tennis shoes for my daughter . The color shows navy , but when they arrived they looked black ... the box said navy ! Had to return because of the shade .
 These Navy blue Keds were more black than navy blue . The picture of the shoes on Amazon was very different than the one I received . I put them next to my black keds and you could not tell the difference between the navy blue and the black keds . Very disappointing .
 Well in one of the descriptive pictures the bottom of the shoe is all black ! The shoes I received were a brown rubber color on the bottom of the shoe . Also in another picture , the shoe inside is white and the shoes I received were blue inside . They are not as comfortable as a pair of keds that I owned years before .
 I ordered a pair of black and white keds and was sent a pair of plain black keds . In my opinion they are not nearly as cute as the black and white ones . Also , I ordered a narrow pair because I have really narrow feet , but the narrow pair is pretty tight on me . I ca n't imagine how they have extra narrow pairs because the narrow ones looked abnormally skinny . So be warned . I would have returned them but I had to wear them to a wedding as part of my bridesmaid outfit a week from the time they arrived . I probably will not be wearing them again and I wish I could return them for the black and white pair I had ordered .
 Do not buy ! The Keds quality has become garbage ! Much narrower , cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price !! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart . Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end .
 I bought my black Keds last winter . Within 6 months , there was a hole in the canvas above the toe of the left shoe . -LRB- Not because the shoe was too small , but because the canvas was extremely thin . -RRB- Also , the soles look much thicker in the photos than in reality .
 My new sneakers broke my heart ! They have been making subtle changes for the past several years . This last one was too much . I have been wearing Keds sneakers for about 60 years and absolutely loved them . Several years ago they came out with flared soles , -LRB- I said to myself , I guess I can live with that . -RRB- Then they began making the toes more pointed . Did n't really like that . What 's wrong with toe room ? Time for new ones - pictures showed the flared soles were gone -LRB- GREAT -RRB- . Ordered a pair . The toes are still too pointed , but the insole is as hard as a rock -LRB- maybe not quite -RRB- and the built in arch support was gone ! They had a perfect product and really ruined it . I could just cry . I returned my shoes and they were very kind and gave me a full refund .
 If you order these Keds sneakers today you will NOT be getting the same sneaker that has reviews from a year or more ago . Believe me , they are entirely different.Well , darn . As an almost life-long Keds wearer I can say with some authority that what I received are NOTHING like any pair of Keds sneakers I 've ever had before.Previously there was at least light arch support even in the most basic of their sneaker styles , this pair has none . The sole is stiff and clunky , the canvas fabric is thin and poor quality and they are in general , junk . No quality of any kind left in this previously reliable brand.My usual size in these is a 7 and that has always been 100 % comfortable and a perfect fit when worn with a pair of sport socks . This pair is saggy and baggy on top even when tied and the sides bagged out too.They WILL be going back.Save yourself time and aggravation and pass these by .
 Avoid doing business with Shoemall ! Check their feedback ! I 've made two orders with Shoemall and both times they do n't have my items in stock . It seems they do n't update on Amazon regularly . I 'll never buy from them again . Beware , they 'll charge & send you the accessory to an item and later contact you that the main item is out of stock . This happened to me both times I 've ordered . Really bad business practices !
 I have an old pair of these shoes that I have loved for a long time , but needed to replace . I ordered this pair and was very disappointed in the quality . I have only worn these shoes perhaps a dozen times and the sole is already coming apart . They also have this weird squeak with every step that I take . I will be replacing these , but will not purchase another Keds shoe .
 After reading some of the other reviews , I hesitated to purchase these Keds but decided to take a chance anyway . That was a mistake . The Keds that arrived the other day are nothing like I remember -LRB- and I lived in Keds for many years -RRB- . These are a very cheap version of the sturdy , supportive Keds of yesteryear that fit like a glove and lasted forever . The new ones are also quite a bit narrower , thinner , pointed in the toe , and feel like something you 'd get at a dollar store for a few bucks . Returning this product for a refund and wo n't be purchasing Keds in the future .
 I wore these about twice a week for about 5 weeks before they began splitting apart . To late too return them now so it was a waste of money . Very disappointed in the quality . I wore Keds for years and never had any problems with quality . Will not buy this brand again .

 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .
 3 weeks after buying these shoes , i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined . This never happened to the cheap Target brand we bought . I have to throw them away . The insole does n't come out so I ca n't even try to bleach them .
 In any shoe I ideally I wear a 7 1/2 W. I usually end up with an 8 M because there is no wide width offered . This summer I wanted canvas tennis shoes for summer and decided to try some Keds . There seems to be no consistency of sizing , however , between colors or styles , and I have had to try different colors and styles due to `` not available '' items . Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug . So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long , but wide enough . I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W -LRB- no Chambray available in 7 W -RRB- and it was waaay too short and very tight . I do n't think a size 8 W would even fit . This idea of shoes `` running small '' or `` running large '' makes no sense to me . Just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it .
 I was so disappointed with these shoes . In fact , I returned them . The quality is not that of the Ked 's that I grew up wearing !
 I bought these shoes in black to match my work uniform only to receive them in the mail to discover that they are super narrow . It 's like these shoes are designed for rabbits or something . Thankfully amazon has very easy returns . If you decide to buy these shoes online try them on first , or read the return policy .
 I bought the white leather sneakers for $ 38 at a DSW store awhile ago . Let me tell you , they do NOT last . I bought Keds hoping for a quality , practical , and stylish shoe that I could wear with anything for a few years . This is what you could expect a few years ago , that Keds were STRONG shoes . Well surprise , they barely lasted one season . The bottom sole of the shoe came unglue from the rest of the shoe , and most of the white leather chipped off leaving patches of brown . Looks terrible , no way worth my $ 40 .
 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 I almost always wear a size 6 but as soon as I put these on , they hurt my feet . They are extremely narrow - returned right away .
 I bought this sneaker from my Mom who has worn the same style for years . I 'm sorry to say that we were not happy with our purchase - it seems that the mold for the shoe has changed - the stitching on the top of the shoe is in a different place and does not make this a comfortable shoe for my mom .
 I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them . They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them . I will not purchase any Keds in the future .
 The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem . The shoes that arrived had been worn . I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had . He made a good offer however , I decided to wash the shoes and keep them , which I did . Now , I have an infection on my toe . Not good .
 They sent the wrong color LEDs , I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked .
 I 've ordered Ked 's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality . The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $ 5 . No support , thin canvas - just junk . I 'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe . I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to . No support , no padding , more narrow , thinner canvas . I 've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference . Save your money . You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $ 5 - $ 8 , it just wo n't have a Keds tag . This is no longer the bargain it once was . Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator . What 's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe do n't even know it 's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago .
 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?
 Even though I ordered my normal size , these shoes pinched my toes painfully . I ended up throwing them in a donation box .
 I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them . Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable . Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now . Some stuff should be left in the 80s !!
 Eh . I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap , but I should have paid more attention to the reviews . The quality is way low with these shoes . They 're super uncomfortable and make your toes feel like they 're packed in sardines . -LRB- And I have really small feet - I 'm a women 's 5.5 -RRB- Now that I see them on my feet , they do n't even look that cute . Anyone who buys KEDS for the first time ONLINE should realize that they are exactly what they seem
 The shipping cost was less than what it would have cost me in gas to go the store to buy

There seems to be no consistency of sizing , however , between colors or styles , and I have had to try different colors and styles due to `` not available '' items . Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug . So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long , but wide enough . I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W -LRB- no Chambray available in 7 W -RRB- and it was waaay too short and very tight . I do n't think a size 8 W would even fit . This idea of shoes `` running small '' or `` running large '' makes no sense to me . Just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it .
 I was so disappointed with these shoes . In fact , I returned them . The quality is not that of the Ked 's that I grew up wearing !
 I bought these shoes in black to match my work uniform only to receive them in the mail to discover that they are super narrow . It 's like these shoes are designed for rabbits or something . Thankfully amazon has very easy returns . If you decide to buy these shoes online try them on first , or read the return policy .
 I bought the white leather sneakers for $ 38 at a DSW store awhile ago . Let me tell you , they do NOT last . I bought Keds hoping for a quality , practical , and stylish shoe that I could wear with anything for a few years . This is what you could expect a few years ago , that Keds were STRONG shoes . Well surprise , they barely lasted one season . The bottom sole of the shoe came unglue from the rest of the shoe , and most of the white leather chipped off leaving patches of brown . Looks terrible , no way worth my $ 40 .
 Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return !!
 the style was wonderful however even tho it said 9 med it was a trifle small-thought it might be an 8 instead-win some you lose some
 3 weeks after buying these shoes , i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined . This never happened to the cheap Target brand we bought . I have to throw them away . The insole does n't come out so I ca n't even try to bleach them .
 These shoes are not as good as they used to be . Very little support . The sole is very thin . Definetly not worth the price .
 These Navy blue Keds were more black than navy blue . The picture of the shoes on Amazon was very different than the one I received . I put them next to my black keds and you could not tell the difference between the navy blue and the black keds . Very disappointing .
 I ordered these Navy Keds tennis shoes for my daughter . The color shows navy , but when they arrived they looked black ... the box said navy ! Had to return because of the shade .
 Do not buy ! The Keds quality has become garbage ! Much narrower , cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price !! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart . Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end .
 Well in one of the descriptive pictures the bottom of the shoe is all black ! The shoes I received were a brown rubber color on the bottom of the shoe . Also in another picture , the shoe inside is white and the shoes I received were blue inside . They are not as comfortable as a pair of keds that I owned years before .
 I ordered a pair of black and white keds and was sent a pair of plain black keds . In my opinion they are not nearly as cute as the black and white ones . Also , I ordered a narrow pair because I have really narrow feet , but the narrow pair is pretty tight on me . I ca n't imagine how they have extra narrow pairs because the narrow ones looked abnormally skinny . So be warned . I would have returned them but I had to wear them to a wedding as part of my bridesmaid outfit a week from the time they arrived . I probably will not be wearing them again and I wish I could return them for the black and white pair I had ordered .
 I 've ordered Ked 's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality . The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $ 5 . No support , thin canvas - just junk . I 'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe . I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to . No support , no padding , more narrow , thinner canvas . I 've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference . Save your money . You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $ 5 - $ 8 , it just wo n't have a Keds tag . This is no longer the bargain it once was . Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator . What 's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe do n't even know it 's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago .
 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?
 I bought this sneaker from my Mom who has worn the same style for years . I 'm sorry to say that we were not happy with our purchase - it seems that the mold for the shoe has changed - the stitching on the top of the shoe is in a different place and does not make this a comfortable shoe for my mom .
 I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them . They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them . I will not purchase any Keds in the future .
 The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem . The shoes that arrived had been worn . I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had . He made a good offer however , I decided to wash the shoes and keep them , which I did . Now , I have an infection on my toe . Not good .
 These shoes are not as good as they used to be . Very little support . The sole is very thin . Definetly not worth the price .
 I bought my black Keds last winter . Within 6 months , there was a hole in the canvas above the toe of the left shoe . -LRB- Not because the shoe was too small , but because the canvas was extremely thin . -RRB- Also , the soles look much thicker in the photos than in reality .
 My new sneakers broke my heart ! They have been making subtle changes for the past several years . This last one was too much . I have been wearing Keds sneakers for about 60 years and absolutely loved them . Several years ago they came out with flared soles , -LRB- I said to myself , I guess I can live with that . -RRB- Then they began making the toes more pointed . Did n't really like that . What 's wrong with toe room ? Time for new ones - pictures showed the flared soles were gone -LRB- GREAT -RRB- . Ordered a pair . The toes are still too pointed , but the insole is as hard as a rock -LRB- maybe not quite -RRB- and the built in arch support was gone ! They had a perfect product and really ruined it . I could just cry . I returned my shoes and they were very kind and gave me a full refund .
 If you order these Keds sneakers today you will NOT be getting the same sneaker that has reviews from a year or more ago . Believe me , they are entirely different.Well , darn . As an almost life-long Keds wearer I can say with some authority that what I received are NOTHING like any pair of Keds sneakers I 've ever had before.Previously there was at least light arch support even in the most basic of their sneaker styles , this pair has none . The sole is stiff and clunky , the canvas fabric is thin and poor quality and they are in general , junk . No quality of any kind left in this previously reliable brand.My usual size in these is a 7 and that has always been 100 % comfortable and a perfect fit when worn with a pair of sport socks . This pair is saggy and baggy on top even when tied and the sides bagged out too.They WILL be going back.Save yourself time and aggravation and pass these by .
 Avoid doing business with Shoemall ! Check their feedback ! I 've made two orders with Shoemall and both times they do n't have my items in stock . It seems they do n't update on Amazon regularly . I 'll never buy from them again . Beware , they 'll charge & send you the accessory to an item and later contact you that the main item is out of stock . This happened to me both times I 've ordered . Really bad business practices !
 I have an old pair of these shoes that I have loved for a long time , but needed to replace . I ordered this pair and was very disappointed in the quality . I have only worn these shoes perhaps a dozen times and the sole is already coming apart . They also have this weird squeak with every step that I take . I will be replacing these , but will not purchase another Keds shoe .
 After reading some of the other reviews , I hesitated to purchase these Keds but decided to take a chance anyway . That was a mistake . The Keds that arrived the other day are nothing like I remember -LRB- and I lived in Keds for many years -RRB- . These are a very cheap version of the sturdy , supportive Keds of yesteryear that fit like a glove and lasted forever . The new ones are also quite a bit narrower , thinner , pointed in the toe , and feel like something you 'd get at a dollar store for a few bucks . Returning this product for a refund and wo n't be purchasing Keds in the future .
 I wore these about twice a week for about 5 weeks before they began splitting apart . To late too return them now so it was a waste of money . Very disappointed in the quality . I wore Keds for years and never had any problems with quality . Will not buy this brand again .

 I have worn Keds sneakers for many years , always ordering size 6.5 . The label in the sneaker and the box are labeled 6.5 , but this sneaker is at most size 5 , or it is a child 's sneaker.Very disappointed .
 The shoes were an amazing fit , but when I washed them -- in cold water , I might add -- the blue dye from the soles bled out onto the white canvas . Perhaps , it will wash away next time , but I was more than miffed .
 Not only is the canvas cheap & lightweight , it has a bluish tinge to it . The tongue of the shoe is only sewn halfway ... i.e. , the inside is merely the raw cut . The first time I washed them -LRB- in cold water -RRB- , the blue dye from the inside bled thru to the white upper . Very disappointed in what was formerly a great basic sneaker ... I suppose Keds has succombed to the Chinese influence . Very sad indeed .
 I bought these in both white and stone . I really like the stone , as it does n't seem to stand out as much as the white . Also , it 's a nice change from white all the time . My mom liked the stone color when she saw mine , so I ordered a pair for her as well.We 've noticed there is a change in the way Keds have been made since the 90s . They are not as comfortable . The arch can be `` bumpy '' or nonexistent , and they run a little small . I wear a size 8 , and the stone pair are tight on me . Tighter than the white for some reason . I 'm sure they will get better as they break in , but I 've never had a pair of Keds that is this tight . My feet actually hurt the first day I wore them . That never happened to me with Keds . And I have narrow feet . Someone with a wider foot could n't wear these comfortably , at all . The sneakers also do n't last as long as they used to . I wore Keds a lot when I was in high school , and one pair would last me a long time . Now , I notice the edges at the bottom of the shoes start to come apart with much less wear , and the footbed becomes very flat and uncomfortable . They do n't feel as cushiony as they used to , even when brand new . Very different . Wearable , and I like them , but they are not as good as they used to be . I suspect they were not made in China a decade + ago . I think they are made smaller than they used to be , because even looking at my feet while wearing them , I noticed they make my feet look smaller . I like that , but , not at the expense of comfort . I might try an 8 1/2 next time . The white fit better for some reason , not so small.Update

 I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them . Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable . Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now . Some stuff should be left in the 80s !!
 They sent the wrong color LEDs , I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked .

 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?
 Even though I ordered my normal size , these shoes pinched my toes painfully . I ended up throwing them in a donation box .
 Eh . I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap , but I should have paid more attention to the reviews . The quality is way low with these shoes . They 're super uncomfortable and make your toes feel like they 're packed in sardines . -LRB- And I have really small feet - I 'm a women 's 5.5 -RRB- Now that I see them on my feet , they do n't even look that cute . Anyone who buys KEDS for the first time ONLINE should realize that they are exactly what they seem
 The shipping cost was less than what it would have cost me in gas to go the store to buy
 I got these shoes in December and they are VERY cheap . NOT worth the money . I could have gone to a local store and paid a lot less . Additionally , the shoes I received did not look like the shoe in the photo . The shoe i received was more of a sketcher type shoe with a longer top . I would NOT recommend them to a friend or relative . They are not what i expected . the top of the shoe is already coming apart . I 've had Keds before and I do n't know if it was just this pair , but I will not buy shoes this way again .
 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .
 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 I almost always wear a size 6 but as soon as I put these on , they hurt my feet . They are extremely narrow - returned right away .
 In any shoe I ideally I wear a 7 1/2 W. I usually end up with an 8 M because there is no wide width offered . This summer I wanted canvas tennis shoes for summer and decided to try some Keds . There seems to be no consistency of sizing , however , between colors or styles , and I have had to try different colors and styles due to `` not available '' items . Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug . So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long , but wide enough . I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W -LRB- no Chambray available in 7 W -RRB- and it was waaay too short and very tight . I do n't think a size 8 W would even fit . This idea of shoes `` running small '' or `` running large '' makes no sense to me . Just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it .
 I was so disappointed with these shoes . In fact , I returned them . The quality is not that of the Ked 's that I grew up wearing !

 Had these boots for a while . First thing i noticed the laces started to fall apart.I 've never seen a boot sole so sparsely treaded a bit like a tyre on your car less rubber on the road less traction and its going to wear out quicker.Because of the sole when your walking the boot seems to fold on top of your toes very annoying . The inner sole has no arch support and not much spring my feet started to ache after 20 mins walking and lay have n't done that before , had to change them.Seems to run a size to big thats not much of a problem just wore thicker socks.Fine to wear in the middle of winter but in the summer just to hot to wear , even when i put on thinest socks i could fine.They do n't seem to breath at all.No tag or loop on the back to help pull them on even my running shoes have them.Buy timberland at least lay are real leather and better soles same price !
 The shoe seemed nice . I purchased the 2E version since I read in another review that they can be tight . Unfortunately , the top of the tongue bit into my ankle when I tied the shoe . Did n't matter which sock I wore . I had to return .
 The right boot sole was defective , had like a ridge on the outer edge making boot very uncomfortable to walk in . Return and refund procedure was painless . This was the second pair of these boots that had defective sole .
 I hike several days a week all year in rough mountain terrain , much of it off-trail and over rocks . I 've gone through several pairs of these Hi-Tec Altitude boots over the years . The factory supplied insoles are comfortable initially , but are made of a compressible closed cell foam that eventually does not rebound from compression well after some months of use . When the foam becomes compressed , the padded effect is lost and my feet begin to hurt . This can be solved by purchasing and installing an aftermarket pair of insoles such as the Sole Softec Ultra foodbeds , or another quality insole.This problem is not exclusive to Hi-Tec , as I 've seen it with other boots and running shoes also . Some aftermarket insoles/footbeds are made of resilient material that does not tend to stay compressed with heavy use . I am not sure why the manufacturers of boots and shoes do n't just use suitable footbeds in the first place , but I assume that they save a little money by doing what they do.Aside from the poor insoles , the boots themselves are comfortable , keep my feet warm in fairly cold weather even though they are not insulated , and the soles provide good traction.UPDATE 2-26-2012My son purchased a pair of these Hi Tec Altitude boots in the last year . After only 100 miles of hiking , the traction lugs on the soles were deteriorating very badly and coming off . Suspect a bad batch of the sole composite material . I purchased some of the very first Hi Tec boots when they first came out and they held up very well . Then , some years ago , our family had backpacked twelve miles into a designated wilderness and the sole of my daughter 's Hi Tec boot completely separated from the upper . Lacking any repair material , I had to hike 12 miles out , drive to town several hours away , purchase a new pair of boots , drive back , and hike twelve miles back in with the new non-Hi Tec boots , just in time to join the family on a 12 mile hike out ! I 'd assumed that perhaps in the years that passed , Hi Tec had solved the quality control issues , that the experience was a fluke , and I went back to them . A mistake , apparently .
 I thought how could you go wrong with 270 plus positive reviews but shoes are probably the most difficult thing to review because hardly anyone has the same foot or preferences . And they really need to fit well and feel good or they can ruin what should be a good time . Shoes are one thing you should n't buy just for the price.I bought these for hiking but as soon as I put them on I knew I 'd be in trouble after a day out in these . While the fit is great -LRB- it 's very hard to find boots that come wide -RRB- there is hardly any cushion inside - anywhere . They just did not feel comfortable . I prefer to wear thin socks so that does n't make up the lack of comfort . The lining even feels rough . But the worst is the seam that hits right at the ball of my ankle . Scrape , scrape , scrape , that 's all I could feel . Imagine several hours of that . I also did n't notice any arch support at all.Based on other reviews it also seems that the quality is not consistent . I do n't think that was the problem with mine , they just do n't work with my feet .
 Do n't know what all the people who gave these boots a great review were thinking but these are not great boots . They did arrive on time but they are not worth the saved money . First off the boots had spots around the lower edge -LRB- where the boot and the rubber bottom meet -RRB- where there were huge holes where there was missing glue . Tried them on anyway and took them off within 2 minutes off walking around my house . They were the most uncomfortable boots I have ever tired on . They were so bad my feet and ankles hurt for an hour afterwards . The &#34; insole &#34; they put in the shoe is a joke at best . It feels like you are walking on a piece of granite . Would not recommend for anyone looking for any boot that they want to actually wear .
 Lasted about as long as a pair of boots from wally world for half the price . I live a on a small farm and I do some welding and construction . I guess for a city slicker they will last a life time .
 Either the upper was stuffed too full or I got a bad pair ? I wore these for 10 minutes and my achilles was in agony on both ankles . I tried folding the upper down into the shoe and let it sit that way to stretch it a little but it just did n't work .
 Product reviews are very subjective . Based on the reviews of this boot I hoped for a great boot at a fair price . Instead I found the boot to be subpar in terms of comfort . They shoes were stiff and far too ` roomy ' . My feet where floating inside them . I returned them immediately . I 've had far more comfortable boots right out of the box .
 They keep coming untied ! If it was n't for that I would give it 5 stars . The boot is waterproof , it is comfortable , wont give you calluses or corns . But they have hooks for wrapping the laces over at the top that no matter how you try and tie it , they will inevitably become undone ! The first time
 I am writing this review after I confirmed that my first pair of these boots are bad with manufacturing defect . After reading all these excellent reviews about the Altitude IV , I purchased a pair with high expectations . However , my first pair had a defect in the left shoe . It lacked arch support and it was uneven on the bottom which made my foot hurt . At first , I thought it was just the insole which I put in another pair on top of what is in the boots . However , it did not help , and my foot continued to hurt . Today , I went to a retail store and tried out another pair of the same model and size , and the arch support is great in both feet with proper insole cushion . I promptly exchanged my boots.All in all , my point is that I am disappointed with Hi-Tec for making bad shoes and still allowed them to be sold . 5 star for these boots but 1 star for the poor quality control .
 Length :
 I have owned these boots for several years now . They fit well , are quite comfortable , and seem watertight . However , about 1 year ago I was on a hiking trip in Costa Rica . We were on a trail that needed to cross several streams to reach a waterfall . The guide took one look at my boots and told me I would have problems because several past clients had slipped on the wet rocks in similar boots . Other brands of hiking boots did not have the same problems . I noted that anytime you have water and rocks together there are potential problems of slipping , especially if there is moss . Thus , I discounted the warning . Later , at one of the waterfalls it was necessary to step on several wet stones . I found that my boots could not get any kind of grip on the slick rocks . I had never experienced anything so slick . The others in my party did not have the same problems . I usually am one of the most sure-footed hikers , but these boots made it feel like walking on ice in dress shoes . I finally had to take off my boots and go barefoot , which did not pose the same problem of slipping . One of the other men in the group told me that he was a pilot in the US Air Force and that in his squadron these Hi-Tec boots had been prohibited because there were too many injuries coming in and out of the cargo planes when it was wet . Ironically , even though these boots seem to be waterproof , you would not want to use them in a wet area that could also be slick . They seem to work fine on rough ground , even when wet . Finally , after wearing these boots for several seasons -LRB- primarily when I am outside in snow and slush -RRB- , they have developed some very annoying squeaks . So , it is embarrassing walking in a group because my boots make so much noise . Otherwise , these boots have been fine .
 Although the reason I did not like the Hi-tech altitude IVs are subjective , I will at least explain why i did n't like them.First off , there are a bit big and bulky . No so much heavy as just get in your way . I did n't feel like I could have very good freedom of movement in them.they were comfortable , and felt good in terms of cushioning the sole of my foot . it 's not so much soft as much as it is slightly sloped on the medial and lateral sides of the heel the form more of a cradle for the posterior of the foot . most of this cradling is provided by the inserted sockliner.three things I was especially disappointed with were the heel height -LRB- very high , felt like you were wearing a cowboy boot -RRB- , stiff forefoot toe-up bend that made walking feel more like rocking on a semicircle plate rather that the shoe actually flexing and an unnatural overlay under the left big toe beneath the sockliner.When i think about it , it does walk and resemble a cowboy boot sole form -LRB- not tread but actual sole plate shape -RRB- and heel height . comparing them to a walking shoe , sport shoe or even a timberland boot which i compared to these , the forefoot did have much more `` rock '' to it , which i thought felt weird . for instance , the timberland boots ' toe lays flat on the ground . in this shoe , the toe will be slightly elevated off the ground . and the toe box is not very flexible to allow for the more common flattening.The unnatural and bulge under the toe could not have been normal . likely a factory defect of some type that passed unnoticed through quality control . it was not only distracting -LRB- i have a pet peeve about symmetry - each side should feel the same and equally balanced -RRB- but it was painful after a few minutes of walking if you push off your toes at all.from above , i thought the shoe was ugly , which is important to me because that is the part of the shoe you , the wearer , see most . the leather shows markings easily . and i thought the top around the ankle fit either too loose or too tight , depending on how you lace it.I do not know about it 's waterproofing ability ; I did not wear it in wet conditions . insulation to cold is average to below average . it felt about 1/2 size too small.if you are looking for a design like this , with a higher rise and similar stying , it was fairly comfortable . I do not believe the overlay bulge under the toe would be a problem with other shoes of this make and model , just an isolated incident.Amazon shipping was fast and excellent . i enrolled in Amazon Prime free because I am a college student and got 1-day shipping for $ 3.99 . great deal.just did n't like them . not for me . in the process of returning them now . hope this helps .
 The GOOD
 I have owned these boots for years . They are very good Quality and very Comfortable . They lasted me winter after winter . In fact I had to replace the Laces 3 times . Now for the pair I ordered , not good as Hi-Tec has changed their manufacturer . The pair I own and love are made in China and fit like a glove . Assuming they were the same , I purchased a pair from Amazon -LRB- which is priced excellent -RRB- but they did not fit proper at all . The Boot is now made in Malaysia or something ... and are no longer the same . Which is too bad . So as far as Amazon goes ... `` flawless as usual '' Returning them was not a problem . Just beware of these boots . Try them on at your local Store to check the comfort before you buy online.Mark from Thunder Bay ON , CANADA : -RRB-
 These boots are water proof as advertized but they are not comfortable . I had to get some inserts just to wear them for a day . The lace hooks do not grab the shoe lace and hold so it is a pain just to lace them up . I would not recommend these to anyone .
 I have purchased and worn these boots for years , but since manufacturing has moved to Indonesia the boots are smaller sizes and very narrow . I recently ordered two pairs of these boots in their widest size . Upon arrival I compared them to my old boots that are a `` d '' width . THEY ARE EXACTLY THE SAME ! THERE IS NO WIDE , THEY ARE THE SAME WIDTH !!!!!! I contacted Hi-Tec in regard to the problem because I like to give a person/company a chance to correct the error . Some woman wrote back to me sayin that they were aware of the problems and were currently awaiting another shipment . Nothing about them being sorry for being so stupid as to move the manufacturing from the US . No offer to send me a correct pair . I DO N'T KNOW IF THE CO. . SOLD OR WHAT BUT IF THEY CA N'T TREAT LONG TIME LOYAL CUSTOMERS BETTER THAN THIS THEN i WILL GO SOMEWHERE ELSE ! ANOTHER AMERICAN CO SELLING OUT FOR THE ALMIGHTY DOLLAR-WHAT A SHAME.SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE THAT WILL FIT AMERICAN MENS FEET . SHAME ON YOU HI-TEC !
 I 'd ordered these boots based on decent reviews and price . I rarely return purchases to Amazon but I did return these . The boots were fairly heavy , stiff and narrow . I get that new boots will be stiff but both the uppers and lowers were too stiff for me . I returned them and bought Adidas boots with Gore Tex uppers which were much more comfortable , flexible and light with good sole traction .
 3 months with them and my left boot it open in half i think the glue they use is not good i mean 70 bucks for 3 months is not worth it
 Oversize and they pinch my legs . I had to trim the top 1/2 inch off the boots to keep my legs from bleeding they hurt so bad . Cheap Crap but a notch better than Walmart boots .
 This pair of boots are too tight and between sizes is big jump , i do n't know if there is any other way I can stretch them a bit , they are also only made for soft soil , asphalt concrete will finish them too fast
 I got these shoes in December and they are VERY cheap . NOT worth the money . I could have gone to a local store and paid a lot less . Additionally , the shoes I received did not look like the shoe in the photo . The shoe i received was more of a sketcher type shoe with a longer top . I would NOT recommend them to a friend or relative . They are not what i expected . the top of the shoe is already coming apart . I 've had Keds before and I do n't know if it was just this pair , but I will not buy shoes this way again .
 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .
 I was n't looking for a good walking shoe , just a specific look ; -LRB- surprisingly hard to find simple plain blue sneakers -RRB- . Since newer reviews seemed generally positive , I thought I would take a shot . Unfortunately , these are n't acceptable even for light use . Very tight and feel like cardboard . Note
 I bought my black Keds last winter . Within 6 months , there was a hole in the canvas above the toe of the left shoe . -LRB- Not because the shoe was too small , but because the canvas was extremely thin . -RRB- Also , the soles look much thicker in the photos than in reality .
 My new sneakers broke my heart ! They have been making subtle changes for the past several years . This last one was too much . I have been wearing Keds sneakers for about 60 years and absolutely loved them . Several years ago they came out with flared soles , -LRB- I said to myself , I guess I can live with that . -RRB- Then they began making the toes more pointed . Did n't really like that . What 's wrong with toe room ? Time for new ones - pictures showed the flared soles were gone -LRB- GREAT -RRB- . Ordered a pair . The toes are still too pointed , but the insole is as hard as a rock -LRB- maybe not quite -RRB- and the built in arch support was gone ! They had a perfect product and really ruined it . I could just cry . I returned my shoes and they were very kind and gave me a full refund .
 If you order these Keds sneakers today you will NOT be getting the same sneaker that has reviews from a year or more ago . Believe me , they are entirely different.Well , darn . As an almost life-long Keds wearer I can say with some authority that what I received are NOTHING like any pair of Keds sneakers I 've ever had before.Previously there was at least light arch support even in the most basic of their sneaker styles , this pair has none . The sole is stiff and clunky , the canvas fabric is thin and poor quality and they are in general , junk . No quality of any kind left in this previously reliable brand.My usual size in these is a 7 and that has always been 100 % comfortable and a perfect fit when worn with a pair of sport socks . This pair is saggy and baggy on top even when tied and the sides bagged out too.They WILL be going back.Save yourself time and aggravation and pass these by .
 Avoid doing business with Shoemall ! Check their feedback ! I 've made two orders with Shoemall and both times they do n't have my items in stock . It seems they do n't update on Amazon regularly . I 'll never buy from them again . Beware , they 'll charge & send you the accessory to an item and later contact you that the main item is out of stock . This happened to me both times I 've ordered . Really bad business practices !
 I have an old pair of these shoes that I have loved for a long time , but needed to replace . I ordered this pair and was very disappointed in the quality . I have only worn these shoes perhaps a dozen times and the sole is already coming apart . They also have this weird squeak with every step that I take . I will be replacing these , but will not purchase another Keds shoe .
 After reading some of the other reviews , I hesitated to purchase these Keds but decided to take a chance anyway . That was a mistake . The Keds that arrived the other day are nothing like I remember -LRB- and I lived in Keds for many years -RRB- . These are a very cheap version of the sturdy , supportive Keds of yesteryear that fit like a glove and lasted forever . The new ones are also quite a bit narrower , thinner , pointed in the toe , and feel like something you 'd get at a dollar store for a few bucks . Returning this product for a refund and wo n't be purchasing Keds in the future .
 I wore these about twice a week for about 5 weeks before they began splitting apart . To late too return them now so it was a waste of money . Very disappointed in the quality . I wore Keds for years and never had any problems with quality . Will not buy this brand again .

 They sent the wrong color LEDs , I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked .
 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 I have worn Keds sneakers for many years , always ordering size 6.5 . The label in the sneaker and the box are labeled 6.5 , but this sneaker is at most size 5 , or it is a child 's sneaker.Very disappointed .
 The shoes were an amazing fit , but when I washed them -- in cold water , I might add -- the blue dye from the soles bled out onto the white canvas . Perhaps , it will wash away next time , but I was more than miffed .
 Not only is the canvas cheap & lightweight , it has a bluish tinge to it . The tongue of the shoe is only sewn halfway ... i.e. , the inside is merely the raw cut . The first time I washed them -LRB- in cold water -RRB- , the blue dye from the inside bled thru to the white upper . Very disappointed in what was formerly a great basic sneaker ... I suppose Keds has succombed to the Chinese influence . Very sad indeed .
 I bought these in both white and stone . I really like the stone , as it does n't seem to stand out as much as the white . Also , it 's a nice change from white all the time . My mom liked the stone color when she saw mine , so I ordered a pair for her as well.We 've noticed there is a change in the way Keds have been made since the 90s . They are not as comfortable . The arch can be `` bumpy '' or nonexistent , and they run a little small . I wear a size 8 , and the stone pair are tight on me . Tighter than the white for some reason . I 'm sure they will get better as they break in , but I 've never had a pair of Keds that is this tight . My feet actually hurt the first day I wore them . That never happened to me with Keds . And I have narrow feet . Someone with a wider foot could n't wear these comfortably , at all . The sneakers also do n't last as long as they used to . I wore Keds a lot when I was in high school , and one pair would last me a long time . Now , I notice the edges at the bottom of the shoes start to come apart with much less wear , and the footbed becomes very flat and uncomfortable . They do n't feel as cushiony as they used to , even when brand new . Very different . Wearable , and I like them , but they are not as good as they used to be . I suspect they were not made in China a decade + ago . I think they are made smaller than they used to be , because even looking at my feet while wearing them , I noticed they make my feet look smaller . I like that , but , not at the expense of comfort . I might try an 8 1/2 next time . The white fit better for some reason , not so small.Update
 I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them . Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable . Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now . Some stuff should be left in the 80s !!
 Even though I ordered my normal size , these shoes pinched my toes painfully . I ended up throwing them in a donation box .
 Eh . I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap , but I should have paid more attention to the reviews . The quality is way low with these shoes . They 're super uncomfortable and make your toes feel like they 're packed in sardines . -LRB- And I have really small feet - I 'm a women 's 5.5 -RRB- Now that I see them on my feet , they do n't even look that cute . Anyone who buys KEDS for the first time ONLINE should realize that they are exactly what they seem
 The shipping cost was less than what it would have cost me in gas to go the store to buy
 I bought this sneaker from my Mom who has worn the same style for years . I 'm sorry to say that we were not happy with our purchase - it seems that the mold for the shoe has changed - the stitching on the top of the shoe is in a different place and does not make this a comfortable shoe for my mom .
 I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them . They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them . I will not purchase any Keds in the future .
 The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem . The shoes that arrived had been worn . I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had . He made a good offer however , I decided to wash the shoes and keep them , which I did . Now , I have an infection on my toe . Not good .
 I 've ordered Ked 's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality . The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $ 5 . No support , thin canvas - just junk . I 'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe . I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to . No support , no padding , more narrow , thinner canvas . I 've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference . Save your money . You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $ 5 - $ 8 , it just wo n't have a Keds tag . This is no longer the bargain it once was . Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator . What 's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe do n't even know it 's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago .
 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?
 3 weeks after buying these shoes , i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined . This never happened to the cheap Target brand we bought . I have to throw them away . The insole does n't come out so I ca n't even try to bleach them .
 I almost always wear a size 6 but as soon as I put these on , they hurt my feet . They are extremely narrow - returned right away .
 I ordered these Navy Keds tennis shoes for my daughter . The color shows navy , but when they arrived they looked black ... the box said navy ! Had to return because of the shade .
 These Navy blue Keds were more black than navy blue . The picture of the shoes on Amazon was very different than the one I received . I put them next to my black keds and you could not tell the difference between the navy blue and the black keds . Very disappointing .
 These shoes are not as good as they used to be . Very little support . The sole is very thin . Definetly not worth the price .
 In any shoe I ideally I wear a 7 1/2 W. I usually end up with an 8 M because there is no wide width offered . This summer I wanted canvas tennis shoes for summer and decided to try some Keds . There seems to be no consistency of sizing , however , between colors or styles , and I have had to try different colors and styles due to `` not available '' items . Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug . So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long , but wide enough . I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W -LRB- no Chambray available in 7 W -RRB- and it was waaay too short and very tight . I do n't think a size 8 W would even fit . This idea of shoes `` running small '' or `` running large '' makes no sense to me . Just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it .
 I was so disappointed with these shoes . In fact , I returned them . The quality is not that of the Ked 's that I grew up wearing !
 I bought these shoes in black to match my work uniform only to receive them in the mail to discover that they are super narrow . It 's like these shoes are designed for rabbits or something . Thankfully amazon has very easy returns . If you decide to buy these shoes online try them on first , or read the return policy .
 I bought the white leather sneakers for $ 38 at a DSW store awhile ago . Let me tell you , they do NOT last . I bought Keds hoping for a quality , practical , and stylish shoe that I could wear with anything for a few years . This is what you could expect a few years ago , that Keds were STRONG shoes . Well surprise , they barely lasted one season . The bottom sole of the shoe came unglue from the rest of the shoe , and most of the white leather chipped off leaving patches of brown . Looks terrible , no way worth my $ 40 .
 Well in one of the descriptive pictures the bottom of the shoe is all black ! The shoes I received were a brown rubber color on the bottom of the shoe . Also in another picture , the shoe inside is white and the shoes I received were blue inside . They are not as comfortable as a pair of keds that I owned years before .
 I ordered a pair of black and white keds and was sent a pair of plain black keds . In my opinion they are not nearly as cute as the black and white ones . Also , I ordered a narrow pair because I have really narrow feet , but the narrow pair is pretty tight on me . I ca n't imagine how they have extra narrow pairs because the narrow ones looked abnormally skinny . So be warned . I would have returned them but I had to wear them to a wedding as part of my bridesmaid outfit a week from the time they arrived . I probably will not be wearing them again and I wish I could return them for the black and white pair I had ordered .
 Do not buy ! The Keds quality has become garbage ! Much narrower , cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price !! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart . Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end .
 Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return !!
 the style was wonderful however even tho it said 9 med it was a trifle small-thought it might be an 8 instead-win some you lose some

I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W -LRB- no Chambray available in 7 W -RRB- and it was waaay too short and very tight . I do n't think a size 8 W would even fit . This idea of shoes `` running small '' or `` running large '' makes no sense to me . Just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it .
 I was so disappointed with these shoes . In fact , I returned them . The quality is not that of the Ked 's that I grew up wearing !
 I bought these shoes in black to match my work uniform only to receive them in the mail to discover that they are super narrow . It 's like these shoes are designed for rabbits or something . Thankfully amazon has very easy returns . If you decide to buy these shoes online try them on first , or read the return policy .
 I bought the white leather sneakers for $ 38 at a DSW store awhile ago . Let me tell you , they do NOT last . I bought Keds hoping for a quality , practical , and stylish shoe that I could wear with anything for a few years . This is what you could expect a few years ago , that Keds were STRONG shoes . Well surprise , they barely lasted one season . The bottom sole of the shoe came unglue from the rest of the shoe , and most of the white leather chipped off leaving patches of brown . Looks terrible , no way worth my $ 40 .
 I got these shoes in December and they are VERY cheap . NOT worth the money . I could have gone to a local store and paid a lot less . Additionally , the shoes I received did not look like the shoe in the photo . The shoe i received was more of a sketcher type shoe with a longer top . I would NOT recommend them to a friend or relative . They are not what i expected . the top of the shoe is already coming apart . I 've had Keds before and I do n't know if it was just this pair , but I will not buy shoes this way again .
 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .
 I bought this sneaker from my Mom who has worn the same style for years . I 'm sorry to say that we were not happy with our purchase - it seems that the mold for the shoe has changed - the stitching on the top of the shoe is in a different place and does not make this a comfortable shoe for my mom .
 I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them . They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them . I will not purchase any Keds in the future .
 The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem . The shoes that arrived had been worn . I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had . He made a good offer however , I decided to wash the shoes and keep them , which I did . Now , I have an infection on my toe . Not good .
 I 've ordered Ked 's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality . The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $ 5 . No support , thin canvas - just junk . I 'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe . I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to . No support , no padding , more narrow , thinner canvas . I 've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference . Save your money . You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $ 5 - $ 8 , it just wo n't have a Keds tag . This is no longer the bargain it once was . Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator . What 's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe do n't even know it 's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago .
 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?
 Eh . I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap , but I should have paid more attention to the reviews . The quality is way low with these shoes . They 're super uncomfortable and make your toes feel like they 're packed in sardines . -LRB- And I have really small feet - I 'm a women 's 5.5 -RRB- Now that I see them on my feet , they do n't even look that cute . Anyone who buys KEDS for the first time ONLINE should realize that they are exactly what they seem
 The shipping cost was less than what it would have cost me in gas to go the store to buy
 Even though I ordered my normal size , these shoes pinched my toes painfully . I ended up throwing them in a donation box .
 I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them . Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable . Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now . Some stuff should be left in the 80s !!
 I have worn Keds sneakers for many years , always ordering size 6.5 . The label in the sneaker and the box are labeled 6.5 , but this sneaker is at most size 5 , or it is a child 's sneaker.Very disappointed .
 The shoes were an amazing fit , but when I washed them -- in cold water , I might add -- the blue dye from the soles bled out onto the white canvas . Perhaps , it will wash away next time , but I was more than miffed .
 Not only is the canvas cheap & lightweight , it has a bluish tinge to it . The tongue of the shoe is only sewn halfway ... i.e. , the inside is merely the raw cut . The first time I washed them -LRB- in cold water -RRB- , the blue dye from the inside bled thru to the white upper . Very disappointed in what was formerly a great basic sneaker ... I suppose Keds has succombed to the Chinese influence . Very sad indeed .
 I bought these in both white and stone . I really like the stone , as it does n't seem to stand out as much as the white . Also , it 's a nice change from white all the time . My mom liked the stone color when she saw mine , so I ordered a pair for her as well.We 've noticed there is a change in the way Keds have been made since the 90s . They are not as comfortable . The arch can be `` bumpy '' or nonexistent , and they run a little small . I wear a size 8 , and the stone pair are tight on me . Tighter than the white for some reason . I 'm sure they will get better as they break in , but I 've never had a pair of Keds that is this tight . My feet actually hurt the first day I wore them . That never happened to me with Keds . And I have narrow feet . Someone with a wider foot could n't wear these comfortably , at all . The sneakers also do n't last as long as they used to . I wore Keds a lot when I was in high school , and one pair would last me a long time . Now , I notice the edges at the bottom of the shoes start to come apart with much less wear , and the footbed becomes very flat and uncomfortable . They do n't feel as cushiony as they used to , even when brand new . Very different . Wearable , and I like them , but they are not as good as they used to be . I suspect they were not made in China a decade + ago . I think they are made smaller than they used to be , because even looking at my feet while wearing them , I noticed they make my feet look smaller . I like that , but , not at the expense of comfort . I might try an 8 1/2 next time . The white fit better for some reason , not so small.Update
 These Navy blue Keds were more black than navy blue . The picture of the shoes on Amazon was very different than the one I received . I put them next to my black keds and you could not tell the difference between the navy blue and the black keds . Very disappointing .
 I ordered these Navy Keds tennis shoes for my daughter . The color shows navy , but when they arrived they looked black ... the box said navy ! Had to return because of the shade .
 Do not buy ! The Keds quality has become garbage ! Much narrower , cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price !! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart . Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end .
 I almost always wear a size 6 but as soon as I put these on , they hurt my feet . They are extremely narrow - returned right away .
 Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return !!
 the style was wonderful however even tho it said 9 med it was a trifle small-thought it might be an 8 instead-win some you lose some
 Well in one of the descriptive pictures the bottom of the shoe is all black ! The shoes I received were a brown rubber color on the bottom of the shoe . Also in another picture , the shoe inside is white and the shoes I received were blue inside . They are not as comfortable as a pair of keds that I owned years before .
 I ordered a pair of black and white keds and was sent a pair of plain black keds . In my opinion they are not nearly as cute as the black and white ones . Also , I ordered a narrow pair because I have really narrow feet , but the narrow pair is pretty tight on me . I ca n't imagine how they have extra narrow pairs because the narrow ones looked abnormally skinny . So be warned . I would have returned them but I had to wear them to a wedding as part of my bridesmaid outfit a week from the time they arrived . I probably will not be wearing them again and I wish I could return them for the black and white pair I had ordered .
 I bought my black Keds last winter . Within 6 months , there was a hole in the canvas above the toe of the left shoe . -LRB- Not because the shoe was too small , but because the canvas was extremely thin . -RRB- Also , the soles look much thicker in the photos than in reality .
 My new sneakers broke my heart ! They have been making subtle changes for the past several years . This last one was too much . I have been wearing Keds sneakers for about 60 years and absolutely loved them . Several years ago they came out with flared soles , -LRB- I said to myself , I guess I can live with that . -RRB- Then they began making the toes more pointed . Did n't really like that . What 's wrong with toe room ? Time for new ones - pictures showed the flared soles were gone -LRB- GREAT -RRB- . Ordered a pair . The toes are still too pointed , but the insole is as hard as a rock -LRB- maybe not quite -RRB- and the built in arch support was gone ! They had a perfect product and really ruined it . I could just cry . I returned my shoes and they were very kind and gave me a full refund .
 If you order these Keds sneakers today you will NOT be getting the same sneaker that has reviews from a year or more ago . Believe me , they are entirely different.Well , darn . As an almost life-long Keds wearer I can say with some authority that what I received are NOTHING like any pair of Keds sneakers I 've ever had before.Previously there was at least light arch support even in the most basic of their sneaker styles , this pair has none . The sole is stiff and clunky , the canvas fabric is thin and poor quality and they are in general , junk . No quality of any kind left in this previously reliable brand.My usual size in these is a 7 and that has always been 100 % comfortable and a perfect fit when worn with a pair of sport socks . This pair is saggy and baggy on top even when tied and the sides bagged out too.They WILL be going back.Save yourself time and aggravation and pass these by .
 Avoid doing business with Shoemall ! Check their feedback ! I 've made two orders with Shoemall and both times they do n't have my items in stock . It seems they do n't update on Amazon regularly . I 'll never buy from them again . Beware , they 'll charge & send you the accessory to an item and later contact you that the main item is out of stock . This happened to me both times I 've ordered . Really bad business practices !
 I have an old pair of these shoes that I have loved for a long time , but needed to replace . I ordered this pair and was very disappointed in the quality . I have only worn these shoes perhaps a dozen times and the sole is already coming apart . They also have this weird squeak with every step that I take . I will be replacing these , but will not purchase another Keds shoe .
 After reading some of the other reviews , I hesitated to purchase these Keds but decided to take a chance anyway . That was a mistake . The Keds that arrived the other day are nothing like I remember -LRB- and I lived in Keds for many years -RRB- . These are a very cheap version of the sturdy , supportive Keds of yesteryear that fit like a glove and lasted forever . The new ones are also quite a bit narrower , thinner , pointed in the toe , and feel like something you 'd get at a dollar store for a few bucks . Returning this product for a refund and wo n't be purchasing Keds in the future .
 I wore these about twice a week for about 5 weeks before they began splitting apart . To late too return them now so it was a waste of money . Very disappointed in the quality . I wore Keds for years and never had any problems with quality . Will not buy this brand again .

 These shoes are not as good as they used to be . Very little support . The sole is very thin . Definetly not worth the price .
 These boots where nice . I liked the shaft part and how it went over the knee . The part I did n't like was the actual shoe part . It looked like it had a hidden platform sole , which is not my style ; so I returned them . If you like platform shoes , then this is the boot for you .
 Do n't buy these from Spike Angel . The cheap boot was two sizes too small and they charged me for re-stocking even though they made an error . Horrible company to deal with .
 The boot only comes in whole sizes you ca n't get it in a 6 1/2 or a 7 1/2 it has to be a 6 or a 7 well one size is to small & they other size is to big & the heal does n't feel right , it feels like it 's to far forward it does n't feel like a very comfortable boot .
 i bought these shoes and three days later i could already see the leather strectching and starting becoming very loose and stretched out and didnt last long at all
 I got these shoes in December and they are VERY cheap . NOT worth the money . I could have gone to a local store and paid a lot less .

 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .
 In any shoe I ideally I wear a 7 1/2 W. I usually end up with an 8 M because there is no wide width offered . This summer I wanted canvas tennis shoes for summer and decided to try some Keds . There seems to be no consistency of sizing , however , between colors or styles , and I have had to try different colors and styles due to `` not available '' items . Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug . So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long , but wide enough . I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W -LRB- no Chambray available in 7 W -RRB- and it was waaay too short and very tight . I do n't think a size 8 W would even fit .

 3 weeks after buying these shoes , i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined .

 I was n't looking for a good walking shoe , just a specific look ; -LRB- surprisingly hard to find simple plain blue sneakers -RRB- . Since newer reviews seemed generally positive , I thought I would take a shot . Unfortunately , these are n't acceptable even for light use . Very tight and feel like cardboard . Note

 the style was wonderful however even tho it said 9 med it was a trifle small-thought it might be an 8 instead-win some you lose some

 I 've ordered Ked 's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality . The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $ 5 . No support , thin canvas - just junk . I 'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe . I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to . No support , no padding , more narrow , thinner canvas .

What 's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe do n't even know it 's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago .
 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?
 I bought this sneaker from my Mom who has worn the same style for years . I 'm sorry to say that we were not happy with our purchase - it seems that the mold for the shoe has changed - the stitching on the top of the shoe is in a different place and does not make this a comfortable shoe for my mom .

 Do not buy ! The Keds quality has become garbage ! Much narrower , cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price !! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart . Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end .
 I almost always wear a size 6 but as soon as I put these on , they hurt my feet . They are extremely narrow - returned right away .
 These Navy blue Keds were more black than navy blue . The picture of the shoes on Amazon was very different than the one I received . I put them next to my black keds and you could not tell the difference between the navy blue and the black keds . Very disappointing .
 I ordered these Navy Keds tennis shoes for my daughter . The color shows navy , but when they arrived they looked black ... the box said navy ! Had to return because of the shade .
 3 weeks after buying these shoes , i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined . This never happened to the cheap Target brand we bought . I have to throw them away . The insole does n't come out so I ca n't even try to bleach them .
 In any shoe I ideally I wear a 7 1/2 W. I usually end up with an 8 M because there is no wide width offered . This summer I wanted canvas tennis shoes for summer and decided to try some Keds . There seems to be no consistency of sizing , however , between colors or styles , and I have had to try different colors and styles due to `` not available '' items . Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug . So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long , but wide enough . I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W -LRB- no Chambray available in 7 W -RRB- and it was waaay too short and very tight . I do n't think a size 8 W would even fit . This idea of shoes `` running small '' or `` running large '' makes no sense to me . Just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it .
 I was so disappointed with these shoes . In fact , I returned them . The quality is not that of the Ked 's that I grew up wearing !
 I bought these shoes in black to match my work uniform only to receive them in the mail to discover that they are super narrow . It 's like these shoes are designed for rabbits or something . Thankfully amazon has very easy returns . If you decide to buy these shoes online try them on first , or read the return policy .
 I bought the white leather sneakers for $ 38 at a DSW store awhile ago . Let me tell you , they do NOT last . I bought Keds hoping for a quality , practical , and stylish shoe that I could wear with anything for a few years . This is what you could expect a few years ago , that Keds were STRONG shoes . Well surprise , they barely lasted one season . The bottom sole of the shoe came unglue from the rest of the shoe , and most of the white leather chipped off leaving patches of brown . Looks terrible , no way worth my $ 40 .
 I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them . Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable . Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now . Some stuff should be left in the 80s !!
 Even though I ordered my normal size , these shoes pinched my toes painfully . I ended up throwing them in a donation box .
 Eh . I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap , but I should have paid more attention to the reviews . The quality is way low with these shoes . They 're super uncomfortable and make your toes feel like they 're packed in sardines . -LRB- And I have really small feet - I 'm a women 's 5.5 -RRB- Now that I see them on my feet , they do n't even look that cute . Anyone who buys KEDS for the first time ONLINE should realize that they are exactly what they seem
 The shipping cost was less than what it would have cost me in gas to go the store to buy
 I bought my black Keds last winter . Within 6 months , there was a hole in the canvas above the toe of the left shoe . -LRB- Not because the shoe was too small , but because the canvas was extremely thin . -RRB- Also , the soles look much thicker in the photos than in reality .
 My new sneakers broke my heart ! They have been making subtle changes for the past several years . This last one was too much . I have been wearing Keds sneakers for about 60 years and absolutely loved them . Several years ago they came out with flared soles , -LRB- I said to myself , I guess I can live with that . -RRB- Then they began making the toes more pointed . Did n't really like that . What 's wrong with toe room ? Time for new ones - pictures showed the flared soles were gone -LRB- GREAT -RRB- . Ordered a pair . The toes are still too pointed , but the insole is as hard as a rock -LRB- maybe not quite -RRB- and the built in arch support was gone ! They had a perfect product and really ruined it . I could just cry . I returned my shoes and they were very kind and gave me a full refund .
 If you order these Keds sneakers today you will NOT be getting the same sneaker that has reviews from a year or more ago . Believe me , they are entirely different.Well , darn . As an almost life-long Keds wearer I can say with some authority that what I received are NOTHING like any pair of Keds sneakers I 've ever had before.Previously there was at least light arch support even in the most basic of their sneaker styles , this pair has none . The sole is stiff and clunky , the canvas fabric is thin and poor quality and they are in general , junk . No quality of any kind left in this previously reliable brand.My usual size in these is a 7 and that has always been 100 % comfortable and a perfect fit when worn with a pair of sport socks . This pair is saggy and baggy on top even when tied and the sides bagged out too.They WILL be going back.Save yourself time and aggravation and pass these by .
 Avoid doing business with Shoemall ! Check their feedback ! I 've made two orders with Shoemall and both times they do n't have my items in stock . It seems they do n't update on Amazon regularly . I 'll never buy from them again . Beware , they 'll charge & send you the accessory to an item and later contact you that the main item is out of stock . This happened to me both times I 've ordered . Really bad business practices !
 I have an old pair of these shoes that I have loved for a long time , but needed to replace . I ordered this pair and was very disappointed in the quality . I have only worn these shoes perhaps a dozen times and the sole is already coming apart . They also have this weird squeak with every step that I take . I will be replacing these , but will not purchase another Keds shoe .
 After reading some of the other reviews , I hesitated to purchase these Keds but decided to take a chance anyway . That was a mistake . The Keds that arrived the other day are nothing like I remember -LRB- and I lived in Keds for many years -RRB- . These are a very cheap version of the sturdy , supportive Keds of yesteryear that fit like a glove and lasted forever . The new ones are also quite a bit narrower , thinner , pointed in the toe , and feel like something you 'd get at a dollar store for a few bucks . Returning this product for a refund and wo n't be purchasing Keds in the future .
 I wore these about twice a week for about 5 weeks before they began splitting apart . To late too return them now so it was a waste of money . Very disappointed in the quality . I wore Keds for years and never had any problems with quality . Will not buy this brand again .

 I got these shoes in December and they are VERY cheap . NOT worth the money . I could have gone to a local store and paid a lot less . Additionally , the shoes I received did not look like the shoe in the photo . The shoe i received was more of a sketcher type shoe with a longer top . I would NOT recommend them to a friend or relative . They are not what i expected . the top of the shoe is already coming apart . I 've had Keds before and I do n't know if it was just this pair , but I will not buy shoes this way again .
 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .
 The shoes were an amazing fit , but when I washed them -- in cold water , I might add -- the blue dye from the soles bled out onto the white canvas . Perhaps , it will wash away next time , but I was more than miffed .
 Not only is the canvas cheap & lightweight , it has a bluish tinge to it . The tongue of the shoe is only sewn halfway ... i.e. , the inside is merely the raw cut . The first time I washed them -LRB- in cold water -RRB- , the blue dye from the inside bled thru to the white upper . Very disappointed in what was formerly a great basic sneaker ... I suppose Keds has succombed to the Chinese influence . Very sad indeed .
 I bought these in both white and stone . I really like the stone , as it does n't seem to stand out as much as the white . Also , it 's a nice change from white all the time . My mom liked the stone color when she saw mine , so I ordered a pair for her as well.We 've noticed there is a change in the way Keds have been made since the 90s . They are not as comfortable . The arch can be `` bumpy '' or nonexistent , and they run a little small . I wear a size 8 , and the stone pair are tight on me . Tighter than the white for some reason . I 'm sure they will get better as they break in , but I 've never had a pair of Keds that is this tight . My feet actually hurt the first day I wore them . That never happened to me with Keds . And I have narrow feet . Someone with a wider foot could n't wear these comfortably , at all . The sneakers also do n't last as long as they used to . I wore Keds a lot when I was in high school , and one pair would last me a long time . Now , I notice the edges at the bottom of the shoes start to come apart with much less wear , and the footbed becomes very flat and uncomfortable . They do n't feel as cushiony as they used to , even when brand new . Very different . Wearable , and I like them , but they are not as good as they used to be . I suspect they were not made in China a decade + ago . I think they are made smaller than they used to be , because even looking at my feet while wearing them , I noticed they make my feet look smaller . I like that , but , not at the expense of comfort . I might try an 8 1/2 next time . The white fit better for some reason , not so small.Update
 I have worn Keds sneakers for many years , always ordering size 6.5 . The label in the sneaker and the box are labeled 6.5 , but this sneaker is at most size 5 , or it is a child 's sneaker.Very disappointed .
 They sent the wrong color LEDs , I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked .
 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .

 I was n't looking for a good walking shoe , just a specific look ; -LRB- surprisingly hard to find simple plain blue sneakers -RRB- . Since newer reviews seemed generally positive , I thought I would take a shot . Unfortunately , these are n't acceptable even for light use . Very tight and feel like cardboard . Note
 They sent the wrong color LEDs , I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked .
 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .

 I 've ordered Ked 's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality . The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $ 5 . No support , thin canvas - just junk . I 'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe . I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to . No support , no padding , more narrow , thinner canvas . I 've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference . Save your money . You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $ 5 - $ 8 , it just wo n't have a Keds tag . This is no longer the bargain it once was . Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator . What 's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe do n't even know it 's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago .
 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?
 I bought this sneaker from my Mom who has worn the same style for years . I 'm sorry to say that we were not happy with our purchase - it seems that the mold for the shoe has changed - the stitching on the top of the shoe is in a different place and does not make this a comfortable shoe for my mom .
 I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them . They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them . I will not purchase any Keds in the future .
 The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem . The shoes that arrived had been worn . I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had . He made a good offer however , I decided to wash the shoes and keep them , which I did . Now , I have an infection on my toe . Not good .
 3 weeks after buying these shoes , i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined . This never happened to the cheap Target brand we bought . I have to throw them away . The insole does n't come out so I ca n't even try to bleach them .

 Well in one of the descriptive pictures the bottom of the shoe is all black ! The shoes I received were a brown rubber color on the bottom of the shoe . Also in another picture , the shoe inside is white and the shoes I received were blue inside . They are not as comfortable as a pair of keds that I owned years before .
 I ordered a pair of black and white keds and was sent a pair of plain black keds . In my opinion they are not nearly as cute as the black and white ones . Also , I ordered a narrow pair because I have really narrow feet , but the narrow pair is pretty tight on me . I ca n't imagine how they have extra narrow pairs because the narrow ones looked abnormally skinny . So be warned . I would have returned them but I had to wear them to a wedding as part of my bridesmaid outfit a week from the time they arrived . I probably will not be wearing them again and I wish I could return them for the black and white pair I had ordered .
 Do not buy ! The Keds quality has become garbage ! Much narrower , cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price !! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart . Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end .
 Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return !!
 the style was wonderful however even tho it said 9 med it was a trifle small-thought it might be an 8 instead-win some you lose some
 These shoes are not as good as they used to be . Very little support . The sole is very thin . Definetly not worth the price .
 This was a Christmas gift . As far as I know , the quality is what we expected . The only problem was that it `` toured '' the West Coast for about two weeks before I received it . Thank goodness I ordered several weeks before Christmas !
 I had no problem with the quality of the shoe , my complaint is that the sizing was very confusing . I thought I was buying a pair of size 8 shoe for men or a size 6 for women , but it turned out the other way around . I have tor return these . You need to clarify the sizing of your shoes .

 I would not recommend this shoes . They 're uncomfortable and they 're really hard that 's why I had to return it .

 The shoe is excellent , it looks good and would go with so many things . As always I ordered it in a 13M because I range between 12M and 13M , going with the latter when the toe is somewhat pointed . It was way too small . I put that aside.My friend who is a 10M ordered her 10M and it came , she was all excited , alas , alas ... . the shoe is way too short , it looks like she needs a 12M , ideally 11 1/2 . So what is the point of a good looking shoe if you do not indicate that it runs short . It is truly important to indicate that on your shoes . Very disappointed , first experience with a Moda being short , hope it is my last .
 I ended up giving them away , they were very uncomfortable . I could n't even get through one day with them on .

 I have owned three pair of these boots over the past 11 years . Each of the first two were extremely well built and lasted over 4 years of daily use . The current pair is less than 3 years old and the sole on one boot has cracked . There is no fix for a cracked sole . The leather uppers have been kept well conditioned , and are in great shape . Because the sole is cracked , the boots are worthless . Save your money and look for a different brand boot .
 My boys really liked the boots , they seem comfortable & sturdy . Problem is that the eyelets that hold the shoelaces in place break easily . On one of the pair , the eyelet broke the 1st time he wore it . On the other , it lasted maybe a dozen wears . Hoping Timberland comes through , b/c too late to return to Amazon .

 the asics mexico 66 are the nicest trainers i have ever had - which is why i was so desparate to get hold of another pair - and when the black/grey/gold ones appeared not to be available in the uk i decided to buy them over the internet - sadly eastbay sent me the wrong colour - and whilst they have refunded me the value of the shoes - they have n't done the same with the duty and postage costs which are more than i paid for the shoes themselves . I have also now spent quite alot of money chasing up and trying to get this money back as eastbay assured me i was entitled to it ... and am just about to start the process all over again ... if shopping with them i hope you have a better experience ... second time round i have been impressed by the friendliness and efficiency of the eastbay staff - do n't know whether i 'll get the $ 116 -LRB- not including the purchase price which has been refunded now -RRB- that i am owed ... i think thats down to amazon ... fingers crossed i guess

 Not too pleased that there is no power source -LRB- AC adapter -RRB- included with the product , or any link to find that power source .
 Had I known that this model of glove/boot dryer did not have any type of device to circulate the warm air through the object to be dried I would have never purchased it . I ca n't see how anyone could design a product like this to work on the principal of natural convection , relying on heat to rise without any forced circulation . It took quite a while to try to dry a pair of gloves -LRB- more than a day -RRB- . It now is one of those things you wished you would not have bought , that is to much of an inconvenience to return , that sits in the box in a closet shelf.Spend more to purchase a model with a forced circulation fan .
 this shoe was very comfortable but the straps were broken and I returned the product
 These boots are very small and tight , would fit a maximum of about an 18in thigh . Also the shoe part is very small and uncomfortable .
 They are nice to look at but the tough leather is awful . I 've had these for over a year and I 've worn them no less than 20 times . They still have n't stretched to my feet . Not good for a 9 hour work day .
 I have owned three pair of these boots over the past 11 years . Each of the first two were extremely well built and lasted over 4 years of daily use . The current pair is less than 3 years old and the sole on one boot has cracked . There is no fix for a cracked sole . The leather uppers have been kept well conditioned , and are in great shape .

 I should have known not to buy shoes without trying them on . The fit was way off . I 'll never buy shoes online again .

 The Logo was on the inside of the Sneaker not the outside.It was defective . disappointed with Macy 's .
 i ordered them for my wedding and I got pink ones from converse but i never got the green ones and they charged me for the return . not happy at all
 The shoe looked great , but did n't fit at all . I ordered a size 7 . The strap was so tight that I could barely get my foot into it . Was gon na give them to my mom , who usually wears a smaller size than myself , but she said the same thing . So I exchanged them for an 8 . The same deal all over again . Wasted time was all this shoe gave me . I have a pair of Columbia flip flips already , had them for about 13-14 years . They wear well and would still be in good shape but my puppy got them . I just wanted some that looked newer . Columbia has good shoes , just not this particular one .

 If your idea of comfortable slipper is a piece of wood then you 'll love these .
 the patent leather upper cuts into my foot . I have n't been able to wear them for more than 30 minutes because it is so uncomfortable .

 The shoes were absolutely gorgeous ! The size I ordered was a 10 because I usually wear a 9 1/2 , but just by looking at them I knew they were too small . I had friends at work try them on to see if they wanted them , and we figured out that it 's actually around a 7 1/2 . They 're made in Italy , so perhaps 10 is the European size , but that was n't noted in the online ad .

 These were for my dad.He loves Hush Puppies and , specially , this model of shoes.The last ones we bought got the sole deformed before 1 year . But he decided to give them another chance and buy another pair of the same shoes.As for now , they are OK .
 I need an EEE width.The Amazon search engine claimed that WW was the same.WW is not the the same as EEE.The shoes are too tight .
 These should be a very comfortable shoe . They are n't because the upper is a bunch of synthetic , manmade junk , inside and out . All they do is make my feet sweat . Do n't buy them .

 I ended up giving away these shoes after wearing them one day . We have a recycle area in our apartment building , but it is usually used for things that are not brand new ! These shoes hurt my feet and had no cushioning at all against the concrete I walk on . I will not buy another pair of shoes on line again , unless I know the make and size from hands on purchase before .
 This was called learning the hard way not to believe the hype and not to buy shoes on line . The fit was awful , there is no cushioning to speak of in the soles and other than looking good off my feet these shoes are useless .
 Looks pretty good but uncomfortable for outdoor activities . My feet hurt after walking 5 hours .

 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .
 those are a good shoes , but the delivery provide service is the worst , i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day , i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail , bad deal to me !
 This shoe is great if your into bondage . The sole is very small and does not allow for your foot to naturally expand as you walk in the shoe . Wearing these shoes I feel as if I have ingrown toe nails . Shoe stretchers do not work either , it may provide some measure of comfort but this shoe needs to go back to the drawing board . Buyer beware ! If you are into ancient Chinese foot binding this shoe is for you !
 I should have read the other reviews more closely to realize that the boot slipper pictured and described is NOT what is being shipped in 2012 . As mentioned by others , the product being shipped is Dearfoams Women 's DF451 Bootie which has a large faux fur cuff around the ankle . It does not unfold up and is an ivory color - sure to show dirt and wear over time.I will not review the slippers actualy received - I 'm not sure if I will keep or return them . But they are not the slippers I ordered , and I got no warning that I would receive something other than the pictured item .
 The slippers I ordered were velour and all black . The slippers I received look absolutely nothing like the slippers pictured . They are not velour and they are black w/cream faux fur.Too late to send back because I ordered for the Adopt a Senior program and the party is coming up too quick . Definitely a disappointment .
 Ordered the Black Velour Slippers as pictured by Amazon . When opening the box to wrap , just days before Christmas , I found an ungodly pair of slippers that did not even come close to what was pictured by Amazon . The order had come from BeallsFlorida.Com . They do n't even carry the slippers , so I have to send them back . Thanks for ruining a gift that my wife really wanted , since she had a pair of the same that wore out . If you get directed to another manufacturer by Amazon , be sure that the Manufacturer has it in stock . Anyways , Merry Christmas everybody . Hope your orders go smoother than mine .
 I brought these slippers for my Mom for Christmas . They are nothing like the picture . This company misrepresent this item . The slipper were of poor quality and did n't look like the picture at all . When we call about the problem they said they would sent a return packing label . They lied about that , we waited 2 weeks no label , we called again and still no label . This looks hopeless
 I have size ten feet and they did n't feel comfortable in the product . Gave them to my sister who has smaller feet - 9 1/2
 I bought these for my 17 month old . They fit him perfectly . Due to the fact that they aer listed as `` snow boots '' I naturally assumed that they would be good for outside , in the snow . Way off ... . He wore them in the snow once . He also had snow pants on . The shoes were soaked right through to his socks . Paying upwards of $ 30 for a pair of shoes that are mis-advertised as `` snow boots '' is ridiculous . List them for what they are - cold weather slippers!Since I already wrote his name on the back of them -LRB- day care child -RRB- I ca n't return them ! I could not be more irritated !
 These boots did n't stay on my son 's feet very well at all . They were impossible to slide on because they are so soft ... there 's too much give and they just scrunched up . Also , the soles are soft fabric . They are not at all appropriate for the snow as they get wet right away . Not worth the money in my opinion .
 I am sorry to say that these are the most uncomfortable shoes I have ever owned . I purchased two pair and ca n't wear either of them . They are extremely cute , but do n't let that fool you . Please understand that I am no stranger to wearing heels or trendy shoes . I rarely ever wear anything but heels and spend hours and hours on my feet . These hurt so bad that I actually had to go barefoot in public!Take my advice and stick to Enzo 's , they have never let me down ! Sadly enough , Steve Madden has lost the business of the biggest shoe addict on the planet . I will never buy another pair of Madden shoes .
 One fundamental aspect of organization isthe ability to recognize a contained objectby its label.It is easy to discern this item as &#34; shoe trees . &#34; Men 's shoes and women 's shoes are different.Originally , these shoe trees were marketed asbeing unisex with a general indication of whichmen 's / women 's shoes they would fit.Presently , they are described as unisex.However , the shoe trees received are clearlylabeled on their box as being for women ` sshoes.So if you are a woman , shop with someconfidence , but not too much becauseif the nondescript sizing informationleaves you with unfit shoe trees , youwill have to pay for shipping in additionto the inconvenience of returningthis item .
 My 7 Medium was very narrow and tight , but I liked the look of the shoe and had heard good things about the brand , so I kept them , but still have not been able to stretch them out . Now I wish I had returned them , because I wo n't wear them .
 I love the cotton color , just the right shade for most beige and some white slacks.The show style it the most unconfortable of any Clark shoe I have have . There is something strange about the left shoe , it give me a blister everytime I wear it .
 i do n't understand how can this product receive 5 star rating . it gives the shoes a nasty , rusty , ashy look with very minimum shine . it may be ok to use for primary coating , but not for top coating . i foolishly bought 3 of them , based on the positive feedback , and obviously i 'm stuck with it because i do n't use them .
 The stitching pulled out of the upper toe seam near the bow after less than 3 hours of wear around the house , on carpet.Which is too bad , because they were comfortable and warm . Just not , apparently , well made .
 Soles and stitching wore out after 2 months of use . Buy something else , do n't waste your money on these .
 I have to agree with the last two reviewers - these slippers fell apart much too quickly . This was very sad for me , as they were so incredibly comfortable .
 At face value these seemed to be a nice slipper ... attractive , flannel lined , non-slip sole and a very nice price . I placed my order and , upon receipt , I found that these slippers are fairly narrow and I had to return my original purchase and order another pair one size larger than my normal size.I read some of the reviews regarding their tendency to fall apart at the seams , but wrote them off as cases of people wearing them outdoors instead of as an in-home slipper . I was wrong . I should have heeded the reviewers.I immediately noted that the soles were a bit on the thin side to the point where I could actually feel changes in the floor surface or even the smallest items that I stepped on . I was n't happy about that , but it was n't a game changer . They were still nice slippers for around the house.I 've now had these slippers less than one month and wear them only indoors and mostly on carpeted floors , but the stitching on the right slipper is already coming undone . IN LESS THAN ONE MONTH ON CARPET !!! What a waste of money!From now on I 'll listen to the good folks who shared their experience here .
 I bought these slipper and a similarly-priced pair of Dockers at the same time . When the two pairs arrived , I tried them both on , and immediately noticed that the Staheekum seemed the poorer fit . Both pair were the same size -- 10M -- but the Staheekum seemed too wide and a little short . Because I wanted to see if the Staheekum would stretch in -LRB- most slippers will -RRB- , I wore them first . After three days the left slipper split , the top separating from the side because the stitching gave way . Oh well , I still have the Dockers !
 I bought a pair of these on May 10 , 2011 from Amazon , I loved the looks , still do . Unfortunately I looked at the soles a few days ago and found that both shoes had cracks in the soles that extended all of the way through . I am tough on moccasins and wear them outside occasionally , but the degree of wear which I have seen on the soles in 4 months and the cracks are far beyond what I 've ever seen in this short of a time . I usually wear the real cheap Wal-Mart moccasins and they hold up for at least a year under the same service . I finally bit the bullet and ordered a pair of Rockports . it will be interesting to see how long they hold up .
 I bought these without hesitation because they were Clarks . They hurt my feet so badly I ca n't wear them .
 This shoe got size grossly mislabelled . I ordered size 11 and was afraid of being tight since I wear 11 or 11 1/2 . When I opened the box I found gigantic shoe clearly at least size 13 , but label said 11 . In the same order , my other pair from different brand came exactly 11 as labelled.Quality seems to be good , but being 4 sizes over would not make you any good .
 many people said this shoes is very comfort but it was n't for me . I feel little ... I do n't know ... . it is little narrow and the heel is not balenced ?????
 make sure you order a size up , i bought this shoes for my daughter and the were size 5 but they felt like a 4 , very small , I had to return them right away . very disappointing .
 I purchased these boots for a costume party for work . Before I even arrived at my event , the seam down the middle of the back of one boot had already started to come apart . They were really cute on if you ignored the gaping hole on my calf . I had intended to get two uses out of these this year and wear for Halloween , but looks like I will have to get them repaired somewhere before that can happen.Chacha Boot White Size 7 Accessory
 When I pulled these out of the box , they reeked the PVC plastic smell so badly that I had to let them air out of awhile before I tried them on . After the smell was somewhat tolerable , I grabbed the shoes to put them on , and I noticed the left shoe was horribly scuffed and that the paint was coming off really bad , like it got attacked with scissors or something . Such a bummer ! I ordered them for Halloween and I was just planning on wearing them for the night , but for that price I was annoyed all the whole thing and just sent them back . I will give 2 stars because they are really a fun , cute 60 's shoe , minus the PVC smell and the terrible quality when you look up close .
 I owned a pair of Diesel 's prior to this purchase , and found them to be stylish and comfortable . I was extremely disappointed when I tried these on . The caused extreme blisters on both feet . My feet were bleeding by the end of the day . I tried wearing two pairs of socks on each foot , to no avail . I do not recommend these shoes . They may be fashionable , but they cause so much discomfort that they are not worth it .

 I 'm returning these to Amazon , both for the poor fit and poor design :1 . The size runs large2 . The short part behind the heel is not sufficient to hold the slipper on the foot and is just annoying .3 . The material inside the slipper makes it very slippery and the slipper `` walks '' off the foot.On the plus side
 These are super comfortable , however the firm sole leaves scuff marks all over vinyl , tile , and hardwoods -LRB- I bought them in black -RRB- . My husband swears that the carpets look dirty too . Needless to say , they are going back to the store . Too bad , because they are very comfortable .

 When I first got these shoes , I loved them . They were cute , comfy and a good fit . Within a few days , I noticed they seemed to be a little large after all . After a week or so , I realized they were stretching and were quite loose . But they stayed on my feet -LRB- kind of -RRB- , so I kept wearing them . After a few weeks , they had stretched so much that I could no longer wear them - and then I noticed that the heels had worn half-way down and there were actual holes developing in the bottoms ! This is after less than a month of wearing -LRB- and I 'm not mountain-climbing in them either -RRB- . I called the seller -LRB- Footsmart -RRB- and they said they would not take the shoes back as defective since they had been worn , but gave me the manufacturer 's number . The manufacturer said they had a warranty , so I reported the problem . When I did n't hear back , I tried again . I was told it would take two weeks to receive a response . I waited two weeks -LRB- I work for a manufacturer - we respond to customer complaints within one business day -RRB- . No response . Several calls and one month later , I am still waiting to receive a mailing label so I can send the shoes to the manufacturer for evaluation . I will update this if I do receive a satisfactory solution at any point , but as of now , I would say to stay away from these shoes !
 I 'm a size 9 , through and through , and I 've never had the problems with other shoes that I had with these . Do n't get me wrong - I 'm a Softspots fan , but these shoes are not well-designed . I tried these on and could n't take more than 2 steps in them , they hurt my feet so badly . When the shoe bends as you 're walking , the strips on top come together to pinch the skin on the top of my foot .
 This was without a doght the worst pair of shoes I have ever had the misfortune to attempt to purchase . First they were ugly , second they were way too tight , and last they would never be something I would buy . It cost $ 10 to return and I could not have worn them if I wanted to . This was false advertising if there ever was one .
 The quality of the shoe was good , but I returned them because the fit in the heel was too wide . Slipped up and down when I tried to walk .
 These shoes look great but stretched out so much after wearing one time , they are unwearable . I contacted the seller who ignored my inquiry . I wasted my money . Not recommended .
 Softspots Women 's Trinidad Slip-OnLast year I ordered a size 9 in this shoe . It was a too big but I used a sole insert and a heel pad which solved the problem . The shoes wear well and are comfortable . This year I ordered the same shoe style in size 8 1/2 thinking it would fit perfectly . It was so tight I could not get it on . I returned the shoes and reordered a size 9 which fit but are very snug . These shoes have a strong chemical odor . I have aired them for a week with no improvement . The entire closet literally fills with this odor and I now air them in the garage . I may have to return these shoes too .
 Wasted my money on this shoe . The first day my wife wore them they fit perfectly . By the second day , they streched so much she had difficulty keeping them on her feet .
 Looked like they were substantial sandals . I looked at the pictures very carefully , though what I could not see until they arrived was the poor finished product in the top strap . It was not rounded and finished off soft , rather it was rough along the seam edges and therefore it would give blisters rubbing on the top part of the toes . Shame , other than that it was a decent sandal .
 The sandal is stiff and the quality is so so . The original price is marked much way too high compared to the quality .
 I purchased these knowing they would fit because I had a pair in another color , but I was wrong they were at least 1/2of a size too large . I returned them but had to pay the postage . I feel like that is unfair because they were sized wrong .
 The product runs large and the process of trying the exchange for smallersize is just about impossible . I am still trying to get the shoes back in a half size smaller . They would be o.k. if they fit .
 These shoes run much smaller than Clark 's . I was very disappointed and ended up stuck with them because I could n't get to the post office to return them within the 30 days .
 These were not comfortable for me . I have a bunion on one foot so the adjustable straps were good but after an hour or so on my feet , they hurt . I just have a really hard time finding shoes that do n't hurt my feet and these were not them .
 Propet Women 's W0001 Breeze Walker SandalThis shoe is advertised as a walker , but it did not give my feet enough support for me to walk across the street in them . I was very disappointed and returned the shoes . The return was easy , and I appreciated the service I received , just not the product .
 This shoe looks like my regular diabetic walking shoes , but the quality and workmanship is very poor.The straps were made with such thin leather , that when walking in my livingroom , the straps actuallycut my skin over my ankles and toes . Had to send them right back . Beware of copy cat items whenpurchasing items for yourself .
 PRODUCT WELL MADE , SIZED PROPERLY , LEATHER UPPERS SUPPLE AND NICE . HOWEVER , SOLE WAS VERY HARD AND UNCOMFORTABLE TO WALK IN . STRAP WAS DIFFICULT TO BUCKLE FOR ME , AND THERE WAS NO ARCH SUPPORT AT ALL

 I was hesitant about buying running shoes w/o trying them on first or getting fitted , but these were true to size and oh so comfortable . You really can feel the difference . Their return policy -LRB- 60 days , used -RRB- also reassured me that if they did not work out , I was n't stuck with them . * UPDATE * I 've had the shoes for a few months now -LRB- well passed the 60 day return period -RRB- and the rubber at the bottom is starting to become unglued -LRB- towards the sides of the shoes -RRB- . I most definitely do n't run everyday so this is quite disappointing to see happen already . Substracting some stars ...
 the asics mexico 66 are the nicest trainers i have ever had - which is why i was so desparate to get hold of another pair - and when the black/grey/gold ones appeared not to be available in the uk i decided to buy them over the internet - sadly eastbay sent me the wrong colour - and whilst they have refunded me the value of the shoes - they have n't done the same with the duty and postage costs which are more than i paid for the shoes themselves . I have also now spent quite alot of money chasing up and trying to get this money back as eastbay assured me i was entitled to it ... and am just about to start the process all over again ... if shopping with them i hope you have a better experience ... second time round i have been impressed by the friendliness and efficiency of the eastbay staff - do n't know whether i 'll get the $ 116 -LRB- not including the purchase price which has been refunded now -RRB- that i am owed ... i think thats down to amazon ... fingers crossed i guess
 These shoes were on back order and I still have not received them
 These shoes run so big , and the size is very confusing . I emailed to find out if I could just exchange for a smaller size , but they wo n't do that . I have to send them back , and buy another pair . No thanks .
 Though I am very familiar with Chuck Taylor 's and their sizing , this site confused me . I ended up ordering the incorrect size and had to send them back to the company . Though the company did end up crediting my account back .
 Watch out , Converse are 2 sizes larger than the labeled size . We ended up giving them away , my son is size 11 and they fit his size 13 friend perfectly .
 The product itself was fine but because the item was the wrong size , I had to return for a credit or an exchange . It cost almost ten dollars to return the item after originally spending about six or seven dollars for shipping and handling . If I understand your policy , and you have the correct size and ship that , I will pay another six or seven dollars for shipping . That means for a purchase of about forty dollars , I have paid almost twenty four dollars extra . I would never purchase another clothing item from -LSB- ... -RSB- .
 I 've never wrote a review about any product . I 'm usually satisfied . This however kind of ticked me off . The shoe had some weird stain on it when i first saw them . they were also not the right size . I ended up giving them away .
 I love these converses , the only problem is I used the size guide and ordered a 7 which is supposed to be a uk 5 europe 38 , however I got a massive size 40 -LRB- 7 -RRB- and they do n't fit . Also I now live in London and ca n't return them . sad times : -LRB-
 I love the classic style but miss the quality and durability of the Converse All Stars . I had All Stars that lasted well over five years . Some pairs I even used the soles to slow down and brake while skateboarding and they still lasted a super long time . The Converse All Stars nowadays are no where near the high quality and durability of before . Grab a pair of the high quality Converse kicks from before and compare them to the quality of today . One way to tell a high quality kick from another is the pinstripe on the sole
 I bought this as a xmas gift for my brother . The size of the show was way to big so he went and exchange it .
 I 'm accustomed to Dansko , Sanita , and Allegria shoes , which are all very comfortable , but require a break in period . I 'm ok with that . But these never seemed to get broken in . Maybe my feet are just used to soles on my regular brands . I 'm on my feet 9 hours a day , on concrete , walking around and up and down stairs , for several miles a day , sometimes with long periods standing -LRB- I 'm an adult-education instructor -RRB- . I have heard so many great things about chucks and really wanted a different shoe I could wear from time to time , and was hoping these would be it . I wear a 10 -LRB- 40 -RRB- in women 's and the 8.5 chucks fit my foot well -LRB- thankful I read the other reviews and knew what size to order -RRB- but they just are n't the shoe for me .
 I was very disappointed when I got this sneaker . The soles were very thin and theentire sneaker was very flimsy.I returned it but had to absorb about $ 25 in shipping costs .
 I 've been wearing Chucks for years now , but the pair that I purchased from shoezoo fell apart after 2 months . The sole of the shoe completely ripped off the rest of the shoe , and I 've only used these shoes for casual walking . Pretty ridiculous .
 The service from American Athletics is poor . The shoes were the wrong size but they refused to refund the postage and wanted to charge postage again to resend the correct size . Wo n't be shopping there again .
 My son wore these off and on for a month when school started . Both shoes , the soles started to come off . The right one came off almost completely . Do n't know if this was just a bad pair or what but I would n't order these particular Converse shoes again .
 These shoes look great . They are very trendy and a lot of people are wearing them nowadays . The biggest problem I have with these shoes is that they hurt my feet . The soles are too flat . When I tried running in them , my heels began to hurt . Walking wise , they are n't the most comfortable to say the least . They are also heavy for what they are . Too expensive for what they are . These shoes are probably bad for your back because they do n't absorb any impact . Personally , I do n't recommend them for anyone .
 heard converse shoes were hard to size up . wrong no biggie still like them cant afford now . oh well not ur fault
 I was so happy to get a pair of these shoes , until the second day I had them part of the seam ripped . Go figure with the poorly made stitching . I 've never had a pear of shoes last only one day . I ca n't believe I wasted my money on this . I 've had Wal-Mart shoes last longer than these . 365 times longer than these shoes . WTF
 I ordered these shoes a week and a half ago and still have not recieved them . I do n't know how much longer I am going to have to wait . Your really better off buying them at your nearest retailer of shoes and if they dont have them ask them to order them for you . This is ridiculous . If your expecting a speedy delievery under a week this product may not be for you .
 I wore these shoes to the gym -LRB- powerlifting requires flat soles -RRB- no more than 4 times a week for 3 hours at a time . After 9 months I was sliding the heal on and the seam ripped -LRB- on the opening , between the toe and heal , inside edge -RRB- . Guess I 'll skip the lo top next time .
 was gon na mark this one star ... the size was miss-leading , and too large for my daughter to wear . She really , really wanted these , was soooo excited when she opened them . One full size , or more , too large , maybe men 's vs. women 's ? Miss-marked ? Now what ? There they sit in her room until I can fix the problem . But ... the quality was very nice , shipped well , all that . SO , two stars .
 They picture high tops and only write in the title that it is a converse and whatever color . Only after you order and then see the shoes listed under open purchases does it finally tell you that the item you just bought is low top . I was so upset . Deceiving and conniving company . Then you have to pay for the postage to send it back . I read an earlier review from someone who had the same problem but I thought `` hey , it only happened to one person '' Well , it happened to me too . Just be super careful and read everything.I have only just opened the box , so I do n't know how good/bad the quality is yet . The sizing is right , I am a woman 's 8 , to that is a men 's 6 . It did arrive on time and the correct color and size i selected , but I REALLY REALLY wanted the high tops . The picture was of high top shoes .
 Got her fast , but shoes are to big and it will cost me more money to send them back and then receive them back . There should be a note on how to order Converse . One size smaller than your original foot size . Now I am dealing with shoes that are to big .
 Good looking shoes , but ... after just 1 month , the glue is failing at the edge of the shoe where the foot bends . The shoe still looks perfect , but I had to use shoe goo to fix it . Seems like for the price , and for as long as this style has been around it should n't so this ?!
 Recomend ordering atleast 1/2 size to a full size larger . Straps tend to make it hard to get the foot in and under the strain of trying to put it on can break . No problem shoe still looks good if you cut the straps of .
 These shoes are awful . They 're cheaply made and you ca n't even get your foot inside because of where they place the VERY SMALL straps . Never again .
 These shoes do not look in person the way they look online . They are actually very narrow , and the toe curls up a bit . The shoes break in , right where the design is on the top , and this makes the shoe look bubbly at the top . A very uncomfortable shoe , that will spend its time in my closet , because it is skinny and uncomfortable . Shame on Mr. Cole for this one .
 Okay , first things first . The shoes have excellent comfort on the bottoms of your feet when running . The bad news , because the tongue is so short the edges where the shoelaces lace into end up cutting into your ankles -LRB- literally -RRB- . I wore these shoes and about 10 minutes into my run , my ankles where bleeding . Blood red does not go well with white . I have however rectified a solution to this . You will have to pull out the plastic that holds the shoelaces in -LRB- they are blue in color -RRB- . They are not needed and only cause problems . For me I had only needed to remove the outer plastic , but that might change for someone who is not flatfooted . If you do n't like cutting up your shoes , do n't buy these .
 Have worn these shoes for year . Am only sorry that they do n't come in wide and are no longer in stores .
 The quality of the boots were horrible ! The straps were stitched with orange threads . The shafts that were put on the soles were of two different sizes and werent for that size sole . The heels on the insides were just thrown together . Bunched up and folded leather that hurt the heel . I was not impressed with this product . I would n't give it one star .
 These shoes did NOT live up to their cost . I have already sent them back . I did n't have them but a few days and the laces were falling apart . They were not comfortable at all , and these were wide width and my feet felt like they were in a vice . I have never had a problem with sizing with other shoes before ! I would never buy Timberlands again .
 I had not purchased a Timberland boot in several years and decided upon the purchase . Upon receiving them , I tried on two tube socks and the tongue was so sharp and short that it jabbed into my skin with the socks on . In addition , the boots were durable , however , the boots itself were too heavy to walk around and were too stiff . I had always worn Timberland previous to this purchase and Timberland has changed the make of their shoes dramatically.I contacted Timberland and their response was that they are made over seas . For years there was never an issue with the tongue , as it had a pad around the rim of the tongue and the tongue was extremely long . The boot itself was never heavy nor stiff . Back in the day , they were great to wear on a daily basis.Do not blame Amazon , blame Timberland Company for cutting costs . I will not purchase this product again . Shame on Timberland Company !!
 I bought these and while they look great , they are painful to wear . I thought I just needed to break them in , but after wearing them over the winter , they are still painful to wear . I can only wear them for an hour or two a time . They are too rigid and simply ca n't be broken in . There is no give at all so I ca n't lace them up . They actually change the way I walk . If I wanted to wear uncomfortable shoes , I would just wear heels .
 Ordered these a few days ago and when I first tried them on , I liked them EXCEPT the right boot is MUCH narrower than the left , even though they 're both listed as Medium width . I have narrow feet & the right one pinches.After the first day trying to break them in , my ankles were SORE AS HELL from where the top of the boot rests . The material is just too hard & there 's no give to them at all while walking . Lace these very loosely or you will be sorry ! I can only hope that they become more flexible with time . Wo n't be ordering these again . What a waste . : -LRB-
 I always wear size 7 , D -LRB- wide -RRB- and that is exactly what I ordered . After I tried them on , I found they are way too narrow and stiff -LRB- they feel like medium width B -RRB- . They hurt my feet and I do n't like them at all . I contacted the seller many times , but no response regarding how to return them . If you want to buy these shoes , you should really size up the width .

 These are really nice , soft comfy slippers , however , if you use arch supports , they may not work for you.I placed my arch supports in the slippers and thisraised my foot just enough that the heel keptcoming out of the slipper . I had to return them.I had no problems with the return . If not for that , I would have given them 5 stars .
 My boys really liked the boots , they seem comfortable & sturdy . Problem is that the eyelets that hold the shoelaces in place break easily . On one of the pair , the eyelet broke the 1st time he wore it . On the other , it lasted maybe a dozen wears . Hoping Timberland comes through , b/c too late to return to Amazon .
 The bag is beautiful and soft , but has a very strange , strong odor that is not going away . I have researched online and it seems the odor is from the tanning process used on the leather.However , what I REALLY would not recommend is purchasing this product from Creative Products . I was asked to review them as a seller and put much the same review as above . Then I was contacted by this seller and was TOLD to remove my prior feedback , even though they agreed with my observation that the bag had a strange odor from the tanning process . I was instructed that this was a place for review of their services and not a product review . I perceived the email as very pressuring . As I scrolled through their feedback , I noticed this was their response to most neutral/negative feedback . I think it 's very poor customer service that they are more concerned with their status on Amazon than customer satisfaction and the quality of the products they sell . I wished to change my feedback of them as a seller to negative because I will not do future business with an entity that instructs me on how to leave an opinion . That is very condescending treatment of your customers.However , I removed the feedback with the hopes to leave new feedback . Creative Products is probably aware that once feedback is removed , a buyer can not leave new feedback . I was not aware of this when I removed my feedback , although I should have guessed when Amazon encouraged me not to delete feedback even if pressured by a seller . This left me with a very negative impression of Creative Products .

 I appreciate the attention to detail this brand has , but in my opinion , they look better in the picture .

The material is just too hard & there 's no give to them at all while walking . Lace these very loosely or you will be sorry ! I can only hope that they become more flexible with time . Wo n't be ordering these again . What a waste . : -LRB-
 I always wear size 7 , D -LRB- wide -RRB- and that is exactly what I ordered . After I tried them on , I found they are way too narrow and stiff -LRB- they feel like medium width B -RRB- . They hurt my feet and I do n't like them at all . I contacted the seller many times , but no response regarding how to return them . If you want to buy these shoes , you should really size up the width .
 I had not purchased a Timberland boot in several years and decided upon the purchase . Upon receiving them , I tried on two tube socks and the tongue was so sharp and short that it jabbed into my skin with the socks on . In addition , the boots were durable , however , the boots itself were too heavy to walk around and were too stiff . I had always worn Timberland previous to this purchase and Timberland has changed the make of their shoes dramatically.I contacted Timberland and their response was that they are made over seas . For years there was never an issue with the tongue , as it had a pad around the rim of the tongue and the tongue was extremely long . The boot itself was never heavy nor stiff . Back in the day , they were great to wear on a daily basis.Do not blame Amazon , blame Timberland Company for cutting costs . I will not purchase this product again . Shame on Timberland Company !!
 I bought these and while they look great , they are painful to wear . I thought I just needed to break them in , but after wearing them over the winter , they are still painful to wear . I can only wear them for an hour or two a time . They are too rigid and simply ca n't be broken in . There is no give at all so I ca n't lace them up . They actually change the way I walk . If I wanted to wear uncomfortable shoes , I would just wear heels .

 These shoes did NOT live up to their cost . I have already sent them back . I did n't have them but a few days and the laces were falling apart . They were not comfortable at all , and these were wide width and my feet felt like they were in a vice . I have never had a problem with sizing with other shoes before ! I would never buy Timberlands again .

 I have trouble finding shoes that are wide enough , but was please to slip these shoes on with ease when they first arrived . I was two hours into my shift when I looked down and saw the leather was already wearing off . I 'm not picky with appearances and since I have a hard time finding shoes wide enough I ignored the issue . I 've been wearing these shoes for two weeks now and my feet are still not used to them and I come home with sore feet and ankles .
 For me , these shoes were not good at all . the look is nice but the fit is totally uncomfortable . It 's unfortunate as I do need a comfortable shoes for my job .
 The shoes are no good the glue in the front part of the shoe needs fixing I have this shoes not even a month , they say I have to return the shoes not used well , the problem happen afther i wore them , so 56.00 down the drain . not buying from this seller again .
 I 've had these shoes for a little over a year . They were ok for about the first year . I used to work 10-12 hour days with no real issues with the shoes or pain in my heels/feet . Now I 'm working 8 hour days as a nurse and my heels/feet hurt when I get home . These shoes seem to lack the side support you can get with laced shoes . I am at a loss for what to do ... I like the protection of the slip on shoe , but I like the support of a laced shoe ...
 I always buy these same shoes for work . They are supposed to be bright white . The material on the shoes are discolored . It appeared that they might have been damaged some how , maybe buy extreme temperatures . I 'm not sure . But I 'm sure I will buy these shoes again . But I will not buy from this seller .
 I purchased the shoes in June and I had to buy a new pair of work shoes already and it 's only October . The shoes were a real dissapointment . They were no better than shoes from Payless shoes . Do not recomment at all.I am a waitress an on my feet all day , so I was expecting better from nurse mates .
 This company is a rip off and has bad customer service !!!!!! I bought some nurse mate Bryars a few weeks ago and when I got them I noticed a strong rubber smell , which I thought eventually would go away . After a few weeks , the smell was so strong that my co workers were noticing the smell . I was so embarrassed !! I tried the shoe powders and inserts but still nothing could make the smell go away . So I called nurse mates and they said the shoes were defective and that they would be happy to exchange them . Well I get a phone call stating that they found no smell and I could BUY new ones if I wanted to ! Are you kidding me !? Numerous amounts of people told me they smelled really bad and all of a sudden they do n't !? I was told they have a guarantee but apparently not . I will never be buying from nurse mates again , I 'm better off without the nasty smelly shoes !!!!
 The Nurse Mates were very nice looking and lightweight as described . But I felt they lacked arch support . I stand in one spot for eight hours a day and even after wearing these my feet and back ached at the end of the day . These just did n't cut it for me . : - -LRB-
 I have had my shoes for 2 weeks , I work in a school lunchroom and the white leather is already cracking and the white paint is coming off.If you have to do anything in water like mop these are not the shoes for you .
 Recently I 've found the quality in Skechers on the decline . The soles come unglued , seams break or leather wears quickly . It 's really too bad because these are really comfortable shoes and used to be pretty durable , price considering .
 I bought a pair of shoes for office work and I have been disappointed ever since . I have owned several other Skecher models and have been somewhat happy with them but these shoes have been downright horrible after about a month 's use . My biggest complaint is the squeakiness on the left shoe . The comfort level also is not so great as the back of the shoe rubs on the back of my heal.The shoes are actually quite good looking and the materials are nice . I 'm not sure if its hit and miss with Skechers or if this particular model has design deficiencies .
 I thought these shoes were a real find . They were comfortable , very sturdy looking , and cheap.One early concern , however , was that it really seemed that the shoes could use another eyelet . The heels slipped a bit on my feet . Even if I tightened the laces very tight , the heels would slip as the laces loosened a bit . -LRB- This is a problem that I have had with other `` utility '' shoes . That is , the soles are not so flexible , and as a result it is difficult to keep the heel from slipping . In my opinion , most of them need to have another eyelet . -RRB- I hoped that the shoe would become more flexible with some wear , and the problem would go away . But the problem did not go away . The shoes usually slip on my feet . And as a result of the slipping , the cloth lining on the inside of the shoe has worn away at the heel.But two other much bigger problems emerged with the shoes , problems that were a bit of a surprise.Problem # 1
 I bought these for my husband to wear to work . He loved the fit -LRB- he has a very wide foot -RRB- and found these shoes to be comfy . I bought them because they were Skechers.He came home a couple of days ago and the leather has &#34; peeled &#34; off the top of one shoe and is beginning to peel off on the other . It 's very noticeable , as it is peeling off the toes ! They look horrible . Now , I need to find him another pair to wear to work . I wo n't buy any more Skechers !
 After only 3 months of non heavy-duty use , they have cracks on the top . Very disappointed in this , something you should n't see this early on . Will look for another brand next time I purchase something similar .
 I bought 2 pairs brown and black and the problem was the same . They did n't last for two months . Dont be fool and look for another one .
 the size is ok , it 's comfortable and everything is ok except for the finishing . I ordered the `` Brown '' one which does n't shine , and I got the shiny brown .
 looks nice , but i cant wear them without wearing 2 pairs of socks.cuts into the top of my foot and i literally have a cut on the area above my toes .
 Never wore them because they smelled like moth balls . The odor was so strong that my whole house started to smell like moth balls . Had to return them .
 I love Skechers shoes and I owned many in my life time , but this paid did not hold up , just couple months of wear the soles came loose well before the shoe got any use and wear .
 Upon wearing this shoes for two weeks , they gave me foot problems . I thought they would get better after a few days so I kept wearing them . Now I need to go to the foot doctor because of the pain on my heels.I would NOT recommend this shoes for people who walk a lot at work or are on their feet for long periods of time .
 Purchased these shoes at the end of September . There are cracks on the top of both shoes after barely a month of use . I do n't subject them to a lot of wear and tear ; I work at a desk . This is the second straight pair of Skechers that have lasted me barely a month . Suffice it to say I will never purchase Skechers again .
 The day I got these , I put them on and pressed down with my thumb on top of the shoe ; I wanted to see how much toe-room I had -LRB- everyone does that , right ? -RRB- . My thumb created an indent , essentially caved-in part of the toe area that I still can not get to ` pop out ' . I bought these to replace a nearly identical pair of Skechers that I purchased in '04 that lasted 7 years ! These ones wo n't make it through one season . I question whether the Leather Upper is actually leather at all ! It feels like shiny cardboard .
 Unfortuately , while these Skechers oxfords are initially comfortable and appear rugged , the padded collar is constructed of a very thin , poor-quality leather . After just a few weeks of wear , the finish of the leather in the collar of these shoes cracked and then flaked off . Then the poor-quality leather in this area started to fall apart . So I had a pair of shoes that looked nearly brand new with the collar falling apart and the frayed leather rubbing on the back of my ankle . Also , the pull loop on the back tore after a short time due to the inferior leather . The interior lining is also a cheap , thin embossed cloth that wears quickly in the heel area . You may only get a few weeks of wear before these shoes start to deteriorate in these areas . Other reviewers have also commented on the poor-quality leather and rapid wear .
 My Skechers were very poorly built . I had to return them after wearing 6 times . I now have to wait 4-6 weeks to have them replaced and they wo n't give me my money back to get different shoes .
 I purchased a pair of Sketchers Men 's Alley Cat Utility Oxford blacks and they wore out in less than four months . The heel collar is rubbing off and the rubber outsole is ripping apart from the inner leather sole resulting in the shoes flapping like a pair of flip-flops . The initial wearing of the shoe was painful , pinching at pressure points on the foot . After breaking the shoes in they wore more comfortably , but obviously not for very long . These shoes are an American company brand but are manufactured in China . Given the price and American name brand I expected a little more quality control . I am very disappointed !
 Bought these at a national chain . Wore the occasionally and was very careful with them . The leather bubbled and cracked in several places and the finish wore off the collar part of the shoe all within about 6 weeks . Really bad quality leather . They are good looking and comfortable but 6 weeks is ridiculous . I am very easy on my shoes and always get at least several years out of them . I even have a pair of Elkwoods hiking boots that I used to wear constantly and they are still fine after 10 years . My New Balance sneakers I wear almost every day and are 3 years old with a lot of wear on them I am just now about to replace them . So when these Skechers wore out in 6 weeks I was very upset . The sole look like brand new with no wear on them and now I have to throw them out . This will be the first time I have ever tossed out a pair of shoes with out wearing them out . What a waste of money . I recommend you find another brand . Timberland , Dr. Scholls , Dockers , all make similar shoes that may last longer .
 IT SEEMS LOSING A RETURN TICKET FOR THIS COMPANY IS A MAJOR ERROR . I DID SO AND HAVE N'T BEEN ABLE TO CLEAR THE MATTER WITH THEM SINCE . NEEDLESS TO SAY , I STILL HAVE THE SHOES AND TIME IS RUNNING OUT FOR RETURNING THEM /
 I guess my feet are a little wider than most , but I usually have no problems with boot type shoes . These are so tight I can not even wear them . I wear Converse Chuck Taylors all the time and they are snug , but these just hurt the moment I put them on . So if you have big feet , try these on in a store before ordering . Other than that they look like decent shoes , especially for the price .
 Lied about shipping time ! SHIPPING IS S-L-O-W !!!!!! The 3-5 business day shipping is a lie . After not getting my shoes on time from shoes.com I sent am inquiry email . They responded by saying the shoes should arrive in 5-7 business days . So when they want you to buy the shoes it 3-5 business days , but after you buy , 5-7 business days . I will be going to Zappos.com next time . It will be well over a week before I get my order .
 These shoes with the leather uppers are mandatory for my son 's school . After wearing them for three days , the leather was worn completely through the front . All the kids who wear these kids at school have the same problem . Very cheap leather and poor construction .
 These shoes are beautiful , but tight and flip flop off your feet . It looks like the designers are not taking into account for the arches of the foot . It 's not just this designer but most of the shoes out there . So , from now on I will not buy shoes online . I will be trying shoes on and not waste anymore money .
 Color is not yellow like shown in picture , it 's a gross color I could only describe as `` baby poop . '' They fit fine and are comfortable , but look very cheaply made .
 I purchased these shoes about 2 months ago . My 5-year old son wears them 3 days per week . About 1 month into it , the entire black layer started peeling off - it 's not like the paint is scratched or scraped , which is fine and normal , the ENTIRE BLACK LAYER of the shoes at the toes and around the ankles started peeling off . The laces , too !!! I have never seen the black paint -LRB- or whatever it is -RRB- of laces peel . The quality of these shoes is awful . The worst thing I have seen . I would n't even buy them for $ 5.00 , let alone $ 50.00 . What a rip-off !
 Las fotos no son claras ... y los guayos no vienen completos.No quede satisfecho con la compra .
 This was such a cute shoe in the photo . But I was so surprised when I tried it on that it felt terrible . It cut into my foot , and the shoe 's shape on my foot was unattractive . I think it was the only uncomfortable Clarks shoe I 've ever tried on .
 There is only one problem with the boot , that is , it is too hard to pull on and off . Other than that I like the boot , it 's comfortable and looks good . Next time I will get the one with the zipper .
 I never wanted to write one of these , but I feel I have to . I bought these boots , they were great , but one size too big . So I tried to exchange them . Amazon does n't do exchanges ... apparently too difficult . On top of this , the price doubled after I bought them , so now if I want the boots , Amazon will not honor the previous price . This is something that any dime store would do , but apparently one of the world 's largest online retailers could n't . This is very disappointing , and I would never recomend this company to anyone ... ever ... quite the opposite .
 Item is not authentic . Kenneth Cole is all I wear and those shoes are not Kenneth Cole .

 Shoes seemed comfortable so I have purchased to wear them in the office . The quality was so shoddy - I will never purchase another pair of Florsheim shoes.I have worn them only in a car driving to work and in the office . Still , in 2-3 days the spray-on laquer started to peel of from soles . After 3 weeks or so sole of one shoe desintegrated , cracked . Just imagine , wearing those shoes in the street - would they even last several hours?Could be just one `` unlucky '' pair ...
 When I received these boots I thought , `` oh finally ! '' and they fit nicely in the foot but did n't even hold onto the calve , so they rubbed as I moved . Not only that , inside the heel the metal underneath it came THROUGH not even three months after receiving . The shine was n't as it looks in the pictures and the material began to tear on the tips too soon . I 'd suggest moving elsewhere and finding better boots . Metal in the heel for a few hours is nothing I 'd want anyone else to have to suffer .
 I was so excited when these boots arrived on Saturday , but was quickly disappointed when I tried them on . I do not consider my calves to be large -LRB- I am a petite 5 ' 2 '' and size 4/6 -RRB- , yet I could not zip up these boots . They are at least an inch too narrow .
 I bought these shoes and they only lasted four months . The leather sole was REALLY slippery and never did make it easy to walk with them on . By the last month i had them , the sole had totally separated from the upper . I thought Florsheim shoes were good ; maybe years ago , but not now . These shoes are NOT recommended at all .
 The box said 8.5 Triple E , but the shoes were 9.5 regulars . I purchased another pair at local business .
 The shoes seems to be well put together for having never been worn , because the fit is horrible ! Why I thought buying shoes without trying them on fist -LSB- knowing my size and wearing Florsheims -RSB- is a mystery I will have to self-solve . These are made in Korea -LSB- stamped right under the flap -RSB- on both pairs and the width is as wrong as the makers mark.Stay away from these no matter what the price . I took them to two shoe makers to have them stretched and they said if they tried , the seems would rip apart and the leather would crack . Not a comforting thought since wearing them should naturally stretch them anyway .
 Do n't buy these . I used to love Florsheim -LRB- I still wear an old pair of Comfortech 's -RRB- but I got a bad pair of these .
 I am so disappointed . Its with is narrower than stated but its lenghth is longer than stated around 1 size .
 This is the worst pair of florsheims I 've ever had and I 've had plenty . The construction looks cheap and the sizes are a bit off . I ordered several pairs , one for my father and two for two of my uncles , nobody seems to be happy with theirs.They were priced very cheap ... I suppose you get what you pay for . Still , bad choice for $ 30 ...
 The middle of the shoe is too narrow and makes it hard to walk in . I was very disappointed to have to return these , as I love Nine West shoes .
 At lesst 1 - 1.5 sizes too small . A lot of the comments said to go a half size bigger which I did , but they were still way too small . Amazon charges for return shipping so I definately would recommend a different supplier .
 better off buying the ` steppies ' from bed , bath and beyond . its from the company airplus . this footpetals thing does not provide shock absorbtion ... my balls of the feet still hurt ... does not prevent foot from sliding forward . I have a pointed toe shoe in which i hv placed this and it still slips forward and makes it very hard to walk in . waste of money . Does not do anything it claims .
 I was ordering some of the Sole Stoppers from Foot Petals and thought I 'd try a pack of these too to see if they 'd add some comfort to some heels that had lost their support . After receiving them and trying them out , I am kind of dumbfounded by the good reviews . These provided little to no comfort , and if anything , increased the discomfort in my shoe by being too thin and pushing my foot upward and forward , causing me to get blisters . Save your money.The Sole Stoppers are amazing though !
 I really ca n't review this item because I found the sizes -LRB- EEE -RRB- much too narrow . would have to say the general overall sizing is too skimpy .
 I have worn this model shoe for years , and will wear nothing else . Unfortunately , the vendor Heart and Sole sent me a pair with BOTH insteps heavily creased as though they had been worn . They looked like shoes look AFTER they are broken in . Usually on NEW shoes , the insteps are VERY smooth and look new . After wearing them for awhile , yes , they will crease . The soles of these shoes were unmarked , yet I am suspicious that these were already worn on carpet before being sold to me . I am VERY familiar with the Duke boot , therefore I believe it is not my imagination at work here . Disappointed to say the least . Upon further inspection , I also noticed what appear to be dark ink-like marks on the front of BOTH shoes , and scuff marks on BOTH shoes , between the heels and the soles . I apologize for being so caustic , but this is exactly what took place . To pre-empt the question of why I did n't return them ; they were needed for the holidays .
 This product did n't fit my foot , and the material was too plastic . It was not comfortable . I have medium-wide width feet , and usually Women 's size 9 fits . Not this time . I returned these shoes and got a Men 's Adidas slide sandal .
 Wow , We have bought many pairs of slides over the years , but this pair must have been a second -LRB- not mentioned -RRB- the white stripes started wearing off after one use -LRB- B-ball camp -RRB- & the side seam ripped out @ sole . Poor quality !
 I wear addidas sandals and when I ordered this pair it was too small . Also , I ordered the all white pair , and the white was not all white . It almost looked like it was eggshell colored . I was n't happy with this order and returned them for a full refund .

 The shoe itself is a good product , but it says white/beige and there is no white on the shoe . Very deceptive .
 Shoe is comfortable but the description says off white or white with beige . Which leads you to think the color is mostly white . The true color is neither ! There is absolutely NO WHITE in these shoes . I purchased these shoes because I needed some white off/white shoes NOT beige shoes . No I did not return them it 's too much of a hassel to return things so I kept them and I have worn them once but do not like the color at all . The style is not as cute as her others but they are still a great bargain . The materials are an excellent quality . If you like beige & earthtones you will like these shoes .
 The first thing I noticed on opening these boots was the smell -- which was bad . Secondly , the boots -- a size 8 for my normally 7 1/2 foot , were way too small . I 'm giving this transaction one star because they arrived on time but returning them cost me another $ 15.00 . I still have n't received confirmation they were refunded . Big sigh .
 upon arrival of the boots i discovered they just did not fit , trying to contact amazon or the seller was one `` wall '' after another , so i had to suck up the cost and now have a closet ornament instead of a pair of boots .
 Definitely not worth it . Not only are these boots incredibly cheap/flimsy , there is some ambiguity about which is the left and which is the right foot . They arrived in a very beat-up , dusty box as if they had been sitting in a warehouse for quite some time . I got them on sale and still think they were way overpriced .
 Though cheap and good for minor costume apparel I found these to be very ill fit and lumpy in the heel area , they do n't fit tight and seem to sag in large clumps in various areas.Still an effective costume however .
 I bought size 8 White PU , and when they arrived in the mail I promptly tried them on . In the foot they fit fine , though a bit snugly , but when I tried to zip them up they were too small ! I have about a 14in calf -- average for women in the US is 13 to 14 inches . One would think that as shoe size goes up the calf size in the boot would be bigger , but according to a rep I emailed all of them are 13-inches around . Also , at least in the model I want , they do n't come in a larger calf size . I will not be ordering from this company again .
 These boots look nice but the zipper did not move easily and the ankle is unbelievably small/tight . I have really skinny ankles and I could barely zip them . When I called customer service the agent went to get a size larger to compare the ankle area -LRB- she wore the same size as me -RRB- and she said she could n't zip them up past her ankle . So unfortunately I have to look elsewhere for gogo boots .
 When I received these boots I thought , `` oh finally ! '' and they fit nicely in the foot but did n't even hold onto the calve , so they rubbed as I moved . Not only that , inside the heel the metal underneath it came THROUGH not even three months after receiving . The shine was n't as it looks in the pictures and the material began to tear on the tips too soon . I 'd suggest moving elsewhere and finding better boots . Metal in the heel for a few hours is nothing I 'd want anyone else to have to suffer .
 I was so excited when these boots arrived on Saturday , but was quickly disappointed when I tried them on . I do not consider my calves to be large -LRB- I am a petite 5 ' 2 '' and size 4/6 -RRB- , yet I could not zip up these boots . They are at least an inch too narrow .
 The color and construction is more of plasticy green than grey leather . Does not look like the color in the picture .
 I only wear one kind of ` shoe ' under my suits and that is a dress boot . The problem is that I give the dressboots I wear a real beating
 They look like something made by a 7 year old Taiwanese kid ... who just stared making boots . The material looks cheap and feels cheap -LRB- the black is not as glossy as in the pictures of them online -RRB- . I sent mine back and paid a few dollars more for a super sweet Burberry boot . I can not tell you how cheap they look and feel to the touch !
 These boots , expensive boots , squeak so bad it 's almost funny . The color is not as dark as the gray appears to be in the picture and they are much narrower on the foot . To top it off , they are very slippery even on carpet.So my boyfriend put these on his wishlist and I got them . When he tried them on a few times these things just kept coming up : - Way too squeaky , noisy-Plastic , light gray looking-Narrow-Way too slipperySo I am returning them : - -LRB-
 The first time I saw this boots on here I thought `` What a great boots '' , then I bought them and my surprise was that first I wore this shoes , all the boot 's material started to wizen , 3 days after I wore them again and happened the same thing , since that I have n't used those shoes again and I believe I wo n't ... this is one of the worst purchases I have ever made because the material is not the best and the price for that is not fair at all . Anyway , I hope this review little review help other people 's decision to not buy them even when I know those boots look great.Thanks .
 I bought this boot for the style , which has not ever been changed , but everything else about the boot has . the leather looks worse than pleather and lasts for a much shorter period of time . The boot squeaks very loudly , even after a week of wear . really , it just goes to shoe that you have to spend around 200 or more dollars to get a good boot , nowadays .
 I had been looking for a pair of dress boots for my husband for quite a long time . I thought I 'd hit the mark when I spotted these . What a disappointment . The leather was stiff and not at all the same color as shown in the picture . They were not what I had expected . I thought they would be a nice soft leather and dark brown in color . Especialy for the price . No such luck . Had to send them back .

 I never received the item ordered . I was given a refund because the item was no longer available . Why was it even on the website if in fact it was no longer available ? At least I was given a prompt refund .
 Within one week the center spacer in the heel of both shoes fell out . Apparently it is some sort of shock absorbing type of device . The shoes felt fine and fit well , but fell apart after just a few times worn . I plan on taking pictures and writing the manufacturer with my complaints . I have owned Florsheim shoes before and really enjoyed them . These were awful , and I think they were designed poorly . Hopefully the Florsheim company can make amends .
 I am a school teacher and have used the Florsheim Magna Force for the past 10 years . This year I decided to switch to the Florsheim Men 's Noble Oxford . The heal of the Oxford has a rubber shock absorber bubble for `` more comfort '' . The shock absorber bubble literally burst and ripped on both shoes . This may have been a defect but being that both shoes had the same problem troubles me . The company I used was endless.com and they have a great free return policy for a full refund . I decided not to buy the Noble Oxford 's and instead will buy another Florsheim without the shock absorber bubble at the bottom of the heal .
 - the sole of the shoe is coming away from the leather upper after only 5 months of wear - I have had this problem happen all too frequently with Florsheim shoes - oddly , it has n't -LRB- yet ? -RRB- occurred with shoes bought from a physical store - it will certainly give me pause before ordering on-line again - a disappointment
 Florsheim shoes are the shoes that my father wore and that I could n't wait to get for myself once I hit the working world . I grabbed the Noble style because I wanted it 's rubber sole for durability . I spend a lot of time on my feet at trade shows so I figured that this was a home run.Regrettably , this shoe really hurt the balls of my feet for some reason . I 've never had foot problems before but something about how the shoe was cut and/or the soles of it just did n't sit right with me . I still own the shoes and they have the proper ceder shoe trees in them but I never wear them . I bought a pair of Florsheim Maloy shoes and love them . While not as durable and I 've now worn them through , they were much more comfortable !
 This shoes are dissappointing . My foot slides down at the Toe and it is not very comfortable . I love the Colour and the style , however , I will not be able to wear them too often .
 In my previous review , very happy to receive my KC shoes but to my surprise these were a `` disappointment '' ! Very cheap looking , there were some visible defects -LRB- noticed right away -RRB- , too small and the bottom of the shoe looked worn . Tribeca 's are my favorite KC shoes but again , if you wear a 9 , go a size up for a better fit and comfortability.Good luck , shoe shoppers !
 The reviews in various running magazines purport these shoes to be for the heavier runner . They are no such thing . Imagine strapping a couple of pine boards to the bottom of your feet and trying to run and you get a pretty good idea of how these shoes feel . They are extremely firm -LRB- and I do mean extremely -RRB- . Also , they have the least forefoot cushioning I have ever seen in a shoe including dress street and work shoes . Even though mine are fitted properly the bottoms tend to slap my forefoot as I run . Heavier runners beware !!! I am 250lbs and run fine in cushioned shoes . The Adidas Nova Cushions work great and are cheaper . They are , however , not as cool looking which is what probably sells these shoes . These , like so many other shoes today are designed to appeal to kids . Serious runners beware . My Ken Griffey Jr 's make better running shoes since the cushioning in the bottom is much better while still being `` firm '' . They also weigh about the same and the stiffness is about the same . Forwarned is forarmed .
 Would n't fit my Clarks or Donald J Pliners . Too narrow and pointy , does n't keep the leather tight . Would probably work for some `` real '' boots , but mine got returned .
 the sizing chart states that an XL boot tree will fit a size 13 boot . however , the XL boot tree is just a little short for a size 13 boot and will not stay in place .
 The Woodlore Men 's Boot Tree is not remotely close to the sizing advertized . They run very small and , in my opinion , are so narrow they could not be considered `` Men 's '' . Even ordering a couple sizes up would not resolve the problem of being so very narrow . I definitely would not reccomend them to anyone .

 I felt very bad when I received my order , because buying a number 2 and when I get is a tiny baby . Amazon SPECIFICATIONS no age and it is wrong . I am a disappointed customer .

 Be aware . 5 seconds after turning the polisher on it got hot and smoke started to come out.And yes , the correct batteries were correctly installed.A definite fire hazard .
 According to this seller , my order was shipped one month ago but I did not receive the item yet . The seller wo n't respond to my emails . Not recommendable . I hope to get my money back from Amazon .

 I purchased these shoes to replace a pair I originally bought at Nordstrom -LRB- these were damaged and I had to have another pair -RRB- . The first time I ordered , they were the correct size but they were much longer and did not fit me at all.I ordered another pair in a different color and when they arrived they did not fit properly either -LRB- too long again -RRB- . I thought it would be great to order them online to get a replacement pair since I knew my size , I love the brand and never had a sizing issue with others I have worn.I did not order a 3rd time since both times I ordered they did not fit . It is my opinion that the shoes I received were seconds . Bruno Magli makes wonderful shoes ; great fit and comfortable.I was very disappointed .

 THIS SHOES ARE AWESOME IM HAPPY AND CONTENT WITH THEM IVE PICKED UP WALKING LATELY AND THESE ARE GREAT MY FEET DONT HURT , I DONT GET BLISTERSI AM SO HAPPY WITH AMAZON . COM AND ALL THE THINGS I HAVE PURCHASED FROM THEM FOR NOT SEEING IN PERSON FIRST .
 I bought a pair of Bugaboots about 6 years ago and have worn them maybe 10 to 15 times . The boots are barely broke in and when I went to use them recently I pulled the lace right through the D Ring . Upon further examination I noticed that more than half of the D Rings are nearly corroded through , and these boots are barely broken in . Columbia 's warranty department informed that this would be considered normal wear and that they would not be willing to compensate me for the inferior product . I have owned many lower priced boots and have never had an issue even close to this happen to them . I used to think that Columbia was a premium product , and they have always been priced to reflect that , but this situation has completely changed my mind . I would strongly suggest not wasting your money on an overpriced inferior product .
 Third time wearing my Bugabootoo boots , no more than 6miles walked , and already a 3 '' separation between the leather & rubber sections . A tear , really , since this is a split in the rubber along the seam connecting to the uppers
 Used these boots only a few times and stored them properly . Rubber disintegrated during a winter hike when I was 4 miles and 2500 vertical feet from the nearest trail head . Thank goodness I had duct tape ! Could have been a realy bad situation . Columbia unwilling to help . Brand reliability and service is important to me so I guess I will never purchase from them again . Bean and REI are in my future . Their items are quality and service can not be outdone .
 I had owned these boots for about 3 years and wore them in the winter and a couple of times a year when working at work camps in the summer . I had been pretty happy with the boots because they are comfortable and held up pretty well.This past summer , however , one of the seams on the front part of the boot -LRB- just below the bottom left lace -RRB- tore apart . The rest of the boot is in great shape , but I am obviously very disappointed in the workmanship of this boot . That being said , I can not recommend these boots to anyone who intends to keep them for more than 2 years.I sent an email to Columbia customer service with photos of the broken seam to see if they would replace the boot . Stay tuned .
 I purchased these boots to last through Chicago winters . They are relatively light and comfortable , but the contact point between the rubber and leather begins cracking , letting in moisture and hurting one 's foot . For the price , these boots should be durable -- instead they are defective .
 The boot is comfortable in the foot and is warm and waterproof with good traction . However , the upper chafes my legs just above the ankle . I have noticeable abrasions and extreme discomfort . I do n't normally have this problem with boots . I believe that the upper is too rigid . In any event , I can not wear this boot anymore because it is so uncomfortable .
 Its been about 2 months since purchasing this boot . The 3rd party vendor had a great price and delivered on time , so 5 stars there.The shoe however get mixed reviews . Being a long time Columbia customer , I was n't surprised by the out of the box quality except that I remember thinking how flimsy the plastic speed lace clips looked ... sure enough one has already broke and I no longer use the speed clip feature , always keeping them laced with fingers crossed on the remaining three . -LRB- As an aside , Columbia customer service also gets a mixed review on this . While the clip would be covered under warranty I still will need to cover the freight one way . While this is the industry standard as pointed out to me by the on line customer rep , I do n't feel I should pay one more cent for an under-engineered fault of Columbia 's . And really , do you want to buy something from a just average company ? -RRB- Otherwise the boots do what I had expected , relatively light weight , waterproof , and comfortable , with just enough flex in the uppers to not chafe yet provide support . Grip is good too on varying surfaces except glare ice . I agree with other reviewers that this is an active wear boot , and would not recommend it for sub zero Fahrenheit temps and long periods of inactivity . And , if you overnight with them , plan on sleeping with them to prevent freezing since the liners are not removable . For my 45 minutes a day walking commute to work and day hikes in the upper Midwest the boot works well.Would I buy them again ? Not without a lot more research for an alternative -LRB- preferably with a metal speed lace clip ! -RRB- .
 The seams between the rubber and the leather started failing the first year . I sewed them up and patched them with ShoeGoo , but then the rubber started cracking in several other places . In total I have three major separations at the seams , and 6 other large cracks in the rubber .
 After wearing only a couple dozen times the rubber started to come apart on these where they are stiched together at the seam between the upper and lower sections . I expect that from a 19 dollar mart-mart boot , not something from Columbia . Disappointing.Columbia also wo n't respond to inquiries about their product . Buy something else made by someone else .
 Worked OK for a few outings , but seams fell apart at the seams after approximately 10 wearings . -LRB- See other reviews for confirmation that this is not an abberation . -RRB- Ridiculous . Will * never * buy a Columbia product again . Period .
 As with others I have had the same problem with the bottom plastic/rubber coming undone from the upper fake leather . Also the plastic/rubber gets stiff in the cold and then cracks in multiple places . Worthless boot made in China for a few dollars and then marked up by Columbia to 75 dollars . Avoid at all costs . Columbia will not fix or replace .
 Purchased in late 2006 to replace a pair of Sorels that I had worn for 8 years for snowplowing , showshoeing and winter hiking . Did not start wearing the Bugabootoos until winter 2007 and was surprised that the seam between leather uppers and rubber boot separated within a few weeks . In 2008 , the seam pulled apart entirely , allowing moisture through . Although I like the boot styling , I expected better from Columbia . This year , I will go back to Sorel for the long term .
 So I spend 75 bucks thinking I 'll get a quality boot . The false security of thinking big bucks means quality . Not so . The boot as designed has a major flaw where the rubber -LRB- plastic -RRB- is stitched to the leather uppers . Just wo n't hold . Also the plastic -LRB- rubber -RRB- cracks and splits . Once that happens the waterproof boot becomes a disaster . Here 's the fact , Jack . If you want a waterproof boot , buy a complete rubberized boot . The galoshes of old . The bastardized approach of leather and rubber means problems down the road , say in 5 weeks.Also I notice they are made in China , probably some big factory that turns out the same bugaboot that costs 20 bucks . Save your bucks and buy the pull on galoshes . Or stay out of the water and wear Timberland leathers .
 I 've given up on Columbia 's boots ... I 've had 3 pairs over the past few years and the rubber part over top of the foot has cracked open on all 3 letting snow/water in . It 's too bad really because otherwise I liked them ... they were warm and comfortable for long winter walks and snowshoeing . Anyway , they get a 2-star rating from me .
 I felt very bad when I received my order , because buying a number 2 and when I get is a tiny baby . Amazon SPECIFICATIONS no age and it is wrong . I am a disappointed customer .
 the shoes have patterns on the ankle area that I did not see online when ordering . And those patterns totally ruined the shoes . if i had seen from pics online , i would have not bought this pair of shoes .
 These flip-flops came and at first attracted me as the navy/white Bahamas design was interesting and sexy to look at . However , these sandals have no substance to them at all . They weigh nothing , have a very thin rubber layer to cushions and mat the ground with , and the ` microfiber-ish ' bands rub terribly against my skin which have caused blisters.What 's even more disappointing is that ` Parke and Ronen ' is getting mass publicized in Manhattan right now and a close friend was given several pair of these same exact sandals for FREE at a sample sale on Fifth avenue ! The store had tons of them and just wanted to promote the label . I wasted $ 25.95 and have blisters ...
 Its been about 2 months since purchasing this boot . The 3rd party vendor had a great price and delivered on time , so 5 stars there.The shoe however get mixed reviews . Being a long time Columbia customer , I was n't surprised by the out of the box quality except that I remember thinking how flimsy the plastic speed lace clips looked ... sure enough one has already broke and I no longer use the speed clip feature , always keeping them laced with fingers crossed on the remaining three . -LRB- As an aside , Columbia customer service also gets a mixed review on this . While the clip would be covered under warranty I still will need to cover the freight one way . While this is the industry standard as pointed out to me by the on line customer rep , I do n't feel I should pay one more cent for an under-engineered fault of Columbia 's . And really , do you want to buy something from a just average company ? -RRB- Otherwise the boots do what I had expected , relatively light weight , waterproof , and comfortable , with just enough flex in the uppers to not chafe yet provide support . Grip is good too on varying surfaces except glare ice . I agree with other reviewers that this is an active wear boot , and would not recommend it for sub zero Fahrenheit temps and long periods of inactivity . And , if you overnight with them , plan on sleeping with them to prevent freezing since the liners are not removable . For my 45 minutes a day walking commute to work and day hikes in the upper Midwest the boot works well.Would I buy them again ? Not without a lot more research for an alternative -LRB- preferably with a metal speed lace clip ! -RRB- .
 The seams between the rubber and the leather started failing the first year . I sewed them up and patched them with ShoeGoo , but then the rubber started cracking in several other places . In total I have three major separations at the seams , and 6 other large cracks in the rubber .
 After wearing only a couple dozen times the rubber started to come apart on these where they are stiched together at the seam between the upper and lower sections . I expect that from a 19 dollar mart-mart boot , not something from Columbia . Disappointing.Columbia also wo n't respond to inquiries about their product . Buy something else made by someone else .
 Worked OK for a few outings , but seams fell apart at the seams after approximately 10 wearings . -LRB- See other reviews for confirmation that this is not an abberation . -RRB- Ridiculous . Will * never * buy a Columbia product again . Period .

 I bought a pair of Bugaboots about 6 years ago and have worn them maybe 10 to 15 times . The boots are barely broke in and when I went to use them recently I pulled the lace right through the D Ring . Upon further examination I noticed that more than half of the D Rings are nearly corroded through , and these boots are barely broken in . Columbia 's warranty department informed that this would be considered normal wear and that they would not be willing to compensate me for the inferior product . I have owned many lower priced boots and have never had an issue even close to this happen to them . I used to think that Columbia was a premium product , and they have always been priced to reflect that , but this situation has completely changed my mind . I would strongly suggest not wasting your money on an overpriced inferior product .
 Third time wearing my Bugabootoo boots , no more than 6miles walked , and already a 3 '' separation between the leather & rubber sections . A tear , really , since this is a split in the rubber along the seam connecting to the uppers
 Used these boots only a few times and stored them properly . Rubber disintegrated during a winter hike when I was 4 miles and 2500 vertical feet from the nearest trail head . Thank goodness I had duct tape ! Could have been a realy bad situation . Columbia unwilling to help . Brand reliability and service is important to me so I guess I will never purchase from them again . Bean and REI are in my future . Their items are quality and service can not be outdone .
 I had owned these boots for about 3 years and wore them in the winter and a couple of times a year when working at work camps in the summer . I had been pretty happy with the boots because they are comfortable and held up pretty well.This past summer , however , one of the seams on the front part of the boot -LRB- just below the bottom left lace -RRB- tore apart . The rest of the boot is in great shape , but I am obviously very disappointed in the workmanship of this boot . That being said , I can not recommend these boots to anyone who intends to keep them for more than 2 years.I sent an email to Columbia customer service with photos of the broken seam to see if they would replace the boot . Stay tuned .
 I purchased these boots to last through Chicago winters . They are relatively light and comfortable , but the contact point between the rubber and leather begins cracking , letting in moisture and hurting one 's foot . For the price , these boots should be durable -- instead they are defective .
 The boot is comfortable in the foot and is warm and waterproof with good traction . However , the upper chafes my legs just above the ankle . I have noticeable abrasions and extreme discomfort . I do n't normally have this problem with boots . I believe that the upper is too rigid . In any event , I can not wear this boot anymore because it is so uncomfortable .

 Shoe is comfortable but the description says off white or white with beige . Which leads you to think the color is mostly white . The true color is neither ! There is absolutely NO WHITE in these shoes . I purchased these shoes because I needed some white off/white shoes NOT beige shoes . No I did not return them it 's too much of a hassel to return things so I kept them and I have worn them once but do not like the color at all . The style is not as cute as her others but they are still a great bargain . The materials are an excellent quality . If you like beige & earthtones you will like these shoes .
 The shoe itself is a good product , but it says white/beige and there is no white on the shoe . Very deceptive .
 these are beautiful - but soooooo painful - I really can not wear them - they are very narrow ... sucha shame , I really loved the look of these .
 These are definitly `` wow '' shoes , but ... the 4 '' heel makes them look a little too much like dancer shoes . If the heel were at 3 '' they would not have been too over the top for me . Plus , it may have been possible to walk more than just from the car to the party !
 I wore these shoes for 1 day working in the garden . when I took them off the tops of my feet were inflamed with red bumps that scabbed over and were very tender to the touch , I could n't wear any shoes that touched the tops of my feet for almost 2 weeks.they were comfortable to wear , but the rash is still really bad after 2 weeks . I WO N'T wear them again ...
 Est delivery date was 12/13 - 12/16 guess what date it is today ... 1/3/11 ... . it was going to be a nice Christmas gift for my son-in-law . . I was hoping for 2010 . To many other good companies out there to use this one again .
 i 'm very dissisafied with my crocs . they send the wrong size.so i 'm stuck with them .
 tengo mas de un mes que pedi mis cross y aun no me han llegado necesito saber q paa con ello por favor denme razon de ello ya q los tengo cargados en mi tarjeta y todo gracias
 Maybe I 'm too concerned about fashion , but there are shoes out there that are just as comfortable , and dont make me look like I work in a hospital . I see people wear these every day and I cringe when they walk by . I guess theyre good for people maybe 70 and older who need orthotic shoes and cant wear sandals to the beach .
 I ordered size 8/9 since i wear a size 8 1/2 shoe , they fit my husband who wears size 11 . To top it off I ended up paying $ 6.00 for the return shipping . It will be the last time I order shoes from them .
 Do not waste your money on these they are cheaply constructed I received them today and the snap on the strap that holds them to your foot was broken and would not stay snapped together save your money I paid my money for broken merchandise again please save your money these are not constructed well at all
 Croc strap broke the first time it was worn . Not pleased with this product at all .
 I have bought several pairs of crocs and these did not appear to be original crocs . I always buy the same size and these arrived way too big , how could the same size be too big if these are original crocs ? Had to send back and pay for shipping , not very happy and will only buy crocs from the original website .
 I was very dissapointed with this product . I bought some beach crocs a few years ago and they were made in Canada . These were made in China . They are not the same quality at all . These are not cushioned like the others were , they are also smaller even tho they are the exact same size as the ones made in Canada . These are NO better than the cheaper `` knock offs '' you find in dollar stores .
 We received the Crocs , which are my son 's favorite shoe to wear . However , when he wore them to school the next day , one of the straps broke and I had to run a different pair of shoes to him at school . We are hoping to return them and get a new pair -- that will last longer than two hours .
 Sorry . I bought them as a gift and have a report that the holes up front are very uncomfortable especially for big toe . I will be returning , which I am bummed about , and , have probably learned not to buy a clothing item on line as a gift .
 I begin by saying I have worn Crocs `` Beach '' Men 's XXL for many years . They have always been excellent shoes ... UNTIL , I PURCHASED MY MOST RECENT PAIR . The first thing you notice is they are MADE IN CHINA.Without question the shoes from China are smaller . To the point of even being tight . The back strap ismore narrow than the previous shoes I purchased . The front part of the sole is not as thick . Overall , it feels like a cheap imitation . I may NEVER buy another Croc shoe .
 I have bought several prs of crocs , but these were sized differently than the others which were unisex and thus mfor my size 11 feet were too small .
 I have worn Crocs for years . They are almost a must for diabetics . The ones on this page are made in China . The cheaper quality is immediately visible , the sizing is off and the last -LRB- shape of shoe -RRB- also appears different . I wish Amazon would clearly stipulate where stuff is made so we could have a choice .
 My non-Croc-type of footwear are more comfortable and better made than the real Crocs I bought recently ! Quite disheartening .
 These boots were very nice looking but , unfortunately , turned out to be heavier than expected when received . They would have been used for work but my husband was unable to use them and they were returned .
 I was extremely disappointed with the shoes upon arrival . They look nothing like the picture . this color -LRB- bronze leather -RRB- is cheap looking and not even close to leather looking .
 These shoes are NOT real leather , and they are not comfortable . They are obviously made of a cheap material -LRB- not real leather -RRB- . To make it worse , someone tried to mark out the words `` man-made '' on the inside of the shoe with a black marker ! Prpmptly returned them , and do not plan on buying any shoes from Mr. Madden again .
 PLEASE I WANT YOU TO SEND THE ITEM BY POST BECAUSE IT IS VERY DEFFICULT TO GET THE YOU HAVE BOUGHT
 Soon after I bought a pair , . i uses them A little . A few days ago one of the air pumps in the sole sprung a leak and his right shoes rim no longer spins .
 These shoes are not functional at all . They are velvet all over making it impossible to go outside when wet or slightly wet . Also the rubber sole ? It 's a very hard rubber , there 's no give . You 'd be better off walking barefoot . The sequins are also coming off after a few wears - but when you buy it for $ 2 at Target , I guess I ca n't ask for much .
 Answer
 This is not the shoe you want for wearing around DisneyWorld . I got them before our trip , and started to wear them to work -LRB- to break them in -RRB- . There is a seam just above the last knuckle of my toes . I would get a rub when I would put my foot down . The rub tuned into a blister . I tried different degrees of tightening . Nothing helped . The sandals look good , but I think I wasted my money .
 I have played tennis 2-3 times a week for over 20 years and have had generally good luck with purchase of tennis shoes , even purchased via the internet . I have played mostly wearing Addidas Barricades shoes over the past 3 years and believe they are great for my game . I purchased these less-expensive shoes mostly for kicking around in and not for my regular game play . I 've had them for about 10 months and have finally decided to toss them . They really do not fit well and my impression is that they are simply a bad design by Addidas . Really suggest that you try them before you buy them in this case or you may has similar results .
 is ok not super confort but ... not too badaftere few days of use , more confort . .
 These slippers are not a bargain . They fall apart within a few months and then you need to buy another pair again . Do n't buy 'em . They 're junk .
 I was so happy to have some new warm slippers ! Sadly , they did n't even last for two months of gentle use ! The soles are falling off and I have rubber bits all over the house . The slippers are already in the trash can . Do n't waste your money on these .
 I bought these slippers because the description specified arch support but in fact the slippers have none . In the photo , the sole of the slipper appears to have a raised arch area , however , this turns out to be only a styling effect where the sole wraps the upper -- there 's no structure under it at all . The quality of the slipper 's upper is lower than expected , it appears to be entirely sythetic despite the description of `` wool-blend '' . Also , one of the soles was not glued in properly and fell out after I put my foot in the slipper the first time . The rubber sole is substantial , though heavier than I like to wear in a slipper . All in all , I regret spending the money on these .
 Purchased these for my lady as a Christmas present . Soles are cracking and insoles are sliding . Very poor quality for the $ $ $ .
 I ordered a size 6 . The outside of the box said size 6 . The slippersINSIDE were size 11 and full of cat hair . I am allergic to cats.The soles are black recycled rubber from china and make markson the floor . The soles also stink . I sent them back and will notbe ordering anymore slippers . It 's not possible to know what theyare like until they arrive -- then its too late .
 I bought these slippers in December 2007 and brought them back to NZ . I am very disappointed they have fallen to pieces , the soles have cracked and lumps of rubber fall off when wearing them . This is after 6 months of wearing.July 2008
 Within a month of purchasing these slippers the black rubber bottom began to chip and fall off . I will never buy them again , nor would I recommend them to anyone .
 In the 6 months that I have owned these slippers they have completely fallen apart . The rubber sole has split along the seam and cracked in other locations . Plus , they arrived with a horrible baby powder/chemical perfume like smell that took forever to fade . I was looking for a replacement slipper for my J.Crew wool clogs that were 16 years old and the wool had just started to get holes ... I certainly did not find a good replacement .
 Its been about 2 months since purchasing this boot . The 3rd party vendor had a great price and delivered on time , so 5 stars there.The shoe however get mixed reviews . Being a long time Columbia customer , I was n't surprised by the out of the box quality except that I remember thinking how flimsy the plastic speed lace clips looked ... sure enough one has already broke and I no longer use the speed clip feature , always keeping them laced with fingers crossed on the remaining three . -LRB- As an aside , Columbia customer service also gets a mixed review on this . While the clip would be covered under warranty I still will need to cover the freight one way . While this is the industry standard as pointed out to me by the on line customer rep , I do n't feel I should pay one more cent for an under-engineered fault of Columbia 's . And really , do you want to buy something from a just average company ? -RRB- Otherwise the boots do what I had expected , relatively light weight , waterproof , and comfortable , with just enough flex in the uppers to not chafe yet provide support . Grip is good too on varying surfaces except glare ice . I agree with other reviewers that this is an active wear boot , and would not recommend it for sub zero Fahrenheit temps and long periods of inactivity . And , if you overnight with them , plan on sleeping with them to prevent freezing since the liners are not removable . For my 45 minutes a day walking commute to work and day hikes in the upper Midwest the boot works well.Would I buy them again ? Not without a lot more research for an alternative -LRB- preferably with a metal speed lace clip ! -RRB- .
 The seams between the rubber and the leather started failing the first year . I sewed them up and patched them with ShoeGoo , but then the rubber started cracking in several other places . In total I have three major separations at the seams , and 6 other large cracks in the rubber .
 After wearing only a couple dozen times the rubber started to come apart on these where they are stiched together at the seam between the upper and lower sections . I expect that from a 19 dollar mart-mart boot , not something from Columbia . Disappointing.Columbia also wo n't respond to inquiries about their product . Buy something else made by someone else .
 Worked OK for a few outings , but seams fell apart at the seams after approximately 10 wearings . -LRB- See other reviews for confirmation that this is not an abberation . -RRB- Ridiculous . Will * never * buy a Columbia product again . Period .
 As with others I have had the same problem with the bottom plastic/rubber coming undone from the upper fake leather . Also the plastic/rubber gets stiff in the cold and then cracks in multiple places . Worthless boot made in China for a few dollars and then marked up by Columbia to 75 dollars . Avoid at all costs . Columbia will not fix or replace .
 Purchased in late 2006 to replace a pair of Sorels that I had worn for 8 years for snowplowing , showshoeing and winter hiking . Did not start wearing the Bugabootoos until winter 2007 and was surprised that the seam between leather uppers and rubber boot separated within a few weeks . In 2008 , the seam pulled apart entirely , allowing moisture through . Although I like the boot styling , I expected better from Columbia . This year , I will go back to Sorel for the long term .
 So I spend 75 bucks thinking I 'll get a quality boot . The false security of thinking big bucks means quality . Not so . The boot as designed has a major flaw where the rubber -LRB- plastic -RRB- is stitched to the leather uppers . Just wo n't hold . Also the plastic -LRB- rubber -RRB- cracks and splits . Once that happens the waterproof boot becomes a disaster . Here 's the fact , Jack . If you want a waterproof boot , buy a complete rubberized boot . The galoshes of old . The bastardized approach of leather and rubber means problems down the road , say in 5 weeks.Also I notice they are made in China , probably some big factory that turns out the same bugaboot that costs 20 bucks . Save your bucks and buy the pull on galoshes . Or stay out of the water and wear Timberland leathers .
 I 've given up on Columbia 's boots ... I 've had 3 pairs over the past few years and the rubber part over top of the foot has cracked open on all 3 letting snow/water in . It 's too bad really because otherwise I liked them ... they were warm and comfortable for long winter walks and snowshoeing . Anyway , they get a 2-star rating from me .
 I bought a pair of Bugaboots about 6 years ago and have worn them maybe 10 to 15 times .

 I purchased these boots to last through Chicago winters . They are relatively light and comfortable , but the contact point between the rubber and leather begins cracking , letting in moisture and hurting one 's foot . For the price , these boots should be durable -- instead they are defective .
 The boot is comfortable in the foot and is warm and waterproof with good traction . However , the upper chafes my legs just above the ankle . I have noticeable abrasions and extreme discomfort . I do n't normally have this problem with boots . I believe that the upper is too rigid . In any event , I can not wear this boot anymore because it is so uncomfortable .
 FOR SOME REASON THIS SHOE REALLY APPEALED TO ME , BUT OF COURSE IT WAS TOO LONG . I HAVE A NARROW FOOT , AND FINDING SHOES THAT FIT IS SO HARD FOR ME , SO WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED TO HAVE TO RETURN IT .
 I was disappointed in the fit of this shoe . All of my other Easy Spirits have been very comfortable . This one hurt the top of my foot where the shoe ends . This shoe has a slippery bottom except for the heel , not good for teachers or those walking on tiled floors .
 Take it from someone who has very tough feet to make happy ! This Leo shoe is way too stiff for someone with bunions or bad feet . It ca n't compare with the Capezio 700 t-strap which worked well for me once I got it stretched a little .
 I bought these to replace a previous massaging pair , the ones with all the nubs in it . These did n't do it . The bottom has no cushioning at all and the material they are made from cause feet to sweat .
 Beware the sizing . What they show as size 6-6 .5 is not correct . It was way bigger than a US size 6 or 6.5 . Returned the product . Information provided by Amazon was bad .
 Its been about 2 months since purchasing this boot . The 3rd party vendor had a great price and delivered on time , so 5 stars there.The shoe however get mixed reviews . Being a long time Columbia customer , I was n't surprised by the out of the box quality except that I remember thinking how flimsy the plastic speed lace clips looked ... sure enough one has already broke and I no longer use the speed clip feature , always keeping them laced with fingers crossed on the remaining three . -LRB- As an aside , Columbia customer service also gets a mixed review on this . While the clip would be covered under warranty I still will need to cover the freight one way . While this is the industry standard as pointed out to me by the on line customer rep , I do n't feel I should pay one more cent for an under-engineered fault of Columbia 's . And really , do you want to buy something from a just average company ? -RRB- Otherwise the boots do what I had expected , relatively light weight , waterproof , and comfortable , with just enough flex in the uppers to not chafe yet provide support . Grip is good too on varying surfaces except glare ice . I agree with other reviewers that this is an active wear boot , and would not recommend it for sub zero Fahrenheit temps and long periods of inactivity . And , if you overnight with them , plan on sleeping with them to prevent freezing since the liners are not removable . For my 45 minutes a day walking commute to work and day hikes in the upper Midwest the boot works well.Would I buy them again ? Not without a lot more research for an alternative -LRB- preferably with a metal speed lace clip ! -RRB- .
 The seams between the rubber and the leather started failing the first year . I sewed them up and patched them with ShoeGoo , but then the rubber started cracking in several other places . In total I have three major separations at the seams , and 6 other large cracks in the rubber .
 After wearing only a couple dozen times the rubber started to come apart on these where they are stiched together at the seam between the upper and lower sections . I expect that from a 19 dollar mart-mart boot , not something from Columbia . Disappointing.Columbia also wo n't respond to inquiries about their product . Buy something else made by someone else .
 Worked OK for a few outings , but seams fell apart at the seams after approximately 10 wearings . -LRB- See other reviews for confirmation that this is not an abberation . -RRB- Ridiculous . Will * never * buy a Columbia product again . Period .
 As with others I have had the same problem with the bottom plastic/rubber coming undone from the upper fake leather . Also the plastic/rubber gets stiff in the cold and then cracks in multiple places . Worthless boot made in China for a few dollars and then marked up by Columbia to 75 dollars . Avoid at all costs . Columbia will not fix or replace .
 Purchased in late 2006 to replace a pair of Sorels that I had worn for 8 years for snowplowing , showshoeing and winter hiking . Did not start wearing the Bugabootoos until winter 2007 and was surprised that the seam between leather uppers and rubber boot separated within a few weeks . In 2008 , the seam pulled apart entirely , allowing moisture through . Although I like the boot styling , I expected better from Columbia . This year , I will go back to Sorel for the long term .
 So I spend 75 bucks thinking I 'll get a quality boot . The false security of thinking big bucks means quality . Not so . The boot as designed has a major flaw where the rubber -LRB- plastic -RRB- is stitched to the leather uppers . Just wo n't hold . Also the plastic -LRB- rubber -RRB- cracks and splits . Once that happens the waterproof boot becomes a disaster . Here 's the fact , Jack . If you want a waterproof boot , buy a complete rubberized boot . The galoshes of old . The bastardized approach of leather and rubber means problems down the road , say in 5 weeks.Also I notice they are made in China , probably some big factory that turns out the same bugaboot that costs 20 bucks . Save your bucks and buy the pull on galoshes . Or stay out of the water and wear Timberland leathers .
 I 've given up on Columbia 's boots ... I 've had 3 pairs over the past few years and the rubber part over top of the foot has cracked open on all 3 letting snow/water in . It 's too bad really because otherwise I liked them ... they were warm and comfortable for long winter walks and snowshoeing . Anyway , they get a 2-star rating from me .
 I bought a pair of Bugaboots about 6 years ago and have worn them maybe 10 to 15 times . The boots are barely broke in and when I went to use them recently I pulled the lace right through the D Ring . Upon further examination I noticed that more than half of the D Rings are nearly corroded through , and these boots are barely broken in . Columbia 's warranty department informed that this would be considered normal wear and that they would not be willing to compensate me for the inferior product . I have owned many lower priced boots and have never had an issue even close to this happen to them . I used to think that Columbia was a premium product , and they have always been priced to reflect that , but this situation has completely changed my mind . I would strongly suggest not wasting your money on an overpriced inferior product .
 Third time wearing my Bugabootoo boots , no more than 6miles walked , and already a 3 '' separation between the leather & rubber sections . A tear , really , since this is a split in the rubber along the seam connecting to the uppers
 Used these boots only a few times and stored them properly . Rubber disintegrated during a winter hike when I was 4 miles and 2500 vertical feet from the nearest trail head . Thank goodness I had duct tape ! Could have been a realy bad situation . Columbia unwilling to help . Brand reliability and service is important to me so I guess I will never purchase from them again . Bean and REI are in my future . Their items are quality and service can not be outdone .
 I had owned these boots for about 3 years and wore them in the winter and a couple of times a year when working at work camps in the summer . I had been pretty happy with the boots because they are comfortable and held up pretty well.This past summer , however , one of the seams on the front part of the boot -LRB- just below the bottom left lace -RRB- tore apart . The rest of the boot is in great shape , but I am obviously very disappointed in the workmanship of this boot .

 They are a little stiff , should have smoother edges around the area you slide you foot in . Not very comfortable .

 These slippers look great , and have good quality materials but are not very comfortable . There is absolutely no arch support - it feels as if you are simply walking on concrete . I would NOT recommend these to anyone and had I tried these on in person , I would have not bought them .
 its really a shame to sell a product like this . ordered a 11 , shoes are marked 11 in the soles , my wife , who wears a 9 is wearing them comfortably . poor purchase thank you c laird evans

 Definitely not worth it . Not only are these boots incredibly cheap/flimsy , there is some ambiguity about which is the left and which is the right foot . They arrived in a very beat-up , dusty box as if they had been sitting in a warehouse for quite some time . I got them on sale and still think they were way overpriced .
 Though cheap and good for minor costume apparel I found these to be very ill fit and lumpy in the heel area , they do n't fit tight and seem to sag in large clumps in various areas.Still an effective costume however .
 I bought size 8 White PU , and when they arrived in the mail I promptly tried them on . In the foot they fit fine , though a bit snugly , but when I tried to zip them up they were too small ! I have about a 14in calf -- average for women in the US is 13 to 14 inches . One would think that as shoe size goes up the calf size in the boot would be bigger , but according to a rep I emailed all of them are 13-inches around . Also , at least in the model I want , they do n't come in a larger calf size . I will not be ordering from this company again .
 These boots look nice but the zipper did not move easily and the ankle is unbelievably small/tight . I have really skinny ankles and I could barely zip them . When I called customer service the agent went to get a size larger to compare the ankle area -LRB- she wore the same size as me -RRB- and she said she could n't zip them up past her ankle . So unfortunately I have to look elsewhere for gogo boots .
 The first thing I noticed on opening these boots was the smell -- which was bad . Secondly , the boots -- a size 8 for my normally 7 1/2 foot , were way too small . I 'm giving this transaction one star because they arrived on time but returning them cost me another $ 15.00 . I still have n't received confirmation they were refunded . Big sigh .
 upon arrival of the boots i discovered they just did not fit , trying to contact amazon or the seller was one `` wall '' after another , so i had to suck up the cost and now have a closet ornament instead of a pair of boots .
 When I received these boots I thought , `` oh finally ! '' and they fit nicely in the foot but did n't even hold onto the calve , so they rubbed as I moved . Not only that , inside the heel the metal underneath it came THROUGH not even three months after receiving . The shine was n't as it looks in the pictures and the material began to tear on the tips too soon . I 'd suggest moving elsewhere and finding better boots . Metal in the heel for a few hours is nothing I 'd want anyone else to have to suffer .
 I was so excited when these boots arrived on Saturday , but was quickly disappointed when I tried them on . I do not consider my calves to be large -LRB- I am a petite 5 ' 2 '' and size 4/6 -RRB- , yet I could not zip up these boots . They are at least an inch too narrow .
 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .
 The boots were not what I expected . The pictures made the books look different then they actually were . They were exremely wide and the sizing was off .
 Did not fit well AT ALL . WAY too big around the ankles - every step I took , the boot would start to fall off . They were the right size , length wise and all , just way too wide above my ankle . They were about half as tall as they looked in the photo , which was very disappointing . I sent the boot back at my own expense the same day . I would definatly recommend finding a boot you like in the store so you can try it on first , then ordering it off of here for cheaper .
 I bought these boots a size larger than my normal size and they still did n't fit . It does n't warn about this so I will !
 I also bought a pair of boots for my daughter . They run very small - at least 1 to 1 1/2 sizes too small . I had to return at my expense .
 I just received these boots yesterday and wore them all day.I have some pros but the most important is the con . They are huge & I feel like I am walking in moon boots . I am not referring to shoe size but overall appearance and feel . I own 3 other similiar boots and these are the worst by far.Pros - the color . I wanted a chestnut color boot and this color is perfect . The quality is 100 % . The suede and shearling inside is great and they are very soft and comfortable -LRB- when not walking -RRB- . the price was great too ! especially b/c the quality is great.I ordered the size 9 based on previous customers . I am normally an 8 or 81/2 . if they made these in an 8 1/2 that probably would have fit me but i am happy i ordered up.I am only keeping these boots b/c I do not want the hassle of a return . If I had seen this in a store i would have tried it on but not purchased it b/c of the huge look to them!I was going to order another pair in black but am happy I did not !
 Nice boot but is not even close to size . I ordered a size larger than I wear and still too small . I had to return them .
 have the black and brown pairs . i do walk heavy , however , in little under 2 years , i wore holes through the soles of these shoes - both pairs !!!
 While the sole is very comfortable , the side straps were far too tight and dug into my toes . I am a true size 8.5 medium and rarely have trouble wearing shoes that I have ordered online . I had hoped that the leather would eventually stretch a little but that never happened . I wound up giving the pair to Goodwill . The shoes were so cute but very uncomfortable .

 I will give these shoes some credit
 These boots have `` faux '' or synthetic shearling , which make your feet pretty much rot . Do n't buy these - they look great , but it is too much money for fake . Go for the Ugg or other real shearling boot .
 I just got my shoes today and could n't wait to try them on . : -RRB- First off the shoes are lightweight , nicely shaped , comfortable when sliding your foot in and unique with the zipper . They even go to the extreme of creating a see-through vinyl panel inside the shoe below the heel so you can see the Dr. Scholl 's Gel Insert between the sole layers . So that was a cool feature.And then I put them on ... zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzipp . Ohhhhhhhhhh so comfortable sliding them on until ... I walked in them . : -LRB- With each stride , the heel began slipping off like they were too big -LRB- and no I did n't put on socks nor did I plan to because of the mesh feature -RRB- . I expected some slippage but not THAT much . There did not seem be any extra bulk in the heel area of the shoe to `` grab '' onto my heel . Another thing was the shoes made this quiet popping sound . I realized this was the vinyl circle under my heels while my foot was sticking and then releasing the vinyl circle because my heel was slipping . It probably would not have happened if my feet did not slip in the first place.Before I took them off , I stood in them to see how them felt . They were comfortable on my feet but only if I was just standing , however that would have posed a problem if I wanted to move . ;-RRB- I realized that the fit was not quite right either . It seemed that the wide part of my foot was being squished inward while my heel area was looser . Perhaps having flat feet created this bad fit for me.Overall , I will not diss these shoes because I know that they are well liked by others and I did buy them on the basis of liking what I saw . Naturalizer is a great brand which I have worn in the past but I have to say that this shoe is probably `` not for the flat footed '' .
 I bought this show after having my child 's foot measured . He wore it once and his big toe blistered up about double in size from rubbing the inside of the hard shell-top of this shoe . Dad did n't learn his lesson the first time and bought the same shoe a few months later in a larger size of course and the same thing happened again . My advice , buy shoes made for children and not miniature adult shoes .
 I purchased these laces for my 7 y.o. son who always has to keep tying his shoes over and over.These laces came on a pair of NB running shoes I purchased last year , and I thought they were great . They `` made sense '' . Well , my son tore through these within a week.I would n't buy them for children . Maybe they 're just not tough enough .
 I love Skechers , but this thong developed a hole in it 's sole and a small pebble slipped inside the hole . I was shuffling along with a clink , clink , clink sounding in each step . I have had better Skecher products !!!

 This style was smaller and more narrow than the pair of Reefs I currently have , so I was very disappointed and have to return them .
 Got the metallic bronze in these shoes , they looked exceptional at first but after a few wears i noticed that the heel tips were coming off , and the shoe was becoming discoloured . I bought them at full price so i was quite disappointed .
 I only wore these shoes twice , the second time I wore them out the right heal snapped right off . The nails that were to hold the heal in place were poor quality , the shoe repair I took them to told me they were poor quality . Very cute shoes if you only plan to wear them one time . Otherwise keep a backup pair in your car .
 The boot has a great heel and sole , and the price is good for a work boot . That is the plus side . The negatives are the country of origin is not listed and the boot leather is very thin . I returned my purchase after opening the box and thinking that these are not durable enough for farm work .
 This shoe was terrible ! I wore these shoes a maximum of 4 times in a week ... First the plastic on top came apart from the platform also now the rubber is falling off the bottom of the shoe . . I would think this being a dancing shoe that it would be able to withstand a little more than a week ?? And i go easy on my shoes.Wouldn ' t recommend this brand to anyone !!
 I wore these shoes for the first time at work today . The `` sling '' part dug into my heel , and my toes were cramped by the end of the day . Definitely not the most comfortable pair of slingbacks I 've owned !
 The shoes are gorgeous to look at . They go incredibly well with a few of my dresses . But alas , I pay the price for them . I am a 12 to 121/2 but of course I bought the 13 . I figured , well I can not miss with these . Was I ever wrong , the strap at the back is really skinny and then it just presses into your flesh.If you wear it to work you are going to have to be able to take it off .
 The shoe is absolutely beautiful , but like previous writers , the sling cuts into the back of your heel . Not too comfortable , have to use bandaid to get through the workday . I should have brought extra shoes !
 This sling back looks very good and dressy but the sling itself cuts into your feet , the soles of the shoes is poor so you feel every pebble you walk on . I would not recommend this shoe to anyone . I had to give away my own on the first day I wore it .
 They are a little stiff , should have smoother edges around the area you slide you foot in . Not very comfortable .

 Someone showed me these shoes on Amazon and I feel instantly in love with them . These wedges were quite different with the multi-coloured criss-cross design at the back . However in reality they are not the most comfortable shoes you will wear!The material is quite hard and the back constantly rubs your feet . My feet are n't very broad at the toes but because the material is so hard it also makes the toe area uncomfortable as well . Buyer beware ... if you think beauty is pain , then maybe these shoes are for you ! I have yet to wear them a second time to see what happens ...
 These shoes are really beautiful . If you buy them , you 'll receive a zillion compliments but ... the upper material is really hard and is so narrow that literally crush your toes.I can not tell you if I 'm happy or not
 I received this item earlier than it was due . These are not as shiny as they may seem . I have a wider foot than most people and these shoes are quite narrow . Also , they feel very cheap , rubbed blisters on my heels and are very tight on your toes . I would not recommend these to anyone . While they look absolutley adorable sitting in your closet , they do n't feel so adorable .
 They are a little stiff , should have smoother edges around the area you slide you foot in . Not very comfortable .
 I should have known not to buy shoes without trying them on . The fit was way off . I 'll never buy shoes online again .

 After trying two different pair of same size 7 neither fit my foot.Had to return items to seller . Last time had to pick up freightcharges . Did n't feel that was right . Have an older pair of Rykashoes and never had this problem before .
 This was my first purchase of a Ryka shoe since the inception of the brand . This model had good reviews , so I gave it a try . As soon as I put the shoe on , and stepped on the carpet , I felt immediate pain in the toe box area . The shoe material was very irritating , causing a lot of friction despite my wearing cotton socks . The entire shoe felt horrible . I 'm not sure if it was a defective shoe or just the style . I have chronic , ingrown toenails ; so I need shoes with a roomy toe box area . I also wear orthotics . I was unable to determine if this shoe accommodated orthotics , as I would have had to tear out the glued-in innersoles . If you need a roomy toe box , this shoe is not for you . As for me , I 'll stick to Brooks and New Balance walking shoes .
 THESE SHOES WERE MADE OUT TO BE THE VERY BEST WALKING SHOES , THEY ARE NOT COMFORTABLE ... will not buy no more shoes on line with out trying on . . coast to much to send back
 Sizing off by 1/2 size . Will not buy again . Gave toi granddaughter since she wears a 6 1/2 . Not worth the hassel of returning .

 The sole is comfortable , but I prefer the Olowahu . It has the same sole , but I do n't have to grip the thong with my toes , which is supposedly bad for your feet .
 After reading reviews and hearing a coworker rave about Teva Mush sandals , I hoped I would love these , but they did not feel as great as I anticipated . I have to send them back for a refund.On a brighter note , I bought Teva Elixer sandals . Flip flops with arch support ! Awesome . Give them a try !
 Bought the cheapest brand-name flip-flops Amazon had so that I can use them for pedicure sandals . They 're OK for that , but highly uncomfortable . The footbed is flat , and it feels very difficult to keep them on the feet !
 I usally wear and 8 1/2 and based on other reviews I picked the size down -LRB- an 8 -RRB- instead of the size up . Big mistake ! The eight is tiny , fits more like a 7 . So I 'm out the shipping fee to return these and I bought two pair , : - -LCB-
 I 've worn flip flops almost my whole life . Various kinds , expensive and cheap . I was super excited about getting my first pair of Mush flip flops . Love the design , the flip flops are cute & comfortable . But ... when walking around in them , the heel part is not cushioned well . After wearing them for an hour I could feel the bottom sole design on my heels when I walked . Now I feel the design on the soles everytime I wear them . And the lack of heel cushion makes for almost no shock absorbtion when walking . If you 're only going to be walking on sand , these will be fine . But if you 're walking on side walks and around stores , I do n't recommend these . Unfortunately these are n't made for normal daily use .
 The quality of the shoe is great , the sole comfortable , but the arch support altered the look of my feet in them & I returned them because of that feature .
 For the price I think the heel should not compress so quickly and as well there be more substantial grip to the ground on tile surfaces .

 Although their prices are good , Outfitters outlet sizes are not consistent . Some shoes are too big others too small . Be careful .

 I bought these for a halloween costume , and even though I selected standard shipping , the cost did n't show up on the balance until I got the confirmation and the order had gone through -- shipping cost as much as the shoes I thought I was getting at a discount!Also , though I used the conversion chart to get a women 's size , they ended up being too small .

 One of the worst pair of shoes I bought . When you walk in them they make a farting noise . I rated them a two because they are soft on the inside . You ca n't wear them because it sound like you are passing gas as you walk . Not much else to say . A lesson learned .

 Based on the description ` dress boot ' , I was expecting something I could wear to work here in New York . I 've seen some Amazon customers refer to these as Beatle Boots . That 's an apt and better description . Guys - these boots are great if you want some sort of retro-mod 60 's fashion boot to wear with paisley pants but they are not men 's dress fashion in the 2010 's appropriate for the office . They kind of look like girls ' boots as the toe narrows to a tip and whoa , these babies have heels . Euro-dress boot at best . They should call them something other than Dress Boot for USA . The word `` Dress '' threw me off completely . And , finally , between the tapered toe and the heel , they make your foot look tapered , small and feminine , and I am a 9 1/2 . Need I say more - Return .
 The center section of the sole on the boot cracked from left side across to the right side . It cracked and split where the sole bends as you walk . Bad decission on my part to buy these boots . Will not happen again .
 I have two pairs of G Brutinis boots and this is the third one I purchased . I am rather disappointed because the right boot is noticeably smaller than the left one . I decided to keep them and use wearing thin socks only ... . I even wondered if my right foot is larger than the left one but the problem clearly lies with the boots , not my feet ... . Since the boots are made in China , perhaps their population has feet that do not match - ca n't tell as I have never been there ... Will I be willing to purchase another pair ? I rather doubt ...
 First off , the bottom sole is very slippery , MUST BE VERY CAREFUL , otherwise you will slip and fall very easily -LRB- a black rubber sole would be more adequate -RRB- ; secondly , it makes a lot of LOUD noise as you walk , -LRB- did you ever hear and hate those noises from the shoes/boots from those ladies walking somewhere down the hall , you would keep hearing tock , tock , tock , tock ... -RRB- well this boots will certainly give you those noise . Thirdly , it is a little bit loose around the top opening , which does n't give you a tight grip onto your ankle , therefore when you walk , it feel loosen , and thus these boots , in my opinion , are not made for wearing everyday , for walking ... running errands ... etc. . They are only looking good for showing up at a special occasion or wedding party for maybe 1-2 minutes top . If you wear them longer than that , you will suffer the consequences . Got my point . -LRB- they are sitting on my shoe-rack collecting dust already , I only wore them approximately 1-times -RRB- -LRB- now , you may be asking , why would n't I return them ? right ? Good question , the answer is very simple , when you put them on and walk around the house for lets say , 1-minute to try them out , the bottom sole paint chipped ... it shows sign of `` wear and tear '' so that way you just ca n't return them -RRB- . -LRB- I already went to -LSB- ... -RSB- and bought myself another wear-it-everyday pairs of boots , real leather for even cheaper price -RRB- .
 THE BOOTS HAVE PROBLEMS

 These shoes are SO narrow ! I ordered a 4E 6.5 and I 'm warning you , they are as narrow as a child 's shoe ! The company was very easy to work with , so NO complaints there ! -LRB- I did have to pay $ 8 for return shipping which stinks , but at least I 'm not stuck with these shoes -RRB-

 The cedar wood is a nice feature , however , at it 's widest width it does n't touch the sides of my C width shoes ! When I was turning the screw mechanism to make it narrow to send it back , it broke ! The piece on the end of the screw came off and stuck between the wood . It is ONLY PLASTIC AND GLUED . This is cheap ... you get what you pay for !!
 I purchased 2 shoe stretchers to stretch a pair of shoes simultaneously . After the initial stretch , I wanted to move the ortho plugs to another space and noticed that the holes did not match on both stretchers . Then , when I tried to use them on second pair of shoes , the handle fell off , and the wood cracked into two pieces .
 Attractive stretcher with nice cedar scent but cone which causes stretcher to separate is plastic . The metal rod that screws into plastic cone when being cranked bored through the plastic cone instead of turning it to make wood separate and stretch shoe . If cone tip was metal or stronger plastic , I would n't have had to return and would have rated a 4 or 5 . Would only use for women 's size 7-8 , no smaller .
 I used it once and the screw mechanism no longer works . I would advise not buying this product . there must be others out there that are better .
 So why did n't I listen to the reviews . I have another brand of stretcher that is wood and all metal , it works great . I needed one for my sons shoes so I got this one because the price was right . I used it to stretch one shoe and heard a crack . I had hardly turned it . Then the send one and the plastic piece broke into 3 pieces . So , I did n't even get to finish stretching one pair of shoes . I am now looking for replacement tips but am having no luck . Spend a little extra and get one with all metal parts .
 The inside part kept getting stuck , and I had to shove something into the toe to get it back out of the shoe . The only think I like is the cedar smell . Either I 'll send it back or just keep in my closet for the wood smell . Otherwise , it 's useless .
 I order the Cedar Shoe Stretcher with 2 Ortho Plugs , Women 's 5-8 back in July . I order 2 pairs and both of them broke right away . I really was n't to happy . Plus the whole return with shipping and handling just did n't appear to me like worth the trouble since there is no guaranty the next pair is n't going to break right away as well .
 This product arrived promptly , and I thought it was going to be a life saver , but the screw mechanism broke on my second try .
 When I received it , it looked really good and I put it into a shoe and cranked it tostretch . When I tried to take it out , the `` cranking '' did not work any more and I hadto basically pull it out by force . Now , that `` cranking '' function does not workany more . I am really disappointed how it does n't work after just one use ????
 This is only one stretcher -LRB- not 2 -RRB- that is badly/poorly manufactured . I used it twice and it completely broke .
 This product 's interior rubber part shattered into pieces the second time we used it . This product is a piece of junk . I would suggest you take this product off your sales list .
 Typically I carefully read and heed other reviewers advice . Somehow , I did not on this . Until you use it , quality seems fine . The wood seems sturdy and has a pleasant cedar smell . However , even with gentle use , it broke first time as the important internal tightening screw is cheap plastic . This product is designed to stretch leather . It should be sturdy and able to withstand the force needed to do this . This product is an excellent example of the fraud being perpetrated on the buying public by Chinese manufacturers AND the domestic sellers of their products .
 It just broke when I tried to open it . Do n't waste your money . The inner part is plastic , so when you open the stretcher inside the shoe it does n't resist the pressure and breaks !
 I specifically chose this one because there 's no plastic parts . When it arrived , I found that the part inside -LRB- that the crank threads into -RRB- is plastic . It stripped out after just two turns , which is the recommended amount in the instructions . I got a refund , but I 'm out the $ 5 for shipping .
 One of the shoe stretchers broke after the second use . These things are junk . Of course Shoe Smart will refund my money , but I have to pay the return postage - NO THANKS . I agree with the review that said , `` you get what you pay for '' .
 I bought two of these stretchers and neither one works -- functions , that is . The spreader is stuck and will not budge , no matter how much I turn the handle . Will return.And that 's another big minus . They require a return form to be filled with all sorts of information that is already in the shipping form , reverse side ! Amazon also has all the billing info , why give it again ? A lot of work for little money . Or maybe that is their purpose
 I wear a size 13 or 14 depending on the manufacturer . This shoe stretcher would n't even touch the sides on my size 13 Rockports . They were a little tight , so I wanted to loosen them up.It was ridiculous how far from `` stretching '' they were . I would guess there was at least a half inch of space in the shoes when the `` stretchers '' AND the little knobs were fully extended . Without the knobs it probably would have been an inch . I mean they say up to size 14 , but I would be shocked if they could stretch my wife 's shoes . I 'm returning them because they would n't even be useful for her .
 I purchased this shoe spreader for some shoes that I bought for my son . He is n't terribly forthcoming in telling me when something does n't fit quite right . His folly was getting the narrow shoes in the first place . My folly was not asking the right questions multiple times and multiple ways.So here we are , with the shoe spreader . It 's not wide enough . Even with the Ortho plugs in , it 's not wide enough . I 'm not sure where the receipt is . I wish I could return it though .
 This order was shipped quickly . However , this shoe stretcher is not well made . The turning mechanism broke after two uses . I would opt for a better quality at a higher price next time .
 cheap plastic parts , broke at first use , do not buy this item , much better available for small amt . more money
 This shoe stretcher did not last . It broke shortly after purchasing it . I can not recommend this product . What a waste of money .
 This item is very cheaply made . Plastic internal parts that broke on the first use . I would not recommend this product
 This item was too small for the shoe . Even with maximum adjustment , it did not fill the shoe . I returned it .
 I did not expect that they are very big and heavyI can not walk with itthey are like stone -RRB- :
 These shoes are SO narrow ! I ordered a 4E 6.5 and I 'm warning you , they are as narrow as a child 's shoe ! The company was very easy to work with , so NO complaints there ! -LRB- I did have to pay $ 8 for return shipping which stinks , but at least I 'm not stuck with these shoes -RRB-

 These shoes are extremely tight and small and I have very petite feet . They are shaped funny and just are silly . No issues with shipping . I plan to return .
 I love these shoes so much , it 's a shame that after only a few wearings , my toe had started to make a hole in the top of the shoe . By the time I had worn it a handful of times , my big toe was peeking through the top of the shoe . It makes me so , so sad .
 I 've owned 2 pairs of these now , and I 'll never own another Blackhawk boot . Although initially I thought these were good boots , time has proven otherwise . In less than 1 year of wear on each set , the inner lining comes loose in the heel area and makes them uncomfortable to wear . The soles are dangerously slippery on anything wet , like tile or cement . The soles de-laminate from the cushion part of the boot . The protective borders crack around the toe . One set started cracking by the laces about midway up the boot . One set had the stitching on the tab to help pull on the boot on tear loose . I called Blackhawk twice for service , no real help . Finally got hold of their Customer Service manager , he tried to make me feel like all the issues were my imagination , and had no value as feedback , even though I was pleasant and trying to give them good information . After 4 years as an Army Ranger , I know a thing or two about boots , so Blackhawk boots are poor quality , as is their service .
 These started out as excellent boots . I 've been wearing them in the desert for 4-5 months now , 6 days a week . My job requires very little wear and tear . I have n't had any of the usual issues I normally have with boots ; The soles and tread are holding up great . They feel awesome on my feet , and I have n't had any significant wearing or tear on the inside of the boot ... but , stitches on the toe of the boot have already popped , and a small hole is already starting , thus it 's only a short matter of time until they go in the garbage now . 4-5 months in is a no-go . I would most certainly never buy these boots again .
 Was about to replace my old boots and was looking at these , so I contacted their customer service and was told that Blackhawk boots are made in China . They may be 5 star boots , but I cant buy boots made in China . I 'll keep looking ...
 When I ordered these boots , they did n't specify if they had men or women 's sizes . The size they sent me were , I guess , in womens . I could n't ship them back because I deployed .
 I received coyote tan when I requested for desert tan and this is a huge deal seeing as how I am in the Army and we wear desert tan only . Unfortunately I am unable to return the boots since I 'm in Afghanistan and do n't have time . Hopefully I can play them off and use them for the rest of my tour but I am just disappointed for receiving the wrong color .
 I 've been in the military for 14 years now and I have to say , these are up there with one of the worst . I am very skeptical and picky when buying new boots , so I do research . I feel there are a lot of misleading reviews on these boots . Yes , they are very comfy and the soles are like tennis shoes ... however :1 . There are no breathing holes . My feet sweat even during the winter because there is no air circulation , and then my feet are freezing .2 . The soles starte debonding within 2 months of being in Afghanistan . Your usual rocks , pavement and dirt , nothing out of the norm . And now more and more parts of the sole are slowly coming detached .3 . Yes , the soles do wear quickly . I will willing to accept it if that was the only problem , but $ 140 and all this , I think never again .4 . The worst part of all . I have wide feet . I bought the wides . Well , the boots wall next to `` the ball of the foot '' has collapsed on both boots . When I say collapsed , I mean no longer keeping its form , but hangs down . So add that , and the low profile sole and what do you get ? Wet ! Every time it rains , snows etc and I walk in it , my feet get soaked . And then stay soaked because they ca n't break to air out . Worst combination ever.Never again . This is my story , 6 month old boots . best of luck if you buy them .
 I do not find these walking boots to be comfortable , as advertised . They look good , but they hurt my feet . I would like to return them , but I have worn them four or five times , thinking I would `` break them in '' and they would become comfortable . Has n't worked so far .
 Do not buy these shoes if you want a pair of running shoes to look good after being worn 5 times . The little holes already have little balls on them . The white part turned brown and I have tried to clean them with no luck . I only wear NB and ca n't believe they would put this product out . The fit and lightness are great , but who wants a pair of shoes that look old after wearing only a few times .
 I am a true size 10 and this shoe is too short .
 The service for receiving the product was outstanding ! However , the product itself was not great . I ordered a size 11 , but the shoe was too wide and too short in length . I had to return it . I will order from this company again due to the excellent service and how the return was handled . Great Job !
 I bought two pairs f these for my girls . They 're relly cute looking and sweet detailing - but they never fit right ! One of my girls has slender feet so I was n't too surprised when her feet constantly slipped out the abck , so her heel was hanging over the back of the foot bed . But my other girl has wide , round feet and her heels did the same thing ! We could n't get the strap to adjust enough to keep their feet from slipping out the abck . It made them look like they were wearing two sizes too small !
 I agree with the previous reviewer . While they are cute they just do n't fit well . My daughter wears a size 10 shoe , we have these in a 9.5 . They STILL cause her feet to constantly slip so the heel is hanging over the back and there 's WAY too much toe room . Fortunately I did n't pay much for these because I do n't think they will get passed down to her sister.My daughter does love them though .
 A fair novelty gift , but mine stretched out of shape in a couple weeks . At least my toes get exercise trying to keep them on . I guess they are made to be seen in rather than to walk around in .
 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .

 My son picked out these shoes for basketball . He liked them at first and gave them time to get broke-in , but the outsides of the shoes had no give . Most shoe will form to your foot , these did not . At the end of third stripe , you could feel a big ridge on the inside of the shoe.We had to buy a different pair of shoes that formed to his foot better . Nice looking shoe , but not the greatest fit .
 I just received these beautifully made shoes . However , they are very uncomfortable . I could not walk very far after I first put them on -- the leather rubbed on the small extremity toes and the backside came up too high and cut into the back of my ankle . Sadly , I had to return them .

 I was looking for a comfortable walking shoe that I could take on vacations where I would be walking 8-10 hours per day . I would not be able to walk 2 hours in these shoes . They are not supportive and I would not consider them a comfortable walking shoe . In addition , I am a very consistent medium width and these shoes were very narrow .
 Sizing off by 1/2 size . Will not buy again . Gave toi granddaughter since she wears a 6 1/2 . Not worth the hassel of returning .
 After trying two different pair of same size 7 neither fit my foot.Had to return items to seller . Last time had to pick up freightcharges . Did n't feel that was right . Have an older pair of Rykashoes and never had this problem before .
 This was my first purchase of a Ryka shoe since the inception of the brand . This model had good reviews , so I gave it a try . As soon as I put the shoe on , and stepped on the carpet , I felt immediate pain in the toe box area . The shoe material was very irritating , causing a lot of friction despite my wearing cotton socks . The entire shoe felt horrible . I 'm not sure if it was a defective shoe or just the style . I have chronic , ingrown toenails ; so I need shoes with a roomy toe box area . I also wear orthotics . I was unable to determine if this shoe accommodated orthotics , as I would have had to tear out the glued-in innersoles . If you need a roomy toe box , this shoe is not for you . As for me , I 'll stick to Brooks and New Balance walking shoes .
 THESE SHOES WERE MADE OUT TO BE THE VERY BEST WALKING SHOES , THEY ARE NOT COMFORTABLE ... will not buy no more shoes on line with out trying on . . coast to much to send back

 I could not even walk across the room with these on ! Even though I ordered a wide -LRB- D -RRB- , they pinched the back of my feet and I could feel where the blisters would be ... Returning them immediately !
 I recieved the black shoes with a brown zipper , my first compliant . Them my second wearing the brown zipper broke . I noticed they are not American made any more . Dont take a chanceand buy these shoes the workmanship is terrible . msskttty@aol.com
 I liked the color and the way the moccasins were made , but they are just way too narrow . Please make them in a wide width . Could n't even get my foot in them and I ordered a half a size larger than what I wear .
 really to narrow couldnt get my foot in i am sending back for a refund sorry make them in wide !!!!
 These ARE NOT official Minnetonka mocs . I had a pair of a really nice blue shade back in the day and wantd to &#34; get them back &#34; again . These were a letdown . I would have given it no stars if I could have but it does n't allow for such on here . They were tight and my feet could n't even tolerate the try-on ! The color blue was also more of a cloudy blue and not the nice sky blue I had before -LRB- I had the blue ones probably about late 90s -RRB- I returned them asap ! : o -LRB-

 I 've worn the Men 's Bostonian Tuscana Oxford shoe style for about 5 years now . I would agree with many of the reviews from 2005 to 2008 . These were the most comfortable dress/casual shoes I 've worn . Due to some medical issues , I needed a very comfortable shoe that provided comfort , support , good service life , and at a reasonable price . When I found my first Bostonians at a local store it was the best fit ever . I 've had to order on line the last couple replacements due to closure of the local store . However , this last order gave me a surprise . Instead of receiving a good quality Italian made shoe with all the comfort I previously enjoyed , I received this cheaper version made in India - for about the same price . These shoes no longer fit like a glove ; the medium width is wider and the length is a shade longer . And , I have to agree with one of the other reviewers ; it just does n't have the same quality feel of a good leather shoe . If this is the quality Bostonian is going to , then I 'll be looking for a new brand . I bought based on previous product experience , next time I check the current reviews first .
 I have bought Bostonian shoes for years now and have always been a happy customer . When I received these shoes I was surprised at how cheap they looked . For the price , you would expect a nice classy leather upper . Instead , these `` leather uppers '' appear to me as cheap vinyl made to look like leather . I honestly do n't believe they are leather . Does n't smell like it . Does n't feel like it.Also , I ordered my normal size and the fit is way too big . Not snug and comfortable but like the very cheap and very wide shoes you buy at Walmart from the no-brand shelf . You ca n't pull the shoelaces tight enough to stop the shoe from moving around your foot when you walk.I do not recommend these shoes . Looking close at them , they appear to be shoes that you should pay $ 10.99 for . Disappointing !
 I own these shoes and love them . Or I guess I should say ... I own the old pair of these shoes , Made in italy , and I loved them . Bostonian now manufactures these in India . The new shoes are inferior in every way . The leather is sub par , the quality sucks , and they are uncomfortable . I would by 2-3 more pair of the old high quality italian built shoes . But I might never by Bostonian again after seeing they way they are heading . It 's a shame really .
 For the first instance , everything looked perfect.After wearing it for a couple of hours
 As some of the previous reviews have mentioned , now that the manufacturing moved from Italy , the shoe quality does n't live up to the Bostonian name . I have worn the Italian version 12W for many years and it finally started cracking across the ball of the foot.Hoping that the previous reviews were exaggerating , I ordered a 12W of the current shoe . When I tried it on , it was extremely tight -LRB- like an 11W -RRB- , but the markings showed it was a 12W . Additionally , the workmanship and materials were not up to the original Italian version . It 's now quite a Payless shoe , but it 's not a Bostonian either.The Italian version was worth $ 100 . I would have expected this one in the $ 20 range . If you 've worn the Italian version , do n't bother with this one . You wo n't be happy .
 It is my first try to buy shoes on Amazon , but it may be the last . The design of the shoes is terrible ! Wearing the shoes for one day really hurt my feet , my ankle is swelling now ! It is really disappointing !
 These boots were very nice looking but , unfortunately , turned out to be heavier than expected when received . They would have been used for work but my husband was unable to use them and they were returned .
 Okay - My second toe is NOT longer than my big toe , but somehow these shoes made it look longer - very unattractive !! They were immediately returned -LRB- at a cost to me I might add -RRB- .
 These pants have a `` relaxed fit '' tag on them when they arrive , translation `` mom jeans '' workout pants . The are high waisted with thick elastic and extra room in the stomach . Also , the material between the legs creates extra friction , making them harder to run/walk in .
 Not A comfortable sneaker at all ! Looks like a wonam 's sneaker .

 The boots were delivered within reasonable time . The boots fit well and are comfortable to wear . Leather quality is OK though I have seen better quality leather for the same price . There is however a defect I noted on the second day . There are small cracks , about 12 , 1/4 '' long each at the back of the right shoe . Photo sent . Manufacturer responded to my query and offered replacement or refund . Unfortunately , I am based outside of US and can not ship back using prepaid UPS provided . Could have been nice shoes .

 They are a little stiff , should have smoother edges around the area you slide you foot in . Not very comfortable .

 These run very small . Daughter was wearing a 6 , purchased a 7 , and they were still too snug .

 I bought these last week for $ 36 - free shipping . Now they are $ 45 . Anyway , I buy Saucony Jazz pair after pair . When I compared this pair with the old one , I 've noticed how the quality of new ones worsened . Outside they look like they have been worn for a few months . Inside , the materials appears to be put together without any regard for the output . Uneven stitches , glue marks . When I tried them on , they are no longer the soft and cushioned sneakers I have enjoyed over the years . They are as hard as walking barefoot on hardwood floor or cement . I believe I was shipped the `` fake '' Jazz . I will see how I can return them .

 THE BOOTS ARRIVED IN A TIMELY FASHION , HOWEVER THEY WERE OF SECOND 'S QUALITY . THE EYELETS WERE ALL ASKEW NOT EVENLY FASTENED.I BOUGHT MORE BOOTS FROM ANOTHER VENDER OVER THE INTERNET AND GOT THE IDENTICAL PACKAGE THEY CAME FROM THE SAME PLACE AND HAD THE SAME FLAWS . FUNNY HUH ? I SOLD THE PAIR I GOT THROUGH AMAZON ONLINE , AND EVIDENTLY THE BUYER DID N'T MIND . I DO . I EXPECT WHEN I SHELL OUT GOOD MONEY TO GET A FIRST CLASS PRODUCT.I 'M TAKING MY MOST RECENT INTERNET PURCHASE , -LRB- YES , I DID IT AGAIN , BUT A DIFFERENT VENDOR -RRB- , TO ONE OF THEIR STORES FOR AN EXCHANGE BECAUSE WHEN I 'VE BOUGHT COLUMBIA TRAIL MEISTERS FROM THAT VENDOR DIRECTLY I DID N'T GET THIS PROBLEM.I LIKE AMAZON BUT I 'M A LITTLE APREHENSIVE ABOUT BUYING TRAIL MEISTERS OVER THE INTERNET . COLUMBIA MAKES NORMALLY A GREAT BOOT I OWN THREE OTHER PAIRS INCLUDING THE BUGABOOT OMNI-TECH . I SAY BE CAREFUL.I HOPE AMAZON FOLLOWS UP ON PRODUCTS LIKE THIS FOR QUALITY CONTROL .
 Nice comfortable shoes but I have had trouble with the lacing hooks catching on things . Once I had one catch on the side of a ladder I was coming down -LRB- TALL ladder -RRB- and nearly got killed or at least hurt . Replace the hooks with a better system and they 'd be a great shoe , as is I consider them dangerous .
 I ordered size 11 because the previous pair of these exact same shoes I bought states on the inside label they are size USA-11 , UK9 , EUR 42 , CM27 .5 . What I received on this order 's i/s label states USA-11 , UK 10 , EUR 44 , CM 29 . The new pair I received are much larger than my previous pair . Obviously there is something wrong with Columbia 's labeling program . Size 11 should be size 11 every time !!! I liked my previous shoes but wo n't buy Columbia again because I ca n't be confident of what I will get.Dennis Collins

 I was delighted with the speedy receipt of my Amazon order , however , I had to return this item . The shoe was attractive and stylish but did not feel comfortable on my feet.The texture was hard and uncomfortable to walk in .
 They are a little stiff , should have smoother edges around the area you slide you foot in . Not very comfortable .
 I have been using this for couple of weeks . The shoe looks good andwell built . I like the grip . But the insole peels off - exposing the foamand it messes up the socks . Good shoe - but poor insole.Update
 disappointmenttheir short and very flimsywithin the first week of buying them there was a hole on the back part of the shoe
 I would have wanted to know that it would last a reasonable length of time.Boot split after only a few days of use.Amazon refunded my purchase price .

 Last year , finally having found my perfect sand-color summer walking shoe , eroneously I thought , that I would be able to reorder the same sandle year after year . Just as one can do with Bass sandles . Not so ! What a disappoinment!As I took the offendending , ill-fitting pair back to the store , I was reassured by the shop assistant that I was not alone in my gripes about this `` new and not improved '' edition of that sandle.I was given the 1-800 number to complain to the buyers . But do they listen ?? Would n't you think that such a large company as Easy Spirit would invest in quality control and make sure the shoes they sell are consistent in style and well made from year to year.My sister-in-law echoes my remarks on the same sandles , too . No happy end for these .

 With the title of `` Walking Cradle '' I was expecting a comfortable walking sandal . I bought these for my trip to Disney . I could n't wear them more than a short time without them being uncomfortable . No way I could use them for the hours of walking in Disney World as I had hoped . They also squeeked ! Sorry , these are pretty , but definitely not the comfortable walking sandal I was expecting when I purchased .

 These shoes are SO narrow ! I ordered a 4E 6.5 and I 'm warning you , they are as narrow as a child 's shoe ! The company was very easy to work with , so NO complaints there ! -LRB- I did have to pay $ 8 for return shipping which stinks , but at least I 'm not stuck with these shoes -RRB-
 I like Vaneli styles , and I own other shoes from this company , but these were unusually cheap . They were unlined ! I looked at the other Vaneli shoes in my closet , and they are lined . The suede will certainly stretch out of shape very quickly without any type of lining . In addition , the heel plates are cheap , hard plastic . My experience with this type of heel plate is that it crack and even falls off . My other complaint is the excessive shipping charges . FootSmart charged me $ 12.99 to ship the shoes , and because I am mailing them back due to their cheap construction , they are charging me $ 6.99 more using the barcode return label . Thus I spent $ 20 to try on cheap shoes . I do n't think I will buy Vaneli online anymore , and I wo n't order from FootSmart . Many other shoe vendors charge much less or even zero -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- ! -RRB- .
 Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot , however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out .
 These shoes are SO narrow ! I ordered a 4E 6.5 and I 'm warning you , they are as narrow as a child 's shoe ! The company was very easy to work with , so NO complaints there ! -LRB- I did have to pay $ 8 for return shipping which stinks , but at least I 'm not stuck with these shoes -RRB-
 The boots were delivered within reasonable time . The boots fit well and are comfortable to wear . Leather quality is OK though I have seen better quality leather for the same price . There is however a defect I noted on the second day . There are small cracks , about 12 , 1/4 '' long each at the back of the right shoe . Photo sent . Manufacturer responded to my query and offered replacement or refund . Unfortunately , I am based outside of US and can not ship back using prepaid UPS provided . Could have been nice shoes .
 I LOVE the style and look -- much better than almost any other boat shoe I 've ever had . And the delivery was a day ahead of schedule . BUT ... these shoes are NOT double-E width shoes . They seem to be about D width , so they are really too tight . Do n't know what to do now
 I got the style I ordered but the shoes are too small ! They are labeled 9 W but feel like a much smaller shoe . The reason I ordered this pair from Amazon was for the style of shoe and theSize . They are very hard to get on my feet and painful . Maybe if I keep trying to wear them for short periods at a time they will stretch out to my size .

 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .

 I bought these shoes from Eastbay . They are the worst pair of shoes that I have ever worn in my life . After wearing them for less than a week , I have identical cuts on both of my ankles from where the shoe jabbed into my skin . There is a flexible backing on the shoe which is sewn to the inside right where your ankle goes . As you walk , it grinds into your ankle and makes walking extremely uncomfortable . I HIGHLY recommend not buying this product .
 I ran in every generation of this stability-control shoe since gen-2 . By gen-9 they have totally trashed the shoe . The ride for slight over-pronators has definitely degraded , but the maddening and absolutely inexcusable design flaw is the d * mned squeak that sets in anywhere between 50 & 125 miles of use . There 's a tubular insert in the heal -LRB- just look at the bottom -RRB- that obviously loosens fairly quickly and then -- squeak-squeak-squeak ... every plant ! -LRB- even when you 're walking . -RRB- I 've moved on to Mizuno Nirvana 's -- heavier , but what a great ride . Farewell , Adidas , I guess you did n't love me as much as I did you . Your loss , though , and likely forever .

 I 'm a skater , I know good shoes from bad shoes ... The Vans Classic B/W Checkered Slip-Ons are great shoes . With normal shoes , you spend about a minute putting them on , with these shoes , you spend a couple of seconds , plus the fact that they are really good for skating .

 These shoes are very pretty but they do not run true to size . I ordered 1/2 size larger to wear with thicker trouser socks . The shoe literally slipped of my foot .

 Very poor in quality and design . No side zipper . Not real leather . Materials are very thin .

 Bought this item for my niece but the quality is very cheap . Not at all what i expected to purchase . Glad this was only for playing dress-up .

 These boots fit large and are not nearly as fashionable as they look in the photo . I returned them .
 Wow . Where do I begin ? Let 's start with what is good about this shoe . It is beautifully made and well-constructed . But the positives end there.What 's wrong with the shoe :1 -RRB- TERRIBLE FIT . The fit it terrible -- I ususally wear 8.5 M in dress heels , and the length was too short and toe box too tight . It was 1/2 to 1 size too small .2 -RRB- LOOKS CHEAP . I ordered the red croc . The leather is thick , stiff & shiny . Quite frankly , it looked cheap , like something from Payless or Walmart .3 -RRB- DOES N'T ENHANCE . Finally , the shoe does nothing for the foot . Because of the way it cuts across the top , it widens and shortens the foot . I prefer shoes that enlongate the foot.Simply put , this shoe is unattractive . It went back without hesitation .
 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .

 I bought a pair of Eastland 10 years ago and they were fantastic shoes , comfortable and long lasting , they finally died . I then purchased 2 pairs of the newer version of the shoe shown here , not as comfortable as the original -LRB- the others looked better for the work place too -RRB- but I broken them in and they were acceptable . Now a year later the sole of the shoe has split in two . Definitely not as well constructed as the last pair but they cost the same . Actually the interior of the heel of one of the shoes broke very shortly after I started using them . Right now it would seem I would get about as much usage from a pair costing 1/3 as much . One of the reasons for going to these was because the cheaper shoes die after about a year of wear . The quality has really degraded . You might want to look elsewhere .
 I purchased this shoe in the usual size I take in Eastland shoes and I could hardly get my foot into the shoe . Once on , with the use of a shoehorn , the shoe was long enough but too tight overall . Too uncomfortable on , it was immediately apparent they had to go back . Disappointed as the shoe is good looking and I have had very good luck with Eastland shoes otherwise . Plus had to pay return shipping . : -LRB-
 I 've owned 3 pair of these shoes . Comfort is great , good support , roomy toe box and easy to get on and off . But the soles and heel crack and split long before the leather uppers show wear . The inside lining material wears and becomes shabby quickly . I would pay twice the price for better quality for a longer wear . The design is great but the material inside and the sole/heel is inferior . I 'd buy again IF the price reflects the material quality .
 I , too , had the same shoe for years but the material at the top was starting to wear so I replaced it with this new shoe . The new shoe was not as comfortable at first , but after time has become more comfortable . After just over a year , I , too , have had the same problem with this replacement pair as other reviewers . The bottom of the shoe has split on both shoes . This is very troubling since my previous pair lasted for years with much more wear .
 I bought these for a halloween costume , and even though I selected standard shipping , the cost did n't show up on the balance until I got the confirmation and the order had gone through -- shipping cost as much as the shoes I thought I was getting at a discount!Also , though I used the conversion chart to get a women 's size , they ended up being too small .
 I wore these boots for the first time , Halloween night . I did a little dancing and a very little bit of walking and when I get to the last party , the heel on the right boot just snaps off and I almost busted my you know what on some stairs . Cheap cheap cheap , except for the price . I want my money back !
 The company sent me the wrong product and then it took over a month to resolve . This was supposed to be a Halloween costume piece , but too bad . The matter was n't resolved until November . I recommend NEVER purchasing from this store .

 I had no problem with the quality of the shoe , my complaint is that the sizing was very confusing . I thought I was buying a pair of size 8 shoe for men or a size 6 for women , but it turned out the other way around . I have tor return these . You need to clarify the sizing of your shoes .
 I was looking for a comfortable wedge heeled shoe to wear with jeans , and disappointingly , this was n't it . I wear a size 8-1/2 M and rarely have to order anything other than my true size . This shoe was tight in the toes and very uncomfortable -- they felt too small and a bit on the narrow side . I did n't think ordering a half size up would resolve the problem and honestly did n't want to have the hassle of exchanging them with the risk of the replacement size not working out well , either . I opted to return these .
 The outside of the purse looks nice . The purse itself is heavy . It is difficult to find anything inside as there is only one handle and the opening is small . There is one huge compartment so finding things makes it even more difficult . There are some pockets on one side but they are not deep enough to hold anything without them eventually falling out while looking for something in the main compartment . There is one zippered pocket on the other side . I 'm going to buy another person and stop using this one .

 This is the second time I 've purchased a pair of these shoes.The first pair made me want for the black ones.The first pair was higher than the second which was a better reason . These shoes look just alike but they do n't feel alike.My second pair which were cheaper were wider , just did n't feel they same.Cheaper to keep after shipping.But thanks anyway.Some places take to long to send your things.I do n't like that.Amazon is alright.L.W . La. .
 I bought these sandals based on positive reviews and a good price for Rockports . These are pretty comfortable . But I got them in silver , and man , do they look weird . It looks like I took aluminum foil and covered up a pair of sandals with it . The foil material wraps around the back of the heel of the shoe , and it looks strange to me . Also , the silver color does not seem casual enough to wear with slacks or shorts , but they are pretty flat and would look peculiar with a dress or skirt , I think . I am returning .
 Shoe looks great in the picture but is rather strange looking . It is not leather but material and fits too loosely to be comfortable . I found my self walking out of this style and I love Rockports .
 This sandal was too long and too wide , in addition to being made of a very soft leather that would probably have stretched as I wore it . A dangerous combination for a sandal . I say `` probably '' because I returned it . Cute as it is , it just was n't worth the risk . If your feet are usually true to size , I suggest purchasing 1/2 size smaller . If they are a little narrow , you should probably pass on this one .

 I , too , had the same shoe for years but the material at the top was starting to wear so I replaced it with this new shoe . The new shoe was not as comfortable at first , but after time has become more comfortable . After just over a year , I , too , have had the same problem with this replacement pair as other reviewers . The bottom of the shoe has split on both shoes . This is very troubling since my previous pair lasted for years with much more wear .
 I bought a pair of Eastland 10 years ago and they were fantastic shoes , comfortable and long lasting , they finally died . I then purchased 2 pairs of the newer version of the shoe shown here , not as comfortable as the original -LRB- the others looked better for the work place too -RRB- but I broken them in and they were acceptable . Now a year later the sole of the shoe has split in two . Definitely not as well constructed as the last pair but they cost the same . Actually the interior of the heel of one of the shoes broke very shortly after I started using them . Right now it would seem I would get about as much usage from a pair costing 1/3 as much . One of the reasons for going to these was because the cheaper shoes die after about a year of wear . The quality has really degraded . You might want to look elsewhere .
 I purchased this shoe in the usual size I take in Eastland shoes and I could hardly get my foot into the shoe . Once on , with the use of a shoehorn , the shoe was long enough but too tight overall . Too uncomfortable on , it was immediately apparent they had to go back . Disappointed as the shoe is good looking and I have had very good luck with Eastland shoes otherwise . Plus had to pay return shipping . : -LRB-
 I 've owned 3 pair of these shoes . Comfort is great , good support , roomy toe box and easy to get on and off . But the soles and heel crack and split long before the leather uppers show wear . The inside lining material wears and becomes shabby quickly . I would pay twice the price for better quality for a longer wear . The design is great but the material inside and the sole/heel is inferior . I 'd buy again IF the price reflects the material quality .

 I have bought several prs of crocs , but these were sized differently than the others which were unisex and thus mfor my size 11 feet were too small .
 Sorry . I bought them as a gift and have a report that the holes up front are very uncomfortable especially for big toe . I will be returning , which I am bummed about , and , have probably learned not to buy a clothing item on line as a gift .
 I begin by saying I have worn Crocs `` Beach '' Men 's XXL for many years . They have always been excellent shoes ... UNTIL , I PURCHASED MY MOST RECENT PAIR . The first thing you notice is they are MADE IN CHINA.Without question the shoes from China are smaller . To the point of even being tight . The back strap ismore narrow than the previous shoes I purchased . The front part of the sole is not as thick . Overall , it feels like a cheap imitation . I may NEVER buy another Croc shoe .
 I have worn Crocs for years . They are almost a must for diabetics . The ones on this page are made in China . The cheaper quality is immediately visible , the sizing is off and the last -LRB- shape of shoe -RRB- also appears different . I wish Amazon would clearly stipulate where stuff is made so we could have a choice .
 My non-Croc-type of footwear are more comfortable and better made than the real Crocs I bought recently ! Quite disheartening .
 Est delivery date was 12/13 - 12/16 guess what date it is today ... 1/3/11 ... . it was going to be a nice Christmas gift for my son-in-law . . I was hoping for 2010 . To many other good companies out there to use this one again .
 i 'm very dissisafied with my crocs . they send the wrong size.so i 'm stuck with them .
 tengo mas de un mes que pedi mis cross y aun no me han llegado necesito saber q paa con ello por favor denme razon de ello ya q los tengo cargados en mi tarjeta y todo gracias
 Maybe I 'm too concerned about fashion , but there are shoes out there that are just as comfortable , and dont make me look like I work in a hospital . I see people wear these every day and I cringe when they walk by . I guess theyre good for people maybe 70 and older who need orthotic shoes and cant wear sandals to the beach .
 I ordered size 8/9 since i wear a size 8 1/2 shoe , they fit my husband who wears size 11 . To top it off I ended up paying $ 6.00 for the return shipping . It will be the last time I order shoes from them .
 Do not waste your money on these they are cheaply constructed I received them today and the snap on the strap that holds them to your foot was broken and would not stay snapped together save your money I paid my money for broken merchandise again please save your money these are not constructed well at all
 I wore these shoes for 1 day working in the garden . when I took them off the tops of my feet were inflamed with red bumps that scabbed over and were very tender to the touch , I could n't wear any shoes that touched the tops of my feet for almost 2 weeks.they were comfortable to wear , but the rash is still really bad after 2 weeks . I WO N'T wear them again ...
 We received the Crocs , which are my son 's favorite shoe to wear . However , when he wore them to school the next day , one of the straps broke and I had to run a different pair of shoes to him at school . We are hoping to return them and get a new pair -- that will last longer than two hours .
 Croc strap broke the first time it was worn . Not pleased with this product at all .
 I have bought several pairs of crocs and these did not appear to be original crocs . I always buy the same size and these arrived way too big , how could the same size be too big if these are original crocs ? Had to send back and pay for shipping , not very happy and will only buy crocs from the original website .
 I was very dissapointed with this product . I bought some beach crocs a few years ago and they were made in Canada . These were made in China . They are not the same quality at all . These are not cushioned like the others were , they are also smaller even tho they are the exact same size as the ones made in Canada . These are NO better than the cheaper `` knock offs '' you find in dollar stores .
 Even though these shoes have the same model number and design I 'm used to , the leather material and feel are n't the same . Too bad ... I guess I 'll have to look for a new shoe .

 i remember when these shoes came out . About 4 or 5 months after they had been out i went and got the suede version of this shoe . Well i went skating and the same day i tore a massive hole in the toe cap and within the next week u could see both of my toes sticking out from either side . Terrible shoe do not buy them

 hello . my bad rating for this product because there is difference in the color of the shoes , the left is beige with blue -LRB- left -RRB- and the other is dark blue and light blue -LRB- right -RRB-
 I really wanted these because I needed really comfortable sandals for traveling . These are not it . They scratched my feet and caused a lot of blisters . I sent them back to the manufacturer in the hopes that they could fix them . No such luck
 Nice looking shoes , but the ones I received are way too small . They say size 7.5 N , but definitely are not . I will have to return them .
 I ordered blue croc , but I got chocolate color.My son was upset , since blue is his favorite color.I did n't want to take trouble returning it and exchanging it.But we were not happy about it .
 First time buying crocs . Thought they were supposed to be high quality . But after a few weeks of occasional wear by my 5 year old , strap broke off . Hesitant to buy a new pair , but otherwise great for summer b/c they 're close-toed and can get wet . He really liked them ... a few weeks later , we decided to try another pair and this time strap broke on very first day ! What junk . Now he 's wearing one croc from the old pair and one from the new - until those straps break too .
 I bought these crocs for my granddaughter and was very dissapointed that they were too big for her . The sizing is odd so I had to return them
 This is Amazon feedback more than Crocs feedback
 These are made in Mexico , and although it is 100 times better than having them made in China , they are defective . The cuts are not clean . They look like someone sliced them with a knife . I will keep them because it is a hassle to return them but being from CO and buying crocs since they invented them in Boulder ... I am NOT happy with these .
 Not a big fan of these shoes . After my three year old daughter fell numerous times while running in these shoes , we limit her use of them to quick trips to the pool or backyard . She is not allowed to run in them and does n't like to wear them as they make her fall down . She has a narrow foot , and perhaps this attributes to that a bit . These shoes are very wide and loose . Probably more suited to a child with wide feet or a child that does n't run and play -LRB- do they exist -RRB- ? I will not be purchasing these again , as I have found the Keen Newport to be a much better , durable , safer shoe for my child to wear all summer .
 Maybe it is me , but I ordered shoes in what I thought were my daughters size and they came in the exact size of my son 's , whose feet are two sizes bigger . I could have misordered but I was pretty careful about it . The sizing chart is confusing.I agree with the woman who says the shoes are too expensive for what they are . That is probably true for kids ' shoes in general , though .
 My daughter owns an identical pair of these in light pink in toddler size 8/9 . I purchased a fuscia pair from Amazon in the exact same size , but they are 1/2 '' shorter in length . When my daughter tried them on , her toes were touching the end of the shoes . So I must return them -LRB- and my daughter is extremely disappointed -RRB- . What 's worse , since the return is not the result of Amazon 's error , they can not be exchanged ; I can order a new pair , but would have to incur the shipping charge . I do n't have money to throw away , and with the sizing irregularities , the next size up could still not fit -LRB- it 's anyone 's guess -RRB- . Unless you have time and money to waste on returns and reorders , I would not recommend ordering these online . We will have to find these in a brick-and-mortar store where my daughter can try them on to see if they 're really going to fit .
 Horrible customer service , unresponsive . I ordered purple and I got a Disney Cars model and on a different size . I wrote an e = mail and never received an answer from them . Thank god Crocs is a great company and I was able to exchange them on a Crocs concept store . I dont recommend this vendor
 Hi , I ordered this pair of crocs shoes for my little boy , and I was very dissapointed , because I noticed that the name of Crocs on the bach side of the trap , was inverted in the right foot . I never saw an original crocs shoes with this kind of mistake , so I thought I was frauded .
 I ordered a pair of children 's crocs from this seller a month ago . I got no notice of delay until I wrote to the seller through amazon . They told me only then that there would be a 2 week delay . Finally today , one month after placing the order , I received notice that they would be unable to fulfill my order . Order your crocs from a different seller !
 I bought a pair of these shoes locally about 2 years ago -LRB- size 8-9 for LESS than -LSB- ... -RSB- -RRB- he was size 8 at the time , they were a little too big on my son I set them aside . It took quite a few months for him to finally be able to use them . Finally he was able to use them , he used them for quite a while . My son is autistic , so once he likes something he wants it ALL the time . Unfortunately he wanted to wear them to bed , since he never went outdoors with them ; I figured that 's not too bad.The only time these would come off was for bath time , eventually they broke -LRB- 3 months later -RRB- . It was a pain to find them locally , they do n't sell them anymore . By the third sleepless night with my son who 'd give a HARD time to be put to bed I came here to Amazon hoping to find help.I ordered the very same shoe same size 8-9 for toddler -LRB- 3 times the price of the originals -RRB- they took 2 weeks to arrive . His size now varies between 9 and 9.5 . They were really tight -LRB- of course -RRB- and he did n't want them ! So I came back and ordered him size 10-11 , surprise ! THEY 'RE HUGE!In my desperation I had to submerge the 8-9 in warm water ... to stretch them , I took newspapers and shoved them inside the shoes and kept changing the warm water . It took 3 days but the shoes FINALLY stretched enough for him to find them comfortable to wear.He 's back wearing them ; meanwhile his foot is growing as I 'm typing here . And yet no shoe sized 9-10 that resembles this shoe at all.Oh but the worst thing is not the size , the worst thing IS THE PRICE ! -LSB- ... -RSB- ??? For rubber shoes ? Are you kidding me ? If I did n't have this emergency I would n't have bought these shoes AT ALL ! These people are deliberately taking advantage of desperate parents!As soon as I find them locally again I 'm ditching these guys , it would n't be so bad if they actually had the size of my son .
 The size was listed 1-3 , but too wide looking , the starp was too cheap , came off easly . I will be returning this pair again !
 My son has been wearing crocs for years . He has worn the classic style . I thought this would just be the next size up . But the sizing seemed off . We ordered a boys size 2 . The size 2 was about 1/4 inch longer than the size 1 that he had outgrown . But the width was 3/4 of an inch wider in the heel area , at least and equally wide or wider in the toe area . The size was described by Amazon as Medium or M. I looked up the same shoe on the crocs.com website and it was described as their `` roomiest '' or widest fit of the three fit styles they listed . So I think this shoe should be listed as a W or Wide not medium , especially since Crocs run wide anyway . I had my son put one old shoe on and one new shoe on and took a picture . I was hoping to be able to post the picture so that potential buyers could see how wide this shoe is . This shoe would probably fit a kid with short toes and very wide or chubby feet . I am returning them as they do not fit my child 's average size 2 foot .
 I BOUGHT THIS CROCS FOR MY 2 1/2 YEARS BOY AND I CHOOSE THE 4-5 M US TODDLER . WHEN I RECEIVED IT IT DID N'T FIT HIM CAUSE IT IS TOO SMALL . THE SIZE CHART IS TOTALLY INCORRECT
 Well they are crocks . and the color is not what I expected . Burst is highlighter yellow ! I was expecting more of a butter color judging by the photo . I read the sizing chart and ordered my toddler a size 8/9 his normal shoe size is a 7 . Well he most likely will not be wearing these at all ! By the time he fits in them it will be winter ! Ugh so frustrating !! But the quality of the product is wonderful . Despite the color mix up i really wish his feet would fit into these !!
 I really do n't want to sound like a naysayer , but I remember reading somewhere that , due to the soft nature of these shoes , then have gotten stuck in the edge of escalators . My children are older , so I did n't worry , but my family and I saw this happen to a young boy first hand . It was quite frightening , and I hate to think of what could have happened if my husband had n't rushed over and pressed the emergency stop button on the escalator . If your child wears these , please take caution to keep his/her feet away from the sides of escalators .
 I was very disappointed with this crocs . It smelled so bad , it had a very strong smell , I would n't let my baby girl wear it as I 'm sure it 's very toxic . I ordered this crocs in Fuschia color size 6-7 and I was really excited to try it on my daughter , but I guess it 's going directly to the trash . I can not return it , cuz I do n't live in the US , and returning it would cost me as much as it costs . . very very unhappy with this order . .
 I ordered these Croc shoes for my daughter in July , and she wore them 3 times and the strap ripped
 We own several pairs of the old Crocs type slingbacks which had rivets that held the strap in place . These rivets have broken in the past and we had ordered replacements -LRB- not free may I add -RRB- . When I called today I was told that the new style Crocs have machine rivets and therefore the old style is no longer available . I find this to be extremely poor customer service .
 I always buy my kids crocs before going to Disney every year . I have never had a problem before . They usually walk alot and stay comfy . This year my 8 year old got horrible blisters on the top of his feet where the shoe opening is . Needless to say he wore gym shoes the rest of the trip . Poor kid was very uncomfortable . I think it might be this style . My other two children wore different styles .
 I love my work crocs so I ordered this for my daily use , and all reviews said order smaller way to big !! So I usually wear a 81/2 to 9 in shoes -LRB- on the smaller side normally -RRB- so I ordered a 8 and wow they were way to small !! And even with my foot in them it felt too unstable . Not a great choice for me : -LRB-
 While I had high hopes for these shoes , I can not recommend them for little toddlers at least . My daughter , who is 2 1/2 , stopped constantly to get out bits of grass , sand , and rocks that came in the holes around the sides . Not fun ! However , I also bought some crocs with a crocband around this problem area , which are perfect and never do this , so I recommend buying some of those instead !
 We purchased these from an outlet store so perhaps they were not made properly . However I was informed that the color combination between the shoe and strap was the only difference so I am posting this review for Moms who have toddlers with wide feet . After one hour of wearing the shoes my son developed blisters on the side of both feet . We threw the shoes away . Will not buy another pair . Too bad since I liked the anti microbial aspect and breathability .
 I 've purchased many pairs of Crocs over the years but the quality has severely diminished over the past few years . I 'm not sure exactly what has changed in the manufacturing but a pair of crocs used to last my daughter a couple of years . At the end of May , the back strap broke on a pair so I bought a new pair through Amazon . She wore them TWICE when one of the straps broke off the back . We decided to do `` surgery '' and took a back strap off an old pair to replace the broken one . I wish we had simply returned them at the time but she liked them so we did n't . Now , the other strap has broken off the back . Please note that the strap off of the older pair is still intact and going strong . You can actually FEEL the difference in thickness between the old and new . It 's really sad because my daughter and most of her friends love them but I will not spend $ 32 on a pair of shoes that breaks immediately . And of course , I ca n't return to Amazon . Hopefully , I 'm not the only one that 's complained -LRB- I also complained directly to Crocs -RRB- and the quality will improve again but for now , we 've purchased our last pair of crocs . And our last pair of shoes from Amazon , PERIOD , due to the return policy .
 We order these for my son 's birthday . They arrived on time on his birthday but they were obviously in Used condition . The bottom of the crocs were worn , and the alligator images on the sides were scratched off .
 I think I would have loved this shoe for my 3 year old , but the black buckle piece broke within an hour of her wearing it ! She was just around the house and it popped off and the inside was broken . The color was cute though . Wish Amazon had not run out so I could have exchanged them . I had to take a refund instead . Probably why they were only $ -LSB- ... -RSB- when I bought them !
 My son had a pair of crocs last summer and wore them every day . They held up beautifully . So , I bought him a pair -LRB- same color and style -RRB- for this year and within a month the strap broke off . At $ 20 , these shoes should stand up better than that . I do n't know what happened to their quality , but these were a disappointment .
 I normally love Crocs and buy a pair each year for my kid , but the one 's I just got broke in two days . I want to return them for a new pair .
 I ordered blue crocs for my child in a certain size . They sent me bright neon crocs , in a smaller size . Why ? I do n't know . I ask for an exchange or refund , and I have yet to receive any . This has been going on for months and it is yet to be resolved . I finally put a review to see if I can get a different outcome .
 The strap broke within 6 weeks of receiving the item . Our now 19 month old has another pair of Crocs -LRB- lego blocks -RRB- that she has worn more and those are still fine . Her previous pair she was able to wear until she outgrew with no problems.I am very frustrated I can not return/exchange these when it seems I must have received a defective pair .
 I have purchased at least six pairs of Crocs previously and I have always had great luck with them holding up through all kinds of wild little boy behavior . Which is why I am really disappointed that the straps on these Crocs broke after my son wore them 4 or 5 times . Maybe these were seconds of some type ? Fakes ? Not sure , but very unhappy to be purchasing another pair less than two weeks after purchasing these .
 If you get the length you need , then they are way too wide - like boats and way too big for children to keep on their feet .
 Not sure what happened to the Crocs brand , however , the quality definitely is NOT the same as it has been . My 2 year old son wore this pair only a few times before the back strap broke off and it can not be repaired.Basically it was a waste of money and I will have to look for an alternative brand that has n't allowed their quality of product to drop .
 These are cute and look comfy however both my kids complain that the straps have cause blisters . The area where the round crocs logo is , rubs on the insides of their feet . Not a good vacation when the kids are complaining of hurt feet .
 I order two pairs of these for my boys , and within five minutes of my older son putting them on for the first time the plastic `` rivets '' holding the strap to the shoe broke . Shortly after that , a `` rivet '' on my other sons pair broke . Two new pairs of shoes both broken within ten minutes of them being worn tells me that this is more than just a manufacturing `` oops '' . The rivets are a design flaw and whatever cost-savings they are to the company , they just paid for in customer loyalty . I will never buy crocs again!BTW , for those of you who have this problem , there is a fix ... Go to the fabric store and buy some Blue Jeans Buttons to replace the plastic `` rivets '' . They fit the openings pretty well , and they 're metal , so they are n't going to break .
 The sizing does not make sense ... I bought a size 4 for my one year old and it could fit a four month old . Wasted my money .
 The croc buttons were not snapped together tightly . She was heart broken but without the straps she ca n't keep them on her feet . I saved three of the buttons but no such luck on the first one that came off .
 These shoes are not durable at all . My son who is 2 only wore these for a few days before the black plastic piece that holds the strap on the back broke off . I could never get it back on right and eventually lost the piece . They are now completely broken and can not be worn at all .
 I really wanted these because I needed really comfortable sandals for traveling . These are not it . They scratched my feet and caused a lot of blisters . I sent them back to the manufacturer in the hopes that they could fix them . No such luck
 Nice looking shoes , but the ones I received are way too small . They say size 7.5 N , but definitely are not . I will have to return them .

 I 'm a skater , I know good shoes from bad shoes ... The Vans Classic B/W Checkered Slip-Ons are great shoes . With normal shoes , you spend about a minute putting them on , with these shoes , you spend a couple of seconds , plus the fact that they are really good for skating .

 They really hurt . I 've never had sneakers that hurt , but somehow these do . The back of my ankle gets rubed and I get red and sore . Stinks because I really think they are cute . Also even though my feet are very tiny ... the vencro hardly reaches far enough to close . Maybe if you tape up your ankle it wo n't hurt as much .

 These are cute and look comfy however both my kids complain that the straps have cause blisters . The area where the round crocs logo is , rubs on the insides of their feet . Not a good vacation when the kids are complaining of hurt feet .
 I order two pairs of these for my boys , and within five minutes of my older son putting them on for the first time the plastic `` rivets '' holding the strap to the shoe broke . Shortly after that , a `` rivet '' on my other sons pair broke .

 If you get the length you need , then they are way too wide - like boats and way too big for children to keep on their feet .
 I ordered blue crocs for my child in a certain size . They sent me bright neon crocs , in a smaller size . Why ? I do n't know . I ask for an exchange or refund , and I have yet to receive any . This has been going on for months and it is yet to be resolved . I finally put a review to see if I can get a different outcome .
 The strap broke within 6 weeks of receiving the item . Our now 19 month old has another pair of Crocs -LRB- lego blocks -RRB- that she has worn more and those are still fine . Her previous pair she was able to wear until she outgrew with no problems.I am very frustrated I can not return/exchange these when it seems I must have received a defective pair .
 I have purchased at least six pairs of Crocs previously and I have always had great luck with them holding up through all kinds of wild little boy behavior . Which is why I am really disappointed that the straps on these Crocs broke after my son wore them 4 or 5 times . Maybe these were seconds of some type ? Fakes ? Not sure , but very unhappy to be purchasing another pair less than two weeks after purchasing these .
 My son had a pair of crocs last summer and wore them every day . They held up beautifully . So , I bought him a pair -LRB- same color and style -RRB- for this year and within a month the strap broke off . At $ 20 , these shoes should stand up better than that . I do n't know what happened to their quality , but these were a disappointment .
 I normally love Crocs and buy a pair each year for my kid , but the one 's I just got broke in two days . I want to return them for a new pair .
 Not sure what happened to the Crocs brand , however , the quality definitely is NOT the same as it has been . My 2 year old son wore this pair only a few times before the back strap broke off and it can not be repaired.Basically it was a waste of money and I will have to look for an alternative brand that has n't allowed their quality of product to drop .
 I think I would have loved this shoe for my 3 year old , but the black buckle piece broke within an hour of her wearing it ! She was just around the house and it popped off and the inside was broken . The color was cute though . Wish Amazon had not run out so I could have exchanged them . I had to take a refund instead . Probably why they were only $ -LSB- ... -RSB- when I bought them !
 We order these for my son 's birthday . They arrived on time on his birthday but they were obviously in Used condition . The bottom of the crocs were worn , and the alligator images on the sides were scratched off .
 While I had high hopes for these shoes , I can not recommend them for little toddlers at least . My daughter , who is 2 1/2 , stopped constantly to get out bits of grass , sand , and rocks that came in the holes around the sides . Not fun ! However , I also bought some crocs with a crocband around this problem area , which are perfect and never do this , so I recommend buying some of those instead !
 We purchased these from an outlet store so perhaps they were not made properly . However I was informed that the color combination between the shoe and strap was the only difference so I am posting this review for Moms who have toddlers with wide feet . After one hour of wearing the shoes my son developed blisters on the side of both feet . We threw the shoes away . Will not buy another pair . Too bad since I liked the anti microbial aspect and breathability .
 I love my work crocs so I ordered this for my daily use , and all reviews said order smaller way to big !! So I usually wear a 81/2 to 9 in shoes -LRB- on the smaller side normally -RRB- so I ordered a 8 and wow they were way to small !! And even with my foot in them it felt too unstable . Not a great choice for me : -LRB-
 I ordered these Croc shoes for my daughter in July , and she wore them 3 times and the strap ripped
 I really do n't want to sound like a naysayer , but I remember reading somewhere that , due to the soft nature of these shoes , then have gotten stuck in the edge of escalators . My children are older , so I did n't worry , but my family and I saw this happen to a young boy first hand . It was quite frightening , and I hate to think of what could have happened if my husband had n't rushed over and pressed the emergency stop button on the escalator . If your child wears these , please take caution to keep his/her feet away from the sides of escalators .
 I was very disappointed with this crocs . It smelled so bad , it had a very strong smell , I would n't let my baby girl wear it as I 'm sure it 's very toxic . I ordered this crocs in Fuschia color size 6-7 and I was really excited to try it on my daughter , but I guess it 's going directly to the trash . I can not return it , cuz I do n't live in the US , and returning it would cost me as much as it costs . . very very unhappy with this order . .
 My daughter owns an identical pair of these in light pink in toddler size 8/9 . I purchased a fuscia pair from Amazon in the exact same size , but they are 1/2 '' shorter in length . When my daughter tried them on , her toes were touching the end of the shoes . So I must return them -LRB- and my daughter is extremely disappointed -RRB- . What 's worse , since the return is not the result of Amazon 's error , they can not be exchanged ; I can order a new pair , but would have to incur the shipping charge . I do n't have money to throw away , and with the sizing irregularities , the next size up could still not fit -LRB- it 's anyone 's guess -RRB- . Unless you have time and money to waste on returns and reorders , I would not recommend ordering these online . We will have to find these in a brick-and-mortar store where my daughter can try them on to see if they 're really going to fit .
 Horrible customer service , unresponsive . I ordered purple and I got a Disney Cars model and on a different size . I wrote an e = mail and never received an answer from them . Thank god Crocs is a great company and I was able to exchange them on a Crocs concept store . I dont recommend this vendor
 Hi , I ordered this pair of crocs shoes for my little boy , and I was very dissapointed , because I noticed that the name of Crocs on the bach side of the trap , was inverted in the right foot . I never saw an original crocs shoes with this kind of mistake , so I thought I was frauded .
 I ordered a pair of children 's crocs from this seller a month ago . I got no notice of delay until I wrote to the seller through amazon . They told me only then that there would be a 2 week delay . Finally today , one month after placing the order , I received notice that they would be unable to fulfill my order . Order your crocs from a different seller !
 I bought a pair of these shoes locally about 2 years ago -LRB- size 8-9 for LESS than -LSB- ... -RSB- -RRB- he was size 8 at the time , they were a little too big on my son I set them aside . It took quite a few months for him to finally be able to use them . Finally he was able to use them , he used them for quite a while . My son is autistic , so once he likes something he wants it ALL the time . Unfortunately he wanted to wear them to bed , since he never went outdoors with them ; I figured that 's not too bad.The only time these would come off was for bath time , eventually they broke -LRB- 3 months later -RRB- . It was a pain to find them locally , they do n't sell them anymore . By the third sleepless night with my son who 'd give a HARD time to be put to bed I came here to Amazon hoping to find help.I ordered the very same shoe same size 8-9 for toddler -LRB- 3 times the price of the originals -RRB- they took 2 weeks to arrive . His size now varies between 9 and 9.5 . They were really tight -LRB- of course -RRB- and he did n't want them ! So I came back and ordered him size 10-11 , surprise ! THEY 'RE HUGE!In my desperation I had to submerge the 8-9 in warm water ... to stretch them , I took newspapers and shoved them inside the shoes and kept changing the warm water . It took 3 days but the shoes FINALLY stretched enough for him to find them comfortable to wear.He 's back wearing them ; meanwhile his foot is growing as I 'm typing here . And yet no shoe sized 9-10 that resembles this shoe at all.Oh but the worst thing is not the size , the worst thing IS THE PRICE ! -LSB- ... -RSB- ??? For rubber shoes ? Are you kidding me ? If I did n't have this emergency I would n't have bought these shoes AT ALL ! These people are deliberately taking advantage of desperate parents!As soon as I find them locally again I 'm ditching these guys , it would n't be so bad if they actually had the size of my son .
 The size was listed 1-3 , but too wide looking , the starp was too cheap , came off easly . I will be returning this pair again !
 First time buying crocs . Thought they were supposed to be high quality . But after a few weeks of occasional wear by my 5 year old , strap broke off . Hesitant to buy a new pair , but otherwise great for summer b/c they 're close-toed and can get wet . He really liked them ... a few weeks later , we decided to try another pair and this time strap broke on very first day ! What junk . Now he 's wearing one croc from the old pair and one from the new - until those straps break too .
 I bought these crocs for my granddaughter and was very dissapointed that they were too big for her . The sizing is odd so I had to return them
 This is Amazon feedback more than Crocs feedback
 These are made in Mexico , and although it is 100 times better than having them made in China , they are defective . The cuts are not clean . They look like someone sliced them with a knife . I will keep them because it is a hassle to return them but being from CO and buying crocs since they invented them in Boulder ... I am NOT happy with these .
 Not a big fan of these shoes . After my three year old daughter fell numerous times while running in these shoes , we limit her use of them to quick trips to the pool or backyard . She is not allowed to run in them and does n't like to wear them as they make her fall down . She has a narrow foot , and perhaps this attributes to that a bit . These shoes are very wide and loose . Probably more suited to a child with wide feet or a child that does n't run and play -LRB- do they exist -RRB- ? I will not be purchasing these again , as I have found the Keen Newport to be a much better , durable , safer shoe for my child to wear all summer .
 I BOUGHT THIS CROCS FOR MY 2 1/2 YEARS BOY AND I CHOOSE THE 4-5 M US TODDLER . WHEN I RECEIVED IT IT DID N'T FIT HIM CAUSE IT IS TOO SMALL . THE SIZE CHART IS TOTALLY INCORRECT
 Well they are crocks . and the color is not what I expected . Burst is highlighter yellow ! I was expecting more of a butter color judging by the photo . I read the sizing chart and ordered my toddler a size 8/9 his normal shoe size is a 7 . Well he most likely will not be wearing these at all ! By the time he fits in them it will be winter ! Ugh so frustrating !! But the quality of the product is wonderful . Despite the color mix up i really wish his feet would fit into these !!
 My son has been wearing crocs for years . He has worn the classic style . I thought this would just be the next size up . But the sizing seemed off . We ordered a boys size 2 . The size 2 was about 1/4 inch longer than the size 1 that he had outgrown . But the width was 3/4 of an inch wider in the heel area , at least and equally wide or wider in the toe area . The size was described by Amazon as Medium or M. I looked up the same shoe on the crocs.com website and it was described as their `` roomiest '' or widest fit of the three fit styles they listed . So I think this shoe should be listed as a W or Wide not medium , especially since Crocs run wide anyway . I had my son put one old shoe on and one new shoe on and took a picture . I was hoping to be able to post the picture so that potential buyers could see how wide this shoe is . This shoe would probably fit a kid with short toes and very wide or chubby feet . I am returning them as they do not fit my child 's average size 2 foot .
 I ordered blue croc , but I got chocolate color.My son was upset , since blue is his favorite color.I did n't want to take trouble returning it and exchanging it.But we were not happy about it .
 Maybe it is me , but I ordered shoes in what I thought were my daughters size and they came in the exact size of my son 's , whose feet are two sizes bigger . I could have misordered but I was pretty careful about it . The sizing chart is confusing.I agree with the woman who says the shoes are too expensive for what they are . That is probably true for kids ' shoes in general , though .
 I always buy my kids crocs before going to Disney every year . I have never had a problem before . They usually walk alot and stay comfy . This year my 8 year old got horrible blisters on the top of his feet where the shoe opening is . Needless to say he wore gym shoes the rest of the trip . Poor kid was very uncomfortable . I think it might be this style . My other two children wore different styles .
 I 've purchased many pairs of Crocs over the years but the quality has severely diminished over the past few years . I 'm not sure exactly what has changed in the manufacturing but a pair of crocs used to last my daughter a couple of years . At the end of May , the back strap broke on a pair so I bought a new pair through Amazon . She wore them TWICE when one of the straps broke off the back . We decided to do `` surgery '' and took a back strap off an old pair to replace the broken one . I wish we had simply returned them at the time but she liked them so we did n't . Now , the other strap has broken off the back . Please note that the strap off of the older pair is still intact and going strong . You can actually FEEL the difference in thickness between the old and new . It 's really sad because my daughter and most of her friends love them but I will not spend $ 32 on a pair of shoes that breaks immediately . And of course , I ca n't return to Amazon . Hopefully , I 'm not the only one that 's complained -LRB- I also complained directly to Crocs -RRB- and the quality will improve again but for now , we 've purchased our last pair of crocs . And our last pair of shoes from Amazon , PERIOD , due to the return policy .
 We own several pairs of the old Crocs type slingbacks which had rivets that held the strap in place . These rivets have broken in the past and we had ordered replacements -LRB- not free may I add -RRB- . When I called today I was told that the new style Crocs have machine rivets and therefore the old style is no longer available . I find this to be extremely poor customer service .
 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .
 those are a good shoes , but the delivery provide service is the worst , i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day , i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail , bad deal to me !
 I really wanted these because I needed really comfortable sandals for traveling . These are not it . They scratched my feet and caused a lot of blisters . I sent them back to the manufacturer in the hopes that they could fix them . No such luck
 Nice looking shoes , but the ones I received are way too small . They say size 7.5 N , but definitely are not . I will have to return them .
 I wish I could give them -5 stars.I got these to replace a pair of New Balance 999 that I had for almost 10 years thinking that the quality of shoes that cost around $ 170 should be really good . I could n't be more wrong . The lining of these shoes started falling apart just after 3 month of wearing them and not even every day !!! Stay away at all cost !
 I love NewBalance shoes because they have great quality and extra wide sizes . But not this pair!First of all , it looks nothing like the picture . It actually looks really green . The logo on the tongue looks so bland and ugly -LRB- it just says `` 780 '' -RRB- And it is n't made in the USA . -LRB- Usually NB shoes are . -RRB- I have nothing against stuffs made in China , but this pair was so poorly made . The green paint on the side wears off on my jeans ! I can feel some threads of strings on my feet when I am wearing it -LRB- and I wear socks -RRB- . The insoles are really thin too . I bought two pairs of NewBalance shoes . The ones in 780 are thinner . The shape of the insoles is kinda different from the other pairs too.It 's functional ; it 's not like it 's falling apart out of the box . But I am not getting my money 's worth with this pair ...

 These shoes appear to be yellowing - literally yellowing - on the shelves in stores all over New York City . I do n't know what they made the white part of the soles from , but they should consider changing it because it actually turns yellow with age like the plastic on an old computer , except apparently much much faster.I ca n't speak to their comfort , however , because Amazon/FootLocker sent the wrong size , so I had to return them to a FootLocker that had stopped carrying them .

 I ordered these cleats thinking maybe Lady Footlocker sold mens cleats , not the case . I got a pair of 10 's that fit like an eight . They look great , but as a guy , you just ca n't go around wearing chick cleats ...
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .

 I had to return it immediately when I opened the box . On the picture it looks more blue than purple .

 Amazon advertised free shipping so I took the Bait . I will not use AMAZON again . I deal with liars all day at work . I do not need to deal with more over the computer . ________ Amazon 's reasoning

 Got these shoes on sale on Amazon . First , the sizes are for narrow feet . If you are a wide size like me , then you 'll either have to look elsewhere or have your shoes stretched , which I did . After stretching and ordering them a size larger , I still need to use corn pad to prevent corns because of the pain . I prep my shoes since I walk about 3 miles a day using order sprays and powders . Surprisingly , they started to stink after 3 days use despite the precautions . They must be using recycled or subpar material . The smell persist despite sprays , powders , liners , freebreeze ... The stitching on the front toe part started showing white material forcing me to use polish to keep them looking good . After three months , they do hold up somewhat but I will not purchase another pair . My old Shaqs were superior to these Reebok and cost much less .
 I found this shoe to run very small . I have 3 pairs of Spring Step shoes , and 2 pairs fit fine , but this pair is so small they 're unwearable . Unfortunately the seller charges a `` restocking fee '' , so in addition to paying postage both ways , this was a fairly costly purchase , and I ended up with no shoes . I will never buy shoes online again , even when I am familiar with the brand .

 I wore these boots for the first time , Halloween night . I did a little dancing and a very little bit of walking and when I get to the last party , the heel on the right boot just snaps off and I almost busted my you know what on some stairs . Cheap cheap cheap , except for the price . I want my money back !
 The company sent me the wrong product and then it took over a month to resolve . This was supposed to be a Halloween costume piece , but too bad . The matter was n't resolved until November . I recommend NEVER purchasing from this store .

There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .
 I wore these boots for the first time , Halloween night . I did a little dancing and a very little bit of walking and when I get to the last party , the heel on the right boot just snaps off and I almost busted my you know what on some stairs . Cheap cheap cheap , except for the price . I want my money back !
 The company sent me the wrong product and then it took over a month to resolve . This was supposed to be a Halloween costume piece , but too bad . The matter was n't resolved until November . I recommend NEVER purchasing from this store .
 I really wanted these because I needed really comfortable sandals for traveling . These are not it . They scratched my feet and caused a lot of blisters . I sent them back to the manufacturer in the hopes that they could fix them . No such luck
 Nice looking shoes , but the ones I received are way too small . They say size 7.5 N , but definitely are not . I will have to return them .
 As nice as these pumps look , they are not comfortable at all . One of the buckle straps were short and hard to latch .

 I ordered these cleats thinking maybe Lady Footlocker sold mens cleats , not the case . I got a pair of 10 's that fit like an eight . They look great , but as a guy , you just ca n't go around wearing chick cleats ...

 Got these shoes on sale on Amazon . First , the sizes are for narrow feet . If you are a wide size like me , then you 'll either have to look elsewhere or have your shoes stretched , which I did . After stretching and ordering them a size larger , I still need to use corn pad to prevent corns because of the pain . I prep my shoes since I walk about 3 miles a day using order sprays and powders . Surprisingly , they started to stink after 3 days use despite the precautions . They must be using recycled or subpar material . The smell persist despite sprays , powders , liners , freebreeze ... The stitching on the front toe part started showing white material forcing me to use polish to keep them looking good . After three months , they do hold up somewhat but I will not purchase another pair . My old Shaqs were superior to these Reebok and cost much less .

 My son has worn stride rite shoes since he was born and I have never had a problem with any of their shoes before . They 've always been comfortable for him to wear and never hurt his feet . BUT these sandals , hurt his feet to the point that he will take them off . The design on these sandals is what causes them to hurt his feet . The clasps on the front and back of the shoe are not designed well . there is a space in between where the velcro closes the material around the toe and around the ankle , also the material has a weird hook type effect where u clasp the velcro area that actually flips down onto the foot and causes it to dig into his skin . Makes no sense to me why they designed the closure areas to have the material turn down . Anyway this is the only pair of stride rite shoes that I have not liked , but he has only worn these maybe 5 times and I 've already sent them off to Goodwill . I would suggest going with a different design the Sunfish and the TT Tallon sandals are wonderful , I will never stray again .
 My 2 year old daughter has always worn Stride Rite shoes . They have always fit her well . This particular model is HORRIBLE ! It digs into her skin and she screams no when I try to put them on her . I put some molefoam in them and that helped a little -LRB- she does n't scream about them with the molefoam -RRB- , but her feet still get blisters and indentations in her foot -LRB- just not as severe as without the molefoam -RRB- . This sandal is a poor design . Why would stride rite have rubber on the inside of the strap over the foot that has a texturized rubber ? That 's what leaves an indentation in her foot .
 My 18 month old son loves wearing his shoes , specifically his Stride Rite tennies . So I figured Stride Rite was the best for sandals . Just putting them on his feet for less than a minute , he was yelling `` Off ! Off ! '' I tried five different times to get him to wear them - just aruond the room . Each time with the same expression . I returned them . They must have been rubbing his little feet wrong . I guess I need to try them on in the stores so I know that they dont rub .

 I purchased the Pacific Outdoors Boot and Glove Dryer as a companion to my PEET Original M97-OL Shoe Dryer . I liked the illuminated on/off switch and it dried my shoes nicely . Unfortunately , the Pacific Outdoors Boot and Glove Dryer smelled like it was burning and while I could not see any evidence of scorching , I was afraid to leave it on overnight.I will be returning the Pacific Outdoors Boot and Glove Dryer and replacing it with another PEET Original M97-OL Shoe Dryer . The PEET is a five star product with no odor and shoes are toasty dry in the morning .
 I bought this boot dryer for my hunny who is a hunter . He turned it on for an hour this morning to dry his boots and gloves and the plastic around the vents melted and morphed . So now it is useless . Would not recommend !
 I guess it works but it smells so bad I sent it back after it was on for 2-hours . Maybe if it was in the garage it would be OK .
 I ordered this 12 Jan 2011 -- received and starting using around 21 Jan 2011 . It broke 1 May 2011 . Used maybe 6 times . I called Pacific Outdoors and they tell me it was a discontinued item and Amazon purchased all they had . I had to go to Amazon for resolution . Amazon warranty ended 24 Feb 2011 . Product did work well the 6 times I used it , but it would cost more to mail back to Amazon than the partial payment Amazon 's offers . Off to the dump with this one . No more Pacific Outdoor products for me

 I loved the shoe itself , i.e. , the quality of its production and the colors , and in general have had great experiences with new balance in the past , but I ordered the wides and they were not really wide at all.If you are not a wide foot like myself , then this will not really apply to you , and you should read another review .
 Bought these for my husband and was wondering why they were so cheap . We love New Balance . But these were made in China !! What 's up New Balance ? We love you cause you 're made in the USA !!!
 Nowhere does it say this shoe has a slip-in insole . I HATE removable insoles so I 'm returning . Also , the box came sealed like new shoes , but one shoe had been laced - rather sloppily leaving twisty creases in the lace - a clear indication this was a return or a store second . Not sure I 'm guaranteed a factory-fresh shoe when I buy thru Amazon , but that 's what I expected . Would n't you ?
 First , these shoes look amazing . The navy suede over the silver really stands out . The N logo on the side even shimmers in the sunlight . So in that regard , they were perfect.As for comfort , they 're as good as any Airwalks or Vans I 've ever worn before . The insole is n't super thick , but it offers some protection from the rocks and whatnot.The durability , unfortunately , does n't seem to be working out for me . One of the shoes , the tighter of the two when I tried them on , has stretched out at least half a size in under a month . It went from rubbing my big toe a bit to my heel suddenly slipping out of the cup . I tried new insoles , that did n't work . I tried the heel lock lacing , and that did n't work . It just seems to be too big for my foot now , a little over a month after the purchase.It 's very frustrating , as I loved the shoes originally , but now my heel is sore from rubbing against the back of the shoe .
 im really so disappointed with this new balance , its really hard to wear it for long hours , my feet hurts , now i dont know what to do with it , i probably just gon na throw it on the trash , i wasted $ 38 , dont be fooled by false reviews , i have the same 574 but i bought it from a local store and its really good , the reason i bought the next one from amazon because it was hard to find the EE size at local stores , i should have a refund for this , i know amazon dont return worn shoes , but i was expecting same comfort as the one i bought from a local store , iam very dissappointed
 Only one color is available for the sale price , and not even in all sizes . It should read `` Sale . $ 39.99 on selected color ... ''
 Both of these were smaller than any 13 shoe I 've ever worn , especially the right shoe , which is too small to even wear . The silver finish is worn off around the edge like they 'd already been used . Not a good purchase
 Defective product , left shoe too tight and a bit short ! I have had three other pairs of New Balance 574 ' s with out a problem .
 Hard like a rock box label 8.5 ee But 8.5 gave them to Salvation Army not worth your time looking ordering waiting then you still have to buy again . I will be glad when gov takes control
 left one of pair is warped . . I wish I did n't make this purchase.if you do n't see and touch anything you want to buy , do not buy it .
 I was greatly disappointed in fit , very narrow compared with previous New Balace shoes purchased over the last 25 + years . I will not buy NB again .

 I was dissapointed in these shoes , I love Aerosoles and these did n't meet their usual standard . They are cute , but not as comfortable as I have found in this brand in the past .

 I was excited to receive my oxfords , but unfortunately ended up very disappointed . After only 4 hours of wearing them I could hardly walk , as they were so uncomfortable . They also had a bad fit on the sides which rubbed the top of my foot . I do n't think 4 hours of wear was worth the $ 40 price . The shoes look very durable , but they 'll probably last a very long time sitting in my closet .

 I ordered the 3.5 big kid shoe based on the sizing chart in inches . The size states that it is 8 5/8 inches and the shoe is actually 8 inches long .

 Description states snake printed leather ; however , purchased shoes and it is labeled/stamped all manmade materials . Shoes were returned .
 They are a little stiff , should have smoother edges around the area you slide you foot in . Not very comfortable .
 I wear size 9 1/2 - 10 wide . These shoes were the perfect look , although a little bright of a silver . I wore these to a wedding and the strap kept falling off my heel . In between the wedding and reception , we stopped at a CVS and I purchased those Dr. Schols silicone grip strips , but even with those the the strap refused to stay on . I was hugely disappointed.I wear wide mostly for my toe box and perhaps my heel is normal size and that may be why they were too big . Still there was a small elastic section on the strap , which should have made it automatically adjust to my heel size , but the elastic was not very springy . Sort of stretched out.One more thing if you wore these without stockings they may work for you . However , for me silver is a winter holiday type choice and I would never go without nylons in the winter .
 The problem with this sandal was not in the sizing , it was just really uncomfortable . The straps really dug in . I do n't expect a pair of dress sandals to be as comfortable as walking shoes , but they should not rub and dig in as soon as you try them on . I expected something with at least a nod to comfort from Naturalizer . I returned them .
 Shoes were very narrow even though they were marked as wide . The shoes themselves were very nice and arrived on time , I just wish they fit .
 Nor stylish neither sensational ! Never thought it will disappoint me so much . In the picture , the fabric appears really fine leather . Which inspired me to order it though it is made with simulated leather . The fabric looks like imitation leather or rexine and the stitching is mediocre . I wanted it for a party and now I have to look for other options . I wonder who would pay for the original price of $ 42.00 when paying $ 12 for on-sale bothered me . I have returned it , hope they will refund me . The product description says it is final sale .

 I suspect this is standard footwear at Guantanamo , assuming these are n't banned under the Geneva Convention . Aside from the look of this shoe , I can not find one redeeming feature . These are far inferior to much cheaper shoes I 've had in terms of comfort , craftsmanship , and fit.I 've mostly worn Ferragamo loafers for the past several years , but I thought it was time to ditch the gaudy buckles and go for something classic and conservative , so I chose this design . I was fitted at the 5th Ave AE store in New York City , and I ultimately ordered 2 pairs online the following week - one in black calfskin , one in burgundy calfskin.They were uncomfortable at the store , but the woman helping me insisted that massaging the heel cup and just wearing them a few times would break them in . This is false . I literally could not walk the one block to my subway stop for the first 3 weeks wearing these . I actually took cabs to work hoping I would n't find a pool of blood in the heel of my shoes each evening . I stomped on the heel cup and tried to use a shoe tree to stretch the area of the toe box that was crushing my pinky toe to no avail . It 's now two months later and they are still horribly uncomfortable . If there is so much as a wrinkle in my sock or the slightest seam , the shoe is unbearable , and the heel continues to chafe.The toe box actually feels stretched out now that they 've broken in a bit . This is far far more pronounced in the burgundy shoes , which broke in a bit easier , perhaps because of a slightly different tanning process ?? Who knows , but now the shoes that once seemed too tight in my forefoot are too loose , and my foot feels like it 's slipping off the footbed if I so much as step on uneven pavement.The sides of the shoe right above the exterior pucker with each step . It seems the heel cup extends a bit far toward the instep . Combined with the strap of leather from the upper that keeps the front stiff , the leather in between the two has no choice but to pucker outward , which I find particularly interesting since all of the leather is remarkably stiff except that one area.The soles are soft , which I sadly does n't seem to make the shoes more comfortable , but it does manage to pick up every grain or pebble on the floor . I 've never thought gravel or pebbles to be a problem , but somehow everything is a problem with these shoes.On the black pair of shoes , the creases on the left and right shoe are very different . While the right creases normally , the left puckers upward and bulges out . I might attribute that to inconsistencies between my feet , but since the burgundy pair does n't have that problem , it seems to be inconsistency in manufacturing.Overall , the quality is so far inferior than I imagined . It 's inconsistent , stiff in the wrong places , and without a doubt the least comfortable pair of shoes I 've ever worn . I deeply regret waiting and waiting for them to break in - it would have been wiser to get my money back . I am extremely disappointed in these shoes and recommend anyone considering buying them be absolutely certain about the comfort prior to purchasing , and even then , perhaps it 's better to seek an alternative .

 Beautiful and comfortable for only two weeks . Insides near toes have peeled back and make the slippers very uncomfortable . Odor is terrible -LRB- I only put them on after showering/feet were dry -RRB- . Not worth the money . Huge disappointment . Threw away after less than one month of use .

 These shoes are great for shopping for a few hours or something but if you work on your feet ... negative . Also they caused horrible foot pain due to barely any arch support.After 2 hours of standing my heels ached and my feet were really sweaty despite the little air holes.Also the strap is kinda flimsy and cheap.All in all not very impressed , not horrible for 35 bucks but definitely not up to `` Crocs '' standards ... although they are far cuter.If you want a basic comfy cute shoe for everyday needs then its fine , working all day long on your feet I suggest something with more support .
 THIS SHOE WHILE CUTE , RUBS CONTINUELESSY ON MY PINKY TOE . LEAVING ME TO TAKE MY SHOES OFF QUITE OFTEN THROUGH OUT THE DAY .
 I thought these shoes were so cute and I tried them on in a store , but they did n't have my size . At the time I thought they were comfortable so I ordered them online . One trip around the museum I work at and they had ripped the skin off the back of my ankle to the point that I had to push the backs down and walk around like they were clogs all day . I tried them a few other times and they always hurt the back of my ankles . Plastic is not a good idea for shoes .
 I thought they would be like ` crocs ' since they cost about as much and was disappointed .

 The shoes themselves are comfortable and I would be inclined to buy another pair if not for their tendency to squeak . Both shoes squeak when I lift up the heel . I have read other posts about J&M shoes having similar problems . For a $ 200 pair of shoes to squeak is not acceptable . I should n't have to try powder , vaseline or WD-40 to alleviate the noise in a pair of shoes that are supposed to be of high quality . I have contacted the company directly and we 'll see if they respond .

 It 's extremely difficult to find these shirt stays anywhere . This was the only site I was able to find them on . Shipping was prompt and I had no problems ordering , however they broke after only a few wears . My husband uses these on a regular basis and he 's gone through 4 of them already . One strap broke the first time he put them on . They have good service , but the product does n't hold up to everyday use .
 I own these shirt stays in the white color and I hate them.They 're great when they work correctly , but they are a very bad design . The clips do not stay clipped unless you really jam the fabric up under the loop , and even then they do n't always stay where you want them . I have also found that they stretch out over a relatively short period of time -LRB- but then again , they are only $ 5 for a set -RRB- . You get what you pay for . There 's nothing quite like feeling squared away only to be walking down the hall or talking to someone important and have your shirt stay pop off and fall out the leg of your trousers.I recommend either the hidden tailor or finding another brand of shirt stay that uses a real clip rather than just a rubber/metal loop design that relies entirely on friction and constant tension .
 Kind of touchy to get clipped on and broke in several weeks of daily use . Would not buy again .
 After 30 minutes of wearing these I got my first nut check from one in front that snapped off . I went straight to the restroom at work and took them off .
 i 'VE BEEN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT OVER TEN YEARS & HAVE BEEN WEARING SHIRT STAYS JUST AS LONG . I 'VE WORN THESE SAME TYPES OF STAYS MY WHOLE CAREER & HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM UNTIL THE LAST 2 SETS I 'VE PURCHASED INSIDE OF 1 YEAR . I 'M GUESSING THAT THEY 'RE MAKING THEM WITH CHEAPER MATERIAL & OR MAKING THEM SHORTER . I 'M 6 ' 4 '' & I 'VE TRIED THEM EVEN WITH PENNIES AS ANCORS & THEY STILL SNAP LOOSE . I 'M ACTUALLY THINKING OF HAVING MY OWN MADE BECAUSE I HATE LOOKING SLOPPY . AGAIN , DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY UNLESS YOUR WELL UNDER 6 ' TALL . GOOD LUCK !
 Military shirt stays must be used by people that are taller than 5 ' but shorter than 6 ' 2 . These shirt stays are capable of winning the war for the enemy . When the packaging was made up for the product did anyone actually look at what the military actually needed or did they they try to sell the military something else that they did not need ? In a field modification I will change a few things on these military shirt stays and hope that I do n't hurt myself . Unfortunately I do n't have many options for a refund since I need them for July 8 . Eureka , the manufacturer hates our military and is intent on selling them equipment that could get our service members injured .
 These are clearly youth-sized . If my knees are bent and I 'm wearing knee socks I can attach these but walking is impossible -LRB- I 'm 5 ' 10 -RRB- . Ca n't judge the quality because I ca n't use them . Will be returning .
 These are way too short . I read the reviews before I purchased these and wished I would 've paid attention and not purchase these .
 This was my first time trying shirt stays . I found the clips to be flimsy and they would only work on the thinnest of materials . I have n't given up on finding a solution , but these were not it .
 these must be designed for use with knee socks they are very short in comparison to the shirt stays I 've had before . These are maybe 12 '' fully extended .
 Do n't waste you money . One of the stays came apart the second time I used it . Very poor quality . Metal pieces are cheap and poorly put together .
 Used these once , and the bands started fraying and ripped by the second attempt to wear them . Yes I 've used these for years for my dress uniforms and the ones I used before -LRB- military issue im guessing from army barracks -RRB- I can not find . I bought these hoping for the same standard but they are sub par and in the trash .
 These stays do not have clamps -- rather they have a buttonhole on both ends . To use them , you need buttons on both your shirts and socks .
 Extremely short , I am 6 ' and even extended to their max they are way to short . On top of that the clip button attachmets keep poping off my shirt if the shirt material is at all thick . I would personally look elsewhere .
 the quality is ok , but they are too short ; and i have worn shirt stays for 20 + years . if you are over 5 ' tall , order somthing else . even with the adjustment as long as they could go , they are too short .
 These shirt stays are shorter than my normal stays by 3-4 inches . I 'm 5 ' 8 '' and have to set them to their maximum length . Even at that setting they are are n't long enough to make them comfortable . They are so tight that I just bought a different set from a military base - much better .
 The clips on these things are made for light weight material like nylon stockings . The sock end works ok , but clipping the things to a shirt with heavier material and getting them to hold is a pain in the neck .
 It 'll hold like the military shirt stays , but one of the ends will rub on your legs when you 're constantly walking . The ohter thing is it 's not long as the actual military shirt stay . Might as well go to the actual military surplus to buy it .
 Clasp do not hold well and do not fasten well they come undone allot so I stopped using them and I am going to purchase a better pair
 THEY STRETCHED OUT AFTER A WEEK . . THEY WERE ALWAYS POPING OFF AND THE CLIPS WOULD NEVER STAY CLAMPED DOWN . I WOULD NEVER BUY THESE AGAIN.AND YES I DID USE THEM EXACTLY AS DIRECTED ON THE INSTRUCTIONS . POOR QUALITY PRODUCT . THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT ONE STAR I HAD TO PICK SOMETHING OTHERWISE I WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN THEM ANY STAR .
 I wore these three times before they fell apart . The elastic began to unravel/fray and the metal brackets broke . Cheap , cheap , cheap .
 The clips are very cheaply made and the stiching will irritate your legs like crazy . It feels like they were stiched with fishing line .
 Sorry to say this , but they were useless . I 've already thrown them away . I 'm 6ft tall and had the straps extended all the way and they were still too short . The straps were always coming loose . I would literally be standing still and one would pop off . I 've had several types of shirt stays and these are the worst . I do n't like giving bad reviews , but it is what it is .
 there are way too short . ca n't use them . I can not recommend this procduct . not a great deal . hate them
 I am a police officer . I bought these to wear with my unifirm for work . They were extremely difficult to put on , and then they would not &#34; stay ! &#34; The plastic clips are very poor quality and kept popping off ! I would not recommend these to anyone !
 Rothco Black Military 4-Piece Shirt Stays are cheap and poorly made and I do not recommend them to anyone . They do not stay clipped as they should and I am constantly having to reattach them .
 Im not exactly a giant so i expected these to fit me fairly well . I was wrong , these straps look like they should be worn be an eight year old boy they are so short . Or maybe i just need some thigh high socks -LRB- i doubt thoses are military standard anyway -RRB- My point is if your over 5 ' 8 i would not suggest buying these . This product is for short men
 These are too short use unless you wear a very long shirt and have dress socks that go almost up to your ankle -LRB- I am average height -RRB- . Needs to be longer .
 Beautiful and comfortable for only two weeks . Insides near toes have peeled back and make the slippers very uncomfortable . Odor is terrible -LRB- I only put them on after showering/feet were dry -RRB- . Not worth the money . Huge disappointment . Threw away after less than one month of use .
 I really wanted these because I needed really comfortable sandals for traveling . These are not it . They scratched my feet and caused a lot of blisters . I sent them back to the manufacturer in the hopes that they could fix them . No such luck
 Nice looking shoes , but the ones I received are way too small . They say size 7.5 N , but definitely are not . I will have to return them .
 I ordered the 3.5 big kid shoe based on the sizing chart in inches . The size states that it is 8 5/8 inches and the shoe is actually 8 inches long .

 I ordered these cleats thinking maybe Lady Footlocker sold mens cleats , not the case . I got a pair of 10 's that fit like an eight . They look great , but as a guy , you just ca n't go around wearing chick cleats ...

 I own many much pair of Clark 's shoes and this style is narrower than the average Clark shoes . The center decoration that holds the shoe upper together makes the show have less flexibility than normal Clarks . If your foot is slightlynarrorer than a medium width , this is the shoe for you .
 Pretty to look at but very uncomfortable on . Foot pulls off to side . Had a great experience with other Clarks but this was a waste of money .
 I ordered size 7.5 for myself , but did n't fit me at all . My mother in law wears size 6.5 and they fit her perfectly .

 The Boots look great , but when I first put them on , the steel toe rubbed my large toe slightly . After four hours of wearing them , both sides of my foot were too sore to continue wearing them . One person suggested that they needed to be `` broken in '' , but I am not tough enough to break in the steel toe on the boot . The steel toe looks like it belongs on a regular or even narrow boot . I am now the owner of $ 186 boots that were worn only 4 hours .
 Dear friends of Amazon , I am reviewing the Danner Instigator GTX Gore-Tex -LRB- uninsulated/no thinsulate etc. . . -RRB- , boots . I am military , law enforcement , and an avid hiker ... so I was expecting a boot which fit the description which Danner labeled to the letter . My Danner military boots have lasted through many battles -LRB- on and off the field -RRB- . However , BEWARE !!!! These boots , while decent quality compared to similarly priced boots on the market , are not what I 'd expected . For one thing ... Unlike the photographs ... they are by NO STRETCH of the imagination BROWN with TAN highlights !!!!! These boots are as orange as a pumpkin ! As both military -LRB- uniform -RRB- and law enforcement -LRB- uniform -RRB- requirements are very specific , I discovered that these boots ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE under any conditions to wear for duty . And then I figured , `` Well ... I 'll just keep them for hiking then ! '' But , as soon as I undid the laces , and prepared to try them on for the first time , I quickly discovered that they have a LEATHER collar around the ankle section ... . another misstatement , as DANNER claimed they had a cloth/gore-tex like material which comfortably surrounds the ankle ! Yeah right ! That 's on the outside !? It 's cloth on the outside , and leather on the inside ? HUH ? Anyone who does ANY hiking will tell you that that is a friction problem waiting to happen ! Remember those rub marks when you wore crappy boots as a kid ? So I called them to get my money back . They supposedly have a `` no questions asked '' FREE returns policy right , which was one of the reasons I 'd picked them too ! But -LRB- again -RRB- , since I 'd ordered them through the MILITARY website , they would not take them back -LRB- nor would they take them back if you got them on AMAZON either she explained -RRB- ! So , now I am stuck with a pair of boots which CAN NOT be worn with ANY clothing imaginable -LRB- unless your going as a pumpkin to the next Halloween party of course -RRB- ! Signed , Really pissed off at Danner!PS . Also bought an extra pair of the `` supposedly '' impact dampening inserts too . They were $ 16 , and no better than the cheap gel Doctor Shoel 's -LRB- however you spell it -RRB- inserts one can obtain at any drug store for $ 6 . But do n't believe me ... come on and waist your money too ! My advice is to look at customer photo 's on each site , as when one tries to take a picture of them THEY DO look brown and tan ! But when you take them out of the box in the regular light they are not ! First pair of shoes I 'd describe as functionally and visually HIDEOUS !

 These sandals are extremly uncomfortable . I wear a size 10.5 , but I ordered a size 11 , they were still very narrow and pinched my feet . Also they felt like I was walking on concrete . They are not ajustable and look and feel poorly made . For the same price go with Adidas sandals

 They developed holes way too quickly.Don ' t bother.Nice red though .
 I have purchased online through Fogdog in the past ; however , the description on Amazon is incorrect . This is NOT a 3 pair pack , it is only one pair of socks for $ 13.99 plus shipping . What a rip-off . I am deeply disappointed.Pro Feet Mens Acrylic Multi-Sport Tube Sock - 3 Pair Pack

 I ordered these boots as a part of a party costume -LRB- NCIS 's Abby Sciuto -RRB- . I placed the order a week earlier and payed for express shipping as I was not willing to take any chances . But apparently that was not enough ... they mixed up my order and sent it by ground !!! I received the package 10 days after I ordered it and shipped it back without even giving a look a it . So I 'll not be able to provide a review of the item itself but their customer service was so apologetic and efficient after the fact that they earned at least 2 stars .

 Tommy , what were you thinking ? Although they are lovely to look at , they are absolutely the most uncomfortable shoe , bar none . The shoe bed is too small to accommodate the average foot and they slip off when you walk , I even tried a smaller size thinking that was the problem , I was wrong . Take this design back to the drawing board and start again .
 The picture is totally misleading . They are not leather boot , instead a manmade one -LRB- not even suede -RRB- ! Although they are comfortable indeed , still feel frustrating .
 I bought these to replace a pair of Khombu boots I bought last year . It 's amazing they look almost exactly the same . Unfortunately while the Khombu boots made my feet feel all warm , comfy and protected the Dinara Naturalizers are less comfortable and bite into my feet a bit and are not good for wearing for long periods of time .
 When ordering my shoes I specifically asked for for size 6W and I got the Tan colour in that size but the exact shoe in the black has printed on the inside 6M and someone used a black pen to change the M to a W and the shoe was sent to me like that and obviously as a result does n't fit me properly . The Tan with the proper 6W printed on the inside of the shoe fits me perfectly.I have been back and forth with numerous emails to Shoe Mall who at this point refuses to acknowledge the mistake . All I ask is that the correct size shoe be sent to me . Everytime I ask if they have the black in the 6W they say that is what was sent to me even though I have said to them over and over in my emails that what was sent to me was a 6M that was made to look like a 6W . The shoes themselves are nice shoes but it would be nice to know that when you order something online you get what you ask and that the company that you buy from will do whatever is necessary to correct a error that obviously happened on their end . Unfortunately at this point that has not been my experience .
 I was looking forward to the possibility of a `` walking sandal . '' Unfortunately , these sandals did not do the trick for me . They are well made and of quality materials . The problem is in the sizing . The heel is much larger than I expected it to be . I was tempted to think that perhaps I had purchased the wrong size but no , the width and length were fine . Only the heel was too wide . They just did n't work for me.Your experience may be different .
 Unfortunately I had not purchased Propet brand shoes prior to this purchase . I found that they run smaller than other similar brands . Therefore , I could n't wear the shoes and due to an illness I could not get them returned within the 30 day frame . I wo n't purchase shoes from Amazon again .
 The Propet Women 's W0089 Pedic Walker Sandal seems nice , but it runs very small . Normally , my mother wears a size 10 1/2 , but she 'd need a 12 in this , and this does n't come in a 12 -LRB- an 11 was way too small ; her toes overlapped the end of the sandal -RRB- . The worst part is that I had to pay for return shipping back to FootSmart . If this purchase would 've been directly through Amazon , it would 've been so much better . They pay for return shipping on things that do n't run according to size . Buying from FootSmart is NotSmart .
 I 've been wearing Propet shoes for several years and I 've always been pleased with them . In fact I have two other pair of these sandals in Brown and Black . So I felt safe buying another pair in tan thinking they would fit the same . These are a quarter of an inch shorter than my other ones ! So my toes stick out a little beyond the sole and this is very uncomfortable . I 'm very disappointed .

 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .
 I was really excited to receive this pair of gorgeous sandals , but upon a few hours of wearing them , the links broke ! Needless to say , I had to return them - very reluctantly .
 These slippers are very pretty and attention grabbing but with a few wears the links will fall apart and the rhinestones will fall off . Very disappointed I loved the design .
 -LSB- Update -RSB- Ok , I purchased these a couple of years ago now -LRB- my how time flys ! -RRB- , and I finally broke them in . I 'm wearing them right now , in fact , and they are quite comfortable . It took several long and exhausting months before they were well and truly wrangled , but now they have become familiar , old friends . Exactly how slippers should be.So , I 'll give these slippers an extra star , but really , no one should have to go through the trouble of breaking a pair of slipper in ! ----------------- I purchased a pair of these a week or so ago , and I have got to say that they are the most uncomfortable slippers I 've ever owned.When I slipped these , admittedly good looking things on , I immediately noticed a springy ridge that ran down the center of the shoe . It felt odd , and kind of threw me off balance to the left or right a little when I walked.I 'm still not used to them , a week on . Tonight , my Wife said she could tell when I 'm walking around the house , because of the stumbling footsteps . I almost have to gallop to keep up with these things!What amazes me more than anything else , the thing I just do n't get , is how a company like Acorn can sell an uncomfortable slipper . I mean , the whole point of a slipper is that it 's comfortable ! If it fails in that one aspect , then what 's the point?My question is , does n't someone at Acorn corporate headquarters occasionally slip a pair of these bad boys on , and give them a whirl ? I think they 'd be a tad shocked if they did , and maybe they 'd make a better slipper!I want to know what the Acorn Executives are wearing to jaunt around their houses at night . I want what they have , I want what they 're wearing , dammit!Okay , now maybe I just got a bad pair , and I 'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt on that . I doubt though , I 'll be buying anything else from Acorn . Sorry Acorn , you get 2 stars for effort!Can anyone recommend a really comfortable , yet stylish pair of slippers , please ?
 I like the stylish looks of this pair of clog , however , the front part of the clog are too narrow to me , and the shoes do not feel very comfortable to walk on . Somehow feeling hard and yet wabbling ! I had to decide to return them right after trying them on upon receiving them ... !
 I wear an 11.5 but of course no one makes size 11.5 shoes so I 've always worn 12 's . I ordered these after my old boots had fallen apart and started letting whatever moisture I was standing in seep into my socks . Working on an ambulance I 'm sure you can imagine what kinds of moisture I was standing in ... Anyway I ordered these in a size 12 , which let me remind you is a half size too big for me ALWAYS , and when they came I tried to try them on . I could n't even get my foot into them they were so small . I thought maybe Amazon had shipped the wrong size but no , the box said 12 . I checked out the boots thinking maybe the wrong boots made it into the box but again no luck . The tongue clearly said Mens Size 12 . I was so irritated . I shipped them back and went to the local uniform outfitter and bought a pair.I told this story to the guy there and he told me
 My wife bought me these boots as a Christmas present . She ordered them about a month before Christmas ; when I opened them and tried them on I found them to be too big . Of course we could n't exchange them for a smaller pair because they do n't take returns after 30 days.So I stuffed them with insoles to make them fit . I only wore these boots for about six months before I had to throw them out . I am a police officer , so the boots get used pretty hard , but I 've had Wal-mart boots that lasted longer . BOTH soles had completely worn down ; it 's a good thing I had the insoles in them because that 's what I ended up walking on ! The zippers had broken , one heel had split in half , and no amount of waterproofing agent would help keep water out . Terrible boot for any amount of money . Will not buy Western Chief product ever again .
 THIS SHOE WHILE CUTE , RUBS CONTINUELESSY ON MY PINKY TOE . LEAVING ME TO TAKE MY SHOES OFF QUITE OFTEN THROUGH OUT THE DAY .
 I thought these shoes were so cute and I tried them on in a store , but they did n't have my size . At the time I thought they were comfortable so I ordered them online . One trip around the museum I work at and they had ripped the skin off the back of my ankle to the point that I had to push the backs down and walk around like they were clogs all day . I tried them a few other times and they always hurt the back of my ankles . Plastic is not a good idea for shoes .
 These shoes are great for shopping for a few hours or something but if you work on your feet ... negative . Also they caused horrible foot pain due to barely any arch support.After 2 hours of standing my heels ached and my feet were really sweaty despite the little air holes.Also the strap is kinda flimsy and cheap.All in all not very impressed , not horrible for 35 bucks but definitely not up to `` Crocs '' standards ... although they are far cuter.If you want a basic comfy cute shoe for everyday needs then its fine , working all day long on your feet I suggest something with more support .
 I thought they would be like ` crocs ' since they cost about as much and was disappointed .
 I wear a size 9.5-10 , or 41 Euro . The only ordering options were US whole sizes but the sandals are manufactured in Euro sizes . Mephisto translates them on the box as Euro 40/US 10 so they sent a size 40 without size 41 ever being an option , otherwise I would have ordered it instead of a US 10 . It 's not really Amazon 's fault that Mephisto translates the sizes wrong , but Amazon should n't offer only US size options when the sandals are manufactured in Euro sizes because the sizes do n't translate directly . I was really looking forward to these new sandals and even paid extra for overnight shipping , but since they 're too small , I had to send them back even though they felt like they were going to be the most comfortable cute sandals I 've ever worn . We 'll see how a size 41 works . Fingers crossed !
 While I admit I did n't purchase Helen the Mephisto thong sandal from Amazon , I want you to know I wore them for 3 months and the nails underneath became raised enough to cause drill-like holes in my feet ... of course after a while I could n't wear them , it was too painful . I was told to send them back and a month later they were returned to me with the note that these shoes are not covered by Mephisto warranty . FOR AN EXPENSIVE PAIR OF SHOES THIS IS HORRIBLE . I personally will never buy a pair of Mephisto again . By the way I am not heavy weighing about 135 so my weight could not have affected the shoe .
 I have bought many pairs of these exact sandals in the past . I though I would try online to save some money . The sandals hurt my feet and I am unable to wear them . I am disappointed and would not order these online again .
 I like the style of this sandal , but it was not really comfortable , so I returned it.I had a very similar `` Sonoma '' sandal from Kohl 's that I loved . I could n't find it in the stores anymore , but I did find it on their online site . I ordered it from there and also saved a lot of money !
 These used to be great shoes , as can be seen from the numerous positive reviews . But the most recent model is all plastic not leather . I bought a pair last November thinking it was the same model I have been enjoying for several years.Not so , they lasted 6 months , being easily scratched , not flexible and eventually peeling on the sides ... Avoid these is my advice !
 This Deer Stags Oxford is described as a shoe with leather uppers . I was disappointed to find , the shoe is all plastic . I returned the item and will contiune to shop for a real leather shoe .
 Deer Stags has the worst customer service known to man . I contacted them in 10/09 about shoes we received as a present that fell apart . They said to return them and a new paid would be sent in 2-4 weeks . I sent them , got signature confirmation on the package and they were signed for by the company . I heard no word from them and contacted them 5 times total from October 09 until now ... I was completely ignored . I finally had to file a BBB complaint today . Yeah the shoes are nice IF THEY DO N'T FALL APART . If they do you are out of luck since the company ignores you after trying to get replacements from their warranty . Be wary about this company . If you ever need to contact them prepare to be ignored and ignored and ignored .
 These shoes feel okay to wear . However , they fade and polish does not help . I ordered a pair from a different company because of that simple trait . But wait , there 's more ... at about six months of wearing these shoes to work , the soles began to separate . Ugh - never again Deer Stags . B'bye
 This is the worst purchase I 've ever made on Amazon ! They 're made of a strange plastic material that is obvious when wearing . Every time we 're in the car with the heater on , the shoes make the entire car smell like burning trash . It 's so nauseating , we drove with the windows down in Michigan in winter . I will never purchase anything like this again ~ I would strongly suggest you do n't either . I on ; y give it a 1 star , because there is no 0 star option .
 I ordered Deer Stags from one company and they were beautiful leather , but too small . I ordered a larger pair from Amazon and they were some man-made plastic material . Not nice and definitely not up to the standards of Deer Stags . Terribly disappointed in the shoe . I know it 's not Amazon 's fault , but Deer Stags really should go back to the leather shoe , even if I have to pay more for it .
 I bought these in the shoe size I have always worn for the last 5 years , and when they arrived they were too small to accommodate my toes . I wore them for a day to try and stretch them out , and they gave me such terrible blisters that my socks turned red . I asked to return them or at least exchange them for a larger pair , and I was denied . It was money down the drain , and I am never buying Deer Stags again .
 These are very nice shoes , they last a long time and this is the second time I have purchased a pair . - Correction
 The shoe is fairly comfortable and inexpensive , and looks good at first . I could n't figure out why it was such a value but after wearing the shoe , it does not appear to be leather but rather some kind of plastic . If dressing well at your work matters you want to avoid this . This is the last time I 'll order the brand ; this was the first time I 'd ordered one .
 Really red in color . Appears more brown online . Unhappy with the overall appearance of this shoe but I 'm stuck with it .
 I am very disappointed in these shoes . I purchased them for my husband , he wore them to work for 8 days and the soles are peeling off of the shoes . I contacted the Deer Stag company and they told me I could PAY to ship them back to them , and they would examine them to determine if they would replace them . Poor poor quality product , poor poor company . I would recommend purchasing something else .
 Jan 2013 - These shoes are the worst I have seen - I have owned this brand and style in the past and these are 10 % of the original quality . Returned without even putting them on . These shoes make me wish zero stars was a valid option .
 I bought my first pair of Deer Stags many years ago and immediately loved them . Back then , they were the most comfortable , high-quality shoes I had ever come across and they lasted years . Fast-forward to 2010 , my beloved Deer Stags had finally worn out so I was thrilled to find them online at Amazon . What a disappointment ! The drop in quality was immediately obvious as I got them out of the box . They were n't nearly as comfortable and within just a few months of sedentary office use , the outer shell was cracking and peeling badly . The sole also cracked and within 2 years , it was time to replace the entire shoe . By going cheap , Deer Stags has ruined a great product and their reputation .
 I bought these shoes because I 've had good experiences with Deer Stags in the past . These shoes are not only plastic , but very painful to wear because they do n't seem to break-in . I 've worn these for the past 2 days , and the rear of the shoe cuts into your achilles tendon . Wore these shoes to work today and it was simply too painful to wear anymore . Will be returning these .
 The company touts their insert , and it 's true . The insert is very nice , and helps keep your feet comfortable . HOWEVER , the shoe just KILLS your ankle/heel !! It literally rips up the skin at the back of my ankle and causes them to bleed . OUCH!I want to like them , but the pain is unbearable .
 No kidding . It did.I ordered these shoes for one of the most important interviews in my life . I was pretty happy with it when it got here , so I did n't think there would be a problem wearing them to the interview . On the morning of the interview , I ran for a bit to catch the bus , and noticed the increasingly more painful sensation coming from the back of my feet . I look and I see myself bleeding as the shoes scratched the skin above my Achilles tendon.Note that the shoes was NOT too tight for me . It was , in fact , 0.5 size bigger . Also note that I was not wearing thin socks , but rather athletic ones , and still the shoes made me bleed.Essentially , I just bought pain for $ 50 .
 I had to get shoe stretchers for these . The ridge around the top protruded inwards and pressed into my Achilles tendon so I had to rig up the stretcher to flatten it out . I would n't have got them if I 'd tried them on first . Hopefully it will hold after awhile longer then it will be a decent shoe .
 They have charged my credit card , and not responded with anything , including the purchase order of shoes , or answered inquiries I have entered via phone and e-mail . The shoes are now two months overdue ... horrible company
 After 2 months looked shabby -LRB- easy to scuff , heals top fraying -RRB- , after 5 months shoes totally falling apart . In fairness I am hard on my shoes but usually get 9 months from shoes . Can not recommend these shoes unless their going to be seldom used .
 Order the shoe on 5 Feb and received on 13 Feb. . Great feel and good looking shoe . Only problem is there 's a fold on top of the left shoe that does n't look normal ?????
 I loved these when I first got them . They were incredibly comfortable.But after 2 months of wear , the insoles were completely worn out . I emailed the Acorn company -LRB- could not find a phone number -RRB- to find out if I could get replacement insoles , but they have not responded to my email.So , I would rate their customer service 0 stars . For the price , I would have expected better durability and customer service .
 I have an ancient pair of Acorn slip-ons that I just can not throw out because they are my absolute favorite casual shoes . They are in great condition , for around the house and yard-just looking rather frayed on the fabric and beat up on the leather . I needed a new pair that I could wear in public . Thought I 'd try these as they most resemble my favorites , but they are really flimsy and will no way last as long as my old pair . Why , oh , why do you keep obsoleting really great models ??? I 'll keep watching for ones like this with nubuck and thicker soles . I 'm not bothering to buy , until I see the clogs that you made before , I do n't want to be disappointed by a favorite shoemaker !
 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .
 those are a good shoes , but the delivery provide service is the worst , i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day , i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail , bad deal to me !
 Purchased item in February and fur on inside of bottom of slipper is worn out ! I use them as inside slippers for around the house wear . I have had similar slippers at half this price last 1 1/2 to 2 years . These just made it four months .
 Shoe is advertized as a leather upper . When it comes it is clearly marked as `` ALL MAN-MADE MATERIALS '' inside the heel . Also shoe has to be sent back to seller who charges anywhere from a 15 % restocking fee for a `` damaged shoebox '' to 50 % for `` trying-on wear . '' Seller is a rip-off . Do not buy ! I wish I had a ZERO STAR rating to use .
 The product took 2 weeks to arrive since it was originally shipped to wrong state . Then , I received the wrong color . Size ordered fit at least two sizes smaller than same size from any store . Even when color and size were wrong , I had to return to store at my own expense . Poor custumer service . I will not buy from this company again .
 Not the best fit , and not the best color . I wear them occasionally but not often . My feet tend to slip out for some reason even with my arch insoles .
 Other reviews were right that these seem to run a little small . Both a little short and maybe a little narrow too .
 This shoe is pretty and stylish , but not true to size . I ordered a medium width . The shoe fit OK except for the heel , which was way too narrow . I had to return them .
 i was looking for nice plain low heels.i trusted the hushpuppies brand . needed 11 ew . to narrow and bottom of shoes were slick . a plus size girl could slip and fall in these real fast . i returned them . i suggest cloudwalkers instead .
 This is a very cute shoe , especially the style and the height of the heel . However , it is not made of leather as advertised . This makes a difference to shoppers as myself , as shoes made of manmade materials do n't breathe well.Also , I ordered a Medium-width shoe , but this style runs extremely narrow . I have never had to buy a Wide-width shoe in my life and am consistently the same size for dress shoes . However , these are more than uncomfortably tight on my foot.It 's too bad , because the seller mailed the product to me in record time . Their customer service was also very responsive when I contacted them to return the item . Overall , I would not give the seller a negative rating , but would caution people interested in purchasing this product as they may need to order a size up -LRB- esp . in width -RRB- .
 I looked all those nice reviews but I was disapointed when the shoe came . It is pretty but has a slipery sole . And it is not leather as advertised .
 I was told that this was the fastest running shoe ever . But when I compared them to Nike 's models , they were clearly inferior.Overall -- slowest running shoe ever .
 I have been wearing New Balance sneakers for over ten years and this is not their finest product . I purchased these for just strolling around the park with the kids , no long distances , but they were quite annoying . The sole is recessed and there is an odd portion on the end of the shoe that rubs your heel as you step . Unfortunately , I tried to go up a size and had the same result.They look really nice but they 're not worth the discomfort . I suggest that you take a good walk around a footwear store with these on before you add to the unwanted shoes in your closet .
 This is an Uncomfortable shoe . The heel is much higher than discribed , and it is much too tight . It was on sale , so returning it was not an option . So , I have a pair of shoes that will never be worn .
 The price was good . The fit was okay . The shoes only lasted a week on a very active 8-year-old . Not impressed with the elastic ties . Could n't get them to stay tied and one worked its way out of the shoe . Researched a solution , and the advise was buy new shoes ! Not happy having to replace them after one dance class . I went with a different shoe the second time around .

 I ordered a size 3 for my son ; however , when I got them , they were so hard to unlace and then I had to practically shove his foot into the shoe . Once in , I realized that they ran about a size too small and were really tight . I did n't want to pay $ 6.99 to return , so I 'll sell them .
 These shoes are nice looking , but WAY too small . I normally wear a size 7 normal width , and I purchased size 7 , and the sticker on the bottom of the shoes indicated size 7 . I could n't even completely slide my foot into these shoes . I 'd estimate the straps over the foot are less than 1 inch high . The area for the big toe was so tight that it completely cut off the blood supply and the toe turned purple . These shoes were made in China , and I guess they do n't have their quality control in place yet .
 The boots have a sparkle that appear to be rhinestones , but do n't be fooled ! They are actually irridescent stickers , and they make the boot look cheap . Overall , the boot would look significantly better without the `` glitter stickers '' !
 I ordered these boots and they said they were ostrich boots . When I received them there was no bumps on the boots . They were plain old cowboy boots . They were not what the picture projected them to be . Then I had to pay $ 26.00 to mail them back . I was not satisfied with them . It spoiled my Christmas .
 Sorry . I bought them as a gift and have a report that the holes up front are very uncomfortable especially for big toe . I will be returning , which I am bummed about , and , have probably learned not to buy a clothing item on line as a gift .
 I begin by saying I have worn Crocs `` Beach '' Men 's XXL for many years . They have always been excellent shoes ... UNTIL , I PURCHASED MY MOST RECENT PAIR . The first thing you notice is they are MADE IN CHINA.Without question the shoes from China are smaller . To the point of even being tight . The back strap ismore narrow than the previous shoes I purchased . The front part of the sole is not as thick . Overall , it feels like a cheap imitation . I may NEVER buy another Croc shoe .
 We received the Crocs , which are my son 's favorite shoe to wear . However , when he wore them to school the next day , one of the straps broke and I had to run a different pair of shoes to him at school . We are hoping to return them and get a new pair -- that will last longer than two hours .
 Croc strap broke the first time it was worn . Not pleased with this product at all .
 I have bought several pairs of crocs and these did not appear to be original crocs . I always buy the same size and these arrived way too big , how could the same size be too big if these are original crocs ? Had to send back and pay for shipping , not very happy and will only buy crocs from the original website .
 Est delivery date was 12/13 - 12/16 guess what date it is today ... 1/3/11 ... . it was going to be a nice Christmas gift for my son-in-law . . I was hoping for 2010 . To many other good companies out there to use this one again .
 i 'm very dissisafied with my crocs . they send the wrong size.so i 'm stuck with them .
 tengo mas de un mes que pedi mis cross y aun no me han llegado necesito saber q paa con ello por favor denme razon de ello ya q los tengo cargados en mi tarjeta y todo gracias
 Maybe I 'm too concerned about fashion , but there are shoes out there that are just as comfortable , and dont make me look like I work in a hospital . I see people wear these every day and I cringe when they walk by . I guess theyre good for people maybe 70 and older who need orthotic shoes and cant wear sandals to the beach .
 I have worn Crocs for years . They are almost a must for diabetics . The ones on this page are made in China . The cheaper quality is immediately visible , the sizing is off and the last -LRB- shape of shoe -RRB- also appears different . I wish Amazon would clearly stipulate where stuff is made so we could have a choice .
 My non-Croc-type of footwear are more comfortable and better made than the real Crocs I bought recently ! Quite disheartening .
 I wore these shoes for 1 day working in the garden . when I took them off the tops of my feet were inflamed with red bumps that scabbed over and were very tender to the touch , I could n't wear any shoes that touched the tops of my feet for almost 2 weeks.they were comfortable to wear , but the rash is still really bad after 2 weeks . I WO N'T wear them again ...
 I ordered size 8/9 since i wear a size 8 1/2 shoe , they fit my husband who wears size 11 . To top it off I ended up paying $ 6.00 for the return shipping . It will be the last time I order shoes from them .
 Do not waste your money on these they are cheaply constructed I received them today and the snap on the strap that holds them to your foot was broken and would not stay snapped together save your money I paid my money for broken merchandise again please save your money these are not constructed well at all
 I was very dissapointed with this product . I bought some beach crocs a few years ago and they were made in Canada . These were made in China . They are not the same quality at all . These are not cushioned like the others were , they are also smaller even tho they are the exact same size as the ones made in Canada . These are NO better than the cheaper `` knock offs '' you find in dollar stores .
 I have bought several prs of crocs , but these were sized differently than the others which were unisex and thus mfor my size 11 feet were too small .
 The first time I wore these , I stepped into a puddle and my socks got absolutely soaked . Through these boots .
 I purchased these shoes for my Son - He owns a Landcaping Company and he walks alot ... After one week the sole separated from the shoe - He had to stop and buy a roll of duck tape . He love the way they felt and his feet was n't as tired by the end of the day . Need to work on the outside Quality - comfort is good .
 They are pretty useless . They do not hold up and they are not slip proof . I work in my studio and have to replace them frequently . So it is a good thing there are so many of them . Would not buy them again .
 My son loves the appearance of the shoe , but the item description is very misleading.Product Features Listed in Description : - leather-Soft , calfskin leather upper-A youth shoe that employs powerpulse technology for optimal kicking power-Eva insole for comfort-Split outsole for optimal weight and flexibilityThe tag on the shoe actually lists a synthetic upper . I would not recommend this seller based on the deceptive advertising .
 i got a pair for my daughter . however , when she tried it on , we had a hard time fitting it because it was quite tight . though it fits her , it was not comfortable . she ended up not wearing it at all .
 This boot looked so much better online . For this boot to be by Nine West it looked very cheap . I was very disappointed with this product that I returned it but I 'm still waiting for my refund !!!
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .
 it much worse then looks at the picture . bad laether quality , awful false fur
 So , I figured I should rate these on how they were when I received them in the mail ; 2 Stars . Although I enjoy them more now that I have altered them myself . Now , let me explain : - I wear a size 7 and I ordered these in brown . At the time they did n't have a regular 7 , they only had 7 Medium Width . I went ahead and ordered them anyway . When I first took them out of the box I was n't sure if I was even going to be able to get them on my feet ! They were incredibly tight , and hard to zip . It helped to loosen up the laces , but they were still a bit uncomfortable . I ca n't imagine how tight they would have been if I got regular width . So as I was trying them on I noticed that the tongue of the boot was sewn into place in various spots along the side in order to help the tongue stay in place ... The problem with this is that all it did was add to the tightness of the boot . One of the boots was also defective and had the tongue folded over onto itself then stitched in place . This was causing the boot to buckle in that spot . Finally , I decided to pull out my seam ripper from my sewing kit and untack the tongue from the boot . This did wonders - The boots were no longer unbareably tight , and they even fit/looked better around the top of my foot . - The biggest problem I had with these were the laces ... In the photo it looks like the boots have leather laces -LRB- at least in my opinion -RRB- . The boots came with regular tennis shoe laces , brown ones of course , but it just really did n't fit with the style -LRB- And I do n't mean round tennis shoe laces , I 'm talking about FLAT ones ... I mean , come on ! They are even NAMED `` Viking '' -RRB- . The laces just did not go at all . I decided to go to my local craft store and buy some brown leather lace that I cut to size and that matched the color . Those look so much better , just like the PHOTO posted here ! - As for overall comfort , they are n't great . But that is somewhat to be expected , these are more for looks than comfort anyway . It 's hard to find tall , cute heels that are comfy . Sometimes beauty hurts ! HahaSo , it 's now clear why I would give them only 2 Starts upon opening the box , but now like them more after I 've spent a bit of my time and money altering them . Now they actually look like the photo that you are marketed with on Amazon ! - __ - Some people would probably just return them , but I liked what they looked like enough online to try and fix them . I am happy with them now . If I had received them in the mail how they look now -LRB- after my alterations and how they should have been in the first place -RRB- I would have probably given them 4 Stars .
 Definitely returning these , the quality is terrible.Disgusting synthetic leather that feels like it leaves a filmy residue on your hands , faux fur that absolutely reeks of plastic and a heel that I feel like I could snap off with my bare hands if I really tried . Also , the heel was not quite 4 '' nor was the shaft of the boot high enough to be called a `` knee boot '' , it reached about 3/4 of the way up my calf -LRB- and I do n't half exceptionally long legs -RRB- . The lacing is not at all attractive , it 's very wide and difficult to tighten around the foot itself , but much easier around the leg . Overall , not an attractive shoe.On the other hand , shipping was fast , and I suppose you get what you pay for .
 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .
 I returned the item because it was not exactly what I was looking for .

 I got 2 pairs , for each child and when they were wearing those sandals without socks all day , the sandals just smelled so bad . I left them outside but they still smell ! I always get Stride rite for many years . Oh well , this is a total waste of money .
 These run super big , had to exchange twice o get he size hit , but that does not bother me as much as the WET DOG smell these create and transfer on o the feet . We have owned many pairs of stride rite and were always pleased until we it these ! Do to buy !!!
 Of all the shoes my son has ever owned I like these least , not because they are uncomfortable but because they are the only shoes that have ever stunk . He has had lots of sandals that he wore without socks , none have ever stunk . I ca n't get the stink out and we are going to have to throw them out after very little wear . If he had a foot oder problem I 'd understand , but he does n't have that problem . Skip these and find another brand . We ended up with crocs .
 The only problem I have with these shoes is the heel height . I take a size 12 so when shoes list the heel height it is for a much smaller size and the heel height goes up considerably for larger sizes . These heels are over 3 inches , however , these shoes make my foot look smaller and can be worn with jeans as well as with dressier outfits . I love them !!!
 yesterday 3/08/09 was the 1st time I took shoes out of box and I was highly disappointed . I just looked at them in the plastic when they arrived and was pleased , but on yesterday when I got ready to put them on I saw all the spots ! there was nothing I could do because they were for the outfit that was to be worn . I do n't think anyone noticed but I was aware
 These shoes would probably be wonderful if they fit ! I ordered 1/2 size larger because I wanted them to workout and they are too large . They hurt my feet because they flop . Otherwise , I think it would be a great shoe .
 Shoes were one size too large in fit . No support at all , like slippers.Problem with the 15 % restock fee . It cost me almost $ 32 in postage & handling and restock just to try these shoes that did n't fit .
 THIS WAS A REALLY NICE LOOKING SHOE , BUT WAS TOO NARROW FOR ME . I HAVE A NARROW FOOT , AND USUALLY THE OPPOSITE OCCURS , SO I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED , BUT HAD TO RETURN IT !
 The Boots look great , but when I first put them on , the steel toe rubbed my large toe slightly . After four hours of wearing them , both sides of my foot were too sore to continue wearing them . One person suggested that they needed to be `` broken in '' , but I am not tough enough to break in the steel toe on the boot . The steel toe looks like it belongs on a regular or even narrow boot . I am now the owner of $ 186 boots that were worn only 4 hours .
 Dear friends of Amazon , I am reviewing the Danner Instigator GTX Gore-Tex -LRB- uninsulated/no thinsulate etc. . . -RRB- , boots . I am military , law enforcement , and an avid hiker ... so I was expecting a boot which fit the description which Danner labeled to the letter . My Danner military boots have lasted through many battles -LRB- on and off the field -RRB- . However , BEWARE !!!! These boots , while decent quality compared to similarly priced boots on the market , are not what I 'd expected . For one thing ... Unlike the photographs ... they are by NO STRETCH of the imagination BROWN with TAN highlights !!!!! These boots are as orange as a pumpkin ! As both military -LRB- uniform -RRB- and law enforcement -LRB- uniform -RRB- requirements are very specific , I discovered that these boots ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE under any conditions to wear for duty . And then I figured , `` Well ... I 'll just keep them for hiking then ! '' But , as soon as I undid the laces , and prepared to try them on for the first time , I quickly discovered that they have a LEATHER collar around the ankle section ... . another misstatement , as DANNER claimed they had a cloth/gore-tex like material which comfortably surrounds the ankle ! Yeah right ! That 's on the outside !? It 's cloth on the outside , and leather on the inside ? HUH ? Anyone who does ANY hiking will tell you that that is a friction problem waiting to happen ! Remember those rub marks when you wore crappy boots as a kid ? So I called them to get my money back . They supposedly have a `` no questions asked '' FREE returns policy right , which was one of the reasons I 'd picked them too ! But -LRB- again -RRB- , since I 'd ordered them through the MILITARY website , they would not take them back -LRB- nor would they take them back if you got them on AMAZON either she explained -RRB- ! So , now I am stuck with a pair of boots which CAN NOT be worn with ANY clothing imaginable -LRB- unless your going as a pumpkin to the next Halloween party of course -RRB- ! Signed , Really pissed off at Danner!PS . Also bought an extra pair of the `` supposedly '' impact dampening inserts too . They were $ 16 , and no better than the cheap gel Doctor Shoel 's -LRB- however you spell it -RRB- inserts one can obtain at any drug store for $ 6 . But do n't believe me ... come on and waist your money too ! My advice is to look at customer photo 's on each site , as when one tries to take a picture of them THEY DO look brown and tan ! But when you take them out of the box in the regular light they are not ! First pair of shoes I 'd describe as functionally and visually HIDEOUS !
 I have worn these shoes less than 5 times and the leather detailing has already worn away . The shoes look cheap , not typical of the nine west brand . I would not purchase this item again . I thought I was getting a good deal but have simply added to my collection of boots that can be thrown on to do yard work .
 They look good on the screen , but in reality the leather is stiff and cheap looking . I 'm a consistent size 8M with average arches , toes , etc. . These felt too small in the toe area , and after a few minutes , my toes felt cramped , and my big toe hurt . I tried a few more times , then I ended up donating them . Not worth it .
 Definately worth the money I paid them for . But next time , I 'll buy more expensive shoes . Gave these away also .
 Amazon has misrepresented this product on their web site . It appears there is an option to buy and brown or a brown grain . I ordered the brown grain but received 2 pairs , one that looked liked brown and one that could pass for the picture of brown grain.When I checked with the actual supplier , I learned they did not offer a brown grain . When I further checked with the manufacturer , I found they did n't make a brown grain.Amazon should correct their site to quit misleading customer .
 Was disappointed with the quality of the propet shoe , but they did replace it
 I only wore Propet Village Walkers for years . For several years I could n't find them in 11.5 N in brown . -LRB- I have them in black and one ragged pair in brown . -RRB- Finally , Amazon had brown Village Walkers and I ordered 2 pair . Sadly , they did n't even come close to fitting . I held them up sole to sole with a couple of previous pairs that I have and found that they were at least 1/2 '' shorter.I 've switched to the Clark 's Tracker in 11N . The Village Walker was more comportable , but the Tracker is also comfortable after a bit of a brake-in period .
 I wear size 12 1/2 but size 13 in the Propet Men 's M4070 Village Walker was too short and the toe box was too flat rubbing against the top of my toes . The shoes looked well made and had a well cushioned sole . I returned the shoes but did not order a larger size because of the flat toe box problem .
 I live in clogs , these are not comfortable . They have a weird arching that makes my feet ache . I can wear them for a short while , but not a walk or all day . Clark 's is usually VERY comfy ... disappointed .
 This shoe was not as attractive as the picture , and they ran very small .
 Not quite the quality I was expecting from Frye . After wearing for only 2 days , the heal on the left boot was separating from the leather . These boots also seem to run quite small . Amazon was great with the return process !
 I bought these boots at a retail store in Chicago to wear on the motorcycle . They are 1 month old and have been worn perhaps a dozen times . The strap , at the top of the boot , to pull them on has failed . A call to Frye and they tell me that if I bought the boots online from them , they would pay the shipping to them for the repair . Since I bought them at a retail store I have to pay to send them back ! $ 235 dollars for a pair of boots and this is the customer service you get . The strap pulled out of it 's stitching because it is too short and has too few stitches at the point it is sewn in . I 've had Frye boots in the past and not had any problems with them . This will be the last pair of Frye I 'll buy . It 's too bad that buying American made products has become a roll of the dice .
 I wanted a large bag that would serve as a diaper bag without being a diaper bag . Bag is smaller than a `` large '' should be . Also , color is not as bright as it appears in the pictures ; is much more muted . I ended up getting the messenger bag as it is larger and it fits my needs much better .
 I had been looking for a Chelsea style boot to wear with my cropped pants in the winter . You know the ones ... Gap in funky colours . J Crew and Vince Camuto have really similar ones . I wanted something with a little weight and maybe a little detail with a nice chunky high heel . I thought these would fit the bill . Um ... No . Definite no . The height is wrong hitting right at the hemline of the pant . That would n't actually be a problem if the width of the boot shaft was narrower and therefore closer to my ankle . These were so wide I looked like Olive Oil with ridiculously skinny ankles . Ok , I have slim ankles but it is n't like they look like you could snap them like a twig . Honestly , even if they looked better on , I am not sure I would keep them . The inside flap on the zipper and the inside collar were made of the worst plastic like vinyl I have ever seen . Seriously , it looked like black electrical tape . Back they went and the hunt continues . The outside leather is pebbley . It was acceptable and if these would work for you , the fit is true to size .
 This style was really cute and looked great on however they smelled awful right out of the box !! It smelled like mothballs so unfortunately I had to send them back . . very disappointed .
 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .
 I love Adidas Superstars , and buy a pair every few years . This year it seems as though they have employed some serious cost cutting measures . These are not the same quality shoes I have been getting year after year . The leather does not even seem real , plasticy , lightweight , the rubber in the soles in now firmer with very little squish . Overall disappointed in these shoes . Will only buy in person from now on to avoid issues such as this .
 Ok , I ordered these shoes for a Christmas present for my brother . I ordered size 10 1/2 in all black color . I recieve the shoes 3 days before christmas and I go to wrap the present but I decided to open the box and check out the shoes . Not only did I get all White shoes instead of Black ones , The left shoe was a size 6 1/2 and the right shoe was a 8 1/2 . WTF ? So now I am shipping them back to them and Hopefully they get it right a second time . Would have been nice to have them right before Christmas since they were a gift . The shoes are great but I wouldnt recommend getting them from SHOEMANIA .
 A few years back -LRB- though it seems like forever ago -RRB- , I was in graduate school for anthropology . I was the studious type and had gone straight from college to grad school , so I 'd never had time for a girlfriend . Sure , I 'd had my dalliances , but when it came down to it my only sustained love was anthropology . It was Spring Break , and I 'd gotten a grant to travel to the Oaxaca region of Mexico and study the indigenous Zoque tribe . Figuring I 'd need a sturdy pair of sneakers and impressed with the rubber shell toe design , I ordered a pair of Adidas Originals Men 's Superstar II Basketball Shoes -LRB- White/Black -RRB- on Amazon . They arrived the morning of my flight.That day I flew to Mexico City and then took a bus to the city of Oaxaca , where I transferred to another bus to get to the base of Monte Alban . I then climbed Monte Alban to reach the peak , where I 'd read the Zoque tribe could be found . At this point I 'd been on my feet for nearly 16 hours , but I had nary a blister or even a foot ache to speak of . I was beginning to really like my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs . But they were caked in dirt and I was getting tired , so I decided to take a break at the summit . As I was about to wash my sneakers in a puddle of water , I heard a rustling of leaves . I looked up and all of a sudden 10 Zoque warriors were surrounding me , spears drawn . I knew a few Zoque phrases from my studies , so I told them , `` Tuk ` ay Tum , '' -LRB- `` I am your friend '' -RRB- but perhaps my dialect was off because that only enraged the warriors more . Soon , the Zoque Chieftan had his spear within an inch of my throat . At that moment , I was certain I would die right there in my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs.But just then , a female hand grabbed the spear and threw it on the ground . I looked up , and standing in the golden sunlight was the most beautiful girl I 'd ever laid eyes on . Her tawny skin glistened like a lake on a cool summer night , her jet-black hair was so soft it made horses jealous , and her eyes were like two perfect almonds . `` I Almika , '' she said , gesturing toward herelf . `` I Dan , '' I timorously replied , awestruck by her beauty . `` Why joo here ? '' Almika asked innocently . `` Study , '' I answered . `` Joo study Zuque ? '' Almika continued . I nodded in the affirmative . At this , Almika 's eyes beamed with excitement . She said something in Zuque that made the warriors lower their spears.Relieved and relaxed , I strolled with Almika toward the Zuque encampment . Between her limited English , my limited Zuque and some hand gestures , we were able to communicate with one another . I learned that she enjoyed weaving and playing traditional Zuque songs on her ocarina , and more importantly that she was looking for a man but was having trouble finding one in her tribe . It was important to her that a man be brave and strong , as many men in her tribe were , but she also wanted a man who was cultured and could show her the world beyond Monte Alban . It was clear to her that I was worldly , but in order to win her heart I knew I 'd have to prove that I was brave and strong . So that night as I fell asleep on my straw bed in the encampment , my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs still caked in dirt , I resolved to show her that I was tough.I rose early and quickly learned that the Zuque men were setting out to fetch firewood . I waved to Almika and then followed them into the woods . Fortunately , I 'd had some experience gathering wood for the fireplace at my parents ' country house in Massachusetts . So I quickly noticed the dry pieces of wood , which impressed the Zuque men . When we returned to camp at midday , I had a haul of firewood in my hands as I espied Almika roasting a cob of maize over a tiny flame . `` Better fire '' I said , and threw some of my wood onto the fire . The sudden burst of flames frightened Almika and she dropped her maize on the ground . Without flinching , I picked it up and held it near the enlarged fire . When it was perfectly crisped , I proudly handed the cob of maize back to her . Beaming , Almika bit into the maize and exclaimed `` Ees tasty ! `` The rest of the afternoon was spent helping the Zuque men fix up one of the elders ' adobes . My repair skills honed on D-I-Y projects with my Dad at our country house in Massachusetts came in handy here . I impressed the Zuque men by patching up a small hole in the roof using some Trident chewing gum I 'd brought in my backpack . When we returned to camp at dusk , the men relayed tales of my handiwork to Almika , who smiled and locked her piercing brown eyes with mine . She walked toward me and we sat on two boulders around the fire during the communal tribe dinner of rattlesnake stew , flirting and laughing all the while.As dinner was winding down , I had my arm around Almika and was about to suggest we take things to an empty hut on the periphery of the encampment . But just then , we heard the shriek of a Zuque child . I looked over and racing toward us was a gigantic jaguar galloping at full speed . Instinctively , I grabbed a bow that was lying next to me and loaded it with an arrow . I 'd learned archery at day camp near my parents ' house in Massachusetts . My parents did n't want me to go because they thought the camp was run by a bunch of ne'er - do-well Hippies , but fortunately I convinced them to let me go . I pulled the bow string back , and released . It was so dark I could barely see what had happened . But then I heard the noise - first a whisper and then a full-on chant `` Dan ! Dan ! DAN ! DAN ! DAAAAN ! '' and when I looked closely , I saw that I 'd hit the jaguar squarely between the eyes ! Almika ran up to me and gave me a bear hug . I held her and just wanted to be with her , but jaguar blood was everywhere - on my arms , on my legs , and on my already dirt-caked Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs . I told her I needed a little time to wash up , and she impishly replied , `` No too long ! '' Zuque warriors slapped me on the back as I walked to the nearby stream . I washed my face and body , then drenched my clothes in the water , and cleaned off my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs until they were gleaming white like a full moon.When I returned to the camp , nearly all of the Zoque were in their huts getting ready for bed , but Almika was waiting for me near a small fire . I ran to her and sat down on the boulder next to her . We held each others ' hands . `` Dan , joo thee man I wait for , '' Almika cooed . `` Joo smart and culture but joo also brave as Zuque warrior . '' `` And you 're the woman I 've been waiting for , Almika ! '' I exclaimed . We kissed passionately for what seemed like hours but was probably a few minutes . `` Let 's go somewhere more private , '' I suggested and Almika nodded in agreement . I took her by the hand and we walked to a fire further from the center of camp.We sat on the ground and I whispered , `` That 's better . '' She giggled . We were rolling around in the grass next to the quivering light when she whispered , `` Joor shoe hurt my foot . '' She was barefoot and my sneakers were hitting her toes . `` I 'm a little tired , why do n't you take them off for me , '' I suggested . She moved down to my feet and delicately unlaced my first shoe . Then she unlaced the second one . She pulled both sneakers off . My bare feet felt amazing on the grass . `` Put them by the fire to get them toasty , '' I directed Almika . Almika stood up and gently placed my sneakers by the fire . She was about to sit back down when she did a double-take . She was staring intently at my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs . I did n't think it odd , as it was first time she 'd seen my sneakers clean and in enough light to make them out clearly and I figured she 'd naturally be curious . But a moment later , Almika let out a blood-curdling scream that could be heard all the way in the Sierra Madres . `` RUBBER SHELL TOE ! RUBBER SHELL TOE ! '' she cried . `` What ? '' I replied , `` it 's a very sturdy construction . '' `` RUBBER SHELL TOE ! Joo no Man ! Joo a Boy ! '' she yelled . `` No , '' I implored , `` do n't you remember - I gathered the wood , I fixed the house . I even killed a jaguar ! I 'm a man ! '' She screamed , `` a Man no wear Rubber Shell Toe ! JOO A BOY ! '' and I screamed back , `` I 'M NOT A BOY ! '' but it was too late . Almika was already running to the precipice of Monte Alban . `` DAIRE EES NO MAN FOR MEEEEEE ! '' she cried and with that she threw herself off the mountain into the dark abyss below.Though I was crushed , I quickly understood that when the Zuque realized what had happened they would roast me alive , so I hurriedly put on my Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs and ran all the way down the mountain the fastest I 've ever run , tears streaming down my face . I caught a redeye bus to Oaxaca , another bus to Mexico City , and then a morning flight back to America.When I got back to campus , I was too depressed to get out of bed for a couple days . But eventually my female platonic friend Chrystal invited me to coffee and I agreed . I did n't want to wear the accursed Adidas Men 's Superstar IIs but my idiot roommate had rearranged our shared shoe rack and I could n't find my other sneakers and I was in a hurry . So I showed up at Caribou Coffee in the back of the campus bookstore and saw that Chrystal had already taken a table . I walked toward her and she stood up . `` Hey Daaaaaan ! '' Chrystal chirped , `` how was the triiiip ? '' I was about to unload my entire tale of woe on her when she offhandedly added , `` Yikes - uh , Dan ... what 's with those sneaks ? You 're not a high school mallrat in New Jersey , you 're like , an adult . Rubber shell toe - big No-No . `` And Chrystal explained to me how it was a truth universally acknowledged among the women of the world -LRB- even in the remotest corners of rural Mexico -RRB- that rubber shell toe sneakers should never be worn by any male over the age of 17 under any circumstances . I learned my lesson the hard way - by losing the love of my life . But I write this review in the hopes that other men do n't have to suffer as I suffered . And do n't go out and get the Adidas Originals Men 's Superstar II Basketball Shoe in Black - you wo n't fool anyone . It 's sometimes said that women have a Sixth Sense . This is true - they can sense when a guy is wearing a rubber shell toe sneaker , and they will run away . Sometimes they 'll keep running until there 's no ground left and the only thing beneath them is 15,000 feet of air and a bottomless void of nothingness where dreams go to die .
 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .
 those are a good shoes , but the delivery provide service is the worst , i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day , i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail , bad deal to me !

 I did n't notice it when looking at the online pictures , but these boots were the ugliest things I 've ever put on my feet , and I am no high-end shoe wearer . Honestly , they resembled those big fat moon-boot looking over-padded snow boots that anyone living in the North probably had as a kid . Thankfully , I had these shipped to work and within minutes of putting them on , I had received enough feedback to make shipping them back a no-brainer . Thank you to Amazon for allowing me to ship them back free of charge .
 My husaband had them for only a month before they came unsewn at the toes . Not a small hole but it went all the way across . And in both shoes . Not put together right . Very disappointed . To much money to fall apart !!!!!!!!
 I found these to be less than comfortable . The arch support is lacking and I had pain after wearing them for about an hour .
 This is certainly a sturdy piece of equipment . The problem is , it 's very large , much too large for women 's shoes . It 's also oddly shaped . I simply can not use it . If I ever need to slip a pair of loafers on my quarter horse , this will be really handy .
 The metal has no temper and is very soft . As you can see from the three photos that I have uploaded , how distorted the metal has become only after 2 or 3 uses . I do still use it because its all that I have but come on man ... . I think plastic would have been better than this . I am a verified purchaser , and very disappointed . For those who gave 4 & 5 stars I just do n't get it unless the intended use was for your small children .
 This would be a great product if only they polished the edges ; as it is , this thing is just stamped steel which by itself is no hit ; but the EDGES . The edges are SHARP and will cut your shoes your socks and your skin.Perhaps we 're expected to head over to a hardware store and obtain some sandpaper and polish and round off the edges?Or perhaps this is what inmates in federal penitentiaries order to file down into knives ? It would be PERFECT for this !
 Edges are cut at a sharp angle , have to be careful taking out horn not to cut the leather on shoe . would not recommend this product would rather get a wooden one instead . learn from my mistake !
 What a COMPLETE piece of crap ! The ONLY really honest review was the man who showed pictures of this soft piece of crap all bent up from intended use !!!!! IF you need too use it as an ACTUAL shoehorn , meaning putting on a pair of tight fitting shoes where you may need a slight bit of LEVERAGE , then this is NOT what you need ! This is a TYPICAL made in china piece of C R A P ! TYPICAL american sellout company hiring slave labor in china making a total piece of S H I T ! Any one dumb enough to give this positive reviews should give it time till yours looks like mine , which looks like the one in added on picture . What a TOTAL piece of garbage !
 It 's made of cheap , untempered steel that bends out of shape , and it has sharp edges that can cut your socks . Anti-recommended .

 I bought these shoes for my mom ; she has a pair that she 's about worn out . Unfortunately the replacement ones are extremely narrow . She could n't wear them even with light socks . They are very narrow in the toe and they angle in beginning quite far back .
 You must select the correct picture for this item ! I ordered this , thinking that I will get shoes with hard soles ! What a disappointment !
 Not hard soled!The sizing is n't accurate . Need to buy them a whole size smaller ! but still Cute style
 What I received is cute , fur lined , well sewn . it is true to size . I wear 9.5 , and ordered 9 in these because the first pair really was WAY too long to be an accurate 9.5 . These are snug , but think they will stretch . I have narrow feet and they are good . I did not yet contact the company about this error , so I can not say as to how they would respond . They have a thin but firm man made sole . These will be good for keeping at work when I need to slip into something more comfortable or when I drive to work in my scrumptious ACORN chinchilla slippers and forget to bring a pair fo shoes to change into -LRB- happened once ! -RRB- . Minnetonka makes very high quality products - the low score is for sending me the wrong model - not even anything close . The delivery is fast and they have good packing .
 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .

 I was sent the wrong size and Amazon refused to exchange them ; said it was my fault . I know what size shoe I wear !!!! So , now I have shoes that I can not wear . Amazon suggested that I sell them ! That is ridiculous ! Oh and I could n't return them either because they were late in arriving to me and by the time I knew they were wrong , my 30 days were expired . Amazon could not be bothered .
 I 've been wearing Chucks for years now , but the pair that I purchased from shoezoo fell apart after 2 months . The sole of the shoe completely ripped off the rest of the shoe , and I 've only used these shoes for casual walking . Pretty ridiculous .
 These shoes run so big , and the size is very confusing . I emailed to find out if I could just exchange for a smaller size , but they wo n't do that . I have to send them back , and buy another pair . No thanks .
 I bought this as a xmas gift for my brother . The size of the show was way to big so he went and exchange it .
 The service from American Athletics is poor . The shoes were the wrong size but they refused to refund the postage and wanted to charge postage again to resend the correct size . Wo n't be shopping there again .
 I love these converses , the only problem is I used the size guide and ordered a 7 which is supposed to be a uk 5 europe 38 , however I got a massive size 40 -LRB- 7 -RRB- and they do n't fit . Also I now live in London and ca n't return them . sad times : -LRB-
 Though I am very familiar with Chuck Taylor 's and their sizing , this site confused me . I ended up ordering the incorrect size and had to send them back to the company . Though the company did end up crediting my account back .
 I 've never wrote a review about any product . I 'm usually satisfied . This however kind of ticked me off . The shoe had some weird stain on it when i first saw them . they were also not the right size . I ended up giving them away .
 I love the classic style but miss the quality and durability of the Converse All Stars . I had All Stars that lasted well over five years . Some pairs I even used the soles to slow down and brake while skateboarding and they still lasted a super long time . The Converse All Stars nowadays are no where near the high quality and durability of before . Grab a pair of the high quality Converse kicks from before and compare them to the quality of today . One way to tell a high quality kick from another is the pinstripe on the sole
 These shoes look great . They are very trendy and a lot of people are wearing them nowadays . The biggest problem I have with these shoes is that they hurt my feet . The soles are too flat . When I tried running in them , my heels began to hurt . Walking wise , they are n't the most comfortable to say the least . They are also heavy for what they are . Too expensive for what they are . These shoes are probably bad for your back because they do n't absorb any impact . Personally , I do n't recommend them for anyone .
 was gon na mark this one star ... the size was miss-leading , and too large for my daughter to wear . She really , really wanted these , was soooo excited when she opened them . One full size , or more , too large , maybe men 's vs. women 's ? Miss-marked ? Now what ? There they sit in her room until I can fix the problem . But ... the quality was very nice , shipped well , all that . SO , two stars .
 They picture high tops and only write in the title that it is a converse and whatever color . Only after you order and then see the shoes listed under open purchases does it finally tell you that the item you just bought is low top . I was so upset . Deceiving and conniving company . Then you have to pay for the postage to send it back . I read an earlier review from someone who had the same problem but I thought `` hey , it only happened to one person '' Well , it happened to me too . Just be super careful and read everything.I have only just opened the box , so I do n't know how good/bad the quality is yet . The sizing is right , I am a woman 's 8 , to that is a men 's 6 . It did arrive on time and the correct color and size i selected , but I REALLY REALLY wanted the high tops . The picture was of high top shoes .
 I 'm accustomed to Dansko , Sanita , and Allegria shoes , which are all very comfortable , but require a break in period . I 'm ok with that . But these never seemed to get broken in . Maybe my feet are just used to soles on my regular brands . I 'm on my feet 9 hours a day , on concrete , walking around and up and down stairs , for several miles a day , sometimes with long periods standing -LRB- I 'm an adult-education instructor -RRB- . I have heard so many great things about chucks and really wanted a different shoe I could wear from time to time , and was hoping these would be it . I wear a 10 -LRB- 40 -RRB- in women 's and the 8.5 chucks fit my foot well -LRB- thankful I read the other reviews and knew what size to order -RRB- but they just are n't the shoe for me .
 I was very disappointed when I got this sneaker . The soles were very thin and theentire sneaker was very flimsy.I returned it but had to absorb about $ 25 in shipping costs .
 My son wore these off and on for a month when school started . Both shoes , the soles started to come off . The right one came off almost completely . Do n't know if this was just a bad pair or what but I would n't order these particular Converse shoes again .
 Nice shoe and fits great , only problem is I got the wrong color and I do n't have time to return them before I leave on vacation
 Good looking shoes , but ... after just 1 month , the glue is failing at the edge of the shoe where the foot bends . The shoe still looks perfect , but I had to use shoe goo to fix it . Seems like for the price , and for as long as this style has been around it should n't so this ?!
 Got her fast , but shoes are to big and it will cost me more money to send them back and then receive them back . There should be a note on how to order Converse . One size smaller than your original foot size . Now I am dealing with shoes that are to big .
 Watch out , Converse are 2 sizes larger than the labeled size . We ended up giving them away , my son is size 11 and they fit his size 13 friend perfectly .
 The product itself was fine but because the item was the wrong size , I had to return for a credit or an exchange . It cost almost ten dollars to return the item after originally spending about six or seven dollars for shipping and handling . If I understand your policy , and you have the correct size and ship that , I will pay another six or seven dollars for shipping . That means for a purchase of about forty dollars , I have paid almost twenty four dollars extra . I would never purchase another clothing item from -LSB- ... -RSB- .
 heard converse shoes were hard to size up . wrong no biggie still like them cant afford now . oh well not ur fault
 I was so happy to get a pair of these shoes , until the second day I had them part of the seam ripped . Go figure with the poorly made stitching . I 've never had a pear of shoes last only one day . I ca n't believe I wasted my money on this . I 've had Wal-Mart shoes last longer than these . 365 times longer than these shoes . WTF
 I ordered these shoes a week and a half ago and still have not recieved them . I do n't know how much longer I am going to have to wait . Your really better off buying them at your nearest retailer of shoes and if they dont have them ask them to order them for you . This is ridiculous . If your expecting a speedy delievery under a week this product may not be for you .
 I wore these shoes to the gym -LRB- powerlifting requires flat soles -RRB- no more than 4 times a week for 3 hours at a time . After 9 months I was sliding the heal on and the seam ripped -LRB- on the opening , between the toe and heal , inside edge -RRB- . Guess I 'll skip the lo top next time .

 Los zapatos a pesar de ser converse no salieron tan buenos , alpoco tiempo se despegaron .
 esto es un enga & ntilde ; o , yo hab&iacute;a comprado un par de color blanco y otro par de color azul pero el vendedor envi&oacute; los dos pares de zapatos de color blanco ! ademas dudo que sean originales puesto que el material se ve de baja calidad .

 Good looking shoes , but ... after just 1 month , the glue is failing at the edge of the shoe where the foot bends . The shoe still looks perfect , but I had to use shoe goo to fix it . Seems like for the price , and for as long as this style has been around it should n't so this ?!
 Nice shoe and fits great , only problem is I got the wrong color and I do n't have time to return them before I leave on vacation
 My son wore these off and on for a month when school started . Both shoes , the soles started to come off . The right one came off almost completely . Do n't know if this was just a bad pair or what but I would n't order these particular Converse shoes again .
 was gon na mark this one star ... the size was miss-leading , and too large for my daughter to wear . She really , really wanted these , was soooo excited when she opened them . One full size , or more , too large , maybe men 's vs. women 's ? Miss-marked ? Now what ? There they sit in her room until I can fix the problem . But ... the quality was very nice , shipped well , all that . SO , two stars .
 They picture high tops and only write in the title that it is a converse and whatever color . Only after you order and then see the shoes listed under open purchases does it finally tell you that the item you just bought is low top . I was so upset . Deceiving and conniving company . Then you have to pay for the postage to send it back . I read an earlier review from someone who had the same problem but I thought `` hey , it only happened to one person '' Well , it happened to me too . Just be super careful and read everything.I have only just opened the box , so I do n't know how good/bad the quality is yet . The sizing is right , I am a woman 's 8 , to that is a men 's 6 . It did arrive on time and the correct color and size i selected , but I REALLY REALLY wanted the high tops . The picture was of high top shoes .
 I was very disappointed when I got this sneaker . The soles were very thin and theentire sneaker was very flimsy.I returned it but had to absorb about $ 25 in shipping costs .
 I love the classic style but miss the quality and durability of the Converse All Stars . I had All Stars that lasted well over five years . Some pairs I even used the soles to slow down and brake while skateboarding and they still lasted a super long time . The Converse All Stars nowadays are no where near the high quality and durability of before . Grab a pair of the high quality Converse kicks from before and compare them to the quality of today . One way to tell a high quality kick from another is the pinstripe on the sole
 I love these converses , the only problem is I used the size guide and ordered a 7 which is supposed to be a uk 5 europe 38 , however I got a massive size 40 -LRB- 7 -RRB- and they do n't fit . Also I now live in London and ca n't return them . sad times : -LRB-
 These shoes run so big , and the size is very confusing . I emailed to find out if I could just exchange for a smaller size , but they wo n't do that . I have to send them back , and buy another pair . No thanks .
 I 've never wrote a review about any product . I 'm usually satisfied . This however kind of ticked me off . The shoe had some weird stain on it when i first saw them . they were also not the right size . I ended up giving them away .
 Though I am very familiar with Chuck Taylor 's and their sizing , this site confused me . I ended up ordering the incorrect size and had to send them back to the company . Though the company did end up crediting my account back .
 Watch out , Converse are 2 sizes larger than the labeled size . We ended up giving them away , my son is size 11 and they fit his size 13 friend perfectly .
 The product itself was fine but because the item was the wrong size , I had to return for a credit or an exchange . It cost almost ten dollars to return the item after originally spending about six or seven dollars for shipping and handling . If I understand your policy , and you have the correct size and ship that , I will pay another six or seven dollars for shipping . That means for a purchase of about forty dollars , I have paid almost twenty four dollars extra . I would never purchase another clothing item from -LSB- ... -RSB- .
 I 'm accustomed to Dansko , Sanita , and Allegria shoes , which are all very comfortable , but require a break in period . I 'm ok with that . But these never seemed to get broken in . Maybe my feet are just used to soles on my regular brands . I 'm on my feet 9 hours a day , on concrete , walking around and up and down stairs , for several miles a day , sometimes with long periods standing -LRB- I 'm an adult-education instructor -RRB- . I have heard so many great things about chucks and really wanted a different shoe I could wear from time to time , and was hoping these would be it . I wear a 10 -LRB- 40 -RRB- in women 's and the 8.5 chucks fit my foot well -LRB- thankful I read the other reviews and knew what size to order -RRB- but they just are n't the shoe for me .
 I bought this as a xmas gift for my brother . The size of the show was way to big so he went and exchange it .
 I 've been wearing Chucks for years now , but the pair that I purchased from shoezoo fell apart after 2 months . The sole of the shoe completely ripped off the rest of the shoe , and I 've only used these shoes for casual walking . Pretty ridiculous .
 The service from American Athletics is poor . The shoes were the wrong size but they refused to refund the postage and wanted to charge postage again to resend the correct size . Wo n't be shopping there again .
 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .

 heard converse shoes were hard to size up . wrong no biggie still like them cant afford now . oh well not ur fault
 I was so happy to get a pair of these shoes , until the second day I had them part of the seam ripped . Go figure with the poorly made stitching . I 've never had a pear of shoes last only one day . I ca n't believe I wasted my money on this . I 've had Wal-Mart shoes last longer than these . 365 times longer than these shoes . WTF

 I ordered these shoes a week and a half ago and still have not recieved them . I do n't know how much longer I am going to have to wait . Your really better off buying them at your nearest retailer of shoes and if they dont have them ask them to order them for you . This is ridiculous . If your expecting a speedy delievery under a week this product may not be for you .
 These shoes look great . They are very trendy and a lot of people are wearing them nowadays . The biggest problem I have with these shoes is that they hurt my feet . The soles are too flat . When I tried running in them , my heels began to hurt . Walking wise , they are n't the most comfortable to say the least . They are also heavy for what they are . Too expensive for what they are . These shoes are probably bad for your back because they do n't absorb any impact . Personally , I do n't recommend them for anyone .

 Although these flip flops look very nice , the toe bed is too long , I end up catching them on stairs and such , ca n't even consider wearing them at a rocky beach I 'd be flat on my face . The width is also for a narrow foot , the straps are tight ... If I had n't worn them , I would have sent them back .
 These sandals were ordered in a size 10 , and they did not fit . I went into a store that sells them here and tried on a different style of reef sandals and they fit perfectly ... I do n't know why these did n't fit , but they were very uncomfortable because of that !! I gave them to someone else , who wears 9 1/2 and they fit her fine ... I would recommend ordering a size up if possible ...
 Do not buy this product . I bought it in good faith and my feet are all covered in shoebites . I have thrown the original box always so I m stuck with it but let me tell u it 's not even a week and it 's dreadful
 Based on previous reviews , I purchased this and after wearing them for the whole summer I have to say I am a bit disappointed because they lack enough shock support for just general walking around & shopping . By the end of the day , your feet will hurt . I have a different pair of flip flops made by Crocs which I bought at a shoe warehouse that have the same thickness but with a much better shock absorption than the Reef sandals . Must have a different composition . As a bonus , the Crocs have tiny knobs on their sandals ' foot bed which does make walking in them feel good to the skin , and at the end of the day in those , my feet do n't hurt as much as if I 'd spent the day in the Reefs .
 I like the feel of this shoe since it is cushiony but where the back strap is attached to shoe it is bulky and very uncomfortable on my foot and I do n't have picky feet.I hate returning things so they will sit in my closet until I get rid of them which is a shame because they are nice shoes but not worth having blisters on my feet : -LRB-
 I had yet to find a Reef sandal I did n't like , until this one . The straps of the sandals are attached really far back on the foot bed . So far , that when I walk , it pushes on my arch . I 've also noticed that when I walk my toes start to hurt after a while . I do n't know if that has anything to do with the way the strap is pushing on my arch or what . I was hoping for more cushion as well . I am really disappointed with this sandal . I 'll wear it to the mailbox , etc. but I 'll keep looking for another all-day sandal . I am a size 7 .
 I own a pair of reefs other than these . Bought both the Black & Brown . If you want a flip flop to bum around the house with , these are ok . But do n't expect to get any sort of support if you plan to walk around for a long time they will hurt your feet . For the money not worth the brand name .
 Took over a month to get product.Think compensation should be given when you ar guaranteed to get the product by a certain date .
 The website said size 6 Mens , the shoes were size 6 Womens , and the return process was designed so that i could n't actually return them for shoes in the right size .
 I 'm very disappointed as this shoe must have some undisclosed latex in it . It was comfy true , but that does me little good !
 I 'm size 7 and this feels like size 6.5 . The front tho . . seemed right length but the back seems a bit short , and the straps were too tight . Not sure if the straps would be comfortable even if it was n't tight tho ... The sole padding feels just ok but the material they use should be questioned ... I dont think its comfortable on the skin at all . And its true the bottom can be slippery coz it 's pretty much flat . I do n't think it 's worth the money . If it was $ 13 bux I would get an exchange for a bigger size.My questions is why the hell do these companies make sandals that are uncomfortable and charge us what it 's to worth ??? That is plain stupid . It is OBVIOUS they didnt use a shoe model ... Thank god for amazon tho I can just get a refund hassle free .
 Is not true to size , a 9 is more like an 8 1/2 and the straps ride really really weird ...
 These sandals are pretty . That 's the only good thing I can say . Their shape is VERY weird . The sandal is VERY long from the toe piece forward and sticks out way beyond my toes . Then the shoe is way too short from the instep back . The straps are twisted and dig into my instep and the sides are taller than the middle . I 've worn flip flops all my life . I do n't know how this manufacturer thinks they can charge almost $ 20 for a shoe like this .
 I ordered these flip flops in blue and in black . The black pair fits well and are comfortable ... The blue pair are the worst flip flops ever ! They hurt my feet and feel too small ... I 'm not sure how the same shoe can have two different fits ! I love reefs and have been wearing them year round for 15 years now but I am very disapointed in these .
 I will never buy anything from this company again . I bought these shoes for furture daughter in-law 's wedding , they were not what she wanted , we returned have to pay shipping both way and a restocking charge . Boy they are reaaly making money off customers .
 These shoes look great but slip on the heel making them very uncomfortable . Perhaps the toe box is too large . I returned my pair before going out of my apartment with them.linda b
 I was recommended to purchase a Ryka water shoe . I chose the slip-on hoping to save myself some money . Unfortunately the shoe was way too tight , so much that my feet cramped almost immediately and I had to finish my water aerobic class barefooted . Now I have shipped them back and will have to spend the extra bucks for the tie type . I will still purchase the Ryka water shoe - it is awesome .
 I have owned three pair of these boots over the past 11 years . Each of the first two were extremely well built and lasted over 4 years of daily use . The current pair is less than 3 years old and the sole on one boot has cracked . There is no fix for a cracked sole . The leather uppers have been kept well conditioned , and are in great shape . Because the sole is cracked , the boots are worthless . Save your money and look for a different brand boot .
 had a hard time using this thing . first it tore the loop off my tie trying to fit it in the clip , then it cut my button off the shirt sliding up and down the shirt . I went back to using my tie bar and tack .
 This has two clips at 90 degrees to each other . One goes on the little loop on the back of the tie , to other goes on your shirt . The part that goes on my shirt always falls off , so this has n't really worked out for me .
 The tie lock is difficult to use . The spring clip is so tight and small that I have trouble getting it open for the tie or the shirt . I have tried to use it three times now and gave up on it because I became frustrated with getting both sides of the clip attached .
 I was looking for tie tack under accessories . I came across this thing along with tie chainRope Style Tie Chain for Men , `` the tie thing '' The Tie Thing Tie Stay by Necktie Accessories - White Cotton , `` Tiedown '' which is a clear plastic alternative to the cloth `` the tie thing `` Tiedown , the Alternative to Tie Tacks and Tie Barsand offcource my original search tie tack Sterling Silver Knot Tie Tack . Although Tiedown and the tie thing are MUCH cheaper -LRB- and comes in a very cheap package -RRB- , they work better and are useable on a daily bases . On the other hand this Tie Lock is VERY diffecult to attach on both the shirt and on the tie . It is very fiddely and has a great potential to damage both parts of dressing as mentioned by a previous reviewer on Amazon.Save your money . Either go for the low cost `` the tie thing '' The Tie Thing Tie Stay by Necktie Accessories - White Cotton , or its alternative in clear plastic `` Tiedown `` Tiedown , the Alternative to Tie Tacks and Tie Barsthis will give you functionality or spend more and go for style using tie chainRope Style Tie Chain for Menor tie tack Sterling Silver Knot Tie Tack .
 These shoes look great on my shoe shelf , but are so uncomfortable that I 've never actually worn them . The edges of the leather feel sharp and cut into my feet even though the size itself feels correct .
 This shoe peeled my heel 's skin off and it gives me blisters . I would not recommend this shoe at all . Stay away !
 Unfortunately , the back of the shoe digs hard into my achilles tendon . Too painful , even with thick socks .
 I bought these a while ago . After wearing them for above a month averaging approximately 3 days a week , the stitching started to fall apart . Especially at the crease points where you bend your foot as you walk . For $ 30 , I was expecting the shoes to last at least 6 months ... very cheap quality .
 The picture of the product was black . I received brown shoes with a scuff in the leather already . Not satisfied .
 First , they tore through my ankles . When they finally broke in , they literally BROKE . Within 6 weeks , the entire heal of the right shoe nearly tore right off . Quite embarrassing . You get what you pay for !! Do n't bother with these shoes !!!!
 These shoes tore up the back of my heel to the point that I was limping around by the end of the first day wearing these .
 These shoes are cute but I ordered my regular size and they seemed a half size bigger and were very wide .
 I will never buy anything from this company again . I bought these shoes for furture daughter in-law 's wedding , they were not what she wanted , we returned have to pay shipping both way and a restocking charge . Boy they are reaaly making money off customers .
 I ordered a larger size of these slippers and still could n't wear them . Too bad , 'cause they were a great deal .
 This was such a cute shoe in the photo . But I was so surprised when I tried it on that it felt terrible . It cut into my foot , and the shoe 's shape on my foot was unattractive . I think it was the only uncomfortable Clarks shoe I 've ever tried on .
 I ordered these shoes and up to now have never received the shoes . This is my worst experience ever online . I have written emails and up to date have not seen a replied from the company . I have written to Amazon in hopes of a refund or I will not purchase anything from Amazon again . My husband Richard Munro and I shop on Amazon on a regular basis and I am very disappointed in this Yshop being advertise on their site . Since I ordered my shoes I have seen tons of negative feedback about this particular store and Amazon have made all the products this store offered currently unavailable so no one else can place order with them but in the meantime I still havent gotten a refund and I will not order anything else on here unless I do . Its the principle of the whole thing . People should not be this dishonest .
 Brought this and less than two months later the strap broke . Went to shop repair to get it glue back in but then a week later the clasp broke ! Just poorly made . My last shoes -LRB- different brand -RRB- last me at least whole year . Probably not worth it to get it repair .
 I purchased Wine Red color in this last year . I have got compliments on how cute it looks all along ; however only I know that after wearing it for one whole season , it still bites on the edge where the shoe ends near the bow . If I could I would return this shoe and get something more comfy .
 El vendedor debe revisar las opciones , Me enviaron unos calzados de recien nacidos y seleccione uno de ninos , mi hijo esta muy molesto .
 too bad the company was wrong in sending the size and they sent me to buy baby shoes for teens hurts that can not return
 this item was out of stock when i ordered and i was never notified when it or if it came back into stock . it 's a shame too , my grandson was really looking forward to getting them .
 Got totally wrong shoe with the order , that sorta sucked . Were 12 bucks so I just gave it to my cousin instead of going through the return process and having them mess up again .
 the shoes LOOKED nice when i got them -- unfortunately the tongue came out of the right shoe 2 days after i got them . no way to return them since they were worn and no way to repair them ... BOTTOM LINE - i 'll stick to NEW BALANCE shoes bought locally from now on . i have 3 pairs of NB shoes and all of them have held up much better than the Reeboks ... if there were a way to rate these shoes at ZERO stars , i 'd have done it
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .
 I 've never wrote a review about any product . I 'm usually satisfied . This however kind of ticked me off . The shoe had some weird stain on it when i first saw them . they were also not the right size . I ended up giving them away .
 Though I am very familiar with Chuck Taylor 's and their sizing , this site confused me . I ended up ordering the incorrect size and had to send them back to the company . Though the company did end up crediting my account back .
 Watch out , Converse are 2 sizes larger than the labeled size . We ended up giving them away , my son is size 11 and they fit his size 13 friend perfectly .
 The product itself was fine but because the item was the wrong size , I had to return for a credit or an exchange . It cost almost ten dollars to return the item after originally spending about six or seven dollars for shipping and handling . If I understand your policy , and you have the correct size and ship that , I will pay another six or seven dollars for shipping . That means for a purchase of about forty dollars , I have paid almost twenty four dollars extra . I would never purchase another clothing item from -LSB- ... -RSB- .
 These shoes run so big , and the size is very confusing . I emailed to find out if I could just exchange for a smaller size , but they wo n't do that . I have to send them back , and buy another pair . No thanks .
 The service from American Athletics is poor . The shoes were the wrong size but they refused to refund the postage and wanted to charge postage again to resend the correct size . Wo n't be shopping there again .
 I 've been wearing Chucks for years now , but the pair that I purchased from shoezoo fell apart after 2 months . The sole of the shoe completely ripped off the rest of the shoe , and I 've only used these shoes for casual walking . Pretty ridiculous .
 I love the classic style but miss the quality and durability of the Converse All Stars . I had All Stars that lasted well over five years . Some pairs I even used the soles to slow down and brake while skateboarding and they still lasted a super long time . The Converse All Stars nowadays are no where near the high quality and durability of before . Grab a pair of the high quality Converse kicks from before and compare them to the quality of today . One way to tell a high quality kick from another is the pinstripe on the sole
 I 'm accustomed to Dansko , Sanita , and Allegria shoes , which are all very comfortable , but require a break in period . I 'm ok with that . But these never seemed to get broken in . Maybe my feet are just used to soles on my regular brands . I 'm on my feet 9 hours a day , on concrete , walking around and up and down stairs , for several miles a day , sometimes with long periods standing -LRB- I 'm an adult-education instructor -RRB- . I have heard so many great things about chucks and really wanted a different shoe I could wear from time to time , and was hoping these would be it . I wear a 10 -LRB- 40 -RRB- in women 's and the 8.5 chucks fit my foot well -LRB- thankful I read the other reviews and knew what size to order -RRB- but they just are n't the shoe for me .
 I was very disappointed when I got this sneaker . The soles were very thin and theentire sneaker was very flimsy.I returned it but had to absorb about $ 25 in shipping costs .
 I bought this as a xmas gift for my brother . The size of the show was way to big so he went and exchange it .
 I love these converses , the only problem is I used the size guide and ordered a 7 which is supposed to be a uk 5 europe 38 , however I got a massive size 40 -LRB- 7 -RRB- and they do n't fit . Also I now live in London and ca n't return them . sad times : -LRB-
 My son wore these off and on for a month when school started . Both shoes , the soles started to come off . The right one came off almost completely . Do n't know if this was just a bad pair or what but I would n't order these particular Converse shoes again .
 I wore these shoes to the gym -LRB- powerlifting requires flat soles -RRB- no more than 4 times a week for 3 hours at a time . After 9 months I was sliding the heal on and the seam ripped -LRB- on the opening , between the toe and heal , inside edge -RRB- . Guess I 'll skip the lo top next time .
 heard converse shoes were hard to size up . wrong no biggie still like them cant afford now . oh well not ur fault
 I was so happy to get a pair of these shoes , until the second day I had them part of the seam ripped . Go figure with the poorly made stitching . I 've never had a pear of shoes last only one day . I ca n't believe I wasted my money on this . I 've had Wal-Mart shoes last longer than these . 365 times longer than these shoes . WTF
 I ordered these shoes a week and a half ago and still have not recieved them . I do n't know how much longer I am going to have to wait . Your really better off buying them at your nearest retailer of shoes and if they dont have them ask them to order them for you . This is ridiculous . If your expecting a speedy delievery under a week this product may not be for you .
 These shoes look great . They are very trendy and a lot of people are wearing them nowadays . The biggest problem I have with these shoes is that they hurt my feet . The soles are too flat . When I tried running in them , my heels began to hurt . Walking wise , they are n't the most comfortable to say the least . They are also heavy for what they are . Too expensive for what they are . These shoes are probably bad for your back because they do n't absorb any impact . Personally , I do n't recommend them for anyone .
 Good looking shoes , but ... after just 1 month , the glue is failing at the edge of the shoe where the foot bends . The shoe still looks perfect , but I had to use shoe goo to fix it . Seems like for the price , and for as long as this style has been around it should n't so this ?!
 Got her fast , but shoes are to big and it will cost me more money to send them back and then receive them back . There should be a note on how to order Converse . One size smaller than your original foot size . Now I am dealing with shoes that are to big .
 was gon na mark this one star ... the size was miss-leading , and too large for my daughter to wear . She really , really wanted these , was soooo excited when she opened them . One full size , or more , too large , maybe men 's vs. women 's ? Miss-marked ? Now what ? There they sit in her room until I can fix the problem . But ... the quality was very nice , shipped well , all that . SO , two stars .
 They picture high tops and only write in the title that it is a converse and whatever color . Only after you order and then see the shoes listed under open purchases does it finally tell you that the item you just bought is low top . I was so upset . Deceiving and conniving company . Then you have to pay for the postage to send it back . I read an earlier review from someone who had the same problem but I thought `` hey , it only happened to one person '' Well , it happened to me too . Just be super careful and read everything.I have only just opened the box , so I do n't know how good/bad the quality is yet . The sizing is right , I am a woman 's 8 , to that is a men 's 6 . It did arrive on time and the correct color and size i selected , but I REALLY REALLY wanted the high tops . The picture was of high top shoes .
 Although these shoes are wider in the toe area they still feel tight and they pinch . I hope that they will stretch a little . I have never had `` break in '' issues with my other Clarks . I have several pairs of Clarks and these shoes are not even close to being as comfortable as my others . Also , they do not look as cute on as they do off . When I am wearing them it looks like I am wearing a cowboy boot . I paid a lot for shipping or I would probably send these back .
 I do n't know . They look weird , the sole 's soooo different from my other converse !!! Buuu
 I was pretty disappointed with the store when I opened the shoe box and found two right shoes in different shades of blue . It took some time but they did refund me for the purchase and told me to throw the shoes away because they `` did n't know anyone that could use two right shoes '' .
 I ordered the ` dazzling blue ' low tops because I fell in love with the color . Not to mention , they were VERY fairly priced . They came in a day early . Which , I was extremely pleased about . But , they managed to send me a size 10 in mens . I ordered a size 6 mens/8 womens . So , they are not one , not two , BUT FOUR SIZES TOO BIG . I loved the color , and the price , and the shipping time . I was extremely disappointed in the size . Four sizes is a bit ridiculous . One or two is n't as bad . For such a horrible mistake , they are NOT getting 3 stars .
 The shoes came really fast but they were not the ones that I ordered . I ordered the black and white chucks and when I opened the box , they were completely black . There was not enough time to call and complain to get the correct ones .
 Ordered for a Christmas gift and never received it . I do not recommend this seller . Never responded to any of my emails until after I asked for my money back .
 nike bought converse . they raised the price and lowered the quality . ive been wearing chucks for 25 plus years and can say with certainty that stitching has been removed and rubber/glue cheapened . these new chinese made nike chucks fall apart fast . they are no longer a long lasting shoe . but they still look cool .
 I know chucks have weird sizing , and so a women 's 8 is a men 's 6 and so forth , but the size chart given here is idiotic . There are literally about 50 different sizes listed in the item details , with M -LRB- D -RRB- and all sorts of other inscrutable nomenclature next to each size . Maybe this reseller should take a hint from the converse website which has SIZE/CONVERSE SIZE -LRB- women 's 8/converse 6 -RRB- so the customer can have a chance of ordering the right size .
 I am , and always have been a Chuck Taylor fan . I am a 39 yr old mom of 5 and at one point or another , someone in my home owns a pair . My 16 yr old son wanted a pair of hi-top Chuck Taylors for Christmas . The picture of the `` unbleached '' pair , looked white , so I purchased them . When the box arrived , I wrapped it and placed it under the tree . Can you imagine my disappointment -LRB- and most importantly , my son 's -RRB- , when he opened the box and inside there was a yellowish stained pair of Chuck 's ? DO NOT BUY This `` unbleached '' color unless you want a yellow pair of sneakers.For the first time , sizing was as issue , as well . Runs almost a whole size larger .
 I did not get what I wanted . They sent me different color . So , I returned it .
 I have gotten these runners for my sons for over 10 years . They love the colors , light feeling , and comfort of these Converse shoes . They are also not `` ones for leather '' so these fit their tastes perfectly and they are washable . I would not recommend them for gymnastics or physical education classes because they are not made for that type of activity but they are comfortable for walking !
 these shoes are classics and I ca n't fault the style . My son actually wore them for a wedding -LRB- with suit and all -RRB- , however , they run large -LRB- long -RRB- and had to be sent back . I found them at the last minute at a local store in the right size . We ordered the 12 but he ended up buying 10.5 . It cost me $ 12.50 to send them back so it was kind of an expensive mistake . Always get free return shipping where you order . Just saying .
 if you want to be liked dont pick these there are so 5 years ago i wouldnt reccomend these to humans
 Product never showed up . Also , never got a reply from the seller when e-mailing them . No problem getting a full refund from Amazon however .
 Watch out for selecting the converse black shoe , it displays a low top but may in fact be a hi top , be sure in the cart .
 I purchased Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars because they were strong durable shoes . However , these shoes started to come apart less then three weeks after purchase . The eyelets tore loose from the canvass material , I was shocked and in disbelief . Never in years past do I remember any shoe coming apart in so little time . Maybe just this pair was manufactured incorrectly ? Now I have the joy of sending them back . I did hear from the company who sold them to me through Amazon although as yet they have not responded to my basic questions , not sure why the hesitation . I am sure we will get through this but in the mean while I am without footwear .
 I have worn these things since high school and the quality was much better when they were made in the USA . The glue doesnt seem to hold up as well and the canvas is not as tough . I do n't know if it is inflation or what , but why are these shoes 50 bucks ? The whole reason they were great back in the day , was they were half the cost of the other shoes and twice as comfortable .
 By the time we got the shoes and tried them on , went to return , and they did n't have them in the correct size he needed . So we are having to return them and my husband is left chuck-less . Perks
 Upon receiving the shoe , they look just like my other converse shoes . I expected them to be made in China . They looked real ... but upon very close inspection , I noticed that the white rubber toe part is rounder and bigger . The real converses ' are pointier and smaller . The material also feels cheaper . Another dead give away was the color . The navy blue in the converse stores I went into were a truly dark navy blue color . This one is more of a faded navy blue . There are tons of fake converse out there , some look almost like the real thing . I suppose you just really have to do your homework and probably not buy online unless from the actual converse website . Hey , maybe even the seller did n't know . Like I said , no one would be able to tell these are fakes by the looks of it , but I still give it a 2 becuase I paid the amount of what a real converse would cost and I think it is my duty to let other consumers know . I suppose these 'll fall apart within a year .
 Image shows Purple HI TOPS , but when you order ... you get LO tops . Also , items that say ` qualifies for super saver shipping ! ' they 're not . So unless you are ok with lo tops when you want hi tops ... do n't fall for it !
 We ordered the Chuck Taylor All Star Hi-Tops with the white soles and laces . What we received was the all black shoes . That 's not the picture that went with the order we placed .
 i love the converse , but not the store , i have a big problem i made a mistake and they did n't help , now i have two pair of the same color , i and nobody size like me .
 My order was in wrong size because of amazon.com had wrong size convertion chart!A - Z guarantee does n`t help me . I ` m out of country ! They sad that I have to ship my order back , but as I sad I ` m out of country ! Who ` ll pay shipment , me ?! YES ! They sad I have to pay shipment if I ` m out of country ! No help , no order anymore !
 Grew up in Chucks and love the look -- the coolest one ever . Decided to try a pair again -LRB- am over 60 now -RRB- but found them painful -- like a slab of wood tied to my feet . What we need are geezer Chucks with cushioning ! Converse , are you listening ?
 I ordered this item two weeks ago . I ordered a size 11 and got a 7.5 . Went through the hassle of getting a refund , repackaging and shipping the item . Then I ordered a new pair after being assured that I would receive the right size . However ONCE AGAIN THE SHOES ARRIVED IN A SIZE 7.5 . This is ridiculous . Please beware , do n't waste your time .
 the shipping time was great , but they sent me low tops instead of high tops . they said if i send them back they 'll send me the right ones but i should n't have to , they should 've got it right the first time .
 I ordered the standard Black shoes , but instead received the Black Monochrome ones which were n't even listed as being available in my size .
 the shoes LOOKED nice when i got them -- unfortunately the tongue came out of the right shoe 2 days after i got them . no way to return them since they were worn and no way to repair them ... BOTTOM LINE - i 'll stick to NEW BALANCE shoes bought locally from now on . i have 3 pairs of NB shoes and all of them have held up much better than the Reeboks ... if there were a way to rate these shoes at ZERO stars , i 'd have done it
 I found the shoes too heavy for tennis . The cover over the laces made it difficult to pull the laces tight . I cut off the cover and that made it better . The advertisement on the back of one of the shoes came off which was n't a functional part of the shoe so it did n't matter . The strip is still on the other shoe . I would n't buy this shoe style again . I bought it through Amazon and had not tried it on before purchase . Barbara Reynolds
 Is not true to size , a 9 is more like an 8 1/2 and the straps ride really really weird ...
 These sandals are pretty . That 's the only good thing I can say . Their shape is VERY weird . The sandal is VERY long from the toe piece forward and sticks out way beyond my toes . Then the shoe is way too short from the instep back . The straps are twisted and dig into my instep and the sides are taller than the middle . I 've worn flip flops all my life . I do n't know how this manufacturer thinks they can charge almost $ 20 for a shoe like this .
 I ordered these flip flops in blue and in black . The black pair fits well and are comfortable ... The blue pair are the worst flip flops ever ! They hurt my feet and feel too small ... I 'm not sure how the same shoe can have two different fits ! I love reefs and have been wearing them year round for 15 years now but I am very disapointed in these .
 These sandals were ordered in a size 10 , and they did not fit . I went into a store that sells them here and tried on a different style of reef sandals and they fit perfectly ... I do n't know why these did n't fit , but they were very uncomfortable because of that !! I gave them to someone else , who wears 9 1/2 and they fit her fine ... I would recommend ordering a size up if possible ...
 Do not buy this product . I bought it in good faith and my feet are all covered in shoebites . I have thrown the original box always so I m stuck with it but let me tell u it 's not even a week and it 's dreadful
 Although these flip flops look very nice , the toe bed is too long , I end up catching them on stairs and such , ca n't even consider wearing them at a rocky beach I 'd be flat on my face . The width is also for a narrow foot , the straps are tight ... If I had n't worn them , I would have sent them back .
 Took over a month to get product.Think compensation should be given when you ar guaranteed to get the product by a certain date .
 The website said size 6 Mens , the shoes were size 6 Womens , and the return process was designed so that i could n't actually return them for shoes in the right size .
 I 'm very disappointed as this shoe must have some undisclosed latex in it . It was comfy true , but that does me little good !
 I own a pair of reefs other than these . Bought both the Black & Brown . If you want a flip flop to bum around the house with , these are ok . But do n't expect to get any sort of support if you plan to walk around for a long time they will hurt your feet . For the money not worth the brand name .
 Based on previous reviews , I purchased this and after wearing them for the whole summer I have to say I am a bit disappointed because they lack enough shock support for just general walking around & shopping . By the end of the day , your feet will hurt . I have a different pair of flip flops made by Crocs which I bought at a shoe warehouse that have the same thickness but with a much better shock absorption than the Reef sandals . Must have a different composition . As a bonus , the Crocs have tiny knobs on their sandals ' foot bed which does make walking in them feel good to the skin , and at the end of the day in those , my feet do n't hurt as much as if I 'd spent the day in the Reefs .
 I like the feel of this shoe since it is cushiony but where the back strap is attached to shoe it is bulky and very uncomfortable on my foot and I do n't have picky feet.I hate returning things so they will sit in my closet until I get rid of them which is a shame because they are nice shoes but not worth having blisters on my feet : -LRB-
 I had yet to find a Reef sandal I did n't like , until this one . The straps of the sandals are attached really far back on the foot bed . So far , that when I walk , it pushes on my arch . I 've also noticed that when I walk my toes start to hurt after a while . I do n't know if that has anything to do with the way the strap is pushing on my arch or what . I was hoping for more cushion as well . I am really disappointed with this sandal . I 'll wear it to the mailbox , etc. but I 'll keep looking for another all-day sandal . I am a size 7 .
 I 'm size 7 and this feels like size 6.5 . The front tho . . seemed right length but the back seems a bit short , and the straps were too tight . Not sure if the straps would be comfortable even if it was n't tight tho ... The sole padding feels just ok but the material they use should be questioned ... I dont think its comfortable on the skin at all . And its true the bottom can be slippery coz it 's pretty much flat . I do n't think it 's worth the money . If it was $ 13 bux I would get an exchange for a bigger size.My questions is why the hell do these companies make sandals that are uncomfortable and charge us what it 's to worth ??? That is plain stupid . It is OBVIOUS they didnt use a shoe model ... Thank god for amazon tho I can just get a refund hassle free .
 Los zapatos llegaron en muy malas condiciones . Se podia apreciar con facilidad que los zapatos estaban usados .
 I want to return that item because I received a wrong size . Since now i did n't have a chance to contact to the seller , I hope someone can help me to change this item with the right size that I ordered . By the way I ordered size 11 and got something like size 9 .
 NO PUEDO EMITIR OPINION ALGUNAPORQUE ESTA MERCANCIA NUNCA ME LLEGO , QUISIERA QUE SI LA LLEGARA A COMPRARALGUN DIA ME LA ENVIARAN POR UPS O FEDEX YQUE CUANDO LLEGUE A VENEZUELA SECONECTE AQUI CON DOMESA , ZOOM O MRW.GRACIAS
 size runs bigger than the average boot . they are too big nothing I do helps . This was a total waste of money for me .
 The shoes themselves are comfortable and good looking for casual wear , however they are not as advertised on amazon . I am a vegetarian and was on a hunt for a reasonably priced pair of good looking casual shoes that are made of synthetic materials only and I came upon these Deertags by typing vegetarian shoes into the search engine . They say manmade in description , but low in behold I order them and look at the stiched tag on the inside and yes their upper is partially made of leather . What a waste of time for anyone looking not to where animal skin on their feet !!! Otherwise buy them .
 After reading contradictory reviews on the materials used for this shoe , I contacted Deer Stag directly to inquire whether or not it is made of genuine leather . E. Philips is correct , this shoe , and all of the Deer Stag line is made of genuine leather . However , the Soft Stag line has a similar looking shoe called the Tremor that is made of synthetic materials . I will gladly remove my 1 star review once the description on this shoe has been changed -LRB- which will hopefully be soon since I contacted amazon customer service -RRB- .

 I wore these shoes to the gym -LRB- powerlifting requires flat soles -RRB- no more than 4 times a week for 3 hours at a time . After 9 months I was sliding the heal on and the seam ripped -LRB- on the opening , between the toe and heal , inside edge -RRB- . Guess I 'll skip the lo top next time .
 Nice shoe and fits great , only problem is I got the wrong color and I do n't have time to return them before I leave on vacation
 My son wore these off and on for a month when school started . Both shoes , the soles started to come off . The right one came off almost completely . Do n't know if this was just a bad pair or what but I would n't order these particular Converse shoes again .
 The shoe itself looks great -LRB- if you do n't touch it , that is -RRB- . When I unvelcroed the shoe , the velcro strap looked as if it had been velcroed and unvelcroed many times . After that initial unstrapping of the velcro , it had made the leather strap look worn . My son had not even tried it on and it looked used .
 These shoes looked so nice in the pictures ; but are a POS in reality . Well , maybe they are not that bad . But still I decided to never again buy shoes online . Would try the red ones though .
 Nothing went right with my order . The shipping was ridiculous on such a small item - I believe it was as much as the keychain I ordered . It took weeks longer to get this order than anything else I had ordered at the same time , and when I finally got the keychain , it was the wrong one ! I 've kept the keychain because I ca n't be bothered trying to get this fixed , but I wo n't be using this business again .
 I need black confortable shoes to work . I am a waitress and I have to walk non-stop , sometimes for 12 hours . I used to wear Reebok Princess Sneakers but with new uniforms , I needed something more dressy , so I bought all the &#34; comfortable shoes &#34; I could find here at Amazon . I was looking for a mary-jane look with a sneaker feel . - Ambulator By Aetrex Women 's B6000 Mary Jane , Black - I could n't even try it because it runs a number and a half small -LRB- at least -RRB- . My size is 9 or 9,1 / 2 . I bought 9M , 9wide and 9 1/2 wide . All too small . Go at least a number up . Another problem is that the insole is too high . My toes and the top of my feet were so &#34; squished &#34; against the top of the shoe that I could n't even give it a quick walk . It looks adorable , - Propet Women 's W3851 Wash & Wear Slip-On - The back is too high so it cuts/rubs on your leg when you walk . Overall uncomfortable . A lot of pressure on your feet overall , sides and top . Runs true to size -LRB- 9 1/2 W for me -RRB- - Propet Women 's W0029 Mary Jane Walker - Good support all around , long strap on top , good looking but not enough cushion to walk for 12 hours . fits true to size -LRB- 9 1/2 for me -RRB- . As they did not have it in wide , it makes too much pressure on the front of the foot , just before the toes . - Drew Shoe Women 's Rose Mary Jane , Black Calf/Black Stretch , - Too high where the strap comes out , it hurts as soon as you put it on . It looks so comfortable is the worst offender . Runs true to size -LRB- 9 , 1/2 W -RRB- - Clarks Women 's Wave.Cruise Mary Jane Flat , Black ,9.5 W US - It feels like it is missing half of the sole ! It feels like just the outer part of the sole is on , and the other half is missing , making your foot lean towards the inside . Crazy ! It feels like I am gon na fall down , very hard to keep your balance . Almost like ice skates . Runs BIG , go a size smaller.The winner ? So far I found Eurostep Jenna Black -LRB- $ 59.99 at my local store -RRB- to be the best one . Mary Jane style . I 've used it for 4 nights now and one 12 hour shift .
 I had bought these shoes before and I really liked them . These are super comfortable and look very professional . However , 2 months after I bought these shoes they started to make squeeking noise ; which was very embarrasing at work .
 I bought these shoes with high expectations . I had heard great things about them . I purchased these shoes in March 2012 , and they lasted until around July 2012 . I still wear them , but they are almost no longer wearable . The soles are almost completely worn dorn . I wo n't be purchasing this brand again .
 I have been buying Deer Stags for several years for the following reasons :1 . Comfortable2 . Durable3 . Classic styling appropriate for the office environment4 . Reasonably priced - especially considering the engineered comfort features compared with ` traditional ' brandsThese shoes tick every box ... BUT - they have a very annoying high-pitched squeak coming from inside the shoe . It does n't matter what surface you are on . I had just started wearing a hinged knee brace when I got these . I blamed the noise on the hinge until the day I was n't wearing the brace.You definitely wo n't be sneaking up on anyone wearing these !
 My deer stage shoes fell apart in 3 months , I work in a office with a carpet floor and the tops unglued from the bottom . They where very comfortable while they lasted . Will never by again !
 Producto que me fu&eacute; devuelto el importe por no haberlo recibido . Despu&eacute;s me lo hicieron pagar sin tener nada en cuenta.Abusivo y vergonzoso . Seg&uacute;n sus propios datos los zapatos a&uacute;n est&aacute;n por ah&iacute; dando vueltas .
 I bought a pair of these shoes and after four months , I had to throw them away because the soles broke in half.This was a third pair , so I give up.No more Deer Stags . They make faulty shoes .
 I ordered both the cherry and black Deer Stags through Sportman 's guide.com . When I recieved the shoes the cherry was polished and new looking . The black pair was dull and had no shine . Instead of returning the product , as should have done , I tried different ways to put the gloss and polish on those shoes.All attempts failed . Very unhappy with product . I have learnedmy lesson .
 I found these shoes to be brittle and uncomfortable . Spend a little more and you will able to walk without blisters .
 I 've owned brown , raisin , and black versions of this shoe . They are incredibly comfortable , especially the wide sizes . My only complaint is that the last pair I bought had their soles -LRB- both shoes -RRB- come unglued with just a few months of wear . The rest of the shoe looks great , but I ca n't wear them because the front part of the sole is coming off .
 The shoe looked great , but did n't fit at all . I ordered a size 7 . The strap was so tight that I could barely get my foot into it . Was gon na give them to my mom , who usually wears a smaller size than myself , but she said the same thing . So I exchanged them for an 8 . The same deal all over again . Wasted time was all this shoe gave me . I have a pair of Columbia flip flips already , had them for about 13-14 years . They wear well and would still be in good shape but my puppy got them . I just wanted some that looked newer . Columbia has good shoes , just not this particular one .
 Shoe appeared to be the wrong size.The shoe was a bigger size than what was stated , more like a factory reject .
 Ordered a size 8N in blue , received a 9N in black . What more can I say?The seller has no quality control .
 THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I ORDERED SHOES FROM AMAZON -LRB- SHOEFLAKE -RRB- AND THEY WERE ENTIRELY THE WRONG SHOE . FORTUNATELY , I HAD SOMEONE TO GIVE THEM TO . HOWEVER , I AM OUT $ 60 + DOLLARS .
 I have worn the Liberty Loafer for many years . These run wider than any others that I have -- in the same size . I will not order these again .
 I have worn the Enzo Liberty loafer as my primary shoe of choice for many years , and have owned at least 15 pair . I always knew I could depend on this shoe to fit my foot as if it were hand-made for me , and to be comfortable from day one . Unfortunately , the quality of this shoe seems to have deteriorated while the cost has steadily gone up . This pair is not the soft buttery leather I have grown accustomed to , but feels extremely stiff , does not conform to my foot , rubs my ankle and cuts into my instep . I will not be ordering these again , and am greatly disappointed .
 CHEAP!DO NOT BUY ! Strings in front broke apart when I tried them on for the FIRST time . After only 10 wears , the Backseam ripped down the whole back of the right boot , I had to trash them after only having them for 1 MONTH ! This is the WORST product I have EVER purchased ! Due to the one month return limit , I could not return them . Hows that for Planned obsolescence !!!
 Incredibly difficult to get these boots on ! The point where the fur meets to shoe is just to tight . Shoe size was correct if you could get the boot on . If you have any arch at all forget this one ! I sent mine back .
 I want this in my size - give me a 10 because I wear thick socks . You should try and offer more sizes :-LRB- I live in circumpolar America for goodness sakes !!!!
 Anyone who buys these boots , should be ashamed . Go to -LSB- ... -RSB- to see what really goes on when rabbits and other animals are stripped from their coats ! alive !
 El vendedor debe revisar las opciones , Me enviaron unos calzados de recien nacidos y seleccione uno de ninos , mi hijo esta muy molesto .
 too bad the company was wrong in sending the size and they sent me to buy baby shoes for teens hurts that can not return
 this item was out of stock when i ordered and i was never notified when it or if it came back into stock . it 's a shame too , my grandson was really looking forward to getting them .
 Got totally wrong shoe with the order , that sorta sucked . Were 12 bucks so I just gave it to my cousin instead of going through the return process and having them mess up again .
 I own these shoes in red and am very disappointed . The leather is nice and soft , however it is so soft that the shoes give no support on the side and it looks like my feet are double their normal width . The sole does not cover the toe portion -LRB- as many other moccasins do -RRB- and now my bright red shoes have a huge white wear mark across the toe portion -LRB- imagine you were in ballet slippers up on toepoint -- that portion is completely worn -RRB- . I must say - I own several pairs of mocassins but none were such terrible quality . I loved the way these looked that I ordered 5 pairs in various sides and colors and EVERYTHING went back .
 It 's not Pittsburg ... . There is an H on the end of the city name . It 's PittsburgH .
 This boot only lasted me 2 months wearing them every other day . The zippers splits apart . It is not water proof and the air pocket on the bottom popped . Do n't waist your time or money .
 Walking around on to 12 hr shifts and the top of the boot kept rubbing near the zippers latch . It 's a shame I used the Under Armor boots -LRB- new on the market -RRB- and they were great right from the start .
 I loved the boots for the 3 times I got to wear them . The heel cap came off of one boot and was lost . A lot of money for that to happen .
 The shoe looked great , but did n't fit at all . I ordered a size 7 . The strap was so tight that I could barely get my foot into it . Was gon na give them to my mom , who usually wears a smaller size than myself , but she said the same thing . So I exchanged them for an 8 . The same deal all over again . Wasted time was all this shoe gave me . I have a pair of Columbia flip flips already , had them for about 13-14 years . They wear well and would still be in good shape but my puppy got them . I just wanted some that looked newer . Columbia has good shoes , just not this particular one .
 Too flexible and can really hurt your feet when walking long distances . The only sturdy part is the heel .
 I personally think that these shoes are too narrow . There size chart is n't very good either . I first ordered the larger size , as the chart said , but they were way too big . Even when the length fit on the 2nd pair , they are just too narrow .
 Really not worth wasting your money on . They look and feel cheap , and the fit is awful . I returned mine straight away .
 I love crocs and have a couple pair of the Athens style . I liked the looks of this style so I ordered a pair after wearing my former crocs so much I needed to replace them . I love the way they feel but ca n't stand the crinkle noise the strap makes with every step ! I 'm returning them and ordering the good ol' Athens to replace them . I wear a half size shoe and order up and they fit great . Love how comfortable crocs are !
 I bought these as a gift . The size 6 is much closer to a 7 , so I ended up having to exchange for a size 5 . I bought some other styles of Crocs which ended up being a full size too SMALL , so the Crocs sizing seems to be very inconsistent .
 I ran in every generation of this stability-control shoe since gen-2 . By gen-9 they have totally trashed the shoe . The ride for slight over-pronators has definitely degraded , but the maddening and absolutely inexcusable design flaw is the d * mned squeak that sets in anywhere between 50 & 125 miles of use . There 's a tubular insert in the heal -LRB- just look at the bottom -RRB- that obviously loosens fairly quickly and then -- squeak-squeak-squeak ... every plant ! -LRB- even when you 're walking . -RRB- I 've moved on to Mizuno Nirvana 's -- heavier , but what a great ride . Farewell , Adidas , I guess you did n't love me as much as I did you . Your loss , though , and likely forever .

 Being taller is n't necessary in houseshoes ! They also run a little smaller than my normal shoe size .
 These slippers run a little wide . While they are very soft and cushy , and even have soles that will endure a little outdoor time , I found that they are a little sloppy . By that , I mean my they fall off easily , and my foot has a tendency to slide in the left slipper to the outside of it -LRB- I do have pronation/supination problems -RRB- , but it makes it feel funny and unbalanced . I think I 'll revert back to a harder soled slipper the next time I order .
 I had two primary issues with these shoes .1 -RRB- They did not look like the photo , they are actually very shiny and plastic looking .2 -RRB- They are very uncomfortable .
 This shoe runs pretty small . I had to return my usual size in Clarks . Ordering on the internet sucks sometimes for that reason . You incurr shipping costs both ways .
 This shoe is not comfortable at all ! See the cute black leather design running down the center ? It is raised and rubs on the bottom of your foot . My feet are narrow , I normally purchase narrow width , I ordered this shoe in the normal width and it pinches my feet . I can not even wear these shoes .
 This case partially covers the screen on both sides of the Zen Vision W and would interfere with video playback . The openings for the controls also do not fit correctly and interfere with easy operation . It should be adequate to provide protection and listen to music but I would not recommend this item or purchase it again .
 i have bought this product to use it with zen vision w but as soon as i got it i found that it does n't fit with it cause it only works with regular zen visionso i had to through it out and to go to creative web site to get another one that fits it .
 ITEMS WERE RETURNED DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE INNER SOLE BECAME UNGLUED . i WOULD LIKE TO EITHER HAVE A NEW PAIR OR A REFUND OR REPAIRED AND RETURNED.I HAVE HEARD NOTHING CONCERNING THIS UP TO THE PRESENT TIME .
 In the summer of 2008 I wanted to buy a comfortable , supportive sandal to wear on our trip to Disney World . I read a lot of reviews on Chacos and read about the technology behind the design . I was sure that Chacos would be a perfect choice and bought a pair for myself and my teenage daughter after being fitted by a REI salesperson . We both wore them to Disney and we both had problems right away . Both of us complained of pain in our big toe joints and we had problems with the strap tightening around the toe while we walked . At some point during the trip I had lost all the feeling in one big toe and had a deep indent where the strap was . It felt like when you get a shot of Novocain and your lip feels numb when you touch it . -LRB- I had no feeling at the tip of my toe for three months ! And then it gradually got better during the fourth month . -RRB- My guess is that the strap damaged a nerve . During the summer of 2009 I wore the sandals again for short periods of time with no problem , so I decided to take them again to Disney with the intention of constantly checking the strap and keep it very loose around my toe . I was successful , but at the end of the first day my toe started to feel prickly . That 's when I retired my Chacos and bought a pair of FitFlops which were extremely comfortable and gave me no problems for the rest of the week . My daughter ended up giving up her Chacos also . She felt they were very uncomfortable and ended up buying another sandal at Disney that worked well . We really wanted to like our Chacos and gave them a good chance . Unfortunately they did n't work for us .
 I love these shoes in theory . The sole bed is super comfortable but some of the straps are not adjustable and those loops were too big for me . I tried going down a size but then the foot bed is too small . Ugh - I really wanted to keep these shoes but had to send them back
 I clicked on the blue shoe , 5th in line on this page , and it was entitled `` Garden '' and I received green shoes . The green shoes that the official chacos website considers `` Garden '' . I am very upset because if I am going to spend this much money on a pair of shoes , I expect to receive what I ordered and I did not .
 Great look , great fit , comfortable . However I had these for three weeks and the webbing on the back heel frayed . Returned to Chaco for warranty , they would not honor warranty - said it had to be my fault ? Shoes were never worn camping , just city . Good news is they did repair , bad news they charged me for the repair . Next time I will buy Teva 's .
 Cute design and length was perfect . I do not think that I have abnormally big toes but my big toe would not fit into the opening at all . Finally got it in but tight and uncomfortable when walking .
 This shoe is too clunky and the arch is way to high . It gives me blisters on my arch and my big toes are going to fall off . They are good for outdoors and a great concept . I wish they were more dainty .
 These are very uncomfortable . I bought them because of already having feet issues/pain , but these only made it worse . The imprint ridges are very annoying .
 I was tracking this product hardcore and on the day that was suppose to arrive , it did n't come . I was home all day , and nothing . I did n't receive any notes or anything , but the website said person was n't home , which is bull because I was home all day . I suppose that 's UPS 's fault though.The sneaker itself was n't what I expected . Yes it did look like what it was on the picture , but when I looked carefully , it looked like it was put together poorly . The top pieces of the sneaker , the plastic part with the lace holes were misaligned to the sneaker . Towards the toe , also misaligned pieces .

It feels like I am gon na fall down , very hard to keep your balance . Almost like ice skates . Runs BIG , go a size smaller.The winner ? So far I found Eurostep Jenna Black -LRB- $ 59.99 at my local store -RRB- to be the best one . Mary Jane style . I 've used it for 4 nights now and one 12 hour shift .
 I bought these shoes hoping it would let me wear high heels again due to the fact I ca n't after my ACL surgery a few years ago . But they just pinch my toes and the side of my feet from the cheap plastic strap . Also they are n't very comfortable to walk in . I was hoping because they were Dr. Scholl 's shoes they were help my knee and feet , but I was wrong . These shoes killed my knee and feet within an hour . A waste of money in my book .
 This product is supposed to be extra wide -LRB- 6E -RRB- but it did n't even come close . The toe is almost pointed . Not for anyone with wide feet at the ball and toes .
 I ordered a pair of these last year . While extremely comfortable and attractive , these shoes do suffer from a fatal flaw . Namely , the soles are not particularly longlasting
 Had to replace the shoes once , after I got the replacement I used the shoes on a conference and had to walk a lot , the seam at the front did not hold up and ended up with a big hole on one side of the shoe . Not recommended
 I was looking for a comfortable pair of boat shoes . I read the reviews for these shoes and decided to order . Well , I should have listened to many of the reviews because they were really uncomfortable especially in the heel . I would not reccomend these shoes .
 I bought these shoes in early March and they started slowly falling apart in mid-April . Recently the sole lining is lifting up in both feet of my pair . This makes them uncomfortable to wear until the slowly-disconnecting flap becomes folded and creased . Then my socks have been touching the inner-sole which is not comfortable to have the fabric of your socks against . First the sole lining started lifting up and now even the inner-sole is lifting up . Small debris have gotten under the yet-un-creased flap of the inner-sole and are far more annoying than any debris of comparable size in the actual shoe.In addition these may be better served with no laces . Tie them too tight and they immediately become unlaced , too loose and they do not hold the shoe together . A fixed tie at an average tightness would probably work better.The third problem is that one can not wear these sock-less . I have visible red scars on the back of my ankles from the one and only time I wore these without socks in April ! Each bruise is around the size of a dime at the height of the shoe on my feet . Now I 'll never be able to get married.I will not buy this pair again and probably not Dockers shoes again . I 'm still confused that Dockers sells such low quality shoes.Expect compliments while wearing these . Do not expect your moneys worth of a reliable , pain-free , enduring shoe .
 I bought a pair of these shoes at a local shoe store , and I have been very disappointed . I have had them for about six months , and only wear then a couple of days each week . Already the sole of one has split crosswise , and the sole of the other is starting to detach from the uppers . This is what I would have expected from cheap shoes bought at a discount store , not name-brand shoes that cost more than twice as much .
 These shoes look really nice and were just what I was looking for in a pair of casuals . The insole is cushy and feels nice to walk on.At first , anyway . I can not say the same for the rest of the shoe . The grommets in the collar near the backstay -LRB- where your achilles tendon meets your heel -RRB- are hard as nails and dug holes in my heels that have yet to heal after buying them last week . And this after only a couple of hours wearing them around the house . I do n't think I will wait for them to break in because I ca n't see why a pair of shoes should do that much damage to my feet in so short a time . Not at this price , anyway .
 Well , since it 's high heeled , I had to order a size smaller . This one in particular presses down on my toes from all directions , making it painful for the tip of my toes when I walk . It looks great , but I can hardly call it a comfortable pair of work shoes unless you have narrow feet , maybe ?
 The picture is not what is being sold when you order this product . They have the wrong picture , what you get is a ZIGI Girl canvas shoe . Tried to order this boot twice before finding out the this boot is no longer available .
 I have been wearing these shoes for about 4 months . They are good looking but feel cheaper than the shoes I replaced made by Nike Air -- which also was more expensive than this pair of Adidas . I would probably not buy this shoe again.Nothing compares to a great running shoe with cushion inside to protect your foot as it hits the pavement . I feel like this Adidas has no cushion and that my foot is not protected . Also , the Nike shoes were purchased at a running store which is the really best place to buy them .
 This flipflop was too small - with and length-wise . I also found the knots at the top were uncomfortable . I recommend the Olowahu instead .
 This shoe is not for you if you want to actually walk . I literally fall out of the shoe . It was really inexpensive to buy , but the shipping was 2/3 of the cost . Plus to sent it back , I would have paid double for a shoe I did n't want to keep . I recommend not buying this shoe . I have many other TEVA sandals and I LOVE them all . This one just does n't stay on your foot !
 The comfort of reef sandals are great -- i have owned several pairs but the metallic colors are plain ugly . oxy-moronic styling in a beach flip-flop . Amazon 's color selection is very limited -- these metallic colors and all black are the only choice . Reef has lots of additional colors -- would be great to see them offered on amazon .
 Just got these and was so disappointed ! I 've loved reefs all my life and was so excited for this pair , but what came in the mail was not what I expected . I wear 7.5 , 8 tops and since they dont have half sized I got an 8 . What I got was a 6.5 or a 7 max . Although all the stickers say 8 . Not in this world ! Also , the tread is plasticy crap that 's slicker than socks . SHAMEE !!!
 I 've owned at least half a dozen pairs of these sandals over the years . Typically they are excellent . These , however , were much more flimsy and cheaper than my older pairs , and the bottom tread looks completely different compared to my others . They are also too small , even though I 've always worn the size I ordered . Either Reef has gone incredibly down hill , or these are fake shoes .
 The big toe divider on these flip-flops were much too long for my small feet and I could n't keep them on my feet . I returned them . I also did n't like the curved sole -- which made walking harder .
 I wear 8.5 to size 9 . 9 's were an entire size too small . They do n't issue exchanges , by the time I would return them I 'd lose half of what I 'd paid in shipping costs , deducted and what I 'd have to pay to return . They feel pretty flimsy also !
 I have purchased speedo flip flops many times , these are awful . They are like what you buy in the dollar store , no arch support and a sole that catches and folds up under your toe . I do n't believe these are really speedo 's . Do n't buy .
 The pair I ordered was defective and I had to return them . The strap was placed to far back on the shoe bed , so it did n't fit the contour of my foot correctly . I 've since purchased this shoe elsewhere and I 'm very happy with it .
 I just received these reef sandals in the mail and was totally disappointed . First all they do not resemble any of the other reef sandals I have purchased , in look or quality . They look and feel cheap . Secondly , this is not a great price for them -LRB- $ 19.99 -RRB- , this is the sticker cost , I have since found out .
 Ordered these for my daughter . She normally wears 7 1/2 - 8 Medium width . I ordered 8M for her . When she got these they were smaller than any of her 7 1/2 sandles and MUCH narrower . Totally unusable . Marking on the back was US 8 . NOT ! Also the quality , look , and feel was on par with the $ 3.99 stuff you see in Walmart , et al. . Not worth the trouble of returning . Amazon ... I trusted you and you let me down !!! Amazon should screen their suppliers better , are they trying to grow too fast ??? Reef - you need to watch your quality better - do n't lose your image just trying to make your quartlerly numbers . BTW - the label said `` made in Indonesia '' .
 I bought these flip flops to wear at the health club pool . It appeared from the picture that the straps were stiff so I could slip them off and on easily . They are n't . The ` thong ' straps are fabric and they flop so that you have to use your fingers to situate the straps on your foot . Be fine if I was wearing them all day , but I 'm putting them on and taking them off and it 's annoying , especially when your feet are wet .
 I have worn only these flip flops for years and loved them . I ordered some recently only to find that the rubber they use for the sole is now made of a much cheaper material . It used to be dense rubber with some weight to it . The arches were what i loved the most and the durablity . The new material is lightweight and doesnt hold up well . The arches arent as good because the rubber is so soft . I wore them around the pool and they got a bit wet and I left them in the sun . When I returned the sole was acutally curled . I am so disappointed . I can only hope that they go back to using the old material or I will need to find another brand to replace them with .
 The product is great ; but I got sent the wrong color . It was listed as black/blue and turned out to be black/purple and shiny silver . Someone must be color blind .

Amazon 's color selection is very limited -- these metallic colors and all black are the only choice . Reef has lots of additional colors -- would be great to see them offered on amazon .
 Just got these and was so disappointed ! I 've loved reefs all my life and was so excited for this pair , but what came in the mail was not what I expected . I wear 7.5 , 8 tops and since they dont have half sized I got an 8 . What I got was a 6.5 or a 7 max . Although all the stickers say 8 . Not in this world ! Also , the tread is plasticy crap that 's slicker than socks . SHAMEE !!!
 I 've owned at least half a dozen pairs of these sandals over the years . Typically they are excellent . These , however , were much more flimsy and cheaper than my older pairs , and the bottom tread looks completely different compared to my others . They are also too small , even though I 've always worn the size I ordered . Either Reef has gone incredibly down hill , or these are fake shoes .
 The big toe divider on these flip-flops were much too long for my small feet and I could n't keep them on my feet . I returned them . I also did n't like the curved sole -- which made walking harder .
 I wear 8.5 to size 9 . 9 's were an entire size too small . They do n't issue exchanges , by the time I would return them I 'd lose half of what I 'd paid in shipping costs , deducted and what I 'd have to pay to return . They feel pretty flimsy also !
 Ordered these for my daughter . She normally wears 7 1/2 - 8 Medium width . I ordered 8M for her . When she got these they were smaller than any of her 7 1/2 sandles and MUCH narrower . Totally unusable . Marking on the back was US 8 . NOT ! Also the quality , look , and feel was on par with the $ 3.99 stuff you see in Walmart , et al. . Not worth the trouble of returning . Amazon ... I trusted you and you let me down !!! Amazon should screen their suppliers better , are they trying to grow too fast ??? Reef - you need to watch your quality better - do n't lose your image just trying to make your quartlerly numbers . BTW - the label said `` made in Indonesia '' .
 These slippers run a little wide . While they are very soft and cushy , and even have soles that will endure a little outdoor time , I found that they are a little sloppy . By that , I mean my they fall off easily , and my foot has a tendency to slide in the left slipper to the outside of it -LRB- I do have pronation/supination problems -RRB- , but it makes it feel funny and unbalanced . I think I 'll revert back to a harder soled slipper the next time I order .

 Being taller is n't necessary in houseshoes ! They also run a little smaller than my normal shoe size .

 I have worn only these flip flops for years and loved them . I ordered some recently only to find that the rubber they use for the sole is now made of a much cheaper material . It used to be dense rubber with some weight to it . The arches were what i loved the most and the durablity . The new material is lightweight and doesnt hold up well . The arches arent as good because the rubber is so soft . I wore them around the pool and they got a bit wet and I left them in the sun . When I returned the sole was acutally curled . I am so disappointed . I can only hope that they go back to using the old material or I will need to find another brand to replace them with .
 I bought these flip flops to wear at the health club pool . It appeared from the picture that the straps were stiff so I could slip them off and on easily . They are n't . The ` thong ' straps are fabric and they flop so that you have to use your fingers to situate the straps on your foot . Be fine if I was wearing them all day , but I 'm putting them on and taking them off and it 's annoying , especially when your feet are wet .
 I have purchased speedo flip flops many times , these are awful . They are like what you buy in the dollar store , no arch support and a sole that catches and folds up under your toe . I do n't believe these are really speedo 's . Do n't buy .
 The pair I ordered was defective and I had to return them . The strap was placed to far back on the shoe bed , so it did n't fit the contour of my foot correctly . I 've since purchased this shoe elsewhere and I 'm very happy with it .
 I just received these reef sandals in the mail and was totally disappointed . First all they do not resemble any of the other reef sandals I have purchased , in look or quality . They look and feel cheap . Secondly , this is not a great price for them -LRB- $ 19.99 -RRB- , this is the sticker cost , I have since found out .

 I like Vaneli styles , and I own other shoes from this company , but these were unusually cheap . They were unlined ! I looked at the other Vaneli shoes in my closet , and they are lined . The suede will certainly stretch out of shape very quickly without any type of lining . In addition , the heel plates are cheap , hard plastic . My experience with this type of heel plate is that it crack and even falls off . My other complaint is the excessive shipping charges . FootSmart charged me $ 12.99 to ship the shoes , and because I am mailing them back due to their cheap construction , they are charging me $ 6.99 more using the barcode return label . Thus I spent $ 20 to try on cheap shoes . I do n't think I will buy Vaneli online anymore , and I wo n't order from FootSmart . Many other shoe vendors charge much less or even zero -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- ! -RRB- .
 Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot , however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out .

 I was having difficulties with the sizing for this shoe , so I called Amazon.com customer service . The lady was very polite , but could not locate the item . After giving her assistance , she was able to locate the shoe and told me that they were sold out and it could not be ordered.I had the item in my cart so I just clicked to buy it anyway . Either I got it or I did n't . No harm done.It was shipped that day . I will receive it in the mail today.The product itself is great . I have a pair of brown ones ... had them for years and still going strong . And I am not a Dr. Marten 's fan at all.But I do n't think customer service means the customer provides the service to the company ... and I was given incorrect information regarding these shoes being in stock .
 this shoes are as rock , very very hard , uncomfortable.if you want rocks in yours shoes , this shoes can bring.my feet were in pain after wearing them for one day
 The left shoe was fine . But , the right one 's insole was not flat that I have to return it.The seller made me to pay $ 7 to sipping them back.I would say I like the shoes but the product they are selling may have a high defective percentage .

 They are not what they seem , the so called fur , mats up inside the slipper and comes off on your feet . they have gotten all lumpy inside which makes them very un-comfortable to wear . And they are not warm at all . these are the first dearforms i 've had and they will be the last .
 They are as bad as all of the other reviews say . But they served my purpose , I bought them to go with my Halloween costume . I also wear them around the house occasionally , but I can tell they 're not going to last long .

 This was my second pair . They were too tight , although sized the same . The leather seemed to be inferior to my previous pair but likely still serviceable . I gave mine to a homeless man . I am sure he would write a glowing review of his new Dockers .
 I bought this pair in a 10 medium . They looked good and felt good on my feet . However , as other reviewers have said , the soles wear out fast within a couple of weeks ! I do n't recommend these shoes.Dockers needs to strengthen the soles .
 The shoes came with a torn out brass &#34; eye &#34; for the laces . This is not a first quality item and I feel that I was taken advantage of by the vendor .
 Great looking shoe . However BEWARE , At least one full size small . 9 should be a 10 . Also , very , very poor padding on the sole insert . We shall see about the wear -LRB- March 1,2012 -RRB- . Will report back ... I Will not buy this brand again .
 Im a fan of dockers use most products but never had shoes but i thought very hard desilucione , i think i ` ii keep usind HUSH puppies more soft
 First thing you notice about these shoes is that they come plastered with rather unusual promo stickers about their stain resistance . Hmm , should that be a primary concern for a black shoe ? But apparently there 's just nothing else in these shoes to brag about . They look much cruder than in the pictures . The interior -LRB- insoles and some trim -RRB- are lined with a vinyl plastic , not leather . That immediately makes them very hot and uncomfortable to wear . Unlike some other reviewers , I found the sizing to be fairly true . But there was uncomfortable pressure on the instep , and poor shock absorption in the sole . Since the interior is not leather , the shoes are unlikely to break in either.Amazon provides great service both in delivery and handling of returns ; but I wish I could return these shoes all the way back to China , from where they came .
 I have not received this item as of today . I really do n't know what happened to my order -LRB- Dockers Men 's shelter Plain Toe Oxford , Black , 7 M US -RRB- .
 After 4 years , I finally replaced my old pair . I have owned these shoes for less than 4 months now . Already , a hole is beginning to form near the balls of my feet . This is incredible considering the same pair previously lasted 4 years ! I could tell almost immediatly that Dockers must have changed something because of how quickly the shoes were wearing out . I have contacted the company with my complaint .
 These are comfortable but by the time you get them wore in the sole of the shoe is all worn out . I work in an office too , its not like I was on concrete all day and im not over weight . They should make a sole that last longer than 2 months .
 I 've had mine for a barely a month , and I am extremely disappointed how quickly the soles have worn . The soles feel like they are made from the same materials as flip-flop soles . The soles on these have worn so quickly that I will probably only get about another 2 or 3 months out of them.I will NOT be buying Dockers again when I have to replace these , or ever again , for that matter . My shoes before this pair lasted me two years . This is unacceptable , Dockers ! Customers expect much better quality for the higher price associate with your brand name .
 The Dockers Men 's Shelter Plain Toe Oxford is a comfortable and attractive shoe , but the soles wear very quickly . After only 3 weeks of occasional -LRB- 3x a week -RRB- use INDOORS and -LRB- usually -RRB- on CARPET , the soles were visibly worn.Hoping to receive a refund from the seller , Shoebuy.com , proved pointless . When the shoes were returned to me , a form was included indicating that the `` soles are excessively worn '' which is nonsense . If the soles fade so quickly in a mere three weeks , they will be completely eroded in 6 months.In the Great Recession , giving money to a business or government means having parted with it forever regardless of the circumstances . Avoid this shoe and avoid Shoebuy.com unless you wish to get cheated .

The suede will certainly stretch out of shape very quickly without any type of lining . In addition , the heel plates are cheap , hard plastic .

 Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot , however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out .

 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .
 I bought this sandal because I wanted a more stylish but casual sandal . The band actually cut into my foot and made the shoe uncomfortable to wear and my toes actually were forced to spead open for whatever reason . I only wear them if I ca n't find anything else to go with the particular outfit .
 I always wear 6 1/2 , but this pair of 6 1/2 is way too small . The back of my heels was standing on nothing . It has to go back.The high wedge heels look a little too bulky , so it would not look good with skirts , shorts , or capris . But it could look good with pants that cover most of the heels .
 I paid less than $ 20 for this shoes so I did n't expect much . I guess as the saying goes ... you get what you pay for right .
 Product is advertised for $ 14.99 and when searching it , there is no single pair for $ 14.99 . This misleads customers , like myself
 I bought these to wear at work because I do a lot of walking and I wanted flat shoes . I walked 1 block and I immediately got blisters on both my feet .
 I love the old Quark Liberty , but this one is so disappointed me , size is too small , the shoe is too narrowed and too tight .

 I wore these shoes for 1 day working in the garden . when I took them off the tops of my feet were inflamed with red bumps that scabbed over and were very tender to the touch , I could n't wear any shoes that touched the tops of my feet for almost 2 weeks.they were comfortable to wear , but the rash is still really bad after 2 weeks . I WO N'T wear them again ...
 I was very dissapointed with this product . I bought some beach crocs a few years ago and they were made in Canada . These were made in China . They are not the same quality at all . These are not cushioned like the others were , they are also smaller even tho they are the exact same size as the ones made in Canada . These are NO better than the cheaper `` knock offs '' you find in dollar stores .
 Est delivery date was 12/13 - 12/16 guess what date it is today ... 1/3/11 ... . it was going to be a nice Christmas gift for my son-in-law . . I was hoping for 2010 . To many other good companies out there to use this one again .
 i 'm very dissisafied with my crocs . they send the wrong size.so i 'm stuck with them .
 tengo mas de un mes que pedi mis cross y aun no me han llegado necesito saber q paa con ello por favor denme razon de ello ya q los tengo cargados en mi tarjeta y todo gracias
 Maybe I 'm too concerned about fashion , but there are shoes out there that are just as comfortable , and dont make me look like I work in a hospital . I see people wear these every day and I cringe when they walk by . I guess theyre good for people maybe 70 and older who need orthotic shoes and cant wear sandals to the beach .
 I ordered size 8/9 since i wear a size 8 1/2 shoe , they fit my husband who wears size 11 . To top it off I ended up paying $ 6.00 for the return shipping . It will be the last time I order shoes from them .
 Do not waste your money on these they are cheaply constructed I received them today and the snap on the strap that holds them to your foot was broken and would not stay snapped together save your money I paid my money for broken merchandise again please save your money these are not constructed well at all
 Croc strap broke the first time it was worn . Not pleased with this product at all .
 I have bought several pairs of crocs and these did not appear to be original crocs . I always buy the same size and these arrived way too big , how could the same size be too big if these are original crocs ? Had to send back and pay for shipping , not very happy and will only buy crocs from the original website .
 We received the Crocs , which are my son 's favorite shoe to wear . However , when he wore them to school the next day , one of the straps broke and I had to run a different pair of shoes to him at school . We are hoping to return them and get a new pair -- that will last longer than two hours .
 I have worn Crocs for years . They are almost a must for diabetics . The ones on this page are made in China . The cheaper quality is immediately visible , the sizing is off and the last -LRB- shape of shoe -RRB- also appears different . I wish Amazon would clearly stipulate where stuff is made so we could have a choice .
 My non-Croc-type of footwear are more comfortable and better made than the real Crocs I bought recently ! Quite disheartening .
 I have bought several prs of crocs , but these were sized differently than the others which were unisex and thus mfor my size 11 feet were too small .
 Sorry . I bought them as a gift and have a report that the holes up front are very uncomfortable especially for big toe . I will be returning , which I am bummed about , and , have probably learned not to buy a clothing item on line as a gift .
 I begin by saying I have worn Crocs `` Beach '' Men 's XXL for many years . They have always been excellent shoes ... UNTIL , I PURCHASED MY MOST RECENT PAIR . The first thing you notice is they are MADE IN CHINA.Without question the shoes from China are smaller . To the point of even being tight . The back strap ismore narrow than the previous shoes I purchased . The front part of the sole is not as thick . Overall , it feels like a cheap imitation . I may NEVER buy another Croc shoe .
 I love the old Quark Liberty , but this one is so disappointed me , size is too small , the shoe is too narrowed and too tight .
 I had no problem with the quality of the shoe , my complaint is that the sizing was very confusing . I thought I was buying a pair of size 8 shoe for men or a size 6 for women , but it turned out the other way around . I have tor return these . You need to clarify the sizing of your shoes .
 These sandals are very unstable and do not tie securely . The fit was perfect for our son , but they always seem to give on on one side when walking . He almost tripped several times , and fell twice actually hurting himself . We did n't realized these sandals were the cause and threw them in the trash right away . They might work for some , but they were a bad purchase for us . There are better sandals available , would not recommend these sandals .
 My son has a puffy foot , not slim , but this sandals are for the slim foot . Had to send them back .
 They developed holes way too quickly.Don ' t bother.Nice red though .
 I have purchased online through Fogdog in the past ; however , the description on Amazon is incorrect . This is NOT a 3 pair pack , it is only one pair of socks for $ 13.99 plus shipping . What a rip-off . I am deeply disappointed.Pro Feet Mens Acrylic Multi-Sport Tube Sock - 3 Pair Pack
 I expected so much more from dockers . After less than 4 months the leather started to peal away in the toe area of the shoe , left and right . Comfort ? was ok . I feel ripped off and will never buy any dockers product ever again .

 I was shopping around for a nice shoe for a little while , and I found this one at a great store called Soccer Plus in Palatine , IL . I bought the shoe and used it to kick a ball around with some friends . By the end , the back of my ankle had a mark from the friction . Next time I used it , I ran on a treadmill . When I finished and looked at my sock , it was covered in blood from that same area . I 'm not sure what the problem was , but I think it was the artificial material and the lack of padding . I would n't really recommend this shoe . Find one with better padding inside .

 These shoes are very cute and comfortable . However , I was disappointed in the quality , particularly coming from Clarks . The stitching around the sole of one of the shoes began to come undone about the third time I wore them . The sole remained attached , but it looked bad . The covering peeled off both of the buttons , so now they 're just shiny metal . And one of the buttons came off , and I ca n't re-attach it -- currently trying to find a way to do it with super glue . I have an office job and have n't had this kind of problem with a pair of shoes before , so I do n't feel that I have been overly hard on the shoes .

 I bought these from Champs and had about 2 weeks of wear . The rubber sole is thin on the ball of the foot and it split apart . Champs looked at them and declined a refund . This is not considered a manufacturer defect . So if you want to spend a 100.00 for a few weeks wear ... go ahead . The Tornado 3 sole is completely redesigned with a more substantial rubber layer . Do you think they realized this was a problem with the Tornado 2 ????? Very unhappy with this Mizuno product and Champs response .3 days after listing this review , Champs decided to give a full refund . So I do sincerely appreciate their `` new and improved '' response . Thanks Kim !!! I still recommend the Tornado 3 instead ... you will get better wear on the sole .

 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .

 I loved my Keen sandals , mostly due to nice fit , they were a little sweatty though . So much that I bought the shoes -LRB- very good -RRB- , bought the work boots -LRB- steel toed also very good -RRB- , bought the socks -LRB- not so good -RRB- . I do n't honestly wear the H2 sandals that much , maybe had them about a year -LRB- bought them last late summer/fall -RRB- , but live in the northeast so its mostly a summer shoe , 4 -5 months a year or so . So we went to Grand Tetons , these were my `` off hiking day '' shoes for the trip . We did a 6 mile flat hike and the backs ripped out of one of them . By the way the socks have holes in the sides -LRB- not heals or toes like you might expect -RRB- . Used to be all their products seemed to have 5 star ratings ... me thinks the expansion to all kinds of shoes may be causing some kind of performance issues.So not much use , the treads on the bottom frankly look brand new but the heels ripped . I dunno if I will get another Keen shoe , I am seeing some of their newer stuff has some bad ratings . Still I 'd take them over almost anything Teva , but not at full price . I guess I would take another shot for $ 50 or $ 60 ... but for $ 100 they need to last more than a season .
 I returned the pair I bought - Sizes run way smaller than normal - You are best to try them on for sizing in a regular walk-in store first
 This past summer , while wearing ` open toed ' water sandals , I accidentally pulled off the nail of my big toe while wading my kayak out of some shallow rapids just above Cochran Shoals on an urban stretch of Atlanta 's Chattahoochee River . Several of the other paddlers regularly wore Keen shoes and highly recommended them . So , although expensive , I took the plunge and purchased a pair.On the first pair I ordered and received at the end of August 2012 , one of the pull loops above the instep was only sewn on the bottom of the loop , not the top . I returned those and promptly received a new pair . Since then , I 've worn the replacement pair 6 or 7 times paddling other sections of the Chattahoochee River , basically getting in and out of the kayak at the put-in and take-out , as well as casual wear at home and around town 3 to 4 times a week for the past 3 1/2 months . They 're very comfortable and I really like the support and , of course , the toe protection.However , yesterday while eating lunch , I noticed the stitching on the left shoe was loose and pulled out where the outside foot-bed tab meets the back ankle strap just below the ankle.These expensive shoes -LRB- $ 104.95 including original shipping -RRB- have not seen any strenuous use like hiking or extensive creek walking , etc. . Given the first pair had a manufacturing defect right out the box , and this second pair starts falling apart in less than 4 months of casual use , while comfortable and great while they lasted , I recommend you find an alternative manufacturer 's product.Because Amazon 's full refund return date has expired , I 'm out the $ 104.95 , I 'm unsatisfied with Keen 's products , and now I need to find and purchase a replacement product in time for our traditional New Year 's Day paddling trip .
 I bought these to take to Jamaica . I had read all the reviews and they sounded like a great pair of shoes.I put them on and in a few minutes of just standing my feet were hot . I could n't believe how hot my feet got just standing in one place . I walked back and forth across the room and my feet were cool as long as I was walking.The the footbed of the shoe was hard and slightly pebbley . After I took them off the bottom of my feet were tender.I was a little disappointed in them . Since the shoes were not cheap I decided to return them.That same day I ordered a pair of Teva Omnium shoes . The Tevas arrived a few days latter and I love them.My recommendation is pass on these shoes and for about the same money buy a pair of Tevas .
 Nice sandal . But buyer be aware . These run ridiculously small . I 'm on the small size of a 10 and could n't even get my foot into the sandal . Took a size 11-1/2 for a decent fit . Before you buy try a pair on at a local merchant for correct sizing . Amazon 's prices are low for this product but these Keen 's run at least one size smaller than labeled .
 I bought this Sandals for the sole purpose of kayaking which i do n't do that often , the soles are not even starting to show any use and the sewing is coming a part in 4 places , I 've probably used this sandals 20 to 30 times not more .
 I bought these shoes for a 2 week hiking vacation in Utah . I only wore these shoes during the trip . I was happy with the comfort of the shoe however the quality was subpar . Also at the end of the day my feet really smelled bad . I felt that with sandals my feet would get enough air to breath unlike full on hiking boots . At the conclusion of the trip the stitching on the back strap of the shoes had come undone and was very loose . Not something I would expect for a shoe in this price range . I was pretty happy walking through water in these shoes . They never came off and the grip on the bottom held up pretty well .
 They were my size in length , but so short in height at toes , that they smashed my toes and they were very heavy for a sport shoes . I bought Sperrys and love them .
 I bough these as a gift , but was surprised when the recipient mentioned an uncomfortable lump in the sole of the left shoe . This is something I might expect in the $ 15 Wal-mart shoe , but not in this shoe which retails for $ 95 .
 Keen Newport SandalMy first Keen sandals lasted years . I actually wore the heels out of the soles through many years of wear . My newest Keens , bought in march 2011 , suffer stitching failures on both sides of the ankle , both sandals , where the back ankle strap attaches underneath the logo flap on the sides of the ankle . Sadly , as both sandals failed in the same area , this is a quality issue . These sandals have proven to be not worth the cost . I will ask Keen to replace them and if they do , I will be satisfied . if they do not , I will not shell out this amount of money for a sandal that does not last five months .
 I bought these to go canyoneering and hiking . My Teva 's did n't have toe protection and the font of my foot would pop out.The sandals fit a bit tight at first and have become more comfortable as I wear them . I have a wide foot and these fit great for wide feet . They do n't dry as quickly as I had hoped . They do n't grip wet rocks as well as I had hoped either.These have become my go to sandals for outdoor activities.New Comments 2.22.11 The seams tear out easily . I wish KEEN had a better warranty .
 I 've had these sandals for about a year . My brother swears by them and is on his second pair . First , they are very comfortable , and you forget you have them on . I like the closed toe design , which helps keep stones and sticks from getting in under your feet . That said , I will never buy another pair of these . Why ? They smell more than any other sandal I 've worn . I 'm 60 + and have had my share of sandals . These are the worst regarding smell . On a recent road trip w / my wife and brother , if one of us took our Keens off in the car , the windows went down and complaints went up ! We laughed about it , but it was irritating nonetheless . Sure , washing them helps , for awhile . Depending on how often you wear them , you may need to wash them weekly . The ` anti-microbial ' treatment of the sole is a laugh . I 've had Merrell 's that have never had this problem . And my leather-insoled sandals never smell . I 've read so many other complaints about the smell of these sandals , that I know it is a problem . And I do n't think we need to hear about washing/powdering our feet as a solution . The solution for me is to look for a different brand of sandals .
 These began to make my feet smell in the first week and have now begun to come unstitched . Did n't have this problem with the first pair I had for five or more years . Whatever corners they are cutting now make them a rip off .
 I am a great supporter of Keens . However this model is cut differently than the last two pair I bought and is not comfortable .
 I was n't to conviced but I was talk into getting them by my girl as she heard they were great shoes . I wore them for a week or two and loved them . Great sandle but then the stitching started to come apart . I 'll sew them up myself . Almost does n't pay to have to ship them off this time .
 I like the Keen concept , but they are cheaply built and unacceptable as a beach sandal . I have the black model and they have turned a dark purple . The sun or salt water may have caused the change . I wore them everyday during my Culebra vacation . The shoes are not sturdy enough to use on a gravel beach . When I hiked a rocky path , I had to be careful or I would twist my ankle . My companion wore Teva sandals they proved to be a better casual sandal .
 Three days after ordering this product , so I 'm not sure if the product is good or bad , but the vendor surely is something to be desired.Here it is 7 days since I 've ordered this item and the shipper has yet to give any idea when this will ship . Funny there was only 1 pair left when I ordered and something tells me that 2-3 weeks into waiting I 'll get an email they were out-of-stock .
 I ordered this pair of shoes for my husband 's birthday . He is a 10W so I ordered a size 10.5 thinking it would be plenty big . My son has a pair of Keen 's and they ran true to size . Well I was wrong . So I followed the instructions on the shipping label I got from Backcountry -LRB- an Amazon vendor -RRB- to exchange them for the next size up . Backcountry credited the return , but did not notify me that they received/processed the exchange . When I called to ask if the larger size was on the way , they said since it was purchased through Amazon they would not pay the shipping on the way back . So now I 'm out $ 12 for return shipping , no shoes , and very disappointed at the lack of coordination between Amazon and its vendors . I will not be ordering anything like this on Amazon again !
 Great concept , but poor quality . Tore apart at the seems after one use ; a moderate 8 mile hike in the woods . These would be such a better product had they had better craftsmanship . Definitely not worth $ 100 if you plan on doing any actual hiking with them .
 First off these sandals are insanely comfortable and wonderfully versatile . By the look of them you 'd think they were well made and rugged ... and the soles are , the upper however is not.The nylon webbing that looks as though it crosses at the ankle to provide strength actually stops just under the fake suede and spandex and is only held on by those 2 rows of thread . Because of this my pair lasted less than a week of mixed use on a boat and on land walking 5 miles at most before the heal webbing tore off.If the webbing actually met and crossed in the ankle they 'd be perfect , unfortunately they chose not to do that . I 'd call this a design flaw but it was clearly done on purpose though I ca n't imagine saving 1 inch of nylon webbing would make or break the cost of the Sandals.At least the return policy is great , there was absolutely no problem getting my money back , customer service was wonderful .
 I 've owned these sandals for a couple of years now . They may be an excellent dry-hiker sandal but they are not good in mixed environments.I have found that the soles of these sandals become an almost frictionless surface on moist rocks , stairs , etc. . I took a bad fall in a tidal pool in Costa Rica two years ago and almost lost it on some wet stairs next to a swimming pool in Rio this year . I know , it takes me some time to learn a lesson . Thus , if your intending to get these for water/boating shoes , you need to look for something with a Vibram sole or some soft material , not these !
 I bought a pair of these exact same shoes -LRB- size 10 -RRB- 2 years ago . They lasted two whole years and are still very wearable . I 've just worn the tread off.I ordered a new pair with great confidence , and waited for delivery . That is where the pros end . The pair I received in the mail were MUCH MUCH smaller , AND two different sizes ! The left one did fit , very tightly , but I figured it was because they were new . The right one did not fit at all . I compared them to each other and the two shoes were different sizes . They were both marked US size 10 . I then compared them to the old ones that were considerably larger and also marked US size 10 . My old ones were also marked as made in the U.S.A. and the new ones were from china.I called a friend that had also recently bought a pair of Keen shoes from REI.com . They were two small for him as well , and he said one was smaller than the other ... Keen , what has happened ? You went from AWESOME to LAME in two years ? I will not be buying anymore Keen products anytime soon . I have returned these shoes to amazon , and can not review these as positive in any way .
 My H2s were very good on a Grand Canyon river trip a couple of years ago that included maybe 20 miles of hiking and a fair amount of stressing of the shoe . At day 9 the stitching began to loosen . Fortunately , that was at the end of the trip . I did n't consider repairing them myself ; it was pretty clear stitching all over the shoe was loosening . I got a refund and would need confirmation that the manufacture of Keens had changed and improved before buying any more of them .
 The last pairs of Keen sandals I bought , for my wife and me , were thoroughly appreciated as to durabilty and comfort , but said to say , the ones we ordered this time were inferior in every respect . The sizes were marked the same , unfortunately they appeared to be meant for children . The material was overly lightweight and strange , definetly unlike the ones we had bought originally , which were made in the USA.Yours truly , Dennis Mora
 I 'm in the process of returning the second pair . The stitching pulled out in exactly the same place on both pairs . The first pair made it 25 days . The second did n't make it 2 weeks . Completely out performed by a pair of Walmart Earthshoes . Beyond that they collect any loose material under the toes . Walk through a field of grass in seed and after 2 steps they 're full .
 i purchased the Keen Newport H2 and within the first 2 weeks of use the stitching started unraveling through out the sandal-i contacted Keen directly and they chose to insult me because i mispelled a word in my response to them.If you research Keen -LRB- Google
 I bought these shoes for a Grand Canyon River Trip . I liked the comfortable footbed , the rubber cap over the toe , and the siped soles . I broke them in on a 3 day San Juan River trip , and they were fine . They gave good traction on wet rocks and worked well for a 2 mile hike.Then I took them on a 16 day Grand Canyon Trip . After a few days , the shoes stretched and I had to pull the shock cords tighter and tighter to get them to hold my feet . The loose ends of the shock cords dangled so long I sometimes tripped on them.The real kicker came on Day 10 . The stitching that connects the straps around the ankle came out . There was no reason for it , the thread was not worn or abraded . It looked like the stitches just pulled through . I noticed it on one side of one shoe a stitched it back together . Then I looked at the other shoe and it was falling apart in the same spot , but on both sides of the ankle . The January 18 , 2011 review by Tom explains the problem perfectly.These shoes cost nearly $ 100 and lasted a total of about 15 days . The Keen web site says these shoes are designed for `` Hiking '' , but they are not dependable . I could have been 5 miles up a side canyon when the shoes failed.A companion had a $ 12 pair of Ozark Trail river sandals from Walmart , and they were still in great shape when the Keens fell apart.Keen and they absolutely refused to provide a refund , their warranty only offers to replace defective shoes . But I do n't trust their shoes anymore.DON ' T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE SHOES .
 The reviews in various running magazines purport these shoes to be for the heavier runner . They are no such thing . Imagine strapping a couple of pine boards to the bottom of your feet and trying to run and you get a pretty good idea of how these shoes feel . They are extremely firm -LRB- and I do mean extremely -RRB- . Also , they have the least forefoot cushioning I have ever seen in a shoe including dress street and work shoes . Even though mine are fitted properly the bottoms tend to slap my forefoot as I run . Heavier runners beware !!! I am 250lbs and run fine in cushioned shoes . The Adidas Nova Cushions work great and are cheaper . They are , however , not as cool looking which is what probably sells these shoes . These , like so many other shoes today are designed to appeal to kids . Serious runners beware . My Ken Griffey Jr 's make better running shoes since the cushioning in the bottom is much better while still being `` firm '' . They also weigh about the same and the stiffness is about the same . Forwarned is forarmed .

 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .

 I own a pair of the -LRB- Men 's -RRB- leather Keen Newport sandals , and I feel that this sandal is of poor design . Aesthetically , this is a very visually appealing , stylish , attractive piece of footwear , but it just did n't perform practically.My sandals have been on two Boundary Waters -LRB- of Northern Minnesota -RRB- trips , and a couple of hikes , and I have to give them an all-around and overall grade of `` A '' for aesthetics and visual appeal , a `` B '' for comfort , but an `` F - '' for functionality.They are a good-looking and comfortable sandal for -LRB- relatively -RRB- dry flatland hikes , and I 'd say that this is where these sandals are best suited.The traction , at least on mine , is terrible , and extremely slippery on any rock surface -LRB- wet or dry -RRB- . This becomes extremely dangerous when portaging gear . The traction in water -LRB- which is expected to be less than on land -RRB- was terrible in my experience , and created several slips -LRB- and even a few falls -RRB- on both of the Boundary Waters trips that I wore these particular sandals on.Another low point is that they do n't dry quickly . My feet were wet for each entire trip that I used these sandals for , which can become a hygiene and health danger , especially where a lot of hiking is involved.Overall , this is a good and sturdy everyday-wear sandal , and `` OK '' for some dry , flatland hiking . Mine , although nearly new , have been `` retired '' , and are mainly used for running out the trash , mowing the lawn , and a little bit of casual wear for a chic `` Outdoors '' look . But , in my experience , and at the advice of my -LRB- very seasoned -RRB- expedition/trip partner , when looking for a good , well-made , high traction , quick drying -LRB- and true -RRB- water sandal , the best bet is to look into a pair of Chaco water sandals.I ca n't disagree . For wet and/or dry land , it 's tough to beat the traction , comfort , breathe-ability , and overall function of the Chaco water sandal , and they cost less than my Keens did.Keen makes good sturdy products , and I 've owned other Keen products -LRB- trail hiking shoes , etc. -RRB- that I would n't hesitate to recommend , but these sandals just do n't perform the advertised function to the best of my experience.And , to note , I met another person in the Boundary Waters -LRB- again , of Minnesota -RRB- wearing almost identical design to mine -LRB- except a Women 's sandal -RRB- , and she had relayed the exact same disappointments as I had with these shoes , and even though hers -LRB- as well -RRB- were brand new , she was going to also be `` retiring '' her sandals after their first , initial trip for all of the same reasons that mine have been `` retired '' . It 's not a bad `` casual '' sandal , but , for me , it 's just not much more than that , either.Something like a Chaco or a Teva are simply better designed as outdoor use wet and dry land sandals.Update : In looking at Chaco water sandals , I found that if you custom order them -LRB- which costs about $ 25 more than their retail sandal -RRB- they will make any model that they offer with any color strap that you 'd like , and they make these -LRB- custom -RRB- sandals in the USA . The other models are outsourced and imported back to the USA , but not the custom sandals , which will be made in Colorado.For me , it 's worth the extra $ 25 to get an American-made product .
 Have gone through 2 long return processes , as the Sandals coming first from Shoe Structures , and then returned due to the color being a dark GREEN . Then talking to you guys and trying to figure out the problem so as to order another pair the right color . The pair turned out to be the right pair but a wrong dye color -LRB- GREEN -RRB- . The reason this was known was the soles of the Sandals I bought were solid black and did n't have a strip of colored sole between the foot and the black sole . My Newport Leather Bison were the only sandals with a solid black sole , thereby concluding that it was a dye problem coming out of Keen Sandals that way , and Keens quality control allowing a big shipment of the wrong color sandals go out . The second pair I ordered was from Backcountry and the same problem occurred as they were dark GREEN again and another long wait as they went back UPS ground and taking 2 weeks each time for the money to go back on the . com Card account . Thats the other problem as I could n't in conscience buy the right pair straight from Keen until all my refunds were in order and back on my account . It would be nice if the Sandals could have gotten right back to amazon and the credit promptly debited , but the wait is long and the process is reversed , as it speedily comes to you but slowly goes back . Now that a month later and 2 shipments of sandals returned to two different sellers I can now go to the manufacturer where I 'm sure to get the right color as they allowed the wrong color to go out of their doors in the first place . Being disabled and 59 I 'm trying to get used to shopping online and I 'm learning it takes a lot of patience . Returns are not profitable thereby being slow , and taking the buying excitement out of picture altogether . Sincerely Jerry Johnston
 Mine is of very poor quality . Had the sandals for just over a year . Probably less than 5 months of use during Canadian summers.Now the stitches are coming off in two locations -LSB- ... -RSB- -RRB- . I expected the sandals to last longer than than .
 I so-o wanted these to work for me as they are stylish and rugged . Unfortunately , they were too narrow for my regular 10.5 foot . -LRB- A Keen lace-up of that size fits me perfectly ! -RRB- They also felt stiff regardless of how much I tried to break them in . Further , as the insole is designed for draining away water , it was not as comfortable as I would have liked for normal wear on the streets or gentle trails .
 When I opened the box . The box had everything correct on it . They had put wrong style shoe and color shoe in the box . Now I have to return them .
 soles started wearing down fairly quickly.at the 1 year mark they were nearly slick on the bottom , this after wearing them about 2-3 times a week . i wo n't put them on when it 's rainy outside because stepping in any amount of standing water is like hitting an oil slick.won ' t buy these again
 I think the shoes look great . They were exactly what I was looking for . They are n't comfortable , but they 're not exactly uncomfortable either . My major problem with them is that they wore out rather quickly . I 've owned these shoes for 6 months now and I wear them about 3 times a week . The tread on the shoes is nearly gone . They are quite dangerous when walking on wet surfaces . I would not recommend these shoes unless you plan on replacing them in 6 months .
 The comfort level of these shoes is neither great nor poor , just average . What does stick out however is shoe life . These shoes lasted less than six months , where I usually get 12-18 months out of a pair of timberlands or Doc Martens . The insole wore through in about two months and and the tread was worn completely flat at the end of six months . The laces continually shifted to one side . Overall , not impressed at all . Now wearing a pair of Cabelas house brand oxfords that are head and shoulders better .
 I bought these shoes at a department store , not at Amazon.Firstly , they are rather comfortable . However , when worn with either slacks or jeans they tend to look rather cheap and scuff quite easily making them look even more cheap rather quickly to the point where they will also cheapen any outfit/clothing you wear them with.The odd shoe string hole devices on the top make the shoe laces wear and thin-out very quickly , and after a short while the laces refuse to stay tied . The sole appears to have overall average wear , however the upper leather portion becomes unacceptably scuffed and worn to the point where they simply take on a very worn vinyl like appearance ; and after a few weeks I have grown really tired of their cheap vinyl-plastic-like look and feel to where I just will not wear them anymore.Dockers usually makes great shoes , however , these particular shoes are simply crap and totally not worth the money.Check out other Dockers shoes , but my advice is to bypass these shoes and do not waste your hard earned money.These shoes are CRAP !
 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .
 The reviews in various running magazines purport these shoes to be for the heavier runner . They are no such thing . Imagine strapping a couple of pine boards to the bottom of your feet and trying to run and you get a pretty good idea of how these shoes feel . They are extremely firm -LRB- and I do mean extremely -RRB- . Also , they have the least forefoot cushioning I have ever seen in a shoe including dress street and work shoes . Even though mine are fitted properly the bottoms tend to slap my forefoot as I run . Heavier runners beware !!! I am 250lbs and run fine in cushioned shoes . The Adidas Nova Cushions work great and are cheaper . They are , however , not as cool looking which is what probably sells these shoes . These , like so many other shoes today are designed to appeal to kids . Serious runners beware . My Ken Griffey Jr 's make better running shoes since the cushioning in the bottom is much better while still being `` firm '' . They also weigh about the same and the stiffness is about the same . Forwarned is forarmed .

 I would definitely recommend getting a size AND width larger , as these fit very snuggly .

 I also ordered these thinking they were the Romika , mokasso 102 for women . And , I returned them . They did not feel at all like the real thing , the romika 's . I am really disappointed they are not making these anymore ! : -LRB-
 First of I ordered them from the Footsmart catalog and not from amazon , the reason I mention this is because I want to warn you all that they do NOT pay for return shipping ! I had big expectations for these because of the high price -LRB- I usually never pay more than 25 . - for any house slippers -RRB- I specifically wanted good quality slippers with a great built-in arch support ... as far as I can say is it does not have any arch support ! I also do n't consider them soft or cozy ; they feel rock hard on my feet . They are definitely not worth the money and are why too overpriced . 15 . - walmart slippers are 10 times better than those . They only good thing about them is that they look good and the none slip rubber soles ; at least you ca n't fall on your butt to easily when you walk on tiles or wood.I would say save your money .
 I bought this show because it was the closest thing I could find to the Romika 's that I 'd had and wore out . I could no longer find the Romika 's so I tried this shoe . The Europedica was ill-fitted with poor construction . Bah Humbug !
 I have an old pair of the original Romikas . I have to give them up because the soles are worn through . The uppers are still in great shape . This style , Europedica 5250 , is touted as the replacement . They are expensive , and do not fulfill as replacements . I wore them inside and they stayed on my feet , but as soon as I wore them outside , one flew off my foot when I took a step . I could not return them because I had worn them outside . They do not mold to the foot as my old Romikas did , and they do not stay on my feet . Europedica 5250 does not conform to my feet , but simply stretches out . I would not recommend them .
 I realize it 's UGG and so what you 're paying for is the name but the company could make an effort to try to make them worth at least 80 % of the price , but no , the soles are so stiff and un-giving that when you walk your heel rides up and down out of the clog . Also would it hurt or cost them so much to add some arch supports ? There is absolutely none so unless you 're one of the lucky few who have strong arches , you may limit the time you have these on , or do as I did and purchase supports .
 The soles are so very , very thick and ridgid Walking was uncomfortable as the shoe did not flex with my foot . The size was fine but on every step my heel almost came out of the shoe . Looked nice but !!!

 These were not comfortable for me . I have a bunion on one foot so the adjustable straps were good but after an hour or so on my feet , they hurt . I just have a really hard time finding shoes that do n't hurt my feet and these were not them .
 Propet Women 's W0001 Breeze Walker SandalThis shoe is advertised as a walker , but it did not give my feet enough support for me to walk across the street in them . I was very disappointed and returned the shoes . The return was easy , and I appreciated the service I received , just not the product .
 Looked like they were substantial sandals . I looked at the pictures very carefully , though what I could not see until they arrived was the poor finished product in the top strap . It was not rounded and finished off soft , rather it was rough along the seam edges and therefore it would give blisters rubbing on the top part of the toes . Shame , other than that it was a decent sandal .
 The sandal is stiff and the quality is so so . The original price is marked much way too high compared to the quality .
 I purchased these knowing they would fit because I had a pair in another color , but I was wrong they were at least 1/2of a size too large . I returned them but had to pay the postage . I feel like that is unfair because they were sized wrong .
 The product runs large and the process of trying the exchange for smallersize is just about impossible . I am still trying to get the shoes back in a half size smaller . They would be o.k. if they fit .
 These shoes run much smaller than Clark 's . I was very disappointed and ended up stuck with them because I could n't get to the post office to return them within the 30 days .
 PRODUCT WELL MADE , SIZED PROPERLY , LEATHER UPPERS SUPPLE AND NICE . HOWEVER , SOLE WAS VERY HARD AND UNCOMFORTABLE TO WALK IN . STRAP WAS DIFFICULT TO BUCKLE FOR ME , AND THERE WAS NO ARCH SUPPORT AT ALL
 This shoe looks like my regular diabetic walking shoes , but the quality and workmanship is very poor.The straps were made with such thin leather , that when walking in my livingroom , the straps actuallycut my skin over my ankles and toes . Had to send them right back . Beware of copy cat items whenpurchasing items for yourself .

 Even though these shoes have the same model number and design I 'm used to , the leather material and feel are n't the same . Too bad ... I guess I 'll have to look for a new shoe .
 I bought these shoes hoping it would let me wear high heels again due to the fact I ca n't after my ACL surgery a few years ago . But they just pinch my toes and the side of my feet from the cheap plastic strap . Also they are n't very comfortable to walk in . I was hoping because they were Dr. Scholl 's shoes they were help my knee and feet , but I was wrong . These shoes killed my knee and feet within an hour . A waste of money in my book .

 We received the Crocs , which are my son 's favorite shoe to wear . However , when he wore them to school the next day , one of the straps broke and I had to run a different pair of shoes to him at school . We are hoping to return them and get a new pair -- that will last longer than two hours .
 Croc strap broke the first time it was worn . Not pleased with this product at all .
 I have bought several pairs of crocs and these did not appear to be original crocs . I always buy the same size and these arrived way too big , how could the same size be too big if these are original crocs ? Had to send back and pay for shipping , not very happy and will only buy crocs from the original website .
 Sorry . I bought them as a gift and have a report that the holes up front are very uncomfortable especially for big toe . I will be returning , which I am bummed about , and , have probably learned not to buy a clothing item on line as a gift .
 I begin by saying I have worn Crocs `` Beach '' Men 's XXL for many years . They have always been excellent shoes ... UNTIL , I PURCHASED MY MOST RECENT PAIR . The first thing you notice is they are MADE IN CHINA.Without question the shoes from China are smaller . To the point of even being tight . The back strap ismore narrow than the previous shoes I purchased . The front part of the sole is not as thick . Overall , it feels like a cheap imitation . I may NEVER buy another Croc shoe .
 Est delivery date was 12/13 - 12/16 guess what date it is today ... 1/3/11 ... . it was going to be a nice Christmas gift for my son-in-law . . I was hoping for 2010 . To many other good companies out there to use this one again .
 i 'm very dissisafied with my crocs . they send the wrong size.so i 'm stuck with them .
 tengo mas de un mes que pedi mis cross y aun no me han llegado necesito saber q paa con ello por favor denme razon de ello ya q los tengo cargados en mi tarjeta y todo gracias
 Maybe I 'm too concerned about fashion , but there are shoes out there that are just as comfortable , and dont make me look like I work in a hospital . I see people wear these every day and I cringe when they walk by . I guess theyre good for people maybe 70 and older who need orthotic shoes and cant wear sandals to the beach .
 My non-Croc-type of footwear are more comfortable and better made than the real Crocs I bought recently ! Quite disheartening .
 I have worn Crocs for years . They are almost a must for diabetics . The ones on this page are made in China . The cheaper quality is immediately visible , the sizing is off and the last -LRB- shape of shoe -RRB- also appears different . I wish Amazon would clearly stipulate where stuff is made so we could have a choice .
 I wore these shoes for 1 day working in the garden . when I took them off the tops of my feet were inflamed with red bumps that scabbed over and were very tender to the touch , I could n't wear any shoes that touched the tops of my feet for almost 2 weeks.they were comfortable to wear , but the rash is still really bad after 2 weeks . I WO N'T wear them again ...
 I ordered size 8/9 since i wear a size 8 1/2 shoe , they fit my husband who wears size 11 . To top it off I ended up paying $ 6.00 for the return shipping . It will be the last time I order shoes from them .
 Do not waste your money on these they are cheaply constructed I received them today and the snap on the strap that holds them to your foot was broken and would not stay snapped together save your money I paid my money for broken merchandise again please save your money these are not constructed well at all
 I have bought several prs of crocs , but these were sized differently than the others which were unisex and thus mfor my size 11 feet were too small .
 I was very dissapointed with this product . I bought some beach crocs a few years ago and they were made in Canada . These were made in China . They are not the same quality at all . These are not cushioned like the others were , they are also smaller even tho they are the exact same size as the ones made in Canada . These are NO better than the cheaper `` knock offs '' you find in dollar stores .

 i like how it looked on the internet and fell in love with it when i saw it after delivery . however , it was way too big for my calves . like it was 2 times bigger than it should be . the sizing for my feet is ok , but this is made for people with big calves . i am small but not skinny . the boots even has some elastic fabric panels around it , which i think is n't necessary for it is really way too big . i was really upset because the boots really looked so nice and sexy , -LRB- love the shape and heels -RRB- but i look like a 5 year old wearing my mom 's shoes ! i gave it to my mother in law -LRB- and she was so happy -RRB- because i got it with free shipping and i am losing a lot anyways . wo n't order again if not sure about the size ! shoes not made for smaller built people !
 I bought these shoes to do aerobics in . They look good and are comfortable , but only to walk in . There is zero arch support and when I walk in them I feel as if my feet are flat on the ground . There is zero shock absorption and no cushion for doing aerobics . My old shoes that are 8 months old has triple the cusion of these new ones , but I ca n't use the old ones . The gym on the base here do not allow dirty shoes . They are 8 months dirty full of sand and dirt . I am really let down over this as it took me three weeks to have them delivered to my remote location . Now I have to look again .
 This shoe is great if your into bondage . The sole is very small and does not allow for your foot to naturally expand as you walk in the shoe . Wearing these shoes I feel as if I have ingrown toe nails . Shoe stretchers do not work either , it may provide some measure of comfort but this shoe needs to go back to the drawing board . Buyer beware ! If you are into ancient Chinese foot binding this shoe is for you !
 My boys really liked the boots , they seem comfortable & sturdy . Problem is that the eyelets that hold the shoelaces in place break easily . On one of the pair , the eyelet broke the 1st time he wore it . On the other , it lasted maybe a dozen wears . Hoping Timberland comes through , b/c too late to return to Amazon .
 I received these boots as a x-mas gift from my husband . They are beautiful , but useless , as I can not get my foot into one of them . They appear to be 2 different sizes although they are both labeled as a 10 . I had my sister who is a shoe size 6 try them on and she could barely get her tiny legs and feet into them .
 My niece was looking forward to these boots so much for her birthday , and was dismayed -LRB- to say the least -RRB- when they had a yellow color to them instead of being white or off-white as in the product picture . I do not know if it 's something to do with the way someone stored this item , but I would be very careful in retaining your receipt if you purchase these boots . I think they are really cute , and I know someone else that has them and LOVES them -LRB- and they 're not discolored -RRB- , so I hope no one runs into this problem !
 Beautiful boot ... however HORRIBLE customer service with company shoe was bought from.For that reason alone I must not give it a good rating . The boot was beautiful.I would n't suggest dealing with Shoe City .
 I received this boot as a gift . Its being returned immediately . The opening on the top of the boot is so small , I can almost get my foot in . But then the shaft of the boot is so tight that my foot wont go all the way in . Forget about wanting to tuck in your pant leg ... no way . There needs to be a zipper or something unless your a habitual legging wearer . So cute , but not wearable : -LCB-
 I love the bearpaw brand , but sadly this particular style does n't just run small , it could cripple . When these boots arrived I was totally psyched , but when I tried them on -LRB- 1/2 size larger than I wear -RRB- I lost layers of skin off the top of my foot . In the end felt like one of the ugly stepsisters attempting to try on the glass slipper ... yeow ! I 'll continue to buy bearpaw , just not any boot/shoe with this design . Needless to say these have since been returned .
 A friend of mine bought me these . Frankly , I was disgusted . She was uneducated about fur trading and trapping , and after I had showed her what the fur industry is REALLY like , she was appalled . Fur is disgusting . How would you like someone breaking into your house , stealing your children , and SKINNING them -LRB- alive -RRB- to decorate their feet . It 's gross .
 I was so hoping these boots would fit . I received the package , opened them up with much anticipation . I admired the rust color fur , and the feather band . Very cool design . I am not sure if the feathers are adhered well . The shoebox area is soft , kind of fuzzy . Very desirable boots . Certainly one of my favorite designs . Made incredibly small . I then put myself through an hour and a half frustration , trying to slide my size 6 1/2 foot into the boot . Shoe horns did n't work , no socks , socks , thin socks , nylon socks , nope . I tried putting them on , and putting my foot into them , nope . I tried every imaginable way of putting on a boot , then called Street Moda . She was extremely kind . Gave me a 15.00 credit on a different pair , but after the trouble I 've had with returning these -LRB- sent very prompt , pristine , delivery confirmation , priority -RRB- , and the company was n't there when the boots were delivered . They have 14 days now , to pick them up from the post office , or I 'll receive them , and have to pay for the shipping again . I 've called and spoke to them twice , I 've emailed them , emailed them from Amazon , and contacted them on Facebook . I 've never , ever had this much trouble with returning an item on Amazon . Beware of this company . I returned these within 2 hours of receiving them . Sad , cause I love them .
 Honestly i was expecting a bit better quality of the shoes than i have received.Thankfully i ordered the size 6 -LRB- mine is 4/5 - 5 -RRB- The color is much darker than on the picture -LRB- i ordered the color chestnut -RRB- and i have to take a glue out of edges stitches -LRB- between the sole and fur -RRB- . One plus
 i ordered these boots a few months ago and they turned out to be the wrong size . not what i expected because they ran small . i returned them , finally got the email that they were credited , but until this day have NOT received my refund . contacted seller AND amazon . . and nothing . ridiculous .
 After only about a month of daily use these boots already have cracks and holes in the upper where your toes bend . :-LRB- I love the look of the boots but the function is lacking . The feathers did come off , but based on the other reviews , I was expecting that . The feathers do n't contribute to the function but of course the structure of the upper does .
 I was pretty excited to see these marked down in Marshall 's , and even happier to see that they had a pair in exactly my size -LRB- 6.5 -RRB- . Unfortunately , I too had fit issues . I could n't even get my foot through the incredibly narrow , inflexible calf opening . So no go . A zipper or some elastic might make this work , but just look at the image ; you can see how constricting that band is.I 'd love to see a remake of this in something that zipped , tied , had frogs ... something to allow me to get my foot in !
 I am Steven By Steve Madden 's # 1 Fan , for fit , comfort , quality and style but this shoe did not work at all !!! It was painful to the point that there was no earthly way I could walk in them unless my feet were dislocated . I had to return them . The fit ran very snug and tight . I was very dissapointed because I have LOVED all my Steven shoes from pumps , peeptoes and sandals and I loved the animal print , but I just had to return them .
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .
 I decided to get a pair of Dansko clogs because I 've heard and read so much about them , and I do have significant foot problems , which limits the kinds of shoes I can wear . This basic model comes in a narrow , and it fits my foot well , as described . I like the way it rolls forward as you walk . The shoe has a bit of a platform bottom , so it puts you up a little higher than `` flats '' . I thought it was a nice change from my usual Birkenstocks and sneakers . I am leery about rolling an ankle in them , as many have reported , though , as I am a bit accident - prone . I was also leery about the hard foot bed , and my foot did seem sore after wearing them off and on . But my foot problems also can be off and on -LRB- but REALLY on when wearing the wrong type of shoes -RRB- . Overall I liked the look and feel of the shoe pretty well , and really wanted to love them . But after wearing them on a long day with a lot of errands , my soles were so extremely painful that I had to put lidocaine patches on them and take pain meds . So disappointed . The fit is good , and I ca n't get my orthotics into them . Maybe there 's a thin insert that would help ... suggestions ? Apparently my case is unusual , but I would like to see Dansko either 1 . Offer a `` soft footbed '' version , as Birkenstock does for some of its styles , or 2 . Make the insole removable , in case customers want to use their own custom orthotics.Meanwhile , I strongly recommend that if you have foot problems -LRB- mine are plantar fasciitis and tendonitis , aggravated by lupus -RRB- , and you want to try these clogs , do wear them around your house as much as you can for a couple of days , and see how your feet feel , before you decide whether to keep or return them . I wish I had known this , it would have saved me a lot of money and pain , so I Hope this helps someone ! -LRB- actually , this item IS available ; do n't know why it is listed as `` not available . -RRB-
 I can not see if `` made in China '' is stenciled in the upper and there is no serial number , but the shoes I bought from Footsmart could n't cut an 8 hour shift . I wore them around the house the day they came in the mail and they seemed fine , but after I wore them the following day at my busy waitress job , I felt crippled . The stitching around the sides dug into my feet and worse , the ball of my right foot is still sore 30 hours after having taken them off and my toes on that foot are still numb . I ca n't believe these are the same Dansko shoes so many rave about and just maybe they are not . After one wearing , they would not allow me to return them nor would they send me a different right shoe . Now I 'm just $ 100 poorer and have a pair of shoes I will never wear again in my closet . Great . My suggestion is that you buy Dansko 's from a company that takes returns in the event it does n't work out for you . I wish I had .
 I decided to replace my old Dansko clogs with this style and color . After wearing it for an entire shift at work , I developed blisters . I felt that the insole were hard . I was disappointed with this particular style . I like the color .
 These shoes were advertized as being very comfortable . Nothing could be further from the truth . They were so uncomfortable that I can no longer wear them . I even tried to have them professionally stretched twice , to no avail . They are very tight over the top of your foot . OUCH !! What a waste of $ 100 .
 I used to buy them for my whole office but , we have noticed a big difference in quality . The company use to be a lot more personably and cared about each customer . I had a very bad experience with one of the managers there . There are plenty of really good shoe companies so , bye bye Dansko .
 I just recently purchased a pair of the Dansko professional oiled leather clogs . When they arrived I tried them on , it was difficult to get them on they felt a full size smaller . The feel was stiff and hard not comfortable at all.I have a pair that I purchased in 1997 that were the same size as the new pair that fit perfectly and oh so comfortable.I put the 2 pairs together and it was quite obvious the new pair was a few inches shorter.I contacted Dansko and spoke with 2 different representatives who really had no explanation and suggested that I just return them and exchange them.My concern is was it that particular pair or has the sizing changed.I decided to do some research and have read that the new clogs are manufactured in China and the quality is not the same . I checked inside the shoe and it is printed made in China.I think my best bet is to return them .
 I seriously am not understanding the positive reviews on these shoes , but I fell for them and now I 'm sitting here with sore feet . I think some of the problems are unique to my situation while others could possibly be more universal , i.e. something for everyone to consider when thinking of dropping $ 100 + on these shoes . I 'll break the review down into `` universal '' and `` unique '' issues.Universal : - The bottom , i.e. insole , is hard . Maybe if this were n't the case , these shoes would be less painful for me . There just is not cushioning on the inside . I do n't get it . How are these shoes comfortable to anyone with no cushioning , and why do n't they have any ? - These shoes seem to come at least a size or half a size smaller than normal . This makes it difficult to reliably order online , and I am glad I did actually go to a store and try shoes on . Originally , I had called the store up to get the plain Dansko professional leather shoes set aside for me to pick up , told them my size and they held them for me . I got to the store , and those shoes were just too small and uncomfortable . Went a size up , and still ... could barely get my left foot in the shoe -LRB- my left foot is slightly larger than my right foot -RRB- . I asked if they had any Danskos not leathered and they said no ... leather , to me , makes shoes less comfortable because leather is more rigid , harder to stretch out and such . The salesman suggested the oiled Danskos , and they did work better ... but still felt a little too small , even a size up , particularly on the left foot . The salesman stretched out the left shoe , and it eventually felt doable , though not the most comfortable . But I 'd read there was a break-in period , so I went with it . Um , it seems like every time I take the shoes off and put them back on again , they have gone back to being as uncomfortable as the first time I put them on , i.e. they just do n't seem to `` break in . '' At least not quickly , i.e. within a week.Unique -LRB- and these things , as well as some positives about the shoes , are why I give 2 stars and not one -RRB- : - The shoe is uncomfortable , sometimes painful , across the top of my feet , particularly my left -LRB- larger -RRB- foot . I 've seen others say this , too , but I admit to having big , wide feet . I do not have little dainty women feet . I maybe should have asked for the men 's Danskos ... honestly , I do order men 's shoes at times because I have big feet and it 's hard to find women 's shoes in my size at times . But because I had to go up a size with these shoes , I ended up getting the largest size they come in for women ... and I feel like that size is still actually too small for me . It 's actually a little difficult for me to even get my left foot in the shoe , depending on the kind of socks I 'm wearing . Maybe if I could have gotten a better fit for these shoes , they 'd be more comfortable . With the shoes being not quite the right fit , I ca n't really even get cushion-y inserts into them that do n't make the shoes even more uncomfortable . Something to keep in mind for women with big feet.-The shoes are generally fine for about 3 hours or so , but then they start getting more and more intolerable . I work a job where I basically STAND in the SAME SPOT for 8 hours . Most reviews , if not all , I see on these shoes where people are being positive ... are from people who probably are walking and moving about for hours and hours . I do think these shoes are more comfortable when I 'm on the move , though I 'm still not sure I 'd be able to say , if I moved in these for 8-12 hours , things like I see other people writing , i.e. `` my feet feel as good as they did when I first put them on 12 hours ago . '' I really doubt it , especially with , again , the rigid leather material and the hard insole . But I ca n't at all say they feel as good as 8-9 hours before work , with a job where I stand . Again , 3 hours is the ultimate for me . 7 hours in , my feel are hurting to the point where it 's tough for me to concentrate , and all I do is think of excuses I can make in order to sneak off and sit down somewhere . One day , I actually changed out of these shoes and finished my shift in regular shoes because it was so uncomfortable . I have gotten to the point where I take the shoes off regularly during my shift and just stand in my socks/try to stretch out the muscles in my feet . Keep this in mind if you have to stand for hours and hours , and are considering these shoes.-I pretty much always feel as if I 'm going to fall when I wear these shoes . It 's not really the issue others have mentioned , i.e. the heel bouncing up and down in the shoes . It 's how they feel like high heels . If you 're not used to wearing heels ... I 'm finding it just odd . I feel like I do n't have control of my own balance.-I think it might also be important to note that I 'm overweight . It might very well be the case that neither these shoes nor any other are going to help anyone who is putting a lot of weight on their feet for a long time.Positives-With every other kind of shoe , my feet are not the only thing hurting at the end of the day . My back , my legs , even below my stomach area all hurt . I do n't get that with these shoes -- nothing hurts but my feet when I wear these shoes.-I feel completely debilitated after work with other shoes , i.e. I can barely stand or walk for hours after work . With these shoes , my feet do hurt bad after work -LRB- for hours -RRB- , but I can still manage to get around ... I just would rather not ...
 I love the way these shoes make my feet and back feel . I get great arch support and there is plenty of room for my toes to wiggle around . They are fantastic for long hours on your feet.BUT , they are terrible for my ankles . When I wear these shoes I roll my ankles all the time and have fallen a couple of times . They are especially bad for me in a hospital setting where there are cords and such that I risk stepping on . I am also afraid to walk/run in them because I am afraid I will wipe out and fall down.I really want to love these , but I feel that the base of the sole needs to be a bit wider for stability .
 I bought the Dansko Pro in a wide width because I needed a great pair of sturdy , comfortable shoes to work in . I have owned another pair in the past and was really happy with them , so I did n't even question my decision to order this shoe . No place in my area carries this brand , and the closest place does n't carry the wide width , so I ordered them online . Big mistake on my part!One shoe fits great but is n't nearly as comfortable as my other pair had been , but the other shoe barely fits . It 's really tight all the way around and makes my foot go numb . I realize that they 're handmade , but there should be some way for the company to ensure that both shoes are made similarly enough that they can actually fit as a pair . I was so disappointed that I had spent so much money on a pair of shoes I ca n't wear , for multiple reasons . I had to buy a different pair of shoes and they 're more comfortable , but I still have n't found any that offer what I 'm looking for or what my first pair of Dansko shoes did .
 My wife ordered these to wear to work . She is on her feet almost continually . When they did n't fit as well as the REAL Dansko 's she was replacing , we looked inside and saw why . MADE IN CHINA was stenciled on the uppers . We got our money back but no wonder they were such a good `` bargain '' . Always make certain they are not knockoffs when you buy . The original Dansko 's are great shoes for working people .
 I work in restaurants , so I 'm on my feet for 6-14 hours a day , and I heard so many good things about Danskos I thought I would buy a pair . They were really comfortable for a long time , but the first pair I bought was patent leather , and the leather was tearing around the toe and it was squeaking while I walked . So I returned those and got a plain ol' leather pair , and those too were ok for a good 6 months . Now , not even a year later , the colour on the inside of the shoe is rubbing off on my socks , turning my white socks nearly black , and even going through and staining the soles of my feet . On top of that , I come home every night and my feet are stiff and swollen , and I 'm starting to have aches in my knees . I got some gel inserts and they 've helped marginally . I understand I may be putting quite a bit of stress on these shoes , but I think a 120 dollar pair of shoes that markets itself as `` occupational shoes '' should not be doing this in less than a year of use . I wo n't be buying another pair in the future , to save my knees and my back .
 Dansko 's have a great reputation but buying them on line is a bad idea . Dansko 's need to be tried on as they are individually made and sizes are very difficult to judge . I ordered a pair that I thought would fit perfectly , they were too small and I had to reorder my shoes . And return the original pair . I made my initial order on August 29 , 2009 . Today is September 29 , 2009 and I have not received my shoes . All of my friends that wear Dansko 's love them but have urged me never to buy them on line again .
 This was my second pair of Dansko professional clogs and again , they did n't fit properly . I wear a size 10 and therefore purchased a size 41 on my first purchase . They 're extremely tight fitting across the top middle section of my feet and my feet were actually NUMB after wearing them for just an hour . I could n't stand it any longer than that and did n't want to risk permanent nerve or some type of circulatory damage to my feet . My feet also slipped out of the heels frequently . The second purchase was even worse ! I purchased a larger size , 42 , thinking that it would alleviate some of the problems and ended up barely able to even put my foot into the right shoe and could n't even get my foot into the left shoe at all . They were extremely tight and unforgiving . I HATE DANSKO 'S ! I could n't give them anything less than one star and would actually give that star for the way they look . I actually loved the color and style . They 're just poorly made for the price . I ended up buying Klogs brand which look very similiar to Dansko 's and cost about $ 10 less on average .
 They started out comfortable especially since I travel and work on the hospital floor supporting physicians and nurses during EMR implementations . I had a pair of reliable flats , but I needed something with a heel . It all went south when I went to pick up my rental car in San Francisco . Walking on the pavement , I sprained my ankle and fell in the lot . I simply attributed it to clumsiness and the slanted driveway . It was n't a bad sprain and I wore the shoes without any issues afterwards.That was until I parked my car in the cobblestone driveway and wiped out again when I hit the incline . This time it was a little more bloody . Ended up with a swelling , bloody knee , a tetanus shot and grounded by the Medical Clinic at the airport for three days . I concluded that I could n't possibly be that clumsy . I realized that the only thing that changed was my shoes and both times I wore them walking in a driveway , I went down . So if you must have them , be sure to stay on level ground.Mine went back to the store and I have an appointment with an orthopedics specialist .
 Was disappointed that these Dansko 's are not as comfortable as my other pair of Dansko 's . These run a little big and slide on my heel . Also , the top rubs the top of my instep and something about them makes the top of the bottom of my left foot sore . Will still try another pair of Dansko 's later , however .
 the clogs would have great if they were the correct color and came on time . I paid for expedited shipping and should have gotten them in 3 days . It took over a week and they were the wrong color . The shoe company was very nasty and refused to refund my shipping , and when i returned the shoes , they refused to give me a credit , claiming they never got them . UPS sent me the name of the person who signed for them at their store !!! This company is horrible , I would never order from them again . The seller was Shoes Central . Do n't order from them , they are awful . I would give them zero stars but that is not an option
 I have heard nothing but good things about these shoes but when I bought a pair and put them on , I just could n't stand them . I bought a half size larger because I have a wider foot but they just dug into my instep like a torture device . Perhaps they are only for people with narrow feet and low insteps .
 I have bought white pair few years ago and loved it so much I wanted another pair . However , I have recently tried 3 new pairs of Dansko clogs -LRB- all dark colors -RRB- and they all dye my socks . They are extremelly comfortable but I hated to see my white socks dyed after few hours of wearing the clogs . I returned the shoes -LRB- black and blueberry colors -RRB- and ended up with Dansko Nubuck in light blue . The inside is light brown . That too does dye my socks , but at least it is not black.It is still the most comfortable work shoe I have ever owned , but be ready to see your white socks black .
 I have n't even received my order and am furious with Amazon ! I was charged twice for my order by Amazon and when I called Customer Service I was told the first charge was a pre-authorization and I should contact my bank about getting it credited back . So I did call my bank and was told that if Amazon would send a fax explaining what had happened the bank would credit my account for the $ 99.99 . I again spoke to an Amazon Customer Service rep and was told they could submit my request to billing but it would take at least 3 days for my request to be processed . Word of wisdom
 I have worn Dansko 's for over 20 years and never had any problems . They have always been my favorite most comfortable shoes and well worth the cost . In the last year I have had 3 pairs of Dansko 's less than 3 years old fall apart suddenly . It is like the soles just disintergrated . I store my shoes in boxes w / silica packs to keep moisture at bay and keep the leather oiled and treated . I am very very diligent about my shoes and feel like they should last more than 2 or 3 years since they are only worn occasionaly . I will probably not purchase Dansko again anytime soon as I have found several links on the internet that this has happened to others also . I gather Dansko has changed the material for the soles in the last few years and it is common for this `` dryrot '' issue to occur .
 I bought this for my wife . I ordered brown , and I received old brown.She is a surgeon and needed to replace the previous right away . Because she needed the clogs NOW , and she could n't afford to wait another week for a replacement , she will be stuck with the wrong pair for a while .
 Do n't buy these from Amazon . My wifes pair arrived packaged nicely in the original box but it was clear that the shoes had been worn before . The leather on the left shoe was stretched by someone walking in them and they missed a spot when they wiped off the bottom . White is a hard color to clean dirt from so it was obvious . There was also a nice sweat/dirt line just inside the left shoe . If this pair would have been offered at a shoe store I would have asked for a different pair or a discount . I will no longer trust Amazon for a new shoe purchase .
 I like these shoes but recently they have gotten tight !! Or my feet are swollen I wear them with thin socks and they still are a pain
 Dansko 's quality has continually declined since their split with Sanita a few years back in 2007 . Sanita made the Dansko clogs for years until Dansko went their separate way and decided to produce their clog elsewhere , so now Dansko 's are now made in China , whereas Sanita 's are still made in Europe . The quality difference is VERY evident.Not realizing that Dansko was n't held to the same standard as it used to be I ordered a Dansko professional and the professional XP as well . They were so clunky , huge and heavy , I felt like a child wearing my dad 's shoes !! Plus the sizes on the Dansko 's were so inconsistent I was n't able to find a size that fit , even when I went to the Walking company store and tried on several different pairs of the same size , one 38 was almost right , the next was way too tight , one 39 was way to wide , the next just plain huge in every way.Dansko will accredit it to the hand made feature but those of us who have been wearing hand made clogs for some time can attest to the fact that it is so much more than that , Dansko is just not the same shoe that made it famous in the first place . Now it 's just poor quality . I wear a 7.5 US , sometimes an 8 which put me perfectly in a size 38 . Whereas a 38 used to fit me perfectly now they are too short and my big toe smashes every so slightly up against the end to the shoe when I take a step , well no biggie , I 'll just order up one size . So i ordered the 39 which was so huge it flopped off with every step , even with thick socks there was just no way to make them work . 38 's too small , 39 way to big . why the huge jump ?! I have a normal foot , never worn or needed to wear a narrow or wide ever in my life so when these shoes fit so incredibly wide and clompy , I knew that it was n't my foot but their shoe.But the most disappointing point of all was that the quality had noticeably declined.I had the same issue with the XP 's . And a little known fact about the XP memory foam version is that the memory foam base will only last a few months TOPS before going flat , and the cost to replace just the inserts is $ 40 a pair ... ouch ! So after I realized that Danskos would n't work anymore , I decided to search for another clog , that 's when I did some research and discovered that Dansko had made the break from the original maker of the shoe -LRB- sanita -RRB- . I did n't realize that you could actually order Sanita 's until then . That 's when I decided to try a pair of Sanita clogs instead . SOO happy that I did !!! Now I have the quality I remember in a size that fits perfectly . So for those of you on the fence ... try Sanita 's instead . THey were the makers of Dansko that made them famous in the first place . They are better quality , better materials , not made in China , and not so wide you can barely keep them on without sizing down to the point where they are way too small . You wo n't be disappointed . However , due take note because when I went to scrubs and beyond to try the KOI clogs -LRB- made by Sanita as well -RRB- to get an idea of sizing , I did chose to size up so now I wear a size 39 , but who cares ... the quality is back and they actually fit !!
 I was SHOCKED at how uncomfortable these shoes were , after having worn and loved Dansko brand for many years . I found out that the company changed manufacturers -LRB- made in China now -RRB- and the quality of both fit and comfort is so much more obviously underpar ... I literally could not believe how these shoes could pinch and hurt my feet so much in one evening ! I mean , we are not talking about high fashion platform shoes here.I have attached this info from the Sanita shoe website -LRB- the old Danish company that USED to make Dansko clogs -RRB- : `` For many years Sanita manufactured clogs for Dansko . The Sanita and Dansko relationship ended in the Fall 2007 . Since then , all Sanita manufactured products sold in the USA have been sold exclusively under the Sanita brand . `` There you have it . Save your money and your feet . Sanita still makes clogs , thank goodness . Dansko on the other hand ... same high price , but NOT the same shoes .
 I work in a pharmacy and I am on my feet up to 12 hours a day . I had heard so much about how great Dansko shoes are . I got this pair and I was so excited because they are a very nice looking shoe . I wore them 1 day and decided that there was just no way I could keep them . They are way to heavy . I was trying to find a shoe that would help reduce the swelling in my ankle an old injury I still have trouble with -RRB- . My feet were aching and my BOTH ankles were very swollen . Maybe it was just this style ? I have spoken with many nurses that love Dansko and would n't put on any other kind . But for me , I 'm going to have to go back to the Born Toby . Sorry ... I really wanted thee to work out .
 SanFran Jo says : I , too , noticed a difference in fit and also that the pair I recently purchased was made in China . I had to return my pair because they were not comfortable . I already have two other pair of Dansko Professional clogs , and they are very comfortable . I am disappointed in the comfort of the most recent pair I purchased . I have noticed that some of the clogs do say by Danita . Thanks to happy mommy mentioning Sanita , I googled Sanita clogs . Below is a statement found online from the Original Clogs website : For the last 17 years , all Dansko Professional clogs and all Dansko Stapled Clogs have been manufactured by Sanita in Europe . The relationship between Dansko and Sanita ended in August 2007 . Since then , Sanita entered the US market and is now distributing their products directly . If you are looking for the Original stapled clogs with patent number 0060240 stamped on the bottom -LRB- made by Sanita exclusively -RRB- , then look no further as our website features Sanita Clogs ' products exclusively.I ordered the `` original '' clogs by Sanita and they fit as comfortably as the two other pair I have . The number mentioned above is stamped on the bottom .
 first off for $ 120.00 there should not even be any vinyl on them but the plastic vinyl covering the piping is coming off after 1 month of use so i will need to use a black marker to hide it dansko was great till they left sanita now they are cheaply made in china , hungry , italy , and they dont even fit these are some of the problems i have found over the last 3 months i have tried aprox 50 pairs of dansko cabrio professional i should be waring a 37 -LRB- us size 7 -RRB- but now i cant , i need a 38 and most of the 38 are too small also 1 shoe bigger than the other in some pairs the left is tight and the right shoe feels great and in some pairs the right is too tight and the left feels great then after of 3 months and 50 pairs of trying on the pair i did keep the VINYL piping is coming off dansko is no longer good i will now only buy sanita COME ON DANSKO YOU ARE TAKING THE CHEEP AND EASY and you soon will loose customers
 2 consecutive blow outs of the Dansko oiled Cutter style shoes . The first pair split one of the soles at 10 months of use . This was in July of 2009 . Took them back to the store where they were purchased and they sent them back to Dansko to see if they would honor a replacement . They did , although the process took 4 months before I got the replacement pair . Fast forward to last Sept 3 2010 . After less than 9 months of usage one of the soles on the replacement pair not only split completely across the sole but separated on both sides . Plenty of usable tread on the soles so they were not worn out at all . So of course I take them back to the store they came from . Manager of the store calls me today and says they can not help me because now Dansko only has a 6 month warranty on failures and I have to contact them on my own . I 'll see what happens . Dansko = ExpensivePoorly made in China .6 Month warrantyEPIC FAIL !
 They are not comfortable at all really do n't like them . If I knew how to send them back I would .
 The shoes were very uncomfortable , hard , blistered my feet . And i discovered that the shoes of the same size and make are do not fit the same , maybe i should have bought them from a store . Never again
 I bought the brown oiled leather Dansko 's for a vacation to the UK and returned them promptly after getting back home to the US . I thought since I 've heard great things about these shoes and since Danskos are so ugly , they have to be comfortable . I was totally wrong !! These shoes proved to be the absolute worst choice in footwear for European travel and for those that have low arches!The Dansko 's work great for people with high arches , but I felt like I had a river rock jammed in my arch and the aftermath left me with intense pain in my arches and heels days after switching to my Crocs for the remainder of my vacation.The Danskos also have a thick , stiff arch which is a disaster when walking on uneven pavement or cobblestone as the shoe does n't give . I rolled my ankle countless times while walking on cobblestone and ended up with a mild sprained ankle on the first day of my vacation . I have very strong ankles , excellent balance -LRB- I 'm a yoga instructor -RRB- , and I 'm a lightweight so I 'm not the type of person that takes a step wrong or prone to rolled ankles.Last time I vacationed in Europe , I wore $ 20 clog Crocs and walked 10 + miles everyday without experiencing any problems over the cobblestone . I do n't think I 'll experiment with other shoes such as Danskos for the next vacation I take .
 I was so excited to finally purchase a pair of Dansko 's but I 've tried on clogs before and they always seem to run small . Given that information I went ahead and ordered a size larger than I normally would have . I wear a standard size 10 in US Women 's shoes , I ordered a size 11.5 US -LRB- 42 EU -RRB- in these and there is no way they are this size . I also have several pairs of Birkenstock shoes at size 41 that are longer than these . I wondered if perhaps they sent the wrong size in the box , but it is stamped quite clearly on the bottom of the shoe size 42 EU . It simply is not possible for me to fit my smaller foot -LRB- my left foot is smaller by about half a size -RRB- into these shoes . I am so disappointed as I really was looking forward to having my first pair of Dansko shoes that I 'd heard so many great recommendations on . It is my opinion that at the larger sizes these shoes run very small . I think perhaps one size larger may fit , however I still have n't decided if I 'm going to try a larger size . If I do , I will update my review with how that turns out .
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .
 I ordered two of these Diplomat Exclusive brushes made in Germany . What I got were two Star brushes made in Brazil . Not quite the same thing .

 These slippers are cute but the sole is VERY thin ergo , it 's like walking on concrete . There is no arch support . I would not buy them if either one of these things are an issue .
 I bought these shoes hoping it would let me wear high heels again due to the fact I ca n't after my ACL surgery a few years ago . But they just pinch my toes and the side of my feet from the cheap plastic strap . Also they are n't very comfortable to walk in . I was hoping because they were Dr. Scholl 's shoes they were help my knee and feet , but I was wrong . These shoes killed my knee and feet within an hour . A waste of money in my book .

 Normally 8 or 8.5 fits my feet . But the leather of this shoes is too rough . I first ordered 8.5 and I return it to replace by 9 . Even the size 9 is like a blade in my feet . When walking I feel scratching my feet but it looks very good . Make sure you order one bigger that your size .
 Great looking shoe , but the material at the tip of the shoe is synthetic and the sole is stitched to it . The walking motion of the sole directly contacts the tip and rubs a hole straight through it , exposing the end of your foot . I cant believe these are still on the market . Huge disappointment . Spend the money for something of higher quality because these are extremely cheap made . Not worth $ 25 in my mind . Madden lost a customer for life here !
 These are certainly handsome shoes though there are all kinds of construction issues . Also , do n't get them wet or wear them in winter weather or you will be throwing them out within a week , guarantee . I 'm not sure what they 're made out of , but they end up smelling unholy terrible afterwards . If none of this is enough of a deterrent , I would wear wear these shoes seldom and in dry , warm weather .
 the stitching at the top of the shoe came apart the first time worn . did n't wear until summer so the return period expired . very disappointed .
 These look great and are very comfortable . Having said that , the sole does n't come far enough forward to protect the toe which just happens to scrape the ground with every step . After wearing these maybe 6 times the leather on the toe is almost worn through . I would not buy these again .
 I generally like the shoe . It looks good and is comfortable . However , it is poorly made . The stitching is coming off after four months .
 I bought this shoe from a brick and mortar retailer , not Amazon , so my post may not pass the verified purchase test within Amazon . Irrespective there are good things and bad things about this shoe.The good . Nice leather . Cool Look . Interesting concept in a shoe , only problem is that too much stitching and finished leather like the Uppers are right along the outsole periphery or even the center of the outsole . In anything but the best weather and the smoothest of walking sufaces , this shoe will not last . I need a shoe that will survive the 1 -RRB- walk four miles on a sunny afternoon through the hillsides just because test as well as the 2 -RRB- run across the airport desperately trying to make my connecting flight because American airlines always arrives late into LAX test . On both accounts , this shoe would not cut it . The lateral extensions over the outsole are too exposed to abrasion and ultimate wear . The stitching starts to suffer , and the overall shoe bottom will start to look worse for wear after a few days of walking though some mildly damp streets after a SoCal rainstorm . If the outsoles were 10 % wider on each side , I suspect the shoe would have shown a lot more durability , but it did n't and so the shoe did n't last . Luckily , the brick and mortar retailer did give me a nice coupon towards the purchase of another set of shoes which I used to score some nice Florsheim Oxfords , so I am whole . I wish this shoe had more substance .
 Bought these shoes because I liked the look and needed a new pair of `` driving '' shoes after my last pair wore out after about 2 years of use . I 've had these for about 3 months and they are already falling apart . The rubber on the sole is falling apart , and the leather at the toe is peeling off . I would not recommend these as everyday business casual shoes .
 I have 2 of the exact same pairs of shoes purchased from Macy 's and the pair that I received from Amazon were not only missing insoles and the Steve Madden name anywhere on the shoes , but were fake plastic replicas from China . Completely unacceptable and now have to go through the pain of returning them .
 I have had these shoes for less than three months , and I only have worn them about 20 times in very light wear -LRB- to the store , around the house and such -RRB- . Both shoes are already losing their seams and falling apart . The covering on the leather was so thin it is showing through , and looks like they are three years old , not three months . My wife had ordered these before we read the other reviews , but we decided to give them a try anyway . I wish we had n't . What a hassle ! We are having to return them , and I would never buy another shoe from this maker again . They are garbage . I would have been better off buying some shoe at my local dollar store .
 the only good thing about these shoes is that their comfortable . but beware , they do n't last more than a week or two . the stitching on the bottom of the shoe gets worm out real quick , and then the shoe falls apart . its really not worth the money .
 Bought a pair of these about 5 months ago . Actually bought two ; one brown , one black . I wear the brown a lot more and they go with everything , but after about 2 months the bottoms wear out and fall apart . The bottoms now have holes in them . They shoes were great for a while , now they are going in the trash and will be buying from a different brand .
 I just do n't understand the business logic of manufacturers sometimes . Is it really worth it to save maybe $ 1 a unit and end up with a vastly inferior product?I bought these shoes at Macy 's and they looked amazing . They are a good combination of casual/dress that you can wear them just about anywhere.The problem with these shoes showed up about 2 months later . Apparently to save 15 cents in rubber per shoe , Steve Madden decided it would be a brilliant idea to use a perforated sole and cover the bottom with a thin layer of rubber . This gives the impression that you have 1/3 '' of rubber between your foot and the ground , but actually its 1/3 '' of rubber with a bunch of holes on it covered by a few mm of rubber . Unfortunately for you , that means that after a month or two this thin layer wears off and you start getting holes in the bottom of your shoes!Is rubber really that expensive ? I 'm paying $ 60 - $ 80 for these shoes . Seriously , spend $ 1/unit to make the soles more robust , charge me $ 5/unit more , and end up with a much better product and $ 4 more profit.If you 're interested in this style of Casual/Dress shoes I 'd suggest you check out some Sketchers . Not traditionally what you think of when you think of these kinds of shoes , but I 've had a very similar pair of Sketchers in white that look great for about 2 years now , and they 're still going strong.No more Steve Madden for me !
 The shoe is very handsome . I can tell a lot went into the design except for doing it 's job , i.e. protecting your feet . The shoe has no support and after a few months of normal wear a hole developed in my left toe on the outer leather . Not much longer did the irreplaceable thin leather foot-bed wear down to the rubber sole . If your intention is for the `` sole '' purpose of taking the Maserati out for a spin , then the shoe fits . If you plan on throwing the frisby around to impress the ladies with you mad skills , I suggest you do it barefooted .
 Very bad quality . The thread on side of shoe started tearing off on 1st day . Returned it immediately . Highly discourage any potential buyers .

 The reviews in various running magazines purport these shoes to be for the heavier runner . They are no such thing . Imagine strapping a couple of pine boards to the bottom of your feet and trying to run and you get a pretty good idea of how these shoes feel . They are extremely firm -LRB- and I do mean extremely -RRB- . Also , they have the least forefoot cushioning I have ever seen in a shoe including dress street and work shoes . Even though mine are fitted properly the bottoms tend to slap my forefoot as I run . Heavier runners beware !!! I am 250lbs and run fine in cushioned shoes . The Adidas Nova Cushions work great and are cheaper . They are , however , not as cool looking which is what probably sells these shoes . These , like so many other shoes today are designed to appeal to kids . Serious runners beware . My Ken Griffey Jr 's make better running shoes since the cushioning in the bottom is much better while still being `` firm '' . They also weigh about the same and the stiffness is about the same . Forwarned is forarmed .

 This shoe polisher does n't have enough speed or power to polish shoes !!! The brush does a decent job of applying shoe polish , however the buffer pad almost comes to a stop when you try to buff out the polish . It is impossible to get a shine on your shoes using this item .
 I 've bought this style and size of shoe many times before . These were at least a full size smaller than before and I had to return them . Though I asked for a replacement in a larger size I was given a refund and told to re-order . When I did that the price had increased by $ 11.34 . Bait & switch ?
 The labeled sizes on this model are incorrect . I 've been wearing Reebok Ex-O-Fit Lo 's for probably 15 years . I 've even bought them from Amazon before , although never the &#34; clean-label &#34; model specifically until now . I have several pairs from past purchases that are still new in the box , so I was able to directly compare the current version of the model with past versions . -LRB- I 've stocked up on them in case the line is completely discontinued ! -RRB- This version is much too small , at least a full size smaller than what is labeled . I can usually fit a 10.5 -LRB- US sizing -RRB- in my smaller foot for this general model , but with this particular version of the model 's sizing , I just barely fit 11.5 comfortably . The toe area also seems a little more tight generally -LRB- feels somewhat cramped , not just lengthwise -RRB- . Otherwise , the shoe seems to be very well made . I 've long wished there would be a version in which the Reebok label on the heel did n't stand out so prominently , so in that sense , the style of this version is an improvement .
 The process itself was fast , but the product was much too small.There was no indication that the sizes run small . So small , in fact , that I am filing a claim for a full refund .

 Looked like they were substantial sandals . I looked at the pictures very carefully , though what I could not see until they arrived was the poor finished product in the top strap . It was not rounded and finished off soft , rather it was rough along the seam edges and therefore it would give blisters rubbing on the top part of the toes . Shame , other than that it was a decent sandal .
 The sandal is stiff and the quality is so so . The original price is marked much way too high compared to the quality .
 I purchased these knowing they would fit because I had a pair in another color , but I was wrong they were at least 1/2of a size too large . I returned them but had to pay the postage . I feel like that is unfair because they were sized wrong .
 The product runs large and the process of trying the exchange for smallersize is just about impossible . I am still trying to get the shoes back in a half size smaller . They would be o.k. if they fit .
 These shoes run much smaller than Clark 's . I was very disappointed and ended up stuck with them because I could n't get to the post office to return them within the 30 days .
 These were not comfortable for me . I have a bunion on one foot so the adjustable straps were good but after an hour or so on my feet , they hurt . I just have a really hard time finding shoes that do n't hurt my feet and these were not them .
 Propet Women 's W0001 Breeze Walker SandalThis shoe is advertised as a walker , but it did not give my feet enough support for me to walk across the street in them . I was very disappointed and returned the shoes . The return was easy , and I appreciated the service I received , just not the product .
 PRODUCT WELL MADE , SIZED PROPERLY , LEATHER UPPERS SUPPLE AND NICE . HOWEVER , SOLE WAS VERY HARD AND UNCOMFORTABLE TO WALK IN . STRAP WAS DIFFICULT TO BUCKLE FOR ME , AND THERE WAS NO ARCH SUPPORT AT ALL
 This shoe looks like my regular diabetic walking shoes , but the quality and workmanship is very poor.The straps were made with such thin leather , that when walking in my livingroom , the straps actuallycut my skin over my ankles and toes . Had to send them right back . Beware of copy cat items whenpurchasing items for yourself .
 I used them for one day and one of the laces already broke . I would avoid these laces if possible .

 heard converse shoes were hard to size up . wrong no biggie still like them cant afford now . oh well not ur fault
 I was so happy to get a pair of these shoes , until the second day I had them part of the seam ripped . Go figure with the poorly made stitching . I 've never had a pear of shoes last only one day . I ca n't believe I wasted my money on this . I 've had Wal-Mart shoes last longer than these . 365 times longer than these shoes . WTF
 I ordered these shoes a week and a half ago and still have not recieved them . I do n't know how much longer I am going to have to wait . Your really better off buying them at your nearest retailer of shoes and if they dont have them ask them to order them for you . This is ridiculous . If your expecting a speedy delievery under a week this product may not be for you .
 These shoes look great . They are very trendy and a lot of people are wearing them nowadays . The biggest problem I have with these shoes is that they hurt my feet . The soles are too flat . When I tried running in them , my heels began to hurt . Walking wise , they are n't the most comfortable to say the least . They are also heavy for what they are . Too expensive for what they are . These shoes are probably bad for your back because they do n't absorb any impact . Personally , I do n't recommend them for anyone .
 I wore these shoes to the gym -LRB- powerlifting requires flat soles -RRB- no more than 4 times a week for 3 hours at a time . After 9 months I was sliding the heal on and the seam ripped -LRB- on the opening , between the toe and heal , inside edge -RRB- . Guess I 'll skip the lo top next time .
 was gon na mark this one star ... the size was miss-leading , and too large for my daughter to wear . She really , really wanted these , was soooo excited when she opened them . One full size , or more , too large , maybe men 's vs. women 's ? Miss-marked ? Now what ? There they sit in her room until I can fix the problem . But ... the quality was very nice , shipped well , all that . SO , two stars .
 They picture high tops and only write in the title that it is a converse and whatever color . Only after you order and then see the shoes listed under open purchases does it finally tell you that the item you just bought is low top . I was so upset . Deceiving and conniving company . Then you have to pay for the postage to send it back . I read an earlier review from someone who had the same problem but I thought `` hey , it only happened to one person '' Well , it happened to me too . Just be super careful and read everything.I have only just opened the box , so I do n't know how good/bad the quality is yet . The sizing is right , I am a woman 's 8 , to that is a men 's 6 . It did arrive on time and the correct color and size i selected , but I REALLY REALLY wanted the high tops . The picture was of high top shoes .
 I was very disappointed when I got this sneaker . The soles were very thin and theentire sneaker was very flimsy.I returned it but had to absorb about $ 25 in shipping costs .
 I love the classic style but miss the quality and durability of the Converse All Stars . I had All Stars that lasted well over five years . Some pairs I even used the soles to slow down and brake while skateboarding and they still lasted a super long time . The Converse All Stars nowadays are no where near the high quality and durability of before . Grab a pair of the high quality Converse kicks from before and compare them to the quality of today . One way to tell a high quality kick from another is the pinstripe on the sole
 I love these converses , the only problem is I used the size guide and ordered a 7 which is supposed to be a uk 5 europe 38 , however I got a massive size 40 -LRB- 7 -RRB- and they do n't fit . Also I now live in London and ca n't return them . sad times : -LRB-
 These shoes run so big , and the size is very confusing . I emailed to find out if I could just exchange for a smaller size , but they wo n't do that . I have to send them back , and buy another pair . No thanks .
 I 've never wrote a review about any product . I 'm usually satisfied . This however kind of ticked me off . The shoe had some weird stain on it when i first saw them . they were also not the right size . I ended up giving them away .
 Though I am very familiar with Chuck Taylor 's and their sizing , this site confused me . I ended up ordering the incorrect size and had to send them back to the company . Though the company did end up crediting my account back .
 Watch out , Converse are 2 sizes larger than the labeled size . We ended up giving them away , my son is size 11 and they fit his size 13 friend perfectly .
 The product itself was fine but because the item was the wrong size , I had to return for a credit or an exchange . It cost almost ten dollars to return the item after originally spending about six or seven dollars for shipping and handling . If I understand your policy , and you have the correct size and ship that , I will pay another six or seven dollars for shipping . That means for a purchase of about forty dollars , I have paid almost twenty four dollars extra . I would never purchase another clothing item from -LSB- ... -RSB- .
 My son wore these off and on for a month when school started . Both shoes , the soles started to come off . The right one came off almost completely . Do n't know if this was just a bad pair or what but I would n't order these particular Converse shoes again .
 Nice shoe and fits great , only problem is I got the wrong color and I do n't have time to return them before I leave on vacation
 Good looking shoes , but ... after just 1 month , the glue is failing at the edge of the shoe where the foot bends . The shoe still looks perfect , but I had to use shoe goo to fix it . Seems like for the price , and for as long as this style has been around it should n't so this ?!
 Got her fast , but shoes are to big and it will cost me more money to send them back and then receive them back . There should be a note on how to order Converse . One size smaller than your original foot size . Now I am dealing with shoes that are to big .
 I 've been wearing Chucks for years now , but the pair that I purchased from shoezoo fell apart after 2 months . The sole of the shoe completely ripped off the rest of the shoe , and I 've only used these shoes for casual walking . Pretty ridiculous .
 I 'm accustomed to Dansko , Sanita , and Allegria shoes , which are all very comfortable , but require a break in period . I 'm ok with that . But these never seemed to get broken in . Maybe my feet are just used to soles on my regular brands . I 'm on my feet 9 hours a day , on concrete , walking around and up and down stairs , for several miles a day , sometimes with long periods standing -LRB- I 'm an adult-education instructor -RRB- . I have heard so many great things about chucks and really wanted a different shoe I could wear from time to time , and was hoping these would be it . I wear a 10 -LRB- 40 -RRB- in women 's and the 8.5 chucks fit my foot well -LRB- thankful I read the other reviews and knew what size to order -RRB- but they just are n't the shoe for me .
 I bought this as a xmas gift for my brother . The size of the show was way to big so he went and exchange it .
 The service from American Athletics is poor . The shoes were the wrong size but they refused to refund the postage and wanted to charge postage again to resend the correct size . Wo n't be shopping there again .
 Nothing wrong with these boots , but they are not the kind of thing to buy off the web . Go some place and try them on first . I ordered a 9.5 M and they were about 3/4 inch longer than other shoes I have of the same size .
 Although the price is nice and they are cute I would not recommend . The `` thingy '' on the top is always in the way when you want to slip them on . It goes inside and is extremely uncomfortable . You must stop and pull it out . Even if you tighten it up the slippers still do not work well . I fell off the sole when I was turning and hurt my ankle . These slippers looked similar to some Dearfoam slippers that I really loved . They may look similar but that is all .
 Unless you buy these much larger than you really need , they wo n't be very comfortable . The back part of them is always being stepped on and it 's very awkward and uncomfortable . I would not recommend these slippers .
 These are not worth $ 5 let alone $ 30 ! I bought them thinking they looked so warm and comfy . Well they have absolutely NO cushion in them . It is like walking on the floor ! They are warm but not anymore than any other Walmart slipper and my daughter has a pair that are twice as cushy from Walmart . Thumbs down on this slipper !
 the soles of the slippers started shredding after 4 wksthe inside soles came out and were twisted
 All Chinese-made shoe soles are made from recycled rubber whichSTINKS ! Theree is a heel insert under the insole which is veryuncomfortable . This raises the heel , thus removing any supportfor the arches . The upper `` felt '' is very flimsy . This is a very poorquality slipper . I sent both pair back .
 The slippers were for my husbands birthday ... how embarrassing . For the money I was expecting the inside to be as soft and comfortable as clouds instead they are hard and not relaxing at all . I still gave them to my husband and he could n't believe how much I paid for them . After giving them a shot around the house he noticed the fury stuff on the inside was coming out of the slippers in chunks . If anyone knows of slippers made in heaven ... please let us know . We need some .

 Los zapatos son buenos pero escogi mal el tama & ntilde ; o y no los pude usar , calzo 42 y estos son grandisimos.Ciro
 I always buy Daniel Green Dormie slippers , but when I could not get them in my size and color , I bought these.They are very attractive , but after wearing them for awhile , the tops of my feet became very painful . They also causes a corn . Had to throw them out .
 I was so excited when they arrived but I used them for a month and they came apart verry poor quality .
 Yes , these are Cole Haan 's . Yes , theyr ' e the Pinch Penny -LRB- non-Nike Air -RRB- . Yes , they 're a good price . However , this pair is a step down from the identical shoe I have owned maybe a dozen pairs of over the past 25 years.First , I have always loved these shoes . The Pinch series were absolutely made for my feet . Classic styling , durable Brush-Off leather uppers , cushioned leather lining , great fit and superb comfort , unlike most Johnston Murphy 's I have tried.I 've long been dubious of CH 's move to Indian manufacturing of the Pinch series , and this pair confirmed why . The US-made shoe -LRB- gone for about 15 years -RRB- was of quality non-par . The Mexican-made products that followed were nearly as good . However , now they come from India , and the shoe sucks!This is the first CH shoe I have owned that does not have a combination leather/rubber heel . These have a full rubber heel , with an affectatious grove molded into it where the leather to rubber joint used to be . Not that it really matters to most people , except die-hard Cole Haan buyers like me . The all rubber heel adds nothing to its durability , and the fake groove actually makes the shoe look like a cheap knock-off . Beyond that , the previous meticulous moc-toe stitching now is bunched and slightly uneven , and the lower portion of the toe box appears to have been stiched to the sole in a twisted manner . The leather soles on this pair were cracked and wrinkled at the leading edge of the heel , giving them an extremely cheap appearance.These are not your father 's Pinch Penny . They are simply mediochre examples of the attention to detail that we have come to expect of Cole Haan shoes . I promptly returned mine and will shop locally for a pair that is a better example of the company 's former level of workmanship .
 RECIEVED THIS ITEM IN BROKEN BOX WITH TAPED CORNERS SHOE LINING IS DIFFERENT THAN MY REAL COLE HANNS , MAKES ME THINK THEY ARE A FAKE !
 It 's a beautiful boot , like the style , looks very good ; but , it 's so uncomfortable , feet hurt after a couple minutes walking , you ca n't go for a walk with that , that boot is so stiff , i 've never had such an incomfortable boot in all my life.So it 's the look VS the Comfort ?! I guess its worth the price !
 The product description for these slippers states `` Made in Italy '' . But the slippers are stamped with -LRB- you guessed it -RRB- `` Made in China '' . To add insult to injury , the stain used for the outer part of the slipper apparently did not set or too much was applied . There was a wet spot where stain was coming off on my hands when I touched it.I will not be buying from Casual Male again . Footwear from Italy has a good reputation . Using that reputation to sell inferior quality goods that may have been manufactured in near-slavery conditions is a deplorable act of deception . If it is in fact a mistake of some kind , it 's a very , very convenient one .

 Due to the super fast delivery , I rated excellent but be aware , the shoes are not Aetrex as the ad shows . They appear to be identical but when you take a close look , the brand is Apex , which I have no idea where is coming from . I 've been wearing these shoes since my Podiatric prescribed them to me 4 years ago , and I hope they result with the same quality and benefit to my back injury than the real Aetrex , if not , it is a total ripped off .
 Initially was very satisfied but not any more . Loop through which the front strap goes is very cheap flimsy plastic . I have never tightened this strap since the start but the loop still broke - rendering the sandals useless . Avoid Propet !!
 I have owned a pair of Propet Suft Walkers for about 5 years and love them , so much so that I decided I needed a new pair . Ordered these from Amazon - fulfilled by Elite Hero . Paid an extra $ 19 for expited shipping , and took over a week to get them . Once they arrived , they would not fit in that I 've been wearing size 11 of the very same sandal for over 5 years , and the new pair , also size 11 was too small . Upon requesting the return , I was required to pay the shipping back to Elite Hero . The total shipping costs paid was about 1/2 the cost of the sandals.Lesson learned ! Do n't buy shoes/sandals from Amazon - use Zappos instead .
 I purchased these for my brother , however i found it did n't last any longer then a cheap pair from discount store
 - vendor rates well - product was shipped fast and packed well - unfortunately the sandals KILL my feet and they must be returned -- main problem
 Just received this pair today . They look great and have a nice design to them . That 's were the good stops . Unfortunately , the sandal has a problem with the un-adjustable backstrap . It makes your foot go forward one whole size at least . It is simply mis-placed and needs to be back further so your foot can utilize the back of the sandal as well . I 'm not sure about the rest , but the comfort looked nice -LRB- never tried on for more than a minute -RRB- . Too bad . Looked nice , but poor build . I returned them .
 I find that I ca n't wear these for more sandals than a short time.First of all , I often wear low rise socks -LRB- like ankle-high or below -RRB- with these kinds of shoes . Not heavy socks , but light cotton material because I am not fond of my bare feet hanging out . I find that when wearing these with socks , in order to fasten the velcro straps I have to pull them quite tight . I tried wearing them to a movie , found by the end of the movie -LRB- a little more than two hours -RRB- my feet were just not comfortable , cramped , pinched , circulation cut off . And I had ordered the EEE size . And I really do n't want to be constantly tugging at the straps to loosen and then tighten them again.I waited more than 30 days so I ca n't return them , but I really did n't want to return something I 'd already worn on my feet anyway.Update
 Bought these because they have the SAME upper styling as my beloved Nevados that were discontinued.The uppers are too stiff . The lowers have too little bounce . The upper is set a 1/4 '' too far forward , so my heel is not supported by the bottom heel indent , and the instep support is off.The worst thing is they are not quite bad enough to return.Seems solidly built and grips well .
 I returned this sandal . I did not know that the heel strap was elastic . My feet were not secure in the sandal .

 These shoes do not look in person the way they look online . They are actually very narrow , and the toe curls up a bit . The shoes break in , right where the design is on the top , and this makes the shoe look bubbly at the top . A very uncomfortable shoe , that will spend its time in my closet , because it is skinny and uncomfortable . Shame on Mr. Cole for this one .

 Size I always order was way to big . Sent it back and requested a smaller size .3 1/2 weeks later they called to say smaller size not available .
 Not only was I unsatisfied with the product -LRB- shoes too big -RRB- but to make matters worse , when I sent the shoes back to the `` only '' address listed on the packaging , the company would not accept the shoes back -LRB- I had never worn them -RRB- . It cost me $ 48 . dollars for the shoes and another $ 8.45 to get the shoes back from the post office . I will never buy clothing off the internet again .
 I 've worn Stephanie Soft Spots for over 15 years . They 're my favorite work shoe , and I have them in navy , black , white , and recently used leather paint to make a red pair ! Recently ordered 2 pair in size 12 and when they arrived they practically fell off my feet ! WHY OH WHY did they change their sizing ? Decided to send back for 2 size 11 's -- too small . Will try for 11-1/2 . Very disappointed that a product that 's been consistently perfect all these years has undergone a manufacturing change .
 I purchased these shoes because I was looking for a comfotable shoe . I am on my feet a great deal of time . I received them in January . Within three months , the right heel had collapsed internally . So if I wear them the left heel is fine and the right heel sinks down and throws me off balance . These shoes are now to dangerous to wear . Why would this shoes fail this way ? I have never had a pair of shoes do this . I think the company should replace them with a more reliable shoe .

 I bought this boot for my husband as a Christmas gift . The sizing is completely off . He always wears a 10 but this is about 1 - 1 1/2 sizes too big . Now the 9 is not available anywhere & so I can not replace it . If sizing is not going to be somewhat consistent , it is n't worth the hassle to shop online .

 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .

 I 've bought this style and size of shoe many times before . These were at least a full size smaller than before and I had to return them . Though I asked for a replacement in a larger size I was given a refund and told to re-order . When I did that the price had increased by $ 11.34 . Bait & switch ?
 The labeled sizes on this model are incorrect . I 've been wearing Reebok Ex-O-Fit Lo 's for probably 15 years . I 've even bought them from Amazon before , although never the &#34; clean-label &#34; model specifically until now . I have several pairs from past purchases that are still new in the box , so I was able to directly compare the current version of the model with past versions . -LRB- I 've stocked up on them in case the line is completely discontinued ! -RRB- This version is much too small , at least a full size smaller than what is labeled . I can usually fit a 10.5 -LRB- US sizing -RRB- in my smaller foot for this general model , but with this particular version of the model 's sizing , I just barely fit 11.5 comfortably . The toe area also seems a little more tight generally -LRB- feels somewhat cramped , not just lengthwise -RRB- . Otherwise , the shoe seems to be very well made . I 've long wished there would be a version in which the Reebok label on the heel did n't stand out so prominently , so in that sense , the style of this version is an improvement .
 The process itself was fast , but the product was much too small.There was no indication that the sizes run small . So small , in fact , that I am filing a claim for a full refund .
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .
 The product description for these slippers states `` Made in Italy '' . But the slippers are stamped with -LRB- you guessed it -RRB- `` Made in China '' . To add insult to injury , the stain used for the outer part of the slipper apparently did not set or too much was applied . There was a wet spot where stain was coming off on my hands when I touched it.I will not be buying from Casual Male again . Footwear from Italy has a good reputation . Using that reputation to sell inferior quality goods that may have been manufactured in near-slavery conditions is a deplorable act of deception . If it is in fact a mistake of some kind , it 's a very , very convenient one .

 I did n't notice it when looking at the online pictures , but these boots were the ugliest things I 've ever put on my feet , and I am no high-end shoe wearer . Honestly , they resembled those big fat moon-boot looking over-padded snow boots that anyone living in the North probably had as a kid . Thankfully , I had these shipped to work and within minutes of putting them on , I had received enough feedback to make shipping them back a no-brainer . Thank you to Amazon for allowing me to ship them back free of charge .
 My husaband had them for only a month before they came unsewn at the toes . Not a small hole but it went all the way across . And in both shoes . Not put together right . Very disappointed . To much money to fall apart !!!!!!!!
 I found these to be less than comfortable . The arch support is lacking and I had pain after wearing them for about an hour .

 Though shipment and handling were very good , the Eurelle Clog Slippers are very uncomfortable . The sole of the slipper is so heavy it constantly pulls of the foot . I have owned clog slippers before , as well as Dutch wooden clogs and found them to be very comfortable , but these are far from that and I am going to donate to Goodwill . Sorry , but that is the truth .

 I have worn Daniel Green slippers for years and loved them to the point of tatters , but these are huge on me as far as width goes . I have been a 6 narrow for some 60 years , and these slippers are definitely non-fitting .
 ALTHOUGH THESE WERE A GIFT FOR MY GRANDMOTHER SHE WAS DELIGHTED HOW THEY ARRIVED AND WERE WRAPPED . HOWEVER THEY ARE SIMPLY NOT WORTH THE $ 50 . OO I PAID FOR THEM . THEY ARE MERELY A HOUSE SLIPPER THAT YOU CAN GET AT TARGET -LRB- OR A STORE LIKE THIS -RRB- FOR LESS THAN $ 20 !
 These jazz shoes are the kind that easily scuff and wear . The leathery outside rubs away easily , leaving a greenish scuff underneath . They probably wo n't be very durable for much longer . Also , I could n't tell in the picture , but this is the kind that does not have the fabric middle . It is leather all the way from toe to ankle .
 I purchased this exact shoe -LRB- Capezio -RRB- only to receive a brand called Dance Now . The description said to order your normal street size . This is wrong . You need to order at least a half size , if not a whole size larger . I ordered them for my daughter and they are too small . I am real disappointed . I am now stuck with a shoe that my daughter has to wear too small .
 My husband only wears Propets and he has a 15 3E . Normally the Propets are perfect and very comfortable so I decided to buy this pair for him because it looked a little dressier in all black . He got them in and I am not sure if it was a defect on the ones we bought or what but they were super skinny . You could tell just by looking at them that they were way too long and tight . He could hardly fit ! Unfortunately they had to go back , but we bought the Propet Men 's Travel Walker M Casual instead which fit perfect just like the other Propets !
 I 've tried different insoles in them to make more comfortable and not much luck . Have n't tried cleaning them yet so do n't know how easy that will be
 Absurdly , comically overlarge . My SECOND attempt to buy this shoe , I ordered a full size below my normal one this time as the last try was way too big . It is still nearly an inch too long and yet with a tiny opening for the foot . Unless you have feet like a sparrow and are willing to order 2-3 sizes too small and return a few to guess at what may fit , do n't waste your time . I thought the first time I got a misidentified clown shoe . Now I realize Propet just does n't know how sizes work .
 I ordered these shoes for work beauce of a number of positive reviews I 'd read about them , however , these are not walking shoes ! They make my feet ache just walking to and from the bus stop which is right down the street . They have n't much cushioning , had to buy inserts but in doing so make them extremely tight . The only feature I do like is the easy slide on/off . Do NOT buy these if you do a lot of walking.Still searching for the right shoe . So far , Nike Air Max has provded the best results -LRB- for me -RRB- . Hope this review helps .
 This is a nice shoe , but it is loose-fitting in the standard size I wear . A slip-on needs a firmer fit in order not to slip on the feet .
 These shoes were almost completely cushion free on the soles.I thought they would be something like their walking shoes as I have a bad back , and bad feet.Unfortunately , these slip on tennis shoes were the first real disappointment I 'd had from Propet .
 i 'm terribly disappointed in this product . i ordered it and received two shoes with different clasps . looks funny on my baby boy . very angry customer .
 Though shipment and handling were very good , the Eurelle Clog Slippers are very uncomfortable . The sole of the slipper is so heavy it constantly pulls of the foot . I have owned clog slippers before , as well as Dutch wooden clogs and found them to be very comfortable , but these are far from that and I am going to donate to Goodwill . Sorry , but that is the truth .

 1 . They weigh nothing at all ... so no substance .2 . The straps are extremely flimsy and thin .3 . The straps are tight in the wrong places so it pinches .4 . The sole of the shoe is too soft.Basically a bad buy . I wish I could return it . It was a complete waste of my money .
 I love Vaneli and I 've been wearing them for years . These are wonderfully comfortable and chic looking shoes . The style really makes an outfit pop!They are available either online or at Marmi Shoes . I loved these shoes the moment I laid eyes on them.However , this is the first time I have had a problem with any of their shoes . The colorful buttons applied to the shoes are glued on rather than stitched on like Vaneli 's of old.I wore them out to dinner and by the time I got home I had buttons missing from each shoe . Mind you I just sat and had cocktails and nibbles . I did n't move my feet other than to sit , stand , and walk to the little girls room.These wonderful Italian shoes are no longer produced in Italy , but China -- and it shows . I 've compared my older Vaneli 's -LRB- 73 pairs -RRB- to my new Vaneli 's and there is a significant difference.The sole is cheap leather rather than the thick durable leather found in their early versions . The sandal straps on the new Vaneli 's are sown under the liner rather than at the foundation . Making them easier to break.I 'm very disappointed . These were no sale item . I paid full retail .
 These shoes are very cute and are very high quality , however there is absolutely no padding on the shoe . Very uncomfortable when you walk . I returned them because I could n't imagine wearing them for a long period of time .
 I have been wearing Vaneli shoes for many years . . Own many pair . . purchased the Vaneli Bice Slide approx . 1 - 2 months ago and they are already pulling apart around the mesh binding . I have really enjoyed the shoes and was going to purchase in several colors . . but not now !!! Very Very Disappointed .
 did not like rubber bottom because have to use taps on heel and could not apply and shoes ran narrow sent back

 Not A comfortable sneaker at all ! Looks like a wonam 's sneaker .

 I was so excited when they arrived but I used them for a month and they came apart verry poor quality .
 Due to the super fast delivery , I rated excellent but be aware , the shoes are not Aetrex as the ad shows . They appear to be identical but when you take a close look , the brand is Apex , which I have no idea where is coming from . I 've been wearing these shoes since my Podiatric prescribed them to me 4 years ago , and I hope they result with the same quality and benefit to my back injury than the real Aetrex , if not , it is a total ripped off .
 I never received the correct item . I returned the item on December 15th , 2009 and still have n't recieved a refund or the proper item -LRB- it is now February 1st , 2010 -RRB- . I have contacted the seller several times and they keep telling me to wait . I would rather they get me the product I ordered or refund my money in a timely manner . What a joke ! Considering contacting the BBB at this point . This is theft .
 I was so excited when they arrived but I used them for a month and they came apart verry poor quality .
 The boot has a great heel and sole , and the price is good for a work boot . That is the plus side . The negatives are the country of origin is not listed and the boot leather is very thin . I returned my purchase after opening the box and thinking that these are not durable enough for farm work .
 Not A comfortable sneaker at all ! Looks like a wonam 's sneaker .
 While the Earth Lazer is a lite weight shoe and free of animal materials it has poor arch support . There is virtually no lateral arch support and there is no heel cup support . The negitive heel causes to much stretch for the foot and ankle . I would not recommend these shoes to anyone . I think the Birkenstock brand has a great deal more arch support for the entire foot and ankle and keeps the foot in a neutural position .
 These are adorable very flat shoes . I 've actually felt more support in a pair of slippers . Absolutely no foot support ! I also do n't feel the need for heavy metal discs-which is an embellishment that is going to add to the cost ... but they are attached in such a way that they will not endure regular useAnd if you 're expecting suede , better try something else .

 These slippers run real small . I can not wear them as my toes rub up against the sole of the slipper .
 I ordered this slipper believing it to be a flexible soft slipper . Unfortunately , the sole was quite stiff and inflexible , and as I deemed it not appropriate for my 94-year-old mother , I returned it .
 The soles of these slippers was SO stiff that when you put them on you walk right out of them ... . DO NOT BUY !!!!!! yes , they were the right size !
 I 'm sorry I bought these slippers . I do n't know if Daniel Green slippers run small , but I ordered 1/2 size larger just in case and they are still about a size too short . Second problem is quality of construction . I 'm sorry to say but the slippers should not have passed quality control ... the top was not stitched completely to the bottom . I do not recommend these slippers .
 I had purchased the very same slippers years ago in the same exact size . When I received yours and tried them on , they seemed short , but I thought , maybe , because they are new , they need to be stretched . Was I wrong ! Then I thought if I turn them inside out , I could trim away some of the rubber . Naturally , I cut a hole in the seam . By that time it was too late to do anything with them . I felt , I could n't return them , so feeling totally disgusted , I put them back in the box and returned to wearing my old ones . I m not critical of Amazon , but I am critical of Daniel Green - there should be more quality control !
 I should have read the reviews . We measured according to Amazon 's shoe size chart and she can not even get her feet into them let alone wear them . Very disappointing and shame on Amazon .
 I ordered brand new ballet slippers and as they were pulled out of the package they were all black and worn on the bottom of the shoes . Not at all what was advertised and i did not click on buy used button either .
 The shoes were not as they were described.I just was not happy with them at all and they were to tight in the toe for my 4 yr old .
 Our dance instructor measured my daughter 's feet . Of course she lost one slipper right away . . So I ordered the same size through Capezio . When it arrived it could have fit another foot in the toe of the shoe ! That 's how large it was . So I figured `` okay , different company , maybe different fit '' and ordered same shoe a WHOLE size smaller . Same thing . Actually nearly no difference between the two . They really need to advise people of their fit . Which foot measurement equals each shoe size . I 'm paying to return their shoes which seems a bit unfair . Especially since a professional made very clear as to my childs ballet slipper size . And also , I have purchased from other companies that collaborate with our instructor .
 If you already know what size to buy , the quality of the shoe appears just fine . -LRB- Hence the 2 stars -RRB- I ordered my child 's street shoe size , as suggested in some other reviews , and they are at least 2 sizes too small . I would advise either buying a few pair knowing you will be returning the extras , or going to a store for your dancer 's first pair . My town has no store that sells ballet shoes so my options are limited .
 These shoes fit fine but they are uncomfortable on her feet . They do n't `` hug '' her feet the way they should and they look wrinkly . Not pretty at all . They are also difficult to tie . I expected a better product from Capezio . On the plus side they seem strong and are an appropriate color .
 I was very annoyed regarding my purchase of the ballet slippers . AFTER having to return them because the size was VERY wrong , I read a lot of the reviews about them . EVERYONE complained that these shoes were missized and too small . I am annoyed that the description from the Capezio folks does n't warn the consumer themselves . I feel I took Pretty big money loss on my return because of the lack of warning on the size issue . I reordered some shoes from a different company who DID offer guidance on how to select the best size .
 THIS BRAND IS HORRIBLE . I ORDERED AN 11m , WAY TOO BIG , ORDERED 10 1/2 m WAY TOO SMALL , ORDERED 11n THEY ARE A 1/2 INCH SHORTER THAN THE 11M , ABSOLUTELY NO RHYME OR REASON BEHIND THE SIZING . COST 15.00 TO SHIP THEM ALL BACK AND I STILL DO N'T HAVE A PAIR OF SHOES FOR MY DAUGHTER !
 I bought this ballet slipper for my 5yo daughter for her first ballet class . The shoe is very pretty , but the sizing is way off . I ordered her a size bigger , but it was still far too tight , and as her feet are pretty narrow , it was also way too wide . I returned this slipper -LRB- in the end , it cost me a ridiculous amount of money due to return shipping -RRB- and bought her ballet slippers at Payless which are her size and fit .
 My 3 year old daughter wears a size 7 in toddler shoes . Because of my years of dance , I know that ballet shoe sizes are usually not the same as street shoe sizes . We do n't have a dance store within an hour driving distance from our home , so I had to order all of her dance supplies online . Because of this , I measured her foot 3 times to make sure that I got the correct measurement . Both feet were just under 5.5 inches long . When I looked at the size chart for this shoe , the length of her foot matched with a size 7 . I know that some brands have converted their sizes to match street shoe sizes , so I thought that maybe Capezio had done the same . Wanting to be on the safe side , I ordered a half size bigger - a 7.5 , thinking she 'd grow into them if they were too big . When they came , I could NOT believe it . There is NO WAY that someone with a 5.5 inch long foot could wear a size 7.5 . Absolutely NO WAY . I 'd say that she probably could have fit her foot in a 7.5 back when she was wearing a street size 4 . That is a BIG difference . She was so disappointed , and so was I . It would cost almost $ 6 just to return them , even though they shipped for free and weigh almost nothing , so I have kept them for my younger daughter to grow into . Now I 'm trying to find the time to drive 2 hours to the nearest dance store to get her a pair that actually fits since there is no way to tell for sure what size she is based on the size guide provided .
 I bought this shoe for my daughter starting ballet class , and I bought 1 size bigger just in case . It was far too tight for her feet ! The sizing is WAY off on this shoe , so be weary ! If you buy it for your little toddler , be sure to go up at least two sizes !
 The delivery here was excellent , the shoe itself was fine ; however , the feedback I read here I applied to my ordering process and it did not play out for my daughter at all , and she is a petite little girl . I had to return the shoe twice b/c too small . Ended up going to a local danceshop and found out she needed a size and half bigger than her actual shoe size , which also gives her a little wiggle room . Go to a local store if you have one , otherwise you 'll be a bit disappointed like me that the shoe does n't fit .
 This shoe may have been ok but they were soooo small that we could n't use . I returned for another size , went from 7 to 8.5 and still had to return because they hurt her toes . Ballet shoes that hurt her toes ! We had bought a ballet shoe locally in the size 7 so thought we would be close with the Capezio in the same size . We were wrong .
 I was very disappointed with this shoe , and Capezio . My 9 year old had the correct size -LRB- confirmed by costumer -RRB- , wore it in a musical play four evenings , and the toe completely blew out of one of the shoes . Returning it .
 So I decided to still give this product a try despite the reviews saying that the sizing is way off . I measured my daughter 's feet carefully like one reviewer suggested . Her foot measures a little less than 6 '' , which would be between size 8 and 8.5 . I went ahead and ordered her a size 9 and it still did n't fit !! The problem lies in the company stated shoe size vs the sizing info provided by Amazon . The shoes itself only measure 5.75 '' which is not what the sizing info states for size 9 . Her big toes are curled up inside . So now , we have to return the item and pay for shipping because according to Amazon , it 's not their fault . Really cute shoes , but yeah , the sizing is like playing roulette , you never know what you would get !
 I never write reviews but felt like I should this time . I read all the reviews about the ballet shoes running small so I ordered a 1/2 size larger . They are still too small . Of course now I am getting charged shipping to return them . Not worth it . I order stuff from amazon weekly and I will stick to the sellers with free returns from now on .
 I thought I did my homework before purchasing these ... I bought this pair two sizes bigger than my daughter actually needed . They were still way too small . I am happy that Amazon is so great to work with . They returned them free of charge .
 I ordered size 8 for my small 3-year old -LRB- her normal size -RRB- . The shoes looked really nice , but they were way too small -LRB- at least , a size smaller then expected , and probably more -RRB- . I returned the shoes . Had to pay for shipping , but saved by packaging them in a padded envelope and using 1-st class mail instead of Amazon shipping -LRB- saved about $ 2 -RRB- . I would 've gotten another pair , but I 'm afraid it will not fit either , since it 's hard to determine what size would be appropriate , and I do n't want to take chances and have to ship another pair back . If you know exactly which size fits your kid , I would recommend the shoes , but if you do n't , try ordering 1-2 sizes bigger than you normally would .
 I bought them for my 4-year old for a 2-week dance camp - not for heavy use . The first pair was too small -LRB- I ordered half size up from her usual , but they did n't fit at all -RRB- . On the plus side , I was not charged for the return and the new pair in size 10 arrived quickly . When unpacking them I saw that the box looked different from the first one and they had some small issues -LRB- a bit of glue visible on the trim of one , slight discoloration around the ties of the other -RRB- . But these were just cosmetic and I was running out of time for a second return so I sent her to class with them . Today is only the 5th day of use and the inside of the sole is coming off ! It 's probably a glue problem again , but it literally is tearing in several places , so we 'll have to glue it ourselves if we want these shoes to hold for another week of camp.I was very disappointed - sizing issue was almost expected based on reviews , but few people seem to have had such quality issues . I am starting to wonder whether we got a refurbished pair or something .
 received these , 2 pair for my girls who are starting dance , way too small . REtuned both pairs in the same box and only received a refund for one pair . Very upset and dissapointed .
 Ordered these for daughter . She was 2 and starting her first dance class when I got them , and had small feet because she was not a big kid -LRB- still is n't -RRB- . She could n't even get her little foot into the size 6 . However , when we got a size 6 from Payless , she fit in them just fine . Returning this pair would have been a hassle , so we just kept them and learned our lesson . At 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 years old , a $ 10 Payless pair is just fine . And you can return with no hassle if they do n't fit . Live and learn , Mommy !
 We had to clip the elastic just to get the shoe on . It is exactly the same size as the other pair my daughter has in black . These , however , were very tiny for the size .
 My child typically wears a 5.5 toddler shoe . I ordered this shoe two different times ; one in a 6.5 and one in an 8 . both were far from fitting ! ballet shoes typically run small so I ordered up the first time with that in mind . my suggestion is to find a store and let them help you . with shipping cost , the money you `` save '' is not worth it . do not buy .
 these were so adorable but looked like they would fit an infant . My 2 yr old has a small foot , but i still ordered her a 6.5 -LRB- she wears a 6 -RRB- . it was WAY too small . I heard return shipping is a nightmare - wish me luck !
 I ordered these despite all of the other reviews about sizing problems . I checked the Capezio website and the sizing charts indicate to order the child 's regular street size . Further , I 've returned things through Amazon before and for some reason was SURE that I would n't have to pay to exchange if they were still the wrong size . Well , they arrived and despite my double-checking the brand 's size charts , they 're way too small ! And Amazon wants to charge $ 5 to ship them back . So really , do n't be like me and think you did your homework and you 'll be fine . Buy them in store . Major Amazon FAIL .
 These shoes were nowhere near `` real '' size . My daughter wears a size 5.5 in toddler . I ordered a size 6 and I ca n't even get it on her foot ! Make sure you order much larger than usual . I wish I had that advice before I was scurrying around looking for shoes that would fit for TOMORROW .
 I purchased a pair a size and a half larger than my dauhgter 's size - she wear 7 , I ordered 8.5 . Guess what - it did n't even fit her foot . I compared this ballet shoe with a shoe I purchased for her in the store -LRB- 8.5 also -RRB- , and the ballet shoe looked 2 sizes smaller . I am returning them . Not sure I will go with the same brand since the sizing is way off .
 Not A comfortable sneaker at all ! Looks like a wonam 's sneaker .

 I was so excited when they arrived but I used them for a month and they came apart verry poor quality .
 I ordered size 8/9 since i wear a size 8 1/2 shoe , they fit my husband who wears size 11 . To top it off I ended up paying $ 6.00 for the return shipping . It will be the last time I order shoes from them .
 Do not waste your money on these they are cheaply constructed I received them today and the snap on the strap that holds them to your foot was broken and would not stay snapped together save your money I paid my money for broken merchandise again please save your money these are not constructed well at all
 I have bought several prs of crocs , but these were sized differently than the others which were unisex and thus mfor my size 11 feet were too small .
 I was very dissapointed with this product . I bought some beach crocs a few years ago and they were made in Canada . These were made in China . They are not the same quality at all . These are not cushioned like the others were , they are also smaller even tho they are the exact same size as the ones made in Canada . These are NO better than the cheaper `` knock offs '' you find in dollar stores .
 Sorry . I bought them as a gift and have a report that the holes up front are very uncomfortable especially for big toe . I will be returning , which I am bummed about , and , have probably learned not to buy a clothing item on line as a gift .
 I begin by saying I have worn Crocs `` Beach '' Men 's XXL for many years . They have always been excellent shoes ... UNTIL , I PURCHASED MY MOST RECENT PAIR . The first thing you notice is they are MADE IN CHINA.Without question the shoes from China are smaller . To the point of even being tight . The back strap ismore narrow than the previous shoes I purchased . The front part of the sole is not as thick . Overall , it feels like a cheap imitation . I may NEVER buy another Croc shoe .
 Croc strap broke the first time it was worn . Not pleased with this product at all .
 I have bought several pairs of crocs and these did not appear to be original crocs . I always buy the same size and these arrived way too big , how could the same size be too big if these are original crocs ? Had to send back and pay for shipping , not very happy and will only buy crocs from the original website .
 We received the Crocs , which are my son 's favorite shoe to wear . However , when he wore them to school the next day , one of the straps broke and I had to run a different pair of shoes to him at school . We are hoping to return them and get a new pair -- that will last longer than two hours .
 I wore these shoes for 1 day working in the garden . when I took them off the tops of my feet were inflamed with red bumps that scabbed over and were very tender to the touch , I could n't wear any shoes that touched the tops of my feet for almost 2 weeks.they were comfortable to wear , but the rash is still really bad after 2 weeks . I WO N'T wear them again ...
 My non-Croc-type of footwear are more comfortable and better made than the real Crocs I bought recently ! Quite disheartening .
 I have worn Crocs for years . They are almost a must for diabetics . The ones on this page are made in China . The cheaper quality is immediately visible , the sizing is off and the last -LRB- shape of shoe -RRB- also appears different . I wish Amazon would clearly stipulate where stuff is made so we could have a choice .
 Est delivery date was 12/13 - 12/16 guess what date it is today ... 1/3/11 ... . it was going to be a nice Christmas gift for my son-in-law . . I was hoping for 2010 . To many other good companies out there to use this one again .
 i 'm very dissisafied with my crocs . they send the wrong size.so i 'm stuck with them .
 tengo mas de un mes que pedi mis cross y aun no me han llegado necesito saber q paa con ello por favor denme razon de ello ya q los tengo cargados en mi tarjeta y todo gracias
 Maybe I 'm too concerned about fashion , but there are shoes out there that are just as comfortable , and dont make me look like I work in a hospital . I see people wear these every day and I cringe when they walk by . I guess theyre good for people maybe 70 and older who need orthotic shoes and cant wear sandals to the beach .
 I was so excited when they arrived but I used them for a month and they came apart verry poor quality .

 I bought these for my husband last winter . It was n't long before I discovered the problem with them . They kept his feet warm and cozy , BUT you could not wash them ... so after a while the SMELL was overwhelming !! Then they had to be thrown out . I bought them at the $ 70 price , so I wished I had bought cheaper ones you could actually wash .
 This slipper was more like a women 's 7 than a men 's 8 . WAY TOO SMALL !
 Arrived quickly from shoes.com . The quality of the shoes was good , but the were very uncomfortable . Shoes.com was good about the return . I wo n't order shoes on line again unless they are a reorder of the same shoe , same size as a pair i 've already owned -LRB- my mistake -RRB- .
 I typically love Daniel Green slippers but this one was n't as I expected . I was looking for a very cushiony bootie slipper that would be super cushiony around my ankles as well as on the sole of my foot . Although the slipper has an outdoor sole , the bottom of your foot is supported by a layer of the bootie 's soft fabric , a very thin layer of cushion and the rubber sole ; all-in-all , they 're not very cushiony . The slippers were snug but I like them that way .
 I was really looking forward to recieving these `` MEMORY FOAM '' slippers . When they arrived I was EXTREMELY disappointed to discover that they only had a `` RUBBER '' sole with terry cloth . -LRB- The terry cloth and color were beautiful and the size 11 narrow was great on the fit . -RRB- I hope the factory just forgot to put the memory foam in this particular pair of slippers because if that is not the case then this company is guilty of false and misleading claims in their online product discription , as well as , the discription on the attached tag . I returned these slippers the day after they arrived and am still in search of a pair of slippers WITH real memory foam that the wearer can actually feel .
 I just assumed the fuzzy slipper shown would be fuzzy inside as it looks - wrong ! While the outside of the slipper is fuzzy - the inside is a thin layer of material and you can feel the sole of the slipper through the thin bottom . To be comfortable one would need to wear socks for warmth . Also , if this is terry cloth - it 's very thin cloth . Not a great buy .
 Unfortunately in order to get my foot into this bootie , I would have had to force it . And I could see that eventually the opening might tear . So , I had to return it .
 Not pleased . I saw them on QVC , but did n't want to pay their high shipping fees . These slippers , although very pretty , did n't fit snuggly as they appear to fit . They were clumsy on my feet and as I walked , they had a mind of their own . I returned immediately . Amazon refunded my money AND paid for the return shipping !
 I bought this producct on the basis of the reputation of Daniel Green slippers , however , when I received them I was disappointed . I did not think they were worth the cost . I was looking for something that would keep my ankles warm and these slippers are not substantial enough to do the job . They look very nice , but they are too thin to remain around my ankles when I put them on . I expected something heavier . Even the sole was not heavy enough for me to be able to wander around outside when I go to pick up the morning newspaper . I do not like to wear socks with my slippers so that was not a solution to my problem . the size was o.k. and the design is fun , but they are just not sturdy enough for me .
 The slippers looked so comfy but proved to be too small , even at 8 and half wide . Wish they had fit . The only replacement offered was leopard print at 9 . No thanks .
 My family has purshased many items over the years from Amazon , from books to TVs . This is the first item that we are unsatisfied with.Previous reviewers have said the top of the slippers are too tight . I ordered a pair on the larger side for my wife in anticipation of this potential problem and they were still too tight - but OK . Next , my wife said they did n't feel right and kept switching them from one foot to another . She soon discovered that we were shipped two right-footed slippers . Are you kidding me ? Now I finally get time to return them and I find out that I have to return them on my dime because the `` return window is closed '' . Comm ` on I bought them for my wife for Christmas and it 's only the beginning of February . I will never buy footwear from Amazon again . Too much risk and hassle . In the end , these slippers are not as nice as slippers you can buy at half the price just about anywhere .
 I have another pair of Daniel Green slippers in the exact same size , same style , etc. that I bought from a Daniel Green store . They are completely different in that they have a very cushy bottom and these do n't , my others fit perfectly and these are a size too big and I 've had the others for four months and they 've held up great and the tab ripped off the back of these the moment I put them on . I do n't know what the deal is , I 'm just saying I would n't buy these again . Only from a Daniel Green store or -LSB- ... -RSB- or something like that .
 I purchased these slippers for my girlfriend for Christmas last year , need to say they no longer exist in this household . The quality is less than desired and the comfort is not worth the wait . If you do n't do much around the house and just want something to keep your feet warm these are for you . But if you work around the house and take the dog out they wo n't last . Poor craftsmanship and the padding is less than expected . She did n't like these at all ...
 I was looking for an `` indoor-out-door '' type slipper which the description said this was . Not so ! AND , the sole was extremely slippery on regular tile floors AND , provided absolutely no support .
 These slippers are typical of Daniel Green products , beautiful , comfortable and affordable.Thanks
 The high calf boot in this listing DOES N'T MATCH THE DESCRIPTION . This listing shows a slipper as a `` color '' option for some strange reason , but the rest of the options are for a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PRODUCT.These boots are NOT `` REAL '' SHOES at all ; and are MADE ENTIRELY OF PLASTIC that 's extremely thin and flimsy , like disposable , dime-store Halloween costumes . Outdoor use would likely destroy them quickly , and they seem utterly useless for cold or wet weather.These boots DO N'T FIT like real shoes ; they have NO ARCH SUPPORT , NO PADDING , and NO INSULATION . They 're far bigger than the stated size , as though intended to be worn over real shoes and/or clothing.The light brown COLOR DOES N'T MATCH the picture , and is actually a very dark chocolate brown.The seller 's name `` BuyCostumes '' is oddly absent from the listing , which instead shows just `` L.B. Evans '' . The boots are actually called `` Thomas '' by a brand called `` Ellie '' . The description is false and completely misrepresents the product . Not only are we disappointed with the product we received , but we view the use of false advertising and hiding the seller 's name as UNETHICAL , and we 'll be filing complaints with BuyCostumes , Amazon , and possibly the FTC if they do n't fix this listing immediately and compensate us.NOT RECOMMENDED .
 very lightweight and flimsey , if you only need them for a one time thing they will work . but dont expect much .
 I bought this Sandal to wear it along with a ball gown , because I needed the extra inches without necessarely showing underneath the long dress . The high heel platform is very confortable , and it is padded , HOWEVER , those transparent straps are very rough , mainly on the toes opening , the makers could as well put razor blades instead of straps ! Unfortunately not wearable !
 The service was great but the shoes shipped were not the shoe indicated on the box . The requested size was 6.5 and the actual shoe is 5.5 , although the box did indicate 6.5 . The shoes are being shipped back for refund .
 Great looking shoe . These people are nuts if they think the average person could fit in to their shoes . Why ca n't they make it easy . Street shoe size for all ! Yeah . If a dancer wants a snugger -LRB- is that a word ? -RRB- fit by a size smaller . We will return Cinderella 's shoe and get daugther 2 sizes larger than her street shoe and the wide width . The son will go 3 sizes larger than street shoe also in wide width .
 The boot has a great heel and sole , and the price is good for a work boot . That is the plus side . The negatives are the country of origin is not listed and the boot leather is very thin . I returned my purchase after opening the box and thinking that these are not durable enough for farm work .
 I was so excited when they arrived but I used them for a month and they came apart verry poor quality .
 uncomfortably tight . even after several wears and has stretched with regular , normal use . i suggest buing a size up from the/your normal street size .

 I think theyr ' e ok but the seams tore and ripped and then the inside stuffing came OUT !?!??? I think they were very comfortable at first and then they just started ripping . A lot of my friends got them too and theirs all ripped too .

 They should sell these to women . They are way too narrow and they are at least a half size to a whole size too small in length . I should have listened to other reviewers . I bought a pair for me and my dad and even sizing up a half size they were too small . Now I have to pay return shipping for a product that was never constructed correctly to begin with . Buyer beware . Note that these can not be worn if they are too small because the back has a lip and it would definitely cause a blister if your heel extends out over the back of the slipper .
 I ordered these for my husband last year for Christmas . I think he 'd had them for approx 1 month -LRB- and he * LOVED * them and he 's very picky -RRB- before they started falling apart at the seams . He did n't wear them often enough that that ever should have happened after such a short time . Perhaps it was a bad batch ; I never did contact the seller with my problem as I had such issues even getting them ordered -LRB- the price would not come up no matter what I tried so I could not place the order online and CS is in India so there were a few language barriers that had to be hurdled before I could even place my order -RRB- . With the amount I paid -LRB- including shipping -RRB- and the short time they lasted I would never order these slippers again . I found a pair very much like these from another brand and they have already held up longer and cost much less than these . The only reason I gave these 2 stars versus one is because of the fact that he really liked them before they fell apart .
 If you have wide feet like I do , and are looking at these losers for you ` re wide feet , do n`t bother , they would comfortably fit someone with AAA skinny feet . Plus the top of the slipper will only allow someone with no arch , or a very flat foot to wear them.If you are like me , and love New Balance for tennis shoes , you will NOT fit into these . The maker should be spanked for calling these slippers wide .
 ordered my usual size.couldn ' t get on my foot.had to return to amazon .

 After many calls and emails with EastBay , they were not able to successfully deliver shoes to me after 4 weeks . I cancelled the order and made a local purchase . The shoes likely would have been fine - EastBay 's ability to deliver the shoes to me was non-existent . This is the first time I have had any online purchase delivery issues with many purchases over the years from Amazon , Ebay and other online retailers . Quite disappointing .

 If you can manage to get it on , this may be a good slipper . I am a 9 1/2 D and ordered a 10D . On arrival , I found it nearly impossible to insert my foot through the undersized opening so I advised Amazon and they provided me with a shipping label for returning the slippers . I shipped them with that label about 6 weeks ago . Amazon has now advised me the it has not been received and they are billing me for it . This seller did not acknowledge receiving the return and I am stuck with trying to resolve the issue with Amazon .
 The boot has a great heel and sole , and the price is good for a work boot . That is the plus side . The negatives are the country of origin is not listed and the boot leather is very thin . I returned my purchase after opening the box and thinking that these are not durable enough for farm work .
 These look and feel good but the little nobs do break off pretty quick , ruining the shoes completely . Do not buy them .
 I agree . I 've had several pairs of these over the years and they never tore up like they do now . Last pair I bought I brought back because they tore up and got another pair ... well they tore up too . Now I need to find a replacement !
 The shoes are to high in front top thus digging in to the front of your ankle an as such are very uncomfortable . I am trying to wear them hopeing they will stretch . They cost to much to adandon .
 I do n't know but , the size was way too big for me , and this wedge is very heavy to wear , I have n't wore them , I have only tried fitting the wedge and walk back and forth , already then its very heavy ... No do n't buy them : - -LRB-
 These shoes are made very cheaply . The heel is very strange when you see it in person since it dents inward . Not attractive looking on the feet .
 I absolutely love these shoes . They are adorable ... and comfortable . Unfortunately , today is only my 4th time to wear these and the sole is completely separated from the platform heel . I about broke my neck walking down a flight of stairs at work when I noticed this . I guess I 'll have to try to find some really strong shoe glue . I am extremely disappointed !
 I was so excited when they arrived but I used them for a month and they came apart verry poor quality .
 The product is fine . Problem is on the website for my size and width it said large . Then on the box of the product it says I should have went medium .
 I got the smallest show tree and my size is 9 . It fit snugly when I put it in my shoes but 3 days later , it tore through my shoes ! Would not recommend this .
 The edges are not sanded ot beveled , as the toe section expands in the shoe it press an edge against the in side of the shoe causing a crease on the ut side of my 335 dollar Allen Edmond shoe , not cool
 I bought two pairs of the Allen Edmonds Ceder Shoe Trees and would not recommend the product.Of the four , one tree was originally stuck in a locked position . This was caused by a flaw in the metal mechanism , a dent in the metal that prevented the shoe tree from expanding . With about 10 + min of effort I finally forced open the toes and identified the dent in the metal as the cause . It sticks up and catches on the wood when fully closed . While its now functional , the shoe tree has limited mobility , and if I were to close it again , it could easily lock up.I would otherwise identify the material as sturdy and the price as fair , however the dent in the metal is hard to ignore . I had previously purchased $ 20 - $ 25 shoe trees from Nordstroms , these are in many respects equivalent or superior to the Allen Edmonds brand .
 These fit my size 11 shoes well at first but the spring broke on them the 2nd time I used them . Disappointing as I would have expected better from this brand name .
 Please be careful when buying these shoes from this company , I got a size 8 and they were really small I could not get my foot half way in . I contacted the company ... I was told I have to pay for these shoes to get shipped back . SMH .
 I take care of horses and work in mud . Boots serve the purpose but are much to heavy and stiff .
 The boots are very thin and do not stand up . They bend over in the middle , thus making them hard to put on . I expected far thicker material on the upper boot . I am not using them and will probably donate them to a local senior services thrift store .
 They are wonderful looking , but have huge wide heels . I felt like i was wearing flip flops ... Worst part i had to pay to send them back ! In this economy thats a definite OUCH !!!
 This shoe would really only work with a VERY formal situation ... I recieved them and they looked just like a shoe that you would wear with a rented tux !
 to PUT IT CRAP , i didnt get the ADDIDAS 11 ORIGINALS i requested , instead i recieved some awful T.MAC bigfoot basketball shoe , which i promptly gave to the local childrens hospital MERRY XMAS . BOB .

 I purchased these shoes for my Son - He owns a Landcaping Company and he walks alot ... After one week the sole separated from the shoe - He had to stop and buy a roll of duck tape . He love the way they felt and his feet was n't as tired by the end of the day . Need to work on the outside Quality - comfort is good .
 I love the look of these shoes , but they are probably one of my * least * comfortable .
 I kept the shoes but they hurt my feet a lot . I may consider not ordering shoes online .
 Would help if the dimensions are included . This bag is beautiful - but soooo tiny !!
 I purchased these exact boots four years ago and they were durable for the most part and wore out as synthetic shoes usually do after a few years . I was very disappointed to find that the quality of these boots have decreased dramatically . The soles were wavy/warped , there was still some residual glue on the sides that I had to clean off , and when I wore them for the first time one boot scratched the other and I had to use a black marker to try and disguise it . This never happened with my previous pair . I realize that they are not leather so I lowered my expectations for the quality , but really , this is rediculous for $ 50 boots . I did n't return them because it is hard for me to find non-leather shoes that I really like so I am trying to make them work ... plus I did n't want to be out of any more money by paying to have them shipped back to the company . Oh yeah , and I ordered the wide calf and got the regular ... fortunately they are stretchy and they still fit my leg .
 These shoes are pretty awful and not because they are Minnesota Timberwolves shoes . The logos are attached very cheaply and the tongue feels like it covered with cheap plastic . The shoes are also very , very thin and I could n't even wear the shoes . It is no wonder they got discontinued .
 I bought the boots , they were to small at a size 13 . With no return label provided , I shipped back the boots and requested an exchange to a larger size . I have yet to receive a credit on my credit card or the size 14 boots I requested to exchange for .

 I have a hard time finding shoes to fit as I have a small foot . I was thrilled to see these shoes at Amazon and quickly ordered a pair -LRB- I already have a pair and they are so comfortable -RRB- . After almost 2 months , I received a note that the order had been cancelled because they could n't obtain the shoes . I was very disappointed . Plus I had ordered something else that qualified me for free shipping and I was n't even given the opportunity to make that up . Very disappointed .
 Gave one star because no stars was not an option . I 've been waiting delivery of this item for quite some time ; received e-mail that it was back-ordered . It 's been months , where is it ?
 too narrow . i ordered a size up for my hubby but still too tight .
 They hurt to wear -- the soles create pressure points all over , inherent in the design .
 I agree with the other review , you initially do n't find the ridges to be that uncomfortable but the more you wear it the less comfortable it becomes , it always makes a lot of squeeky noises on my flooring and loves to collect hair on the rubber `` gills '' on the bottoms . The only thing good about these is they do breathe and dry off quickly , they 're good for the shower , pool or gym and they look cool but just are n't comfy . I would n't recommend for the beach , I can just imagine these things kicking up sand behind your legs and getting sand grains stuck in the mesh and irritating your feet lol ...
 These really are not at all comfortable to wear . I tossed them out after I brought them on vacation .
 I see I 'm not the only one -LRB- see the other reviewer -RRB- . I 've ordered the brown/tan for $ 19.95 - a total steal , THREE times , and all 3 times its been cancelled . I 'm really shocked and disappointed . How can this be listed for such a long period , and be cancelled like this . I love Amazon , but I just ca n't accept this sort of cancellation , even if its from a third party seller .
 There was a super-discounted price listed so I ordered two pairs of this shoe in different colors and a day later , Amazon cancelled my order . These might be great shoes , but I 'll never know because I ca n't get them !
 Allen Edmonds Men 's Conway Slip-onThe product was offered with free shipping . I ordered my usual size 11D and this came much larger than other brands and did not fit . I had to pay for the shipping in order to return the item and therefore did not order a size smaller as I lost my free shipping .
 cute boot but i usually wear a 9 1/2 , bought these in a 10 and they were a little short . My big toe touched the tip . I gave them to a friend who usually wears a 9 and they fit her perfectly .
 Although listing the specific model as shipping in 1-2 business days , the order confirmation stated two weeks . That is simple `` bait and switch '' . This hurts Amazon 's as well as Fott Locker 's reputation.For us , the delay precluded having it for the trip we had targeted . Another Amazon-partner might have gotten it to us in time .
 I have several pairs of genuine Birkenstock sandals . The Betula sandals are clearly inferior . A light grade of leather is used for straps which makes them impossible to slip my foot into.T.H . Grove
 They are a little stiff , should have smoother edges around the area you slide you foot in . Not very comfortable .
 They are really rough and the loop from the knot on top really rubs the skin raw . Even if wearing light socks it still is abrasive .
 Recieved these as a gift from my dear mother . My face said thank you , but my mind said da HECK . Copious amounts of gross .
 Will be returning these shoes after the holiday season . They are a very narrow fit and they do not stretch .

 They are a little stiff , should have smoother edges around the area you slide you foot in . Not very comfortable .

 This bag only looks good online -- it looks like cheap vinyl in person . Save yourself the shipping charges .
 I bought these at the actual Clarks Store a while back and i have n't worn them since . In the store they seemed to fit fine walking around , but when i tried to wear them a few days later they gave me blisters on the top sides of my feet and at the heel . PAIN!i thought they look really cute and i was so mad because they were n't that cheap . What a waste

 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .

 I usually wear Pliner , Weitzman , Cole Haan . This pair is WAY TOO narrow - which is odd , but perhaps they were made in a different factory . If you have a regular-width foot , I do not recommend purchasing these . If you 're foot is narrow , then this is a great shoe .

 I bought the boots , they were to small at a size 13 . With no return label provided , I shipped back the boots and requested an exchange to a larger size . I have yet to receive a credit on my credit card or the size 14 boots I requested to exchange for .

 I usually like Latico bags , but this one was not a winner . It 's advertised as shiny leather , but it 's not . It 's patent leather , which can look really cheap and plastic in certain colors . I purchased the blue and it looks like a bag I 'd get from a teeny-bopper store . Got ta send it back , which is a shame because I really love the style .

 This shoe was impossibly small , about a full size , which was an expensive shock to me . I had heard that MBT sometimes ran small but since I do not wear socks with sandals , I thought purchasing to the upper end of my normal size would be about right . I wanted these sandals for a vacation trip and was very disappointed to send them back . Also , as I had purchased them from an `` Amazon partner '' not Amazon.com , it was an expensive mistake . It cost me $ 13 to return the item to the storefront seller , `` Heart & Sole . '' Beware of dealing with storefront sellers when purchasing a `` fit item . '' The delivery was ridiculously SLOW , and then the return was costly . Only Amazon.com and Amazon Prime delivery for me .
 I was very upset and dissappointed , I never expected it to happen . When I received the shoes there was a black highlight on the writing and I ignored it . I started to use the shoes the black highlight started to dissappear and the writing started to be clear , I was shocked -LRB- SAMPLE NOT FOR SALE -RRB- I contacted the seller immediately complaining about this issue and I told them if they didnt solve it that I will comlain and her what they replied to me with : Dear customer , We are very sorry for this inconvenience.We buy directly from a local MBT distributor and they sell their over stock merchandise . We were not aware of this situation.For your information it is NOT illegal to sell sample shoes ; actually if you get some of them you can sell them . However it is not your case.We figure out you are out of the United States . Because of this any exchange or return will take time and it would be very expensive.We offer you to keep the sandals and we 'll refund you $ 25 . Please let us know if this would work.Shop Us LastIs it reasonable ???? is it fair to have such a reply from them telling me that it is NOT illegal to sale SAMPLE piece and offering paying me 25 $ back ??? I claimed them on amazon and I posted a negative feedback on them , the day after they e mailed me back with this e mail : Dear customer , We are very sorry for all the inconvenience this has caused you.We 'll cancel this sale and we 'll fully refund your payment for this order.We only appreciate if you consider to remove the negative feedback that already posted.Once again we apologize for any inconvenience.Regards , Shop Us LastI wont delete what I wrote it is the truth and I want the others to be careful to such issues and fight for their rights.Thanks amazon for your fair action I always trusted your site and you never let me downRegards , From the United Arab Emirates , DUBAI
 This was my first pair of MBTs . I was very disappointed . They are not comfortable and are very clunky and awkward to walk in . I really expected more from the brand name MBT . Now I understand the big reduction in price .
 Yes I just checked my sandals bought from the same Seller two months ago `` SHOP U Last '' after reading the previous review . I 'm in shock to find OUT that they also sold me a pair of '' Sample not for sale '' sandals . What a bunch of crooked and dishonest people out there . PLEASE Beware of this particular DISHONEST MERCHANT '' SHOP U LAST '' I GIVE YOU AN ADVICE : '' IT DOES NOT PAY TO BE DISHONEST '' .

 I ended up giving away these shoes after wearing them one day . We have a recycle area in our apartment building , but it is usually used for things that are not brand new ! These shoes hurt my feet and had no cushioning at all against the concrete I walk on . I will not buy another pair of shoes on line again , unless I know the make and size from hands on purchase before .
 This was called learning the hard way not to believe the hype and not to buy shoes on line . The fit was awful , there is no cushioning to speak of in the soles and other than looking good off my feet these shoes are useless .
 Looks pretty good but uncomfortable for outdoor activities . My feet hurt after walking 5 hours .

 I agree with the other reviewer -- these are mis-sized . I wear an 11.5 or sometimes a 12 , and due to his/her review I got an 11.5 . The shoes are far too big for me and I 'll have to return them .

 quite dissapointing . I returned them . They look cheap , feel cheap and run a full size to small .
 I purchased these shoes about 60 days ago . After verifying the fit and apparent quality , I put them away until closer in time to a trip I will soon be taking . I started wearing them about 2 weeks ago . I have worn them maybe 15 times . The sole on one is coming unglued from the body of the shoe . Amazon is of NO HELP WHATSOEVER in resolving my problem . They can not provide any way to contact the manufacturer . The mfr 's web site does not have a way to contact them -LSB- COMING SOON it says -RSB- . Amazon offered a $ 30 credit toward the purchase of another pair ?!?!?!?! Not hardly . Amazon has permanently lost my business .
 The boots were delivered within reasonable time . The boots fit well and are comfortable to wear . Leather quality is OK though I have seen better quality leather for the same price . There is however a defect I noted on the second day . There are small cracks , about 12 , 1/4 '' long each at the back of the right shoe . Photo sent . Manufacturer responded to my query and offered replacement or refund . Unfortunately , I am based outside of US and can not ship back using prepaid UPS provided . Could have been nice shoes .

 I like Vaneli styles , and I own other shoes from this company , but these were unusually cheap . They were unlined ! I looked at the other Vaneli shoes in my closet , and they are lined . The suede will certainly stretch out of shape very quickly without any type of lining . In addition , the heel plates are cheap , hard plastic . My experience with this type of heel plate is that it crack and even falls off . My other complaint is the excessive shipping charges . FootSmart charged me $ 12.99 to ship the shoes , and because I am mailing them back due to their cheap construction , they are charging me $ 6.99 more using the barcode return label . Thus I spent $ 20 to try on cheap shoes . I do n't think I will buy Vaneli online anymore , and I wo n't order from FootSmart . Many other shoe vendors charge much less or even zero -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- ! -RRB- .
 Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot , however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out .
 They are marked 9 , which I wear , but I ca n't even get them on . I 'm assuming they were mismarked as to size.I have 2 other size 9 pairs of Sketchers that fit me perfectly and are my favorite shoes .
 After a few months use , noticed a blister forming on the ball of my foot . For a week , I could not figure out what was causing it ... shoes were well broken in?Come to find out the shoe liner completely disintegrated in the shoe ... wore down to rough Styrofoam that is paper thin and offers no support.Stuff happens . So , I called Brooks and asked for replacements -LRB- said I would even pay !! -RRB- I was informed they do not have that `` part . '' I would need to go to a local store and purchase an `` after market '' brand.With all the shoes out there , would pass on these ... and would pass on Brooks . You would think shoe liners would be a no brainer ... and they are integral to the comfort of the shoe ...
 I have bought this sneaker before and thought it was a good running shoe . It was the black/smoke/gray one but i recently bought these white/blue ones and the quality of the shoe has really gone down . I still have the black ones which feel alot better than these brand new ones .

 I bought these shoes based on the reviews . I am not happy with them at all . I did n't mind having to `` stretch them out '' to get my foot in . I would have dealt with that even though it cut off curculation for about 10-15 mins , if they were comfy.Unfortunately , my heels were on fire within an hour . I bought $ 20 insoles to replace the thin ones in the shoes , for shock absorbing on the heels as well as arch support b/c they have none.Nope , still did n't work . I was miserable in these shoes . If you have no feet problems or weight issues , these might work for you . But if you are n't skinny or have any extra weight that make standing on your feet miserable , then do n't get these shoes . I have found luck w / the Croc Specialists for work , try those . They may not be entirely fashionable , but they are better on my heels and my siatic nerve is not crying out in pain every night !
 I have really bad feet even at the age of 36 and these shoes are not made for anyone that stands on their feet more than 2-3 hrs a day . Your feet are the most important part of your body and you need to support your weight with them . Change your shoes out every 6 months if you wear them everyday . Get over it , plan to spend no less than $ 100 on a good pair of work shoes if you stand all day .
 These shoes hurt my feet . Would send back if I could . I would n't waste my money . They made my feet sore .
 these are cute , and comfy at first , but with heel spurs they just dont have enough cushion and support . plus , they are so low to the ground I had to roll up all my pants . going back to a sneaker style .
 I am a part time waitress who needed not a only a shoe that was slip resistant but also something comfortable . The shoe is in fact slip resistant but offers no arch support and feels harder than a rock to walk in . I would not recommend this shoe for anyone who has knee , leg , back , or foot pain .
 I think there is a factory employing children made of plastic making other things made of plastic and these shoes are one of them . Very cheaply made . Not comfy at all . Would be probably better suited as a planter for begonias or a little place to store rocks or bugs .
 I do n't know if I just got a bad pair or if the people that left good reviews are on crack but to each their own I guess . When I got these I could not believe the lousy little insert `` insole '' that was in them but I thought I should still give them a shot since the reviews are good right ? WRONG !!!!! I HATE THESE THINGS , This are the most miserable pair of shoes I have ever owned , they are comfortable for about 4 hours the very first time and then straight to the crapper they go , I am serious , MISERABLE , my feet have never hurt so bad , WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY !!! I have to wear these until the other work shoes come in that I just ordered , the skechers encompass which is like heaven from what I have heard and from the 5 min I got to try them on I just cant wait ! SAVE YOURSELF !!! DO NOT , NOT NOT NOT NOT BUY THESE , YOU WILL BE MISERABLE and every form of the word . If you want skechers try the encompass !!!
 I purchased these for work , as I always buy skechers for work -LRB- non-slip -RRB- . I was extremely disappointed in these shoes . I ordered the normal size that I wear in skechers and these shoes fit . After one day of wearing them at work they tore holes in my heels so badly that I was crying at work and could n't walk . There is some kind of weird raise in the heel that when you walk it scrapes against the heel . Size wise my shoes fit fine . I work in a very high volume restaurant and I would not recommend these to anyone in the industry .
 They run very small and its almost impossible to get your foot in your true size . If you order these , order a larger size .
 The shoes were in excellent condition although the size run a little small and it 's really tight.So if ur thinking of buying it remwmberto buy it in a bigger size , at least one size bigger.for example if your size 7 choose a size 8
 They are wonderful looking , but have huge wide heels . I felt like i was wearing flip flops ... Worst part i had to pay to send them back ! In this economy thats a definite OUCH !!!
 I purchased the sock monkey slippers for my 8 year old daughter to have shipped to me for Christmas . They arrived on time , however the medium size 4 for children turned out to be for a toddler , not an 8 year old . She wears a shoe size 3-4 . It was not clear in the description of this product when I ordered it . They were not cheap or easy to find and now I have to pay to return them .

 It looks good but hurt my feet . I have never wore it after 20 minutes . The bottom was too heavy and the top is too little to hold onto your feet .
 I bought a pair of Eastland 10 years ago and they were fantastic shoes , comfortable and long lasting , they finally died . I then purchased 2 pairs of the newer version of the shoe shown here , not as comfortable as the original -LRB- the others looked better for the work place too -RRB- but I broken them in and they were acceptable . Now a year later the sole of the shoe has split in two . Definitely not as well constructed as the last pair but they cost the same . Actually the interior of the heel of one of the shoes broke very shortly after I started using them . Right now it would seem I would get about as much usage from a pair costing 1/3 as much . One of the reasons for going to these was because the cheaper shoes die after about a year of wear . The quality has really degraded . You might want to look elsewhere .
 I purchased this shoe in the usual size I take in Eastland shoes and I could hardly get my foot into the shoe . Once on , with the use of a shoehorn , the shoe was long enough but too tight overall . Too uncomfortable on , it was immediately apparent they had to go back . Disappointed as the shoe is good looking and I have had very good luck with Eastland shoes otherwise . Plus had to pay return shipping . : -LRB-
 I 've owned 3 pair of these shoes . Comfort is great , good support , roomy toe box and easy to get on and off . But the soles and heel crack and split long before the leather uppers show wear . The inside lining material wears and becomes shabby quickly . I would pay twice the price for better quality for a longer wear . The design is great but the material inside and the sole/heel is inferior . I 'd buy again IF the price reflects the material quality .
 I , too , had the same shoe for years but the material at the top was starting to wear so I replaced it with this new shoe . The new shoe was not as comfortable at first , but after time has become more comfortable . After just over a year , I , too , have had the same problem with this replacement pair as other reviewers . The bottom of the shoe has split on both shoes . This is very troubling since my previous pair lasted for years with much more wear .

I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .
 Looked and felt fine out of the box . Only wet for a few hours launching my boat and the next day I noticed the insert came unglued . Looks like it uses just a little glue to keep them in , which is too bad , a few stitches would go along way especially at $ 25 , these are the same quality as the $ 7 Walmart used to carry . To be fair , at this price range , I doubt you 'll fair much better regardless of brand .
 So , I loved these shoes so much that I bought them in tan and black . They 're cute and comfortable , which is great ... as long as you only want to wear them once . The strap across the back felt loose when I first put it on , but that was okay because there 's a super convenient strap with a buckle across the back that allowed me to tighten the strap . Problem solved ? NOPE ! The next time I put them on , I noticed they were loose again . Hoping I had lost a pound or two overnight , I took the shoe off to again tighten the strap , and that 's when I saw it
 Loved them the minute they arrived , but stupidly threw out the box . The strap in the back tore the first day I wore them . . ca n't return without box ... spending $ for shoe repair ... very disappointed with quality .
 I , too , had the same shoe for years but the material at the top was starting to wear so I replaced it with this new shoe . The new shoe was not as comfortable at first , but after time has become more comfortable . After just over a year , I , too , have had the same problem with this replacement pair as other reviewers . The bottom of the shoe has split on both shoes . This is very troubling since my previous pair lasted for years with much more wear .
 I 've owned 3 pair of these shoes . Comfort is great , good support , roomy toe box and easy to get on and off . But the soles and heel crack and split long before the leather uppers show wear . The inside lining material wears and becomes shabby quickly . I would pay twice the price for better quality for a longer wear . The design is great but the material inside and the sole/heel is inferior . I 'd buy again IF the price reflects the material quality .
 I bought a pair of Eastland 10 years ago and they were fantastic shoes , comfortable and long lasting , they finally died . I then purchased 2 pairs of the newer version of the shoe shown here , not as comfortable as the original -LRB- the others looked better for the work place too -RRB- but I broken them in and they were acceptable . Now a year later the sole of the shoe has split in two . Definitely not as well constructed as the last pair but they cost the same . Actually the interior of the heel of one of the shoes broke very shortly after I started using them . Right now it would seem I would get about as much usage from a pair costing 1/3 as much . One of the reasons for going to these was because the cheaper shoes die after about a year of wear . The quality has really degraded . You might want to look elsewhere .
 I purchased this shoe in the usual size I take in Eastland shoes and I could hardly get my foot into the shoe . Once on , with the use of a shoehorn , the shoe was long enough but too tight overall . Too uncomfortable on , it was immediately apparent they had to go back . Disappointed as the shoe is good looking and I have had very good luck with Eastland shoes otherwise . Plus had to pay return shipping . : -LRB-
 I got these for my ranch . Liked when I first got , but it sprung a leak and they are only 3 months old ! not happy about this and will not buy this brand again !
 Seems like good construction - but ridiculously oversized . I ordered one size smaller than I needed and that was still just too big . Had to return them because they were n't really wearable - what a pain ...
 I purchased these to work in hot wet conditions so I wear shorts and a tee shirt while grinding concrete countertops . The surface inside rubs against my calf and burns a raw spot there . I have to stuff cloth inside to prevent chafing .
 When I received this product , it was not quite what the picture entailed . There were quite a few differences . They ran a size and a half roughly too large . Not a huge fan of this product . Not happy with them at all . They 've been used once and now are just sitting .
 I purchased this boots for same price I would find it at Walmart , but I tjought I would get some better quality . . Wrong!I returned this items 3x times , and every time was a manufacturer defect with either left or the right boot . Finnaly I asked for a refund . Anyway , I went to Walmart and I bought a pair of rainy boots made in Canada , good quality for less money.I understand to get it wrong for the first time but 3x times to receive bad products ?! I was very dissapointed .
 Ah , just a suggestion ... they might sell better if you include the size !!! DUH !!!
 Not lined and the leg opening is not big at all if you have large calves . Had to get a bigger size just to fit the leg opening , but now the shoe part is too big
 it fits perfectly as a size 14 . my foot is a size 11 or 12 . it smells . it does n't seem like it will last more than a few months if you do hard work outside . i would n't recommend it . but for 19 , it 's the best deal on amazon.i took off the boots 40 minutes ago . i 'm in my room , and i can still smell the boot smell from my leg . it 's making me nausea . i got the boots today too .
 Much too wide at the top and too wide at bottom . My foot just swam around in it. , It fit more like a size 8 . I have even had size 8 's that fit better . Guess this is made for a rally wide foot .
