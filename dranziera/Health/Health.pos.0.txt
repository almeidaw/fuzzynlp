 Excellent stockings for long shifts on your feet - not too tight , not too loose ... garment integrity is longer than package states -LRB- with proper care -RRB- .
 After I had a DVT my doctor required me to wear compression stockings . I wore ugly white TED hose and yucky thick brown stockings . Then I found Jobst UltraSheer . They gave me the compression I needed -LRB- 15-20 , -RRB- but looked like regular pantyhose . Even though my blood clot has been gone for 4 years , I still buy these to wear as support stockings because they make my legs feel so nice . ** Note , I have problems with the rubberized tops rolling down my thigh . I tried the Jobst adhesive , but I hated having my skin pulled all day . I bought an inexpensive garter belt and it works fine and helps keep the stockings from rolling .
 My doctor recommended the thigh high version of this product , but I became very aggravated with them constantly rolling down through the course of the day . They were never comfortable . With my doctor 's permission , I switched over to the knee highs , and they are WONDERFUL !!! I do n't even know I 'm wearing them ! They totally control my calf aching and swelling . Would highly recommend them !!!
 Stockings fit well and are comfortable . Have n't had the opportunity to see how effective they are in preventing edema from air travel .
 Excellent product . However , they are very difficult to get on for older people . I feel like I 've had a full day workout after getting them on . Also , as the day wears on , they begin to roll down from the top and create a very deep ridge in the skin . I have to wear them , so if those two difficulties could be addressed it would be such a help .
 Does a very good job of relieving fatigue . This is a well known brand and is certainly comfortable enough to wear all day . Even if your doctor did n't prescribe these but you are on your feet alot , take care of yourself and buy these .
 It is wonderful to find exactly what you are looking for . I did n't after three years using them I found they have them with a closed toes . I love them
 I 've always had pain in my legs during long travels either by car or plane when you ca n't move very much . I used them for a recent trip consisting on 6 flights total and I could feel the difference . I was n't totally stiff when I got off the planes . They do stay in place with the band at the top . Just be careful they tear as easily as stockings . If you 'll use them much you better get a couple of extra pairs .
 the item was very pleasing to my wife . she has bought this product before in a local store that was probably a previous model , the top of the hose was not as secure as the ones i ordered from the amazon provider.the order was shipped as i was told it would be . i am satisfied with the over all purchase process .
 this beauty looks like the real thing and makes foreplay that much more exciting . my man and i love this thing . it 's powerful , quiet , and everything i could ever want in a vibrator.would definitely buy another if this one breaks , which i do n't think will be for a couple of years . i hope ...
 I liked this toy . This vibe has a nice shape and it 's not really big . In a way it 's actually really cute . It 's got really strong vibrations , but I would have liked more variations between the vibrations . I enjoyed the fact that the toy does n't have an odd taste or smell . My only real complaint is that its too hard around the middle , so you can feel the motor when you use it . Other than that it does the job , and it perked up my night .
 The California Exotics Waterproof Delights Blue Ballsy , is to spice up the relationship and it worked since the beginning , my other half likes it .
 The gf loves this and when she lost it when moving it was her first thing she had to get back . Great vibe low noise , alittle on the firm side though .
 It may be a basic model but it does the job ! My husband and I call it my little blue friend . Do n't hesitate !!!
 After almost a decade on various medications to relieve my anxiety I was tired of relying on and paying for medications . I did research on GABA as a stress reliever and started taking it . First on an as needed basis , and now every day . GABA along with a B Complex vitamin have changed my life around , and for the first time in almost 10 years , I am off of prescription meds !! Back in October I spent 4 weeks out of state to take care of my dying father . Even though it was incredibly difficult and sad , I was able to keep it together without medication . GABA taken at night promotes a restful sleep and together with B Complex has given me a new found relaxation and peace.I do not recommend that anyone takes themselves off medication without their physicians ok - especially for severe depression or overwhelming anxiety . But I highly recommend that people experiencing excessive stress or anxiety issues give Kals GABA 750mg a try along with a quality B complex vitamin
 Great to use with that special friend or lover , but great to use if you are alone . Would highly revomend trying ...
 I take 3 at night be for I got to bed , it helps me rest better !! TRY IT !! AND THE PRICE IS OK
 I love this product and love this company ... all of their supplements are superb quality !!! I finshed my bottle and need to buy another one . Much better than the liquid form that you have to drink .
 I like the Solaray Brand . I am not allergic to it . Vitamin D-3 was recommended by my doctor . The Vitamin D-3 keeps me healthy .
 This is crazy i purchased this item about a week ago and when i went to put it on and got with my partner she laughed and fell to the ground it was so funny i thought she was going to have a heart attack just having this crazy condom on and in intercourse it just made it alot better the sex seriously try it if im wrong .
 This has to be the worst tasting spray in the universe , it is simply awful . But , it works incredibly well.Two sprays just before going to bed and it seems to help whenever my throat feels raw or I have a slight cough . Nothing scientific , but it also seems to help with my snoring . There is a double benefit . I do n't use this every night , only when my throat feels a bit raw.Over time I 've gotten used to the nasty taste . Because it works so well , it 's beginning to taste just fine . The flavor is a bit like those ancient horehound drops my grandmother made me take , without the sweetness -LRB- Horehound Drops Bag
 Zand Throat Spray has been a life saver for me.I 'm a Cancer survivor and I 'm still pretty beat up . A few years ago , during treatment , I collapsed from Anaphylactic Shock . That permanently damaged my Epiglottis , the flap that covers -LRB- protects -RRB- your windpipe when you swallow food or liquids . I then began aspirating foods into my Lungs . As a result , I had 16 bouts with Terminal Pneumonia . I 'm a fighter , so I survived , but only by the Grace of God.So now I experience a strong biting feeling in my deep throat . It causes me to cough uncontrollably . But , with a couple of sprays of this product it ceases . What a gift!I do n't know how I could live without it.TaosGuy
 I have been using this product for years because I have a chronic cough . I think it helps keep my throat moist and helps prevent and alleviate sore throat .
 I 've been using this product for many years during flues and when I would get sore throats . Gurgle your throat with salt , spray this in your throat and do n't eat for a few hours . If you catch your sore throat during an early stage , you can CURE it with this spray . Otherwise , it will become a lot more manageable .
 I had a very bad chest cold and did n't want to take a lot of meds . I knew I had to cough to get all that yucky stuff out of my lungs but there were times I thought I would pass out from coughing . Thank goodness for this throat spray . When I could not stop coughing , it helped to settle the cough enough so I could catch my breath ! Cough drops just took to long to work and were too sweet . I am always going to have this one in my medicine chest .
 I went to a nutritionist and had two different brands of vitamin k . The other brand I had she told me was doing absolutely nothing for me , a waste of my money . But this vitamin k bottle from solaray was definitely benefitting me . So I would recommend this brand you all .

 I must tell anyone who wears these stockings ... I wear them everyday ... thigh highs ... you need to get the Jobst `` It Stays '' roll on body fixative and just put a couple of dots around your legs at the top of where the stockings will be ... they WILL NOT ROLL DOWN ... They stay put ALL day for me . I would n't even put them on with out it .
 I bought this for my father as a gift . He seems to really enjoy it . Being something he had in years past , the hand held infrared devices became a little hard to locate . While this one does n't seem to have the super high build quality that ones did from years gone by , it does the job and as the gift receiver my father seems to be very satisfied with it .
 So easy to hold . Very relaxing and it really does help with sore achy muscles . The price ca n't be beat . I bought a few to give to family and friends . Love It !!!
 USING THIS PRODUCT FOR SORE MUSCLES OF MY OWN AND OTHERS . PROVIDES A DEEP HEAT SOOTHING RELIEF . CA N'T WAIT FOR IT TO BE BACK ON THE MARKET
 I found this little lamp to be very effective for a painful joint or stiff neck and shoulders . I 've read other reviews saying it melted from use . That has n't happened with mine but I usually use it for a half hour at a time and it 's great .
 At this price -LRB- although twice what I 've seen it on store shelves -RRB- , I 'm very satisfied . I purchased this gadget to apply semi-deep warmth and relieve swelling and congestion in sinus areas . Its strength is low enough that I can hold it to skin for a longer period of time than some other infrared devices , giving the heat time to do its job and provide comfort . Bonus
 I recieved this item and was pleased with it . It was not as hot as the old one I had but still gave enough heat to remedy most of the pain . I really do not understand why so many said it did not get hot enough . I found it be very warm and it could of been very uncomfortable if left in the same spot for long . It was effective and the amount of heat was perfect , in my opion .
 I received the product in a timely manner . It was as advertised . I have used it a number of times and it works well although I have n't gotten the results from it I had hoped for . No fault of the seller or the product though .
 With the double vibes , this little dude has all the power you will ever need . The wife loves it ! The only down side is the size . The ring is a little small , and not very flexible .
 This is a great immunity booster and also when I take it on a daily basis it repels mosquitos . I can recommend it highly .
 Good price , excellent design and shipped well.Would 've been better if the vendor also provided personalized engraving .
 My dermatologist tried to sell me these exact pantyhose for a cosmetic procedure I had done . I had some spider veins removed and was told to wear these compression hose after . They wanted to charge me $ 40 more than Amazon . So I bought mine here and they did exactly what I needed them to . I wore them 48 hours straight . . then daily for seven additional days . I actually found I liked having them on b/c they kept me super warm . Definitely would n't want to wear these suing the summer ! I never got a snag or run in my hose and I was n't gentle on them . I have small children and am constantly on the ground playing with them . I washed them in my sink with a little soap and hung them to dry . I 'm sure you could wash them in the washing machine on a low cycle but it only took me two mins to wash them by hand in the sink . So no complaints here ... good buy !
 muy buen producto . rapido facil y a tiempo la entrega . sin contratiempos en todo el proceso . lo recomiendo a a
 excellent protection for aching legs . i wear them under my scrubs or with dress clothes for work . i am a medical student and by the end of the day my legs are normally hurting in a million & one places . these really help .
 I am a personal trainer , work a full timejob , teach 5 classes a week at the gym and take care of my children and family . Needless to say , but I put a lot of stress and strain on my body . Before I discovered this I would often get sick because I was so wore down . Someone recommended this product to me . I was very surprised that it actually worked . I always keep some on hand now and recommend it to everyone for immunity support . The taste is horrible but for me , the liquid is the only one that is so highly effective . Take in a small swallow of OJ , then drink a glass of OJ to kill the taste !
 As the other reviewers stated , when taken as soon as you feel something coming on -LRB- for me it 's either the beginning of a sore throat , with or without a headache , or that run-down feeling right before getting sick -RRB- , this product has stopped those symptoms from advancing into something worse . My last two bottles have had a long shelf life / expiration date . I keep it in a cool , dark cupboard and seal it tight . They each worked more than a year after purchase . Come to think of it , I do n't take any other products , just this one . And the taste is n't that bad to me ... it 's odd , herbal-y , not pleasant , but ok . Well worth the results !
 If I take this 3 or 4 times a day at the first sign of a cold , it usually makes the symptoms go away . I mix 1 1/2 droppers in a bit of pulpy OJ ... . not such a bad taste that way ... The key to it working for me seems to be in taking it as soon as I feel the onset of a cold . If I wait a day or two the results are n't as good .
 I have used this product for 23 years . Nothing even comes close to nipping the cold or flu in the bud . Yes the taste is not great , but I would take 30 seconds of a bad taste in my mouth over getting sick -LRB- for 1 to 3 weeks and missing work -RRB- any day . I take this when I start to get that little tickle in the back of my throat , or feel any semblance to a cold or flu symptom . This is one of 2 products I keep on hand at all times . Oscillococcinum is equally as effective for those flu symptoms . Buy a box of 6 doses and take one when you start to feel that aching weird feeling in your body and in your head.Zand Insure Herbal cured my chronic cough that I had for 5 years , in 5 days , no joke . I had gone to 3 different doctors and no one could tell me what the hell was going on . I walked into a health food store coughing and the owner gave me a bottle of Zand liquid Immune Herbal -LRB- as it was called back in the early 90 's -RRB- been using it ever since , in fact I ended up getting a job there and worked for him for 10 years . Thank you Janet Zand for creating a truly remarkable product .
 My wife and I have used this product for a number of years and feel it helps to avoid most colds and lessens the severity of colds that you get . We combine this with an increased dose of Vitamin C when we feel the onset of a cold . We use three stopper full doses three or four times a day when we feel it necessary .
 I have been using this product for many years now . Granted I eat a mediteranian diet with loads of fruits and vegatables and fish , so I have generally good health . But I also us a small dose of this daily in my Kombusha/Greentea mix and it works fantastic . During the cold and flu season I just up the dosage a bit . I still catch colds but it never gets past the stage of just starting to come down with it . Never becomes a full blown cold . Why pay for terrible medical care when you can care for yourself in a much friendlier healthier manner ?
 This particular product is a great value over the smaller bottles . You are basically stupid not to order this size if this is a product you use a lot . Obviously you know the benefits of this product if you are reading this . Yes , it is a great product for staying healthy . For anyone looking for anything with the herbs contained in this , look no further , just buy this one .

 I have had a Sqwiggler for a number of years and never had a problem with it . I am ordering another for my dad , who has advanced alzheimer 's and responds to the tactile very well . It is nice to squiggle yourself , and wonderful to have someone else do it for you .
 I must tell anyone who wears these stockings ... I wear them everyday ... thigh highs ... you need to get the Jobst `` It Stays '' roll on body fixative and just put a couple of dots around your legs at the top of where the stockings will be ... they WILL NOT ROLL DOWN ... They stay put ALL day for me . I would n't even put them on with out it .
 The package came ahead of schedule and in a nick of time because it started to get really cold , snowy with freezing rain and these socks came in handy to keep my toes warm and dry over my CAST . I plan on buying more because it is really nasty weather up here in New England and I have to wash them often . Also these look a lot better than others posted/advertised on Amazon because some look just like a surgeons mask instead of a sock .
 I ordered the largest size of the sock but my cast is too big for it to completely go over the entire thing . However , it does cover my toes and keeps them warm . Overall , I 'm a happy camper with these . If you have a smaller cast , they work perfectly.Pedifix Stretch Socks
 Warm , soft and cozy . I ordered this for my mom 's broken foot , thinking it was made for a cast -LRB- I guess the reviews made it show up in my search ? -RRB- and had a good laugh when they arrived as a pair and we realized these were just regular -- albeit very , very , very large -- socks . Highly recommended for abnormally large feet and/or foot casts.Thanks , Pedifix : D
 I bought a couple of pair of these to go over my cast from a recent foot surgery . Keeps my toes pretty warm . Very satisfied with this product .
 This sock saved me from immeasurable pain and discomfort . It gently stretches to go on painlessly ; trust me if you break your foot , your old athletic socks will not do , they will kill your broken toe / foot . The other thing I was desperately looking for when I turned to Amazon , was a sock that would wick away moisture , and not make my foot too hot . This sock is AMAZINGLY dry . And , it is odor free . Just as advertised.My tip
 I got these in preparation for my ankle surgery and thank God I did . I used them to cover up the large splint/bandage and my toes post-op and now I wear them over the hard cast . It 's especially important over the cast - even though it 's a smooth fiberglass it gets caught on the furniture and bedding so covering with the sock eliminates that problem and keeps my toes nice and warm as well . It fits perfectly to the top of it -LRB- my cast ends a few inches below my knee -RRB- . I am also using a Cast Cozy for extra warmth when I go outside or when my toes are really cold inside . Both are really needed IMO . Definitely get the XL for covering any cast or bulky bandage . That 's what I have and it fits fine but I do n't think a smaller size would work . They are also holding up well after 3 weeks of use and washing - no holes to be found -LRB- and I take it on and off at least 2x daily to check the swelling in my toes -RRB- .
 I recently broke my foot and were put in a FP Walker boot . The 1st couple of days were no fun with the skin on the back of my heel rubbing . I could not get a normal sock on due to the swelling.These socks rock ! Easy to put on and padding in all the right places.I am definitely buying some more .
 I recently had surgery on my ankle after breaking it pretty badly & needed to find socks to wear under my brace -LRB- aircast boot -RRB- . My doc said I could just wear my own socks , but my own socks are way too tight to comfortably wear with my swollen foot & ankle . I found these & they 're perfect to comfortably fit without putting any pressure on my incredibly sensitive foot . The only con would be the price - not sure why it 's so expensive to make what are basically incredibly lightweight mesh socks -LRB- they do have extra padding on the feet , but they 're still very light/thin socks -RRB- . But ultimately , they 're worth the price for me -LRB- so much so I 'm buying a second pair -RRB- .

 I love this thermometer . Do n't get me wrong , it is definitely an expensive purchase . However , the money was well spent . My husband and I went through a considerable amount of trouble in regards to our children and trying to determine if they were truly having fevers . For a period of about 6 months , our kids were having fevers ranging from a low grade , to a true textbook definition of having a fever . Well , we were under the impression that they were . We have made several trips to the doctor 's office , even switching pediatricians a few times in order to try to figure out what was going on . We were using an Exergen thermometer -LRB- which our doctor 's office used -RRB- that continuously showed higher temperatures . Now , I 'm not knocking the thermometer , in fact , it 's helped us during other incidents of true fevers . But , based on what our pediatricians kept saying , the only way to get an accurate temperature reading is with a rectal temp . Now , the basic rectal thermometers that can be purchased at local pharmacies/walmart/target / etc never work for us . This Welch Allyn thermometer is accurate and considerable fast considering how long it takes to get rectal temps . So , for parents who have been having difficulty finding an accurate reading of your child 's temperature , save yourself the stress and purchase something that will definitely match up to your standards . It 's expensive , but will save you money in the long run .
 Item is exactly what I wanted and expected . I decided after purchasing several other Probe , Ear and Temple Thermometers and them not work properly as well as not being accurate , it was time to spend the money and use exactly what they use at the Dr. 's office . Being in the Medical Field I checked out the reviews and purchased what seemed to be the best fit .
 My health condition requires frequent monitoring of my temperature . The inexpensive thermometers were inconsistent and replacement batteries were hard to find . The Sure Temp Plus 690 costs more , but is very accurate , easy to use and AA batteries can be purchased anywhere . I feel confident in the readings . A back lit display would be nice , but is not essential . It probably would run down the batteries faster . I would recommend the item to anyone needing fast and accurate temp readings .
 Just like the professionals use . Just as accurate . It 's not a toy . Well worth the peace of mind . If you have kids use it on the kids , just use adult supervision .
 We were left with flexible spending money at the end of the year and thus decided to make the plunge and purchase this . This thermometer is expensive but worth it . We have 3 children and have bought many junk thermometers at the local pharmacies over the years that no where compare to this one . It 's fast and accurate , takes about 5 seconds for a reading . I 'm very satisfied with it so far .
 Very sturdy . Holds up well and performs accurately for long periods , even in the context of high humidity and difficult conditions in a developing world hospital .
 I got one of these for our office . This model is a big step up from the previous model -LRB- 679 -RRB- that it replaced . The 679 has only 1 button from which to access all functions . The 690 has 3 buttons so you can quickly access the function that you want . It appears to be durable & accurate . Highly recommended .
 I love having this thermometer . We have three kids and one is an infant.I got rid of my pile of cheap thermometers ! I do n't have to second guess the reading like I did with the cheap ones . If you have an infant , you will need a rectal probe . I ended up buying that and switch them out depending on which kid we need to check . It 's easy to switch out and I recommend spending the money to have that peace of mind .
 I bought 3 other types of thermometers - temporal scan , auxuliary thermometer -LRB- but -RRB- , oral thermometer , but was getting tired of guessing her temperature . I just decided to purchase this one , the same one used by my hospital and personal doc . So happy to have peace of mind .
 It is the best and easy way to purchase your needs , it is safe in money and time thanks to amazone
 Finally got fed up with all small digital thermometers , none of which seem to be reliable , or require a full 3-4 minutes to be accurate , which is an aggravating long time for the -LRB- OB -RRB- patient . I LOVE this `` machine '' , it is accurate and well worth the expense !
 If you have kids this Electronic Thermometer works great ... very accurate . A little expensive , but when you need the best this is the one ...
 I have wasted a lot of money on inexpensive `` instant-read '' thermometers . I have found them all to be unreliable , giving wildly inconsistent readings . I consulted with a health practitioner , who recommended the Welch Allyn Suretemp Plus 690 . It works . It gives consistent temperature readings . Wahoo!I was concerned by another review that indicated the thermometer wears out quickly , but I decided that pertained to a busy health care office environment , and would not be a concern for limited home use.Note the probe covers are required
 I am tracking my temperature every morning and need a thermometer with a screen that is easy to read . This one is great . Bought two others cheaper ones that broke in use quickly . Really does take my temperature in 4 seconds .
 We do home care for my dad and have to take his rectal temperature every 2 hours when we turn and re-position him . We have had the same Welch-Allyn Sure Temp 690 thermometer for 4 1/2 years now . We just replaced the well and probe a few months ago . The casing finally cracked after all of this time . We have only had to change the batteries twice , too . It is still working perfectly and we would recommend this thermometer to anyone who really needs to take temperatures often . It is so reliable . This one gets 5 stars !!!!!
 These days , it seems like every store-bought thermometer is a junky toy . They 're either inaccurate or they break quickly . -LRB- I miss the days of glass/mercury thermometers ... they were slow and fragile but they always worked . -RRB- Anyway , I decided to try this thermometer . It is total overkill for home use , due to the high price , but I was so sick of the cheap junk sold in drugstores that I took the leap . This is a high-quality device , right out of a doctor 's office , and it really does take your temperature in a few seconds.I did have a little bit of a learning curve
 This thermometer is great . We went through a number of less-expensive thermometers before finally finding this one . As a parent of a young child , it 's really important to be able to quickly and accurately take a temperature . After an unexpected hospital stay , we noticed the really awesome thermometers used by the hospital staff . While this model is not quite the one from the hospital , it is the exact model used by our pediatrician . We can always count on it to be fast and accurate!If you have any money left over in your annual healthcare savings account , I recommend spending the money on one of these !
 My wife has some health issues and needs to monitor her temperature regularly . We have gone through all of the cheap digital thermometers we could find , I finally got sick of having the variance in readings -LRB- some were off by as much as .5 degrees ! -RRB- I decided to find the best one I could get . this is it . the same one found in hospitals and doctor 's offices , the 690 is accurate , fast and reliable . It also has a history , which makes reporting to your doctor if you need to easy to do . if you only need to take your temp once in a while , do n't bother with this , but if you even have to take it weekly , I would say this is the only one to consider . make sure you get extra probe covers and replace the battery regularly but otherwise using the model could not be faster or easier .
 I purchased this because I had FSA money I HAD to use . That being said , I am happy I made the purchase . While this is obviously a very expensive device , it reads a temperature very quickly which comes in handy when dealing with sick toddlers .
 My dermatologist tried to sell me these exact pantyhose for a cosmetic procedure I had done . I had some spider veins removed and was told to wear these compression hose after . They wanted to charge me $ 40 more than Amazon . So I bought mine here and they did exactly what I needed them to . I wore them 48 hours straight . . then daily for seven additional days . I actually found I liked having them on b/c they kept me super warm . Definitely would n't want to wear these suing the summer ! I never got a snag or run in my hose and I was n't gentle on them . I have small children and am constantly on the ground playing with them . I washed them in my sink with a little soap and hung them to dry . I 'm sure you could wash them in the washing machine on a low cycle but it only took me two mins to wash them by hand in the sink . So no complaints here ... good buy !
 muy buen producto . rapido facil y a tiempo la entrega . sin contratiempos en todo el proceso . lo recomiendo a a
 excellent protection for aching legs . i wear them under my scrubs or with dress clothes for work . i am a medical student and by the end of the day my legs are normally hurting in a million & one places . these really help .
 HelloI want to let all the ladies know that this product really works ! I am PCOS and the last 3 months I 've lost nearly 20 lbs . then my period came on 7th of july , then again 4th of august and was expecting it 1st of september which it did not come . So I went online and order tha product and rush it and started to take it tuesday night , well today I hot my period and no cramps , no PMS feelings only a little bloated , but I guess is normal for being the first day . I do have a 7 yr old boy , and I am looking for having more children !
 So far I have no complaints . It seems to be working , but I think in more time , I will know if I absolutely love it . I have low progesterone and suffer from PMDD . My last cycle , my pms symptoms were less pronounced , so I think it is working .
 I started taking Vitex after reading about it on many fertility sites . My husband and I have been trying to conceive for over 6 months and are trying everything to make it happen before he deploys . I have always had irregular periods - even my first one was . I had been on birth control mainly to regulate my periods before meeting my husband , and then afterwards to prevent pregnancy . I was having two periods a month or one every 45 days - just all over the map . Since coming off of birth control 7 months ago , my cycles would vary in length between 25 and 35 days . It was driving me crazy having to wonder for weeks at a time if I was just `` late '' again or if I was pregnant . Then when the cycles were shorter , my luetal phase was not long enough to carry out implantation , thsu preventing pregnancy . So I ordered Vitex . I have had a regular 27 day cycle for four months now . I can even pinpoint the exact day I will start my period which has NEVER happened . I will be taking this from now on instead of birth control -LRB- after a pregnancy - hopefully ! -RRB- to regulate my cycles . I highly reccomend it .
 I have been reading about vitex for a year or so . I tried using another brand of vitex and I would feel very weird -LRB- dizzy , light-headed , super heavy flow -RRB- ... I guess it was because the levels of vitex varied with each capsule ... so I was never able to get the correct dosage . So , after reading the reviews for the Solaray Vitex , I decided to give it one more shot . I highly recommend THIS brand of Vitex because the ingredients are standardized ... meaning you are guaranteed get the same potency with every capsule.I have been seeing my doctor for two years now to correct my infertility problems . He told me that I was not able to ovulate on my own . I would have to take drugs . I wanted to try a more natural way first . Last month , I was n't taking vitex ... and I did not ovulate . This month i am pleased to say that I have a positive on my ovulation stick ! I was so happy that I took a picture of it to show my doctor !! It is definitely working for me . Good luck ladies!Dosage
 I have been taking this supplement for a while . I only take one a day . I tried not taking it for a week just to minimize the pills I take every day , but I could feel my mood worsen . This is a great product .
 Had been trying to conceive for two years . first month of taking these and using the ovulation strips . pregnant!Took 2 a day !
 I started taking this because I have irregular menstrual cycles and I want to get pregnant . So far I 've been taking this Solaray Vitex for 3-4 months . I 'm not pregnant yet but my cycles are getting closer to what is considered normal . They used to be anywhere from 30-45 days and now I 'm running more like 32-34 days . On a side note , about two years ago I bought some Vitex for PMS and it did n't seem to work . Later I found out from reading that it 's the Vitex Extract that is supposed to be more effective for these feminine problems and what I had purchased before was just Vitex Fruit . I 'm not sure whether or not the Solaray Vitex Extract I 'm taking now is helping my PMS crabbiness but I think it is helping with my bloating .
 I have been taking vitex for two weeks now.I take a pill in the morning and one at night.I have been noticing my breast becoming sore . . So I 'm going to start taking one a day . . and see if that helps . . the reason why I started taking vitex.For the past year I have been having night sweats and been moody . . Vitex has helped with the night sweats ... but my husband says I 'm still moody.Maybe he makes me moody . . -LRB- lol -RRB- Will let yall now if just taking one pill day works , and hope it helps with the soreness of my breast .
 This product was great , smells weird but it is a root . I would buy it again , no side effects . Great service and price .
 I first started taking this because I saw it on Dr. OZ as a remedy for menstrual cramps , well what I saw on Dr. OZ was actually `` Chaste Tree Extract '' but I have not been able to find that . This is probably the same thing because it works . I started taking it a few days before I expected my period and continued until my period was over and my cramps were not as agonizing as they usually are . I soon started to notice that my hormonal acne -LRB- Nodulocystic acne on my chin -RRB- was not as bad when taking these supplements so I started taking it every day . That led to the unexpected `` problem '' of me not getting my period for several months . I got a little scared and went to the doctor about it . She told me to stop taking it and sure enough I got my period a few months later . I did n't take this stuff for a while because of the whole messing with my cycle thing , I figured it would be best not to do that , but recently my hormonal acne has been raging again , no amount of acne cream was making it go away so I started taking this again and it went away within a few days . I figure , maybe I can treat this stuff like the birth control pill -LRB- not for birth control obviously -RRB- but to even out my hormones and I can stop taking it for a week or so to make sure I do n't go months without a period . At the time I was also taking St. Johns Wart which I am no longer taking , so that could have been the cause of my missed periods since it seems that everyone else reports more regular periods on this herb .
 My husband and I have been TTC for 2 yrs with no luck -LRB- yet -RRB- so after much research I decided to order Vitex . My cycles were anywhere between 35-40 days and I had little to no CM . I took it as directed last month and noticed 100 % improvement in my CM and I ovulated on day 15 which is unheard of for me ! So far , this cycle seems to be identical to last month which is awesome ! I have n't gotten a BFP yet but it has helped regulate my cycle !
 I went off birth control in May and had one period after 40 days and then nothing for 50 days so I started taking vitex and by day 65 I ovulated and two weeks later , I got a BFP ! It 's absolutely amazing if you are trying to conceive and have long or irregular cycles !
 I spent a lot of time researching natural remedies to help with fertility . My husband and I had been trying for 2 years and no success . I am 36 years old with no children and it started getting frustrating . I had 100 % normal periods , 28 days exactly every month . I had read some reviews that said do not take Vitex if you have normal periods . I also get migraines . BAD migraines , usually the exact day before my period.Because of this economy , my husband moved out of state to look for work and so we have been seperated for the past 9 months . We timed out visits with eachother around ovulation . Still no luck . In May 2010 , I started taking vitex . My first period happened as normal as usual but this time , no migraine ! In July , I planned a visit up north to visit my husband . Upon returning to Florida , I discovered I was pregnant ! This after 2 months of taking Vitex!SO , I am a believer in this ! I 'm sure there may have been other factors involved , the food is much fresher and healthier up north and we were just haning out having a good time , no stress . If nothing else , if you get hormone related migraines , I would try Vitex . I have had migraines for many years , so bad I have been in the hospital for them and I have a high pain threshold ! Still have a long way to go and I am considered ` high risk ' because of my age , but an thrilled with Vitex ! Highly recommended , even with regular periods .
 This works ! It is AMAZING ! It helps your body to produce progesterone . You do n't need to take progesterone if you take this . It made a huge difference with my emotional symptoms before my period . I am like a new person ! And it helped with spotting that I was having from not having enough progesterone . I did n't have to take the risky progesterone my doctor wanted me to take - I cured myself with this . Make sure that you take the Vitex that is the extract with .5 % Agnuside -LRB- this one -RRB- . Do n't take the one that is just Chaste Tree fruit . It does nothing and it 's a shame that they make it because people might try it and think that Vitex does n't work . I want every woman who is suffering needlessly to discover Vitex because it helped me SO much !
 Finally a natural product that helped me to actually have a semi-normal period . Instead of 1-2 periods a year that last for 30-60 days , I now have a period about every other month for 8-12 days . I can actually function during my period now . I am finally starting to feel much better.This is an excellent product for premenstral cramps .
 I have always had a normal menstral cycle until about a year ago when I stopped getting my period . I went to the doctor and they prescribed Provera for me to take for a week every four months to get my period . I wanted to get my period regulated again to having it every month like I had it before . I read in a book that Chaste Berry Extract could make that possible . It said it could take a few months but I thought I would give it a try . I have been taking it -LRB- one pill a day -RRB- for months now and for the first few months , the change was minimal but I could tell a little bit of a difference . Now it seems to be working , it is a lot more regulated than it was . I 've only had to take the Provera one time during the first few months of taking this extract . Hopefully soon I wo n't need the Provera at all ! I will continue to take this product for a long while . If you are having the same problem as me , I STRONGLY recommend this ! I 've also heard it helps improve inferility !
 Trying to find something to help with premenopausal symptoms
 I was diagnosed with PCOS after I had my 4th baby . Weight gain , had not had a regular period since I got pregnant -LRB- 2 years -RRB- , and all the fun bs that goes with pcos . After trying 6 months on Metformin , I went to the health food store in town and they suggested this . I now have regular 6 day periods -LRB- from 15 + days of hell -RRB- , mood swings are under control , excess hair growth is slowing , and the pain from the cysts is much better . I recommend you at least TRY this product if you have PCOS , I take 3 pills 2x daily .
 This is the most awesome product ever ! I used to have regular periods till I hit my late 20 's , then my system started going crazy . I 'd miss a period then get one the following month . Then I went for 3 months without ... hence a trip to the dr and left with a prescription for Provera . I started researching Provera and only found bad stuff about it being synthetic ... my search lead me to Vitex , and since its natural , I thought it 's worth a try . I took one pill a day and the following month my period was right on schedule ... and each month since !! I think it works wonderfully.Before writing this review , I read the others and noticed one lady writing about the decreased migraines . I used to suffer from migraines at least once a week , and they were bad & horrible . Bad enough to make a trip to the ER sometimes , as I was sure something much more was wrong ... they were that intense ! I noticed in the last past few months that I 've had less migraines and they were less intense , some that I could skip taking a pill . Upon reading the other ladies reviews , I 'm now confident it was Vitex regularing out the hormones that were causing the migraines . I too found that I 'm less irritable and moody.I want to call Vitex the magic `` lady fix '' .
 When I found this product for my daughter , she was 20 years old and just diagnosed with PCOS . She had moderate beard growth , very overweight , and extremely painful periods . After having a CAT scan done that diagnosed PCOS -LRB- they found cysts on her ovaries -RRB- and a blood test that showed an extremely high testosterone level -LRB- way above the normal range -RRB- , I was quite alarmed when the doctor told us that he wanted to put her on Yaz birth control pills and spironolactone , a potassium-sparing diuretic -LRB- it acts as an anti-androgen , but then you have to monitor your potassium intake -RRB- . I did n't want my daughter on these powerful drugs that both can have dangerous side effects -LRB- strokes for Yaz , cancer for spironolactone -RRB- . So I decided to research a natural supplement that she could try first before resorting to the prescription medications . I found Vitex Chaste Berry Extract , and I started giving my daughter two capsules per day . There have been no side effects from taking this product . My daughter went back to the endocrinologist 6 months later for another blood test . I admitted to the doctor that my daughter had not taken the meds he had prescribed - that we had tried her on Vitex for the past 6 months . I promised him that if the blood test showed no improvement in her testosterone level , we would start her on the meds . Lo and behold , when the results of the blood test came back , my daughter 's testosterone level was reduced to one-half of the previous level -- and it is back in the middle of the normal range !! I was thrilled ! This is a great product , and I highly recommend it for lowering testosterone levels in a female .
 I do not write reviews typically but this product changed my life ! My periods have always been irregular , however I still did not expect them to just stop when I was 25 . . I suffered the mental agony of never getting periods unless I took Provera when I decided enough was enough . The wise Internet came to my rescue and convinced me that Vitex could be the solution . I started taking this product once a day -LRB- first thing in the morning -RRB- for 120 days -LRB- 2 boxes -RRB- with a gap of 2 days when I forgot to pack it on a business trip . During those 120 days , I got 5 periods -LRB- spotting , very light to light flow -RRB- . Then I decided to give myself a week 's break ... and got my full fledged period . So , so thankful ! If your doctor says everything 's okay with you -LRB- yeah , right -RRB- BUT you just need Provera to get your period and fertility treatments to have children , I HIGHLY recommend you try this product . Just give it time to work . Good luck !
 I must tell anyone who wears these stockings ... I wear them everyday ... thigh highs ... you need to get the Jobst `` It Stays '' roll on body fixative and just put a couple of dots around your legs at the top of where the stockings will be ... they WILL NOT ROLL DOWN ... They stay put ALL day for me . I would n't even put them on with out it .
 I have extremely sensitive skin.Regular soaps cause me to break out in a rash.I love this product it has no harsh chemicals and is Fragrance Free.It leaves my skin feeling silky smooth not dry and irritated.I even use it on my face and I noticed a big difference in the look and feel of my skin.If you have problem skin or sensitive painful skin I suggest you try this product I 'm happy I did .

 This creatine powder is like many ... It 's granulated ... it tastes horrible.It 's icky , and it even looks like an illegal drug.Why do I love this product ? Because it is real , high quality creatine.Introduce this supplement to your lifestyle ... even if you are not a body builder or an athlete you will notice the difference in six days of taking this product .
 I HAVE SEEN ENERGY AT THE GYM , EVEN WHEN I RAN . NOT SURE IF IT 'S FROM THE CREATINE BUT I KNOW ISS RESEARCH MAKES GOOD STUFF BECAUSE FIRST TIME I USE THE GLUTAMINE THAT STUFF WORKED REALLY GOOD.THEY 'RE NOT FLASHY ABOUT THEIR PRODUCT ; DO N'T ADD CRAZY FLAVORS AND WHAT NOT , BUT THEY DO MAKE GOOD PRODUCTS . EVERYONE 'S BODY IS DIFFERENT SO EXPERIMENT WHICH WORKS FOR YOU .

 Has been a great transport chair for my wife . Easily to get my wife into and also easier to push her arond in then a wheel chair .
 I have two long haired cats and these are by far my favorite lint rollers -- super sticky and gets the job done in record time .
 This tape is very sticky.I have had products with more sheets - but I think the trade off is good.Good product and good price.More economical to buy the refills .
 I do n't think I 'll ever get a full proof solution to the pet hair problem . As soon as it starts to warm up , on cue , my dog and cat immediately start shedding . But between brushing , my upholstery vacuum and this , I manage to keep it under control . It really comes in handy when I need something really quick . I use it on , everything but my carpet , and I love it . It beats every thing else I 've ever bought .
 i 've used evercare productss before.I expected it to work as well as their lint removers.Well it did n't . It worked better.I have a dog but I am rediculously bent about there being hair all over me and my home . Absolutely no hair , anywhere .
 I love this extra sticky roller ! I 've got 4 cats and this thing really works to get your clothes clean ! Even fuzzy sweatshirts come clean .
 Does the job . Probably can find it cheaper somewhere else , but as far as quality Im not sure there is anything better out there .
 This roller takes the cat hair right off my guest bed , and leaves it clean for my out-of-town guests . I just hope my regular Evercare rollers fit on the handle .
 It is the most sticky roller that i have tried ... almost a sticky roller Connoisseur . Just made the mistake of letting it get slightly smashed and it makes it more difficult to peel off used layer ... but sure does grab the pet hair .
 Yes it is stick and does pick up pet hair , news flash ! That is all there really is to be said
 Evercare extra sticky lint roller is the best product that I have tried of its kind . It is great for removing lint and pet hair from clothing , furniture , bedspreads , etc. , and I believe no dog or cat owner , or owner of any furry animal , should be without this item.It is also wonderful for removing fiberglass from your skin and clothing if you have been ripping out or installing fiberglass insulation or working with resin and fiberglass . If you 've ever worked around fiberglass you know how it sticks in your skin and itches like mad . Evercare extra sticky lint roller actually pulls the fiberglass right out of your skin.Another great use for this product is removing seed ticks . If you live in the southern United States , you know what an unpleasant experience it is to wander into seed tick territory . You can pick up hundreds of these miniscule little bloodsuckers and have them crawling all over your clothes , skin , car upholstery , etc. . With Evercare extra sticky lint roller , you can remove them easily . It will even remove ones that are attached . Just roll them right off .
 I do n't see how this is any different from the conventional -LRB- non-pet -RRB- lint rollers , except maybe that the handle is green ? My dog likes to chew on this one more ? Regardless , it works well -LRB- just as well as the regular version -RRB- for pulling coarse dog hair off just about everything . And so far , the handle has stood up to a few good chewing sessions .
 When I get sick , it almost always ends up in my lungs with lots of coughing . I have tried a lot of different remedies from prescriptions to organic herbs and nothing worked . The pine syrup is the best thing I have found . I highly recommend this product
 The syrup relieved my bronchi during the awful allergy season this year . It is very thick , sap-like , very tasty . Love it !
 My daughter has had chronic nasal drainage since birth and has had numerous sinus infections . After using this product , she can , on many days , go without wiping her nose all day . It has cut down on her infections and she has n't had a real sore nose from wiping it all day . I highly recommend everyone to try this if they have chronic sinus gunk or allergies .
 When my doctor gave me a choice between crutches or a walker , I chose walker . My uncle had one of these and offered me its use . I loved the ease of its smooth gliding wheels and especially the hand brake . I never felt like it was getting away from me . The compartment was handy for traveling around with a book , meds , etc. and doubled as a seat when I was tired and had to rest . I think this is the best walker on the market !
 My wife absolutely loves this rabbit ! During stressful times , she sometimes has difficulty getting `` over the edge , '' so to speak , but this rabbit is able to give her exactly the extra stimulation that she needs . We 've had other vibes , and this is by far the best.The motor is surprisingly powerful but is not terribly noisy . The main body is nice and thick without being monstrous , and the rabbit ears hit her in just the right spot . She also likes the fact that the controls for the clitoral stimulator and shaft are entirely independent , to suit the mood that she 's in at any given moment.And , as one would expect , Amazon shipped the package in a nice , discreet manner . Like many such products , there is a bit of a chemical smell when it comes out of the package , but that quickly subsides with a couple of washes.We purchased this product almost two years ago and it has functioned perfectly for the entire time we 've had it.All in all , it 's been a great buy and has improved an already-great love life . Highly recommended .
 The size of the of the Jack Rabbit is a nice fit the rotating beads and vibrating rabbit will send a woman over the top and begging for more , a must for any woman that needs a little excitement in her life . The multi speeds are a plus and sure to do the job over and over again many times .
 this was my first time getting and using one and im so glad i did ! lol this thing is a champ ! : -RRB-
 good product . pleases the gf . used in the tub once and it stopped working for a day or two . but other than that its a good product
 This was my first vibrator/rotating head and my my my what a way to start out ! It was actually a gift from my husband !
 I 'm very pleased with this product because it has a natural feeling head and makes climaxing easyand can be used in the bathtub , shower or where ever .
 All I can say is OMG !!!! super great ...
 This toy is AMAZING ! Great vibration and the rotating beads do me in almost immediately . Easy to clean and use . Very pleased with the product !
 I bought this for my fiancee and I think she wants to marry it instead of me now . LOL . SHE LOVES IT
 This was the first toy I purchased for myself and I was not let down . Very easy to use and gets the job done quickly . I highly recommend it to anyone sitting there thinking about buying it .
 This is the first battery operated toy to give me an orgasm . I am glad I made the purchase as I had the best Orgasm 's with this rabbit . I used a lubricated condom which made using it very easy . The vibrating ears provide a nice orgasm alone !!! This is a great toy for multiple orgasms .
 Its easy to use and quiet . It rotates and vibrates with 3 levels of intensity . It feels like the real thing . Enjoys ladies
 It arrived fast , and got put to use the same day ! The Jack Rabbit is just what we were looking for , and got the job done in an exciting manner . The girth and the length of the product was just right -LRB- husband was afraid it would be bigger than him , but it was n't -RRB- Used it on all modes , but preferred lowest settings . Smelled a bit like plastic , but what toy does n't at first . Wife truly enjoyed it , and got off strong and fast . Would recommend over similar items priced 3-5x as much at sex toy shop . A +
 I like to try new things and this big -LRB- i mean BIG -RRB- guy came along he is for sure on my top 5 favorite list . Not # 1 because it is a little big and i have to use lots of lube even when i am very wet
 I 'm 24 years old and have never had an orgasm . It 's not that it 's not enjoyable , it definitely feels good , but I 've just never been able to get to that state . I 've had sex with enough men and tried doing it on my own , it just never worked . Then I finally did something about it and ordered this item . It was my first toy . Within 2 minutes I had my first orgasm . WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG TO TRY A TOY ?!?!? :p Now I just have to get a few more toys and introduce them to my sex life with my boyfriend ... hopefully he wo n't mind ^_^
 The Jack Rabbit really works , and works pretty damn fast at that . It is bit on the large side for some , but with a little lube and some gentle play , once those little ears reach the right spot hang-on thing happen quickly . It is the new best friend
 I 'm not really a toy type of person so pretty much it was read some reviews and make a choice.Firstly it was much bigger than I anticipated ! The size -LRB- at least for myself -RRB- was very intimidating and I 'm still not sure if it 's really the right `` fit '' for me.One big complaint on here is about the rubbery smell that emits from it . I did n't find this to be an issue at all . If you stick it right in your nose , yes , it stinks like rubber . I washed mine well before using and still noticed some smell but nothing that interfered in any way with my activity . Also complaints about this product not being soft of flexible are unfounded in my opinion . Even the ears are very soft and pliable . I found the `` rabbit '' part of this product especially enjoyable ! The beads ... I did n't really notice them to be honest but that also speaks to another complaint , I did n't notice any pain or `` scraping '' mentioned in some of the reviews . Other than that I have to say this is a VERY effective device ! I mean ... wow ! The rubber is smooth and soft with some nice textures , the vibration is excellent and the controls are really simple . Also , it 's very quiet ! I have a small apartment and a roomie who knew I was expecting this in the mail . When it arrived she laughed as I headed straight for my bedroom to try it . Afterward I questioned if she had heard `` anything '' and in good humor she insisted she had n't heard a sound . : - DHighly recommend this quality product ! I 've looked other places and have seen this priced at almost $ 80 ! Amazon rocks !
 I just recived this today it came fast only took 2 business days & & it came in a brown box no details on it about what it is & & it was wrapped in a white plastic bag & & so that made me happy & & this is my first toy & & I love it its not that heavy & & it takes 3 aa batteries & & it does the job & & if ur looking for a medium size this is perfect its not to small or big & & the only thing I dislike is the smell it smells like rubber but thats just because its new so it will go away hopefully lol I 'm happy with my perches I hope this helps others
 this would cost at least 2x as much at a specialty store . great product for the price . shipped at a normal speed , had no troubles at all . use it all the time and it is AWESOME !!
 I 'm not sure how I lived so long without this , but I 'm so glad I have it now.I think the width is perfect , the only thing I was n't a big fan of is the bumps on the back side of it . This was my first rabbit , and I highly recommend it !
 I am reviewing the clear jack rabbit vibrator and it is absolutely amazing . Let me tell you , I am a 19 year old girl and I have NEVER had a clitoral orgasm . I tried and tried , but I always ended up getting bored and giving up , so I thought it was impossible for me to ever have a clitoral orgasm . Y' all , I had my first C orgasm ever , and I came in about a minute and a half ! Felt soooooo good ! I would say that noise level is a 2.5 out of 10 , and it has separate vibration and rotation of the head/beads . It 's waterproof which is a nice feature . I would recommend investing in some decent rechargeable batteries with this baby . Overall fantastic product , would definitely recommend and buy again
 This was a great buy . Once you get it in the right spot it takes care of all the rest . If you have never used one before I would recommand this . Perfect for foreplay . Gets the mood going .
 I ordered this toy on December 8 , 2008 and its still going strong today ! Its amazing and has yet to have any issues , it always gets me to finish ! . Would n't want any other toy ! Very quite too.Update
 I do n't know which item other 's are getting but I am glad I did not listen even though there were many negative reviews . I used in the bathtub no problem just make sure I repeat make sure the cap is tight and not cracked from overtightening . This vibrator is large , yes , but I have been with many black men and the size is about an average sized black man 's penis ! -LRB- TMI I know ! -RRB- The penis part does move , some say only the rabbit vibrates , in fact in practically dances and is also hard enough as some said it was not stiff enough . One thing is the rabbit ears are NOT sharp in any form , they are very soft and pliable . My money was very well spent and I love this product . The plastic smell eh get over it , it 's no stronger than latex gloves !
 My fiancee absolutely adores this thing . . If it cud open jars and reach high stuff im pretty sure i would ' t serve any purpous . . lol . . Seriously though . . She loves it . . Amazing valentine present . . Best present ever apparently . . The smell aint all that bad just like plastic really . . Seems to work its magic pretty quick . . Already said when its been exhausted she wants another one . . She genuinely seems delighted with it . . Sooo . . If u wan na walk around with a massive smile on your face ladies . . buy one of these :P But let your man open the jars even if u can . . We do have a little bit of dignity even if its only a little bit .
 ... keeps going and going and going . I got this jack rabbit as a replacement for my last one , an original jack rabbit , in which the cord became faulty . I was looking for an upgrade to an already proven product . The plastic odor goes away after washing , so no issue there . I 've already had it for about 2 weeks , and it 's worked every time . No complaints here . So far , so good . I liked the jack rabbit before , and I still love it even more . It 's definitely a keeper . The jack rabbit is my second favorite . I only say second favorite , because my hubby is my all time fav . This toy keeps up with my high drive . If I could give more than 5 stars I would .
 After reading reviews complaining about the size and smell of this product , I was a little worried . Upon taking it out of the box , it did have a toxic odor ; this odor , however , had nearly disappeared after one use . I 'm average height , but small and young -LRB- 19 years old -RRB- , so I was worried about the size , but it did not disappoint . It is a LITTLE big for me , but I did n't even use lube and I was fine - I just did n't plunge right in when using it . I could see the problem if you 're used to something skinnier , but it 's not so bad -LRB- ~ 6 '' circumference , ~ 1.6 '' diameter -RRB- . The rotation is my favorite part - it does n't even stop moving like other rotating vibrators . The vibration is a little strong and the ears are not so pliable , but on the lowest setting in combination with the rotation , it is perfect . I definitely recommend this product , especially if you can get over size and are not sensitive to vibration .
 Got for my wife ... she loves and and says it is a comparable size to myself . I ca n't twirl like this one though
 Everything fits right , and nothing came broken.This toy has an excellent battery life and will send you away for MILES!The one con is that the beads slow down slightly when put inside
 It was good , is not like out of this world and really amazing , but it works soooooo good ! If you put a lot of pressure when your using it , it turns off automatically , that sucks !
 Wonderful product . I have to say it is definitely my new favorite . The size is awesome , hits all the right spots . The rotator beads work very nicely , and the bullet in the rabbit is just amazing . The material it is made of is easily cleaned , a little on the hard side but still nice . It 's the best in my opinion .
 Before this purchase all I owned was a huge silver bullet . It got too hot from the friction . Found this new toy at Amazon.com for almost half the price anywhere else , including Adam & -LSB- ... -RSB- . The dong 's too long and virtually unusable , at least , not for penetration , not stiff enough , like bad sex . I have to keep it up against my skin with one hand to enjoy the pulsating rotation of the beads . The rabbit ears are worth sacrificing penetration , but it does n't make a very good boyfriend .
 I love this vibrator . I like how wide it is but I guess if you are not used to wide it might be a bit uncomfortable at first . It gets you there really fast . It is a good toy for a good price . I was n't let down . I also love that it is water proof .
 I do like this product . With all the bells and whistles it does it 's job well , but damn is it big . It hurts to use it , though once I get past the pain , it is actually pretty well worth the money .
 Amazing ... I recommended it to a friend and she got one too . We both love em . Yes the batteries run out because of course we use it a lot ! But rechargable batteries solve that problem ! Awesome Awesome buy !
 this was great the clit stimulator was incredable and it has a controler like a massage chair for any setting . its awsome . at least that is what my wife told me after I bought it for her . It was one of the best thing i could get my wife while I am deployed in Iraq . She loves it .
 pleasure within 2mins flat . Bottom line it 's a great toy it 's just way to big for me .
 I have had a pink version of this for a little over a year , a record for me , as I tend to burn through the little guys . I do not find the girth to be much more than the average , but way more than the traditional slim , discrete , `` muscle massage '' vibes.I find that it has good intensity at all three levels of the rabbit , but as someone mentioned the proportion can seem a little off as to the placement of the rabbit ears , but I have found them to be flexible and with a little practice have learned to get it just right for me.I do not usually use the rotation feature but have no complaints from the times I have.Now my pink one has gone to it 's grave , the motor died , I am looking forward to the replacement getting here !!
 I got the purple rabbit and it was great ! This was the first rabbit I have used and my experience could not have been better . I literally came in 10 seconds . Amazing . Plus , it 's super quiet . Definitely recommend it !
 I tried to review previously , but may have been a bit graphic in my descriptions . I did not have a problem with the size , and found it to be just right . It is my new `` favorite '' as it works as good as I had hoped . I would recommend especially for women who like dual stimulation .
 This is an amazing toy , great size for me anyway ... much bigger than expected . Have n't used it in the water but works great without having too . For the money and the satisfaction it brings I think it is very worth it ! : -RRB-
 Bought as a replacement for one used for last 2 years . One received not quite as powerful as original , but gets the job done . Wife enjoys that it 's thicker than others that have been used .
 Okay , this product is great . Bought it for my best friend -LRB- she 's a girl -RRB- , she says its absolutely amazing ! LOL , she loves it !!!
 I send this to my girlfriend that now away , and she miss me , so i was thinking this can be a perfect item for her , so she do n't miss me that much , and she like it so much , this is a big help i believe ...
 First rabbit and it works amazingly . It does things that I never expected it to do . I would definitely by another one if something ever happened to this one .
 i got mines in just awhile ago and i used it for the first time and it made me really happy twice back to back my hubby will love to see me use this lol
 I think the rabbit part is kind of bothersome and I thought the actual shaft would vibrate not just the rabbit . WEIRD .
 This rabbit width size , its kind of large . Compared to others I 've seen and used , its pretty large . The motions are really nice and its easy to switch on and off and adjust the speeds to what you want/need . The price of it is fair and it was a good deal !
 This is a great toy but the spining part broke rather quickly but that happend with my old one 2 idk if its just me or the toys . you have to be careful in the shower and make sure the battery part is sqrewed on right and most likey it will break if u sumerg it in water but other den that the vibrations are nice and strong and the size is nice kinda big but i like it not complaining .
 It does take some getting used to ... it is a little big and I did n't like it right away ... BUT trust me if you have problems with the size and the bunny ear position , BUY LUBRICANT it makes the experience WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY more pleasurable in my opinion ... . also use BRAND NEW batteries , it requires 3 AA 's that gives it way more power . This is defiantly the best vibrator for the price !!!!!!!!!!!!
 My boyfriend bought this for me for Christmas , i have to say at first -LRB- without using it -RRB- i was a little disappointed with the rotation i thought it would be stronger after using it though i thought this thing was absolutely amazing . my boyfriend seems to be a little jealous off it but i guess you 'll have that lol . Ive used it in the shower now twice and i have had no problems at all . like other people have stated it does have a new rubber smell to it but its very faint to begin with and will fade off you really cant smell it unless its right up by your face . as far as width though ... wet or lubricated Ive had a hard time getting it in . there 's been times where i just gave up and did n't even bother because it hurt but once its in its actually very pleasurable . deff . not a toy for people who are inexperienced that 's for sure . all in all great product and especially for the price I 'm very pleased .
 This is a good lil machine for the price :-RRB- I got it for me -LRB- especially -RRB- , but my boyfriend loves to use it on me too . Those little bunny ears work Freakin wonders !!! I never climaxed so quickly.I do n't really care for the rotating beads as much as the vibrating bunny ears.When you combine them . . boy watch out ;-RRB- I would buy this again if I had to.This is my favorite toy so far .
 My wife loves this thing . It has allowed me to avoid pleasuring her , she is doing so much better with housework , she is nicer to the children , I got ta say , it works 10 times better than I do . All kidding aside , it ** does ** work better than I do and it 's a ton of fun to watch . It only takes a couple minutes to do the trick and she 's a happy camper . I 've bought her toys in the past and they have largely remained unused to the best of my knowledge . Not this one . She likes the size , loves the rotating beads , it seems durable , it 's allegedly waterproof , and the rabbit ears work their magic better than a rabbit in a hat . I 'm very impressed and very satisfied .
 Where do I start ? The three modes of speed for the two functions are a wonderful option . I 've went from low to high -LRB- staying in the high zone very briefly -RRB- and was exceptionally satisfied . This is my first rabbit -LRB- but not my first vibrator by far -RRB- and had heard so much about them over the years , found this one for around $ 25.00 . I like the girth size and length of the rotating part , the vibrating part works rather well for me . It 's going on a couple of weeks , so I can vouch for that amount of time at least for durability . I love that it 's waterproof , relatively quiet and easy to clean . The material it 's covered with works with my sensitive skin . I think it 's a great investment , buck for buck !
 My wife say 's it 's excellent brings her to climax with or without me , she gives it 5 stars . No woman should be without one .
 I bought this toy for my girlfriend , cause she has never used a sex toy , at first she was n't very impressed , and actually did n't liked it . But giving it a second and third chance , she loves it now , she loves the vibration and she 's looking now for the next sex toy !
 This is by far my favorite rabbit ! It 's the perfect length and thickness , and the variable speeds are all right on the money !
 This is the first Rabbit product I ever owned and I was a little skeptible . However , to my suprise this `` Bunny '' works like a charm and I must say , I am in love . I have read a lot of complaints about the size is too large , sorry girl , this is just right ; I only wish the the vibration was a little bit stronger . With something like this , men watch out , you can slowly become obsolete .
 This is my first vibrator and I love it ! Please keep in mind , its for women who can handle a lot ... not for the petite or very tight ladies . It never disappoints me ... talk about the big `` O '' !
 This product is amazing and you can take it in the tub . The reviewer who fear that this product will give them cancer should also stop showering because water causes drowning . As long as you do n't use this vibrator as firewood , you 'll be fine .
 Was received within a few days time , and while the shaft may be a bit thicker than expected , it is still enjoyable to work with . :-RRB- It definitely suits the purpose while my boyfriend and I are far apart ; I ca n't wait until we get to use it as a couple ! Vibrations are powerful , so I sill use mine on the lowest setting , but it does make for interesting sensations . This is the first sex toy I have purchased and I find it enjoyable .
 Great , but a little large so it takes some getting used to . I would recommend this product.PS , this is my girlfriends review lol
 My husband bought this toy for me about two years ago . It still works like the first day I got it . I love that this toy 's ears are n't so soft you ca n't feel the vibration . The ears of the rabbit are stiff . My only complaint would be that I would have liked a softer head and shaft with the firm ears . GREAT BUY . We purchased mine at the sex store for $ 60 + tax .
 totally comfortable , and extremely sensual i love it.i adore the bunny ears and the controls are super easyi recommend for any woman looking for comfortable , intense pleasure -LRB- :
 As everyone knows , there is the Rabbit and then everything else . This product gets my girlfriend going wild , she loves the multiple stimulations it provides both inside and out . This is the 2nd one I 've bought because about a year of use the floating beads would no longer work . She loved it so much we bought another one .
 This is great , wife loves it . We 've actually had 3 of them . Wore out the first 2 over the course of about a year each . This has never failed to please her.The only issue we have noticed with them , is the rubber seems to react with other rubber types and `` melt '' . We have had it happen with all 3 of them . So if you keep your toys together -LRB- touching -RRB- like we do , you may want to keep this one in it 's packaging so it does n't get an impression of another toy melted into it.It does tend to get louder the more you use it or the older it gets . At first it was very quite , but now we have to keep a hold on the rabbit to stop the noise from being overly loud -LRB- Especially if the kids are home -RRB- . Again , all the cons happen over time . We will probably keep on of these as long as we can continue to buy them . It 's just really good at what it does even if it does n't last forever .
 Does the trick every time . The rotating and the vibration alone are enough to exist me before I even get started . A +
 I bought the waterproof Jack Rabbit for my wife and she loves it . It has many features that she likes . Plus it uses regular batteries unlike some of the others that require hard to find watch type batteries .
 shipped fast good price good explanation of the detail and all other great aspects of this item ... would tell friends about
 This worked wonders up until the other day - I had been using it regularly for about 3 months , then was using it the other day and the rotation function stopped working . For me , this was a extra benefit , since I mainly need the vibrating bunny head part of it to finish . So I will continue to use that part of it . With the no returns policy on this , no replacement for a broken product . Other reason I am giving it a 4 is because it is a bit on the loud side when you have the rotation function on . I usually had to do this under the covers or when a fan on so my neighbors do n't hear !
 It has been awhile since I have purchased a toy . Usually I would buy from the store so that I could see it in real life . I must say that ordering this online was great it came in discreet amazon packaging so no one knew what was in it . It takes 3 AA Batteries . . but WOW is all I have to say . This product is sooooo worth the money . The girth is a little large . . but if your man is on the med/large side then you should not have any problem . This little gem is powerful . . so turn it on and enjoy the ride !
 What can I say ? As the name implies I do love sex and well if you are looking for a fun toy to play with in the tub this is the one . I have never had a water toy and this one is my first and I just love it ! I actually keep my toy in the shower because I have one of those shower things that you can hang in your shower to store your stuff in . But if ever looking or wishing you could have more fun in the shower this is the toy to have .
 This vibe gets the job done fast . It 's pretty big but all you need is some good lube . I like the fact that it 's hard the ones that I have that are n't as hard do n't get the job done as well . The only thing I do n't like about it is that is has a plastic/rubber smell but after a while it 's not so bad . Over all my favorite rabbit so far .
 Purchased as a late Valentine 's day gift for my wife . I was n't sure that would fly very well but thought `` what the heck . `` On first impression it 's a bit `` larger '' -LRB- circumference not so much length -RRB- than I thought it would be.Buttons are well located and easy to use . The rabbit seemed to be able to hit a few spots that had n't been `` touched '' before , which was good thing . All in all it was very pleasing to use and we were very happy with it .
 Good product , made well . Bullet has good amount of vibration . Hits all the right spots . I think the rabbits bullet should be placed a little higher for better stimulation . Also the beads inside are made of steel and if placed wrong can be a lil painful . The product however is worth the money .
 I love this vibe more than others that I own . It is one I know I can count on to get the job done every time . I highly recommend it .
 What an amazing product . It definitly works like a charm . The vibrating rabbit ears and the turning balls inside the phallus are fantastic together . The best toy I have ever bought for myself . WOW !!! Another person said something about the smell and they were right . It has a very strong funny smell to it , but that can be overlooked . I recommend this product to any woman or couple . Once again , WOW !
 Nothing more to say , it did the trick quite nicely - in fact probably a little too powerful for her so did n't take it to the highest setting ... do n't know if she has done by herself or not since ? Nice that it 's waterproof , makes cleanup a lot more reassuring . Brought a smile to her face & she was very grateful!As warned , the size may be a little bit of a shock -LRB- but a little warm up and some lube does the trick nicely -RRB- . Take it easy , go slow to start with & enjoy .
 This product definitely does what is said to do . I have n't had any problems with it and its not too thick and the power is great .
 I do n't know what I 've done without this all these years ! ~ Mrs. Herline
 You 're an idiot if you do n't buy this . I lasted maybe 30 seconds . Better than any boyfriend I 've ever had - hello new best friend
 I was pretty surprised at how girthy it was when I opened the package . It is made with quality materials . There was the usual strong odor that tends to come along with new toys . But once soaped up nicely it seems much better . I feel lube is nessecary as a companion with this toy . Which can be a downfall at times . But the fact that it operates very smooth And quiet makes up for this . Overall I am very pleased with this purchase and this brand . I love the fact that the batteries are kept in a tray that makes it super easy to keep them together and ready to go in between uses . Great price , good investment , great pleasure : -RRB-
 I can definitely say this is worth the money . Waterproof is a fantastic feature . My husband enjoys using this on me , and it 's not so complicated that I ca n't use it by myself . It is a little big , thick , so if you have a skinny guy , or skinny toys , this would take some getting used to , but it was n't a problem for me , I like the size very much . The bunny ears are a little inflexible , but still work great . I wish it was a little longer , as far as insertable length , but as it is , it takes me only a minute or two before ... . you know . Great toy if you need the extra girth , and it seems to have held up pretty well so far . It is also very quiet , which is a plus . Very discreet . I like the clear color , if it is lying out , your eye does n't immediatly jump to the `` bright pink vibrator on the bed '' ! Yummm!Updated March 2010
 I have a very active household , so I was wary of getting ANYTHING that vibrates in fear of being heard . However , this is VERY quiet , I would say if you want to use it on the top speeds -LRB- although I have n't found the need to use it above the first -RRB- maybe have something like a desk fan to cover the sound if you want to keep it undetected . The twisting motion of the head can be a little more noticeable than the vibrating bullet , it 's almost like a power drill on low , but it 's muted . Again , anything above the first , you might wan na have some cover up.Also , something that was n't covered in the description -LRB- if it was , I did n't see it -RRB-
 This is the perfect toy . If you 're afraid that it 's too big , do n't be . It 's a great size that fits snugly and just feels so good . As with any toy , make sure that you 're nice and wet first . If you have any trouble there , just read some of these reviews , lol , that did it for me . I always think my own natural juices are a better lube than the fake stuff that comes in a tube but whatever floats your boat.Start slowly and resist the urge to keep upping the intensity . I have to fight that urge every time because this thing gets me on the brink of ecstasy within a couple of minutes if I do n't hold back a little . And I find that when I take my time , the orgasms -LRB- yes , that 's plural -RRB- are just that much more intense.This literally makes me cum harder and faster than anything else I 've ever used , including a real penis . Sorry honey , but your sexy cock just ca n't vibrate like this and it does n't have a clit kisser either . Not that the rabbit will ever replace the real thing but if you 've ever been frustrated with your orgasms - either the time it takes to get there or the ho-hum aspect of them - give this toy a try.The fun part of getting a new toy is finding just the right balance and spots for ultimate pleasure . I find that if I pull up on my labia just a little bit , it stretches my clit up just a fraction and produces even more friction and contact . I 'm telling you , it is the most amazing feeling . Once I really get going and am super horny and ready to cum , I allow the `` cock '' to rotate in my pussy at the same time that the small buzzing `` lips '' are fluttering against my clit and then I begin thrusting it in and out of my pussy . The combination of the rotating inside , the clit-buzzing outside and the ever increasing thrusting in and out results in a mind blowing orgasm . You WILL cum with this toy.I can either take my time and end up begging to finally be sent over the edge or I can go for a quickie and literally cum hard and fast within a minute or two.Do not hesitate , buy this toy and get ready to have the best orgasms of your life .
 What can I say ?! I absolutely CAN NOT believe how wonderful this product is ! I own 5 toys and this one by far is my favorite ! I have no regrets or complaints when it comes to me purchasing this product . It certainly gets the job done , and quick too . I have never had to use it for more than a few minutes , its amazing ! It has 3 speeds of vibration for clit stimulation , 3 speeds of rotation in the shaft , you can change the direction in which it rotates , and it is completely submergeable ! It even has a bumpy texture on the shaft to stimulate the g-spot . As far as batteries go , they do not have to be replaced very often either . This is a very well thought out invention and I ca n't think of any ways to improve it !
 Holy . Freakin ' . Crap.I absolutely love my jackrabbit ! :--RRB- - Price
 I love this toy and must say it was a great present . Fun and after 3 months of use minimal to non existent signs of wear and tear -LRB- believe me it gets a lot of use hell 18-22 days per month -RRB- . Also , the sound is a bit loud on the higher levels , but as someone already suggested a fan on as the perfect cover . In all honesty , I get the impression that someone -LRB- not in room -RRB- would have to be listing directly outside the door . So , far has not been an issue between me an my 2 other housemates.I would give this more than 5 stars if I could . * Random general tip for all sex toys that generate sound ; make sure that you are not using it against an inside/support wall . Strange lesson I learned at college ; vibrations travel very well via walls . *
 This is my first sex toy , and I did n't make a mistake with this one . It 's gi-normous , and I LOVE the jelly-like material , it 's firm but the surface is soft and flexible . I do n't use the rotating thing much , though , but it 's nice to have as an option . It took me a while to figure out where I like the bunny ears and his little pointy nose , but now I use it every night my boyfriend 's away . Lots of things you can do with this one
 of course the user will not likely remain quiet . haha . All kidding aside , this is a very durable , quiet , waterproof multitasking vibrator . It does everything but complain about cutting the lawn . One thing I feel sets this vibrator apart from some of the others is the rotating beads . Since they are attached to rotating rods they do n't stop moving when they come into contact with you . In vibrators that have loose beads , when the beads become depressed by the vaginal walls they sometimes stop moving . They are no longer stimulating the vaginal opening . This is not the case with this vibrator . Enjoy and do n't forget to keep extra batteries or better yet ... rechargeables .
 This is and was one of my most favorite vibrators . While the size is a little large the beads and movment of the shaft combined with the tantalizing bunny ears leave a Big O not to be forgotten ! Couple of notes they state the item is waterproof not true a few uses in the tub and every time water got in battery compartment . Also this vibrator has a battery compartment that is removed from vibrator and this broke in a very short time rendering the vibrator useless . I tried to contact the company for a replacment compartment but no response thus far .
 It is exactly what nearly all the reviews said . The product arrived discreetly in a white -LRB- non-see through -RRB- bag inside Amazon 's box . When I opened it , I was very intimidated by the size . It task 3 double AA batteries -LRB- not AAA as someone said -RRB- . The size DOES take some getting used too . Used it twice so far and it 's huge , but I 'll get used to it . The rabbit ears/nose got me off right away , in less than 2mins or so . . . whoa ... Powerful as people have said ... intense -RRB-
 I decided to update my collection and went with this on a whim , and I 'm SO glad I did ! It is not too hard or too soft and the bunny ears are not hard at all , it 's very soft all over . This one is a bit girthy and took some getting used to but other than that , if I could give it 10 stars I would . I 've only used it once and I can say with confidence that nothing compares and if and when this one should die on me I will be ordering another promptly . You do n't need a man , honey , you just need batteries ! I 'll keep my other toys as a back-up but I can say for sure they will be collecting dust now .
 For those wondering , like myself , this DOES come in a discrete package . Now , as for the actual product ? OMG I 've never felt something like this before . This is my first official toy , and I am sooooo pleased ! It 's a little large , and kinda hard but that 's okay . Works wonderfully . I would definitely recommend , especially for the price .
 ITS AWESOME ! GREAT SIZE ! LOVE THE SPEEDS ! GET IT , THEN DUMP YOUR BOYFRIEND AND LIVE A CARE FREE LIFE!SUGGESTION
 This is one strong rabbit vibrator . Rabbit vibrators are my absolute favorite and this one is no exception . It has 3 different speeds of rotation and vibrations that feel amazing . Its also waterproof which is a plus for most people . It is super thick which makes it a bit difficult to use but if you like girthy toys this one is for you ! It will defintely make you feel full .
 A very enjoyable product . I 've owned a clear one for a few months , and really like it for the clear color , it looks nondescript and techy-fun ! Girth is big , but I like this as well . Great action on bunny ears . Waterproofness is definitely a plus . The smell is there , but not really offensive . It is quiet enough . It is the top vibrator out of the three I 've tried so far . I would buy it again .
 Cons
 This vibe is easy to handle , waterproof and hits all the right spots . I have owned 4 vibrators previous to this one and it is by far the best . It has good girth and decent insertion length and is also pretty powerful and quiet . I finally found my g spot with this vibe , and I use it often !!
 As my title says this vibrator has strong vibration and is amazingly quiet when using the vibration only . The `` Floating Beads '' are a bit louder , but are worth the extra noise . I love being able to adjust the level of the vibration with just the touch of a button . This allows it to suit your individual needs all through out the experience . It is a bit on the large size , but not to the point of being uncomfortable by any means . This toy is also very durable and is now going on one full years use , -LRB- Deployed husband turned ex-husband this toy has seen some use ! -RRB-
 I 've seen a few reviews complaining of the smell of this product . It does have a slight rubber smell but its certainly not overpowering and I do n't even notice it except for when I first take it out of the package . It IS however on the large size . Some sort of lube would definitely be recommended . Overall I 'm very happy with this purchase . Totally worth the price .
 Well i purchased this last month -LRB- August -RRB- and here are the pro 's and con 's that i found : It is kind of big not huge huge but a tight fitthe metal beads dont seem to hit the right spot and cause more discomfort that pleasure but i have found them to be nice but that was only one time!The clit stimulator - is the best part of this toy ! It doesnt even need to be on the highest setting , it is a great first toy , it was mine and it totally showed me a new side of things !
 We were a little hesitant to add a toy of this nature to our collection but the wife absolutely loves this one !
 This was my second toy and I love it ! As soon as it arrived I tried it out . I highly recommend this ! It is worth the $ 28.06 and shipping . I 've never had an orgasm that powerful -LRB- :
 Ladies love it and so do I. xfghfghfdh fghfghfgh fghfgh fghfgh fghfgh fghfgh fghfgh fghfgh fghfgh fghfgh fghfgh fghfgh f
 I have bought many toys over the past 6 years for my wife . I started out with a pretty large vibrator that had some really weird fins on it . She really hated it . So i have relaxed on my purchasing of these types of toys . After a while we found one that really works . A small vibrator . Then last year I found a girth increase toy that fit on me . The wife really liked it and started to use it more and more . i figured if I stay away from weird looking vibrators she would like them . So last week after much looking and reading reviews I picked this up from Amazon . After alot of foreplay and much lube / bondage she opened up to it . I did blind fold her so she did not see it . She even told me after the fact that if she had seen it before she would have said no . It was pretty big but she liked it after the initial thrust . It was completely different then any thing else we have tried . which means it did different things to her body that was unique . I had to back it off a number of times to make it last . worked great to use while performing oral on her as well.ProsPower wise - GREAT . I would have liked to see 2 C batteries - there is enough room in it . The turning worked great at any speed . The vibration hit the sweet spot first time on . I kept the vibration at the minimal setting . Which was perfect for my lady . If you like more it has it.CONSI am not sure I would trust it in the water . Long enough to wash it but not in a bath tub for extended amount of time.Not a Con or ProAlso the changing of the direction of the ball bearings did not affect her the way I thought it would but it did give a very brief stopping point.I am looking forward to a long career with this toy . adding it to my arsenal of tools to use to make my wife a happy wife !
 This is our third rabbit . The original was the best vibrator my wife ever experienced . But each new generation keeps getting better . This one is waterproof , so it works great underwater , like in bathtubs and hot tubs . The rabbit ears are doing their thing , while the main vibrator is being used.Nothing else like it on the market . After we got ours , I heard Chelsea Handler describe hers , and they are showing up a lot on porn sites . The only downside is that smaller women may have difficulty inserting it without assistance -LRB- lucky me -RRB- .
 I had mixed reviews of this product . It most definitely got the job done , and fast ! The only qualms that I had was that it was really large and hard to get in sometimes . Also I found that the rabbit ears would get in the way and could become annoying at times , but other than that it is a GREAT product .
 I got this today . As I was putting the 3 AA batteries in I had to try it out . I have a high sitting clit and the clit vib part had to be positioned right . Once I got it positioned right I was in heaven . I had the big `` O '' in a minute -LRB- probably under -RRB- and it was so intense I was shaking . The buttons were easy to manage once you got the position right . I do n't think I will try this in the water since other reviewers have and the toy would n't work after . I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great toy . My husband is looking forward to using this on me tonight since telling him how amazing it is .
 This is a great product with versatility , but takes getting used to the girth . Use some lube for sure . The price is worth it after researching prices of similar products around local stores ... save $ 10 or more on this product . It has a funny smell at first , but clean with some alcohol and it will fade . I also rinse in water , but probably do n't submerge like others say ... overall , you and your partner should have a fun time ... or if you need/have to have some time for yourself !
 My wife loves this thing , perhaps more than me ! This is the 3rd one we bought . 1st one stopped working after 1.5 years of use . Second one , wife dropped it and the batter cover shattered . This one lasted her about 9 months .
 I saw this online and bought it immediately . The only toy I ever bought before this was a small bullet and this blew it out of the park ! AMAZING ! You must buy . Most intense orgasm . Put 's my boyfriend to shame !!!!
 Easy to use ; but a but bulky . Did smell like plastic when I opened it . Definitely would recommend this for the price .
 This product is fabulous ! One of the best toys I have ever used ! It 's really thick and the rotations and vibrations are out of this world !!! Well , like some of the reviews warned me , it did break . Just died and replacing the batteries did not work . I will not be buying this brand again .
 I was very scared to buy but so glad I did works great an its nice to blow off some steam . I would tell friends to buy very happy .
 This seems to be good so far only used it once . I really thought that the shaft vibrated but it does not . Love the bullet in the rabbit ears ... so far so good !
 did the job partner enjoyed it very much will look for another item in the coming future thanks very much
 My wife was scared to use this when I took it out and showed it to her but now she loves it . We play with it about 5 times a week
 This product is great , its not too big . Larger than most , but not bigger then the real thing . Love that its water proof .
 Perfection . Love it . Hope it lasts for a very long time . I have always had a very difficult time reaching orgasm . This got me there pretty easily . Thank you !
 I love the firmness to it , it 's still slightly bendable but not floppy like some dildo 's out there . The rabbit does its job wonderfully and I like the vibration speeds and the motion . Kinda noisy when you use the circular motion side but if you use just the vibration side you can barely hear it . Definitely a plus there .
 This toy is awesome ! Works every time , and fast ! The battery has lasted a while too ! Within 3 mins the job is done
 Little different then I was expecting but really good quality and exactly as advertised , fast deliver an great service , thanks
 My gynecologist recommended a Jack Rabbit to reduce vaginal dryness during intercourse . He said the more you use it , the less dry you will be . He was right . And the product does perform up to expectations . I will however say , the Platinum Mulifuction is a bit better . This one does have as much power and function as the Platinum . Either one is 50 % cheaper than going to a local store .
 Now this one is amazing . My husband and I were enjoying ourselves tonight and he used this on me and I absolutely LOST IT . It was amazing omg I screamed like have n't in along time . It made me feel so good lol . LOVE IT !!!!!!
 The product came quickly and discretely . The vibrator is very strong with three settings . I would just caution that shaft portion is fairly thick and may caused discomfort if not use to the size .
 My wife was skeptical about purchasing a new toy . Until now , she had not cared for any toy we have used . We ended up buying the Jack Rabbit because so many of our friends recommended it . We chose to try it first in the jacuzzi ... it only took about 90 seconds . The next morning , we tried it in bed with the same results . My wife is now a huge fan of the bunny ears ! I highly recommend this item . But it now !!!
 I bought this vibe about a month ago . IT is Fantastic ! the best $ 20 I have ever spent , worth 2x the price.-Yes , it smells like plastic , I dont know why people are turned off by that . Its a vibe ... made out of plastic . -- The vibration is great , the perfect amount . there are two buttons , one controls the bunny ears the other controls the rotation of the shaft . Personally , I dont use the rotation often but the bunny ears bullet is wonderful . They do not irritate me however , I can see why some would complain if they have very sensitive skin.came in working order , and have had no problems since.takes 3 AA batsI recommend to all my friends !
 I bought this because I was tired of wearing myself out in other ways -LRB- haha -RRB- . I am pretty much a nontoy user , but when I saw what all this thing could do and for the price , I was hooked ! It came on time in very discreet packaging -LRB- Thank you Lord ! -RRB- . A regular Amazon Box and a black bag on the inside , completely sealed . I do n't live alone and was worried someone else would open it.I was n't expecting it to be so HUGE . I took it slow , and was able to use it after a little coaxing . A little painful , but eventually I found my rhythym and it was AMAZING . Controls are easy to reach and the spinning feature is heavenly!So , it takes getting used to if you are inexperienced , but it 's definitely worth it !
 I have never owned a toy in my life . However my boyfriend likes to have oral sex and unfortunately fingers and tongue just does n't keep me satisfied so I have to cut down on his time to get mine . I finally just told him that I would do that more for him if we got this for me . I ordered the clear rabbit because it was the cheapest of the colors and super saver shipping , I did n't see a reason to pay more for color it was function that was important to me . It was supposed to be here on the 10th of Jan and it was here on the 6th . I received it in a regular amazon box and it was in a white plastic bag inside . I opened it and it did have a smell -LRB- I washed it once and now it 's gone -RRB- I think it was just a new toy smell . My boyfriend was in total control of it and we ended up using the ears anally which worked good and then after he was done I had him just use it on me to see what it could really do . OMG ! I was done in under a minute . He tried all the different settings I think and it was heaven . But afterwards I just wanted a piece of him :-RRB- It was not much bigger than he is so size was not an issue . The rabbit hit me just right . I do n't feel it was too hard and the rabbit ears were perfect for me . Like other reviewers have said , `` everyone 's anatomy is different '' The vibration was awesome though I really do n't need the highest setting yet and the rotation was perfect . I like that it can rotate clockwise or counterclockwise depending on how you want it to hit . All in all it was a perfect purchase and I plan on using it a lot more , ca n't wait to try out the waterproof feature . I bought this one because it had the most reviews and the best reviews . I am not disappointed .
 my wife LOVES this toy !!! we have several others but she really LOVES this one the best . it is quite fat but she says it feels great . the product is well built and i highly recommend it .
 For me , this is pretty much a sure thing . Sometimes I use the rotating beads . Sometimes I do n't . It just depends on my mood . The rabbit vibration is stronger when the beads are turned off . The size of the item is pretty long/thick and I do prefer this size to some of the other items I have . My current favorite item . Have n't tested to see if it 's waterproof ... too worried that it 'll stop working and then I 'll be SOL .
 For me its a perfect fit and takes me to jus the right places !! N I luv the waterproof component !!!
 This was my first Rabbit and I highly recommend it . It was a replacement of one vibe I had and it was just the plane old plane old , but this thing blows it out of the water literally . Its fun by myself and with my husband . I just really have nothing bad to say , other then the fact it takes me now about 30 sec . But I 'm not sure if that 's a bad thing .
 I love it this toy hits all the right spots when ever my husband is tired the toy is the greatest replacement .
 I really enjoy this item . Girth is n't a problem for me , although I was concerned about it after reading the reviews from others . It is not terribly larger than most of the men I 've been with . The only reason I did not give this item 5 stars was what seems to be the # 1 complaint about this item
 Great product !!! It is also great for virgins ... so if you are still one , I would suggest this one !!!
 gon na make this short sweet and to the point ... ths is the first vibrator -LRB- im not a very open when it comes to the bedroom -RRB- i EVER owned my fiance used it on me last night and all i have to say is if this sucker broke i would be online ordering the next one i could find . I really dont see the need for anyone to buy a 100 $ vibrator this was deff 35 $ WELL spent ! ive had it for a while now and actually it didnt break on its own i broke it the little silver rotating balls must have plastic that drives it well i guess i have really strong kegel muscles . i cant wait to buy another . another awesome thing about it VERY DISCREET shipping . -LRB- never used it in the water so cant say much about that .
 got it for my girlfriend for when i deploy , and even to use as a couple -LRB- at least the vibrator part -RRB- and its pretty awesome.pros - its not THAT big , most of the size is the battery compartment anyway -LRB- im bigger than it , and thats not just bragging -RRB- - its waterproof so far , the few times she has used it so far has been in the tub and its fine - it wasnt dead on arrival - its powerful as all hell , i turned the thing on when it came in the mail just to make sure it worked and it scared the crap outta me - the vibrator is awesome as hell - the rotating beads are awesome as hell - it gets her to climax even quicker than me - very quietcons - none so far , seems like solid construction , simple yet efficient -LRB- and DISCRETE -RRB- packaging
 This product works for me . I 'm a first time buyer and am pretty happy with my purchase ! I read a few reviews complaining about how much noise the product makes but its really not too bad . If you have a fan or a TV on you 're good . Also others were complaining about the smell , but its only noticeable if you put your nose right up on the device .
 It worked exactly as advertized . What 's not to like ? It worked straight from the box ; there were no problems with it - good buy !
 This gave me insanely powerful orgasms , quick too , I loved it , the only thing is I got water in it , my fault , I didnt screw the bottom on tight -LRB- where u put in the batteries , and water got in -RRB- Besides my stupidity , I Love , Love LOOOVE it , It is a little big , But Hey , its fantastic !
 Its a very stiff product - others have a softness to it - This is really rigid - wouldnt recommend it to anyone - dont discuss things like that with people - bought some similar to this one so I purchased one like them - My others burnt out therefore new one desired .
 I love the metal balls in this thing but they do burn out ! It was a year before they did though . I also HATE the rabbit ears . Too much for this lady ! I will definitely be buying another !
 Ok This is one HUGE jack rabbit ! I had no idea it was going to be so big !
 This is an amazing toy . I can tell you after one use , I am addicted . This is the go to in our treasure drawer .
 Would recommend this to everyone . Does the job and then some . Great investment . Load up on the batteries , you 're in for a ride .
 I bought this to replace the same item I 'd purchased 2 years ago from Amazon and , after many , many uses , burnt out the vibe portion of the toy.This product is slightly thicker than average rabbits , but definately not oversized . The motor is quiet and VERY effective , almost too much so ; my husband and I like to use it during playtime , but I find I often have to turn it down or off to hold back a little ... Do n't hesitate to purchase this ; at this price point , it 's the best you can get !
 Got it for the wife while Im on deployment and she loves it ! Works great in the bedroom , shower and tub . Great size , beads , and clit vibe ! Curls the toes very time . Looking forward to going home and seeing her at play with it . Always a great warm up to the real thing !!!
 i am a male , and i bought it for my self because i am bi.this is my first true toy , i bought a smaller vibrator which in all fairness was ok , it was smaller then this one -LRB- i bought the clear/grey one -RRB- and its vibration was nice , almost tickling . and i was hoping for something a bit bigger , and maybe with more motion , so i bought this toy.after getting it from the mail i got into the bathroom and put it to use . it was definitely bigger , i feared it was n't even going to fit lol.but after a few mins working at it it got in and i started messing with the features and it felt pretty good , vibration did n't do anything for me at all , , and the rotation was not very noticeable till i accidentally bent it a little -LRB- right under the ball bearings -RRB- and now it does BIG rotations which feels incredible . the material is soft but firm at the same time , no lubrication is needed tho maybe wanted if your not used to the size , i personally do n't have lube , and i am a little sore from its size and use ^ / / ^ . if you do decide to bend it a little to make the rotation better be careful because it Might brake , i do n't want to risk it by seeing how far it can be bent.obviously as a male i can only use it in one place , so its not as sensitive as it prob is for most females , but its size and rotation -LRB- after being bent -RRB- is really good . i was n't able to finish the first time of use due to stamina , new positions and all but i 'm sure in time i will . good toy , only time will tell if its worth the money -LRB- i 'm a very cheap person xD -RRB- . as for the noise its really quiet , i had my bathroom fan on but i do n't think it really needed it , if u try to push the toy to its max then maybe you need a cover up sound -LRB- guilty -RRB- . i would love to have someone use this on me or me use on them ^ / / ^ but for now i 'll just have to work alone . 4star would recommend -LSB- ... -RSB- -LRB- i 'm 18 years old , USA , FL -RRB-
 First off ... anyone who says it 's a -RRB- too big , b -RRB- too smelly , or c -RRB- that it 's too hard , had to have gotten a bum product.A -RRB- It is larger than your average vibrator , that 's for sure , but it 's smaller than the average penis . If you can accomodate a human , you can take this no problem . I took a measuring tape and wrapped it around the thickest part , it 's only 5 inches around . Use lube though.B -RRB- It does n't smell any more or less plastic-y than any other vibrator.C -RRB- Mine is quite pliable . While it does n't bend , I did n't expect it to , but it is soft . But not too soft !! ; -RRB- I bought this because I wanted a thicker vibrator . And while I like a lot , I only gave it 4 stars for 2 reasons . First , the rabbit IS too high up the shaft . The ears hit about a quarter inch higher than they should , so the shaft ca n't go in all the way if you want them where they 're supposed to go . Second , the insertable part is actually shorter than it looks , due to the placement of the rabbit . The beads are closer to the surface that my old one , so I definitely feel them . It 's also incredibly quiet . It certainly got the job done , no doubt about that !!
 This toy took a little getting use to . But after a few times playing with it I was amazing . I wish there were more options for the speed & vibration but It makes me quite happy & I 'm not always easy to please . ; - -RRB-
 This is at the top of her list when it 's toy time or she 's just not getting there . Well worth the money , I spent a lot more elsewhere .
 I have had this product for over a year now . I love it . It is girthy so it takes some getting used to , but the rotation is very powerful and the vibrations are also great . The down side is that sometimes the clit stimulator can be painful as it is not very soft and flexible . The lowest speed is also quite intense so sometimes takes a few minutes before I can apply it directly . I use this on a very regular basis as my husband is deployed . He and I have played with it on multiple occasions as well . The handle is long enough for him to hold which is awesome . Obviously it has gotten alot of use and still looks new and shows no signs of breaking . The battery life is very good . It is quiet and powerful . The only downside is that is never really `` breaks in '' Very stiff and can at times be painful . For the price this is the best `` Rabbit '' on the market hands down .
 First , the building quality is perfect , very soft and easy to clean . It takes you to heaven in less the 10 minutes . The velocity control is great but the rotation system is a little bit too loud so I require careful when use it . If you live with your parents or share the house with someone else , I suggest to use something to cover the noise or use when you 're all alone . Its amazing ! I recommended it to all girls and couples who wants to spice it their love life . And the price was good too .
 OMG ... Super satisfied ! Works like a charm ! Not as good as the real thing but gets the job done ! Orgasmed within seconds . Would of been five stars but its bigger that what I thought ! Def not for beginners ! : -RRB-
 I really have been enjoying this product.It really works wonders especially when my boyfriend is n't around . We also have a lot of fun using it with four-play . I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good , reliable toy .
 This product is excellent . I bought this to spice up the moment and trust me it did not disappoint . . Wife is more than pleased . .
 This is our 2nd one of these . The first one lasted about 2 yrs and my wife was very sad about its passing . But the 2nd is just as satisfying for her as the 1st . Wonderful item
 I did n't order this for me , and I 'm not going to ask how it works ... so ca n't leave anything other then came packaged well and on time .
 I really enjoy this product . The only thing that 's missing is a lock button . It tends to get very slippery at times , and buttons are accidentally pushed , which makes the experience less pleasurable . I would by this product again , but only if it has some sort of locking feature so I would n't have to stop and adjust it all the time .
 I have had it two years and it is still one of my favorites and works like the day I received it . I would recommend this addition to your supply .
 haha just kidding ... But seriously , you need to buy this . I was reading the poor reviews -LRB- the 1 and 2 stars -RRB- and could n't help but laugh , apparently they used it wrong , because this is SO easy to use , and works like a charm . I will admit I was a little hesitant to buy it at first , since it looks intimidating , but I figured if the ladies on Sex and the City loved it , then I would love it too . . and I DO !! ;-RRB- You 'll never need another toy !
 What would you like to know ? LOL does it get the job done ? YES !!!!!!!!!! The vibration is amazing . Pretty intense !!! I love the material as well . Very soft . It just glides in so there is no need for lubrication . In case you dont have any or lost it , if you know what i mean lol Sorry , i dont know how graphic we can be so ? All i can tell you is that it is a veryyyy good toy specially for the price . Easy to clean . The beads are n't as strong as I thought they would be -LRB- like my other roy -RRB- but they definitely work ! The size is just perfect ! I loved the color too . I got it in blue . Cutest thing ever haha . Not too loud either . Easy to operate , the lights turn on in a row setting so you can see what speed is on . I recommend this for sure . You wont be disappointed ! ALSO ! LADIES
 The Waterproof Jack Rabbit Vibrator is a dual action vibrator . One motor for clitoral stimulation and one motor for vaginal stimulation . The classic `` rabbit '' design . I have n't tested its claim of being waterproof by taking it in the hot-tub , but do n't worry I will!The penis shaped design is supposed to make penetration and thrusting easier , however it is bigger than most vibrators so be prepared with lubrication . The nice thing about this vibrator is that it is made with jelly so you can use water or silicone based lubrication . The jelly also makes it flexible . I found this to be a downside in that it did n't hit my g-spot as well as other dual action vibrators . A plus side is the vibrator 's rotating tip that gyrates in circles to tease your vagina and the massaging beads that allow the vibrator head to roll and rub against your G-spot for stimulation.The `` rabbit ears '' tickle and tease your clit if you can get them positioned correctly . I found the push button control pad to be bulky and hard to use in the `` heat of the moment '' . You get to select from 3 different Rotation and Vibration Speeds or push a button to reverse the spin completely.It uses 3 AA batteries , which is goes through quite quickly . Have plenty on hand . It comes in clear , pink or purple.Once you get past the bulkiness and large size and figure out how to use the control pad of the Jack Rabbit it can produce some great orgasms . For the price it is n't a bad Dual Action or `` Rabbit '' Vibrator .
 I was hesitant to buy a sex toy online , because there is no way for you to actually know how well its made , size , etc.So I took the risk on this because so many people have raved about the Rabbit . And its only like 25 bucks so no great loss if it sucks.It arrived a little early , VERY discrete packaging -LRB- I had it sent to my boyfriends house , and his parents didnt even suspect !! -RRB- . I tried it out right away because I wanted to know what I paid for .30 seconds later , and I was ready to buy a lifetime supply of this !! The head is pretty thick , and I didnt think I would like that , but it wasnt uncomfortable at all.Well worth it !!!
 Strong plastic smell for a few weeks -LRB- ! -RRB- after opening . Wanted phallus , not phthalates :-LRB- . Otherwise good , durable .
 Oh yeah it 's the best toy I have ever had , and I have had quite a few . Nice long handle !! Kinda thick but was a great ride . I recommend this to anyone who has a lot of stress and needs to relax . Afterwards I was craving a cig and I do n't smoke LOL . A must have for the `` Tool '' drawer !!
 This is definitely better than my last jackrabbit and much higher quality ! :-RRB- I got the clear one cause like other reviews say , your eye really does n't jump to it if it is left out and it just looks more mature and less bubble-gum `` my first vibrator '' hahaha!It 's really QUIET for something that moves/does so much and it is more powerful than I expected . I had to keep it on the medium settings for both the rotation and vibration - but even THAT got the job down in 26 seconds -LRB- yeah , I timed it -RRB- . This might take some getting used to for some but I absolutely love it!The only downside of this is that the rabbit ears part needs to be a little more `` lifted '' off the shaft so you can position it in more ways over you than just the one . People have been complaining of a weird plastic smell and it kind of does have A smell but only if you physically put your nose right on the thing and inhale - and it went away after 2 or 3 washes.I highly recommend buying this !
 It 's really big . I 'm not too impressed with the rotating dildo part because I really do n't feel much and I guess I also feel more stimulation from thrusting . However , those rabbit ears -LRB- and the little nose too -RRB- are amazing . I can turn it on the lowest setting and it wo n't take more than 2 minutes for me to have the big `` O '' . It would probably be a lot of fun with a partner .
 WOW ! I just got this in the mail today . This is my 1st ever vibrator/sex toy . I love it already . Everything from the size to the vibrations , the spinning beads . Its so freacking awesome . And you can control the vibes on both the shaft and the part that stimulates your clit . You can use just one or the other , or both .
 Man oh Man what a wise investment this product is for any couple or single female looking to go to that special place that all women love to go and all men love to send them . I say all men but it was all the Jack rabbits I was just the one steering the ship . I think the wife is happier than with the little bitty one and this is quite the upgrade . I didnt notice any weird or offensive smell like some others have reported but its not a breathe strip so its not really something you smell anyway . I highly recommend this for any couple wanting to add some zest to their relationship.I was wanting to do the video review but the wife wouldnt go for it !!
 This was my first toy i have purchased . I have always been a fan of the rabbit vibes and had a very tough time choosing which would be best for me . But i think i made a very good decision . The rotating movements and vibrating ears are a plus !!!! They feel AWESOME and get there job done fast . And it is quiet so no worries about someone hearing you . I think i use it at least 2 to 3 times a day . Although the downfalls of this vibe is it is rather large i was quite suprised when it arrived i was going to send it back but decided to give it a shot and now i love it . I would recommend lube and the size does take getting used to if your not used to your guy being large or other toys . But i would recommend this toy . So go ahead and try it you wo n't regret it i know i did n't !!!!!!
 Wow . That 's really all I can say about this one . Opening the box ... . I was quite surprised to see just how big this one was . Because of it 's girth , I would n't recommend it to someone who is inexperienced with these sorts of toys and/or not sexually active . Insertable length is just over 5 inches and girth is about 5.5 inches around.I was surprised to hear just how quiet this vibrator is . It 's far more quiet than other rabbits I have owned . And for being so quiet , it really has a lot of power ! You might want some cover-up noise if you 're using the second or third power levels though . -LRB- A fan , TV or covering the vibrator with a pillow all work well for this . -RRB- : -RRB- As other reviewers have stated ... the smell of this vibrator is rather overpowering when you first take it out of the package . However , the first couple of washes seemed to cut it quite a bit , so I believe the smell will mostly wear off after 5-6 washes.Takes 3AA batteries , very easy to put them in . I 'd suggest investing in a pack of rechargeable batteries .
 Have n't tried out the waterproof aspect of it , but my wife really enjoys it . It is a little bit large , so you 'll probably want to have some good lubrication on hand , but it does the job well once you get past that.The biggest problem is that the ear on the rabbit are pretty stiff , so can be a little rough part of the time . But this seems to be only occasionally for my wife , and you can always turn them off if they 're bothering you .
 Just received today . Arrived very discreet . In a black bag inside the box . After seeing -- had to try it out . Nice size . Not loud . Quick orgasm if thats what you want.Havent had a lot of time for experiment , but Love it so far !!!
 I allways wanted one of these to add to my colection it works great feels great I highly recomend everyone owning this
 Totally worth the money and an awesome addition to anyone 's bedroom ! Fun for one and even more fun for two ! Got ta have this product ! Excellent material and powerful vibrations and rotations ! If you buy only one `` toy '' make this one be your choice !!!!!
 OMG ! I can not say enough good things about this product . It is SO SO AWESOME ! This was the first adult sex toy I had ever bought and this is a great one !!
 This is absolutely INCREDIBLE ! I used it three times the first day I got it . I literally can not keep it out of me ! By far the best toy I have ever had . It is a little loud , but is easy to cover up with the radio , tv , or a fan . The rotating beads are absolutely amazing . It is the perfect size , but if you are used to smaller toys , you would probably have to work yourself up to it . My boyfriend and I live in different states so it gets alot of use . I LOVE it ! It is very easy to use in different positions and always hits the right spots . I would recommend it a million times !!
 This is my first `` rabbit '' purchase . Tried alot of vibrators and dildos but after a little research , I decided to give this a try . Oh ... my ... god . This is an awesome toy . It is a lil thick , but i like that . The vibrating ears are very powerful ... this thing `` does the job '' over and over !!! Love it !!!
 I Have had a couple of other toys and I did n't understood why women liked them so much but know after using the Jack Rabbit I do.So when I used it , it felt so good ! I had no trouble getting were I wanted to go . This is a good investment ! O and I also bought some Lubricant to go with it .
 I 've never owned a sex toy before , let alone a vibrator , but I 'm sorry I waited so long to purchase one . I found this exact model at Ambiance for twice the price , so you 're getting a really good value buying it here . All I can say about the delivery is that I paid extra to have it over-nighted and it came two days later -LRB- oh well , it was n't an emergency . . -RRB- . I 've only had it a few days but it has worked every time , so I feel good about the money I spent on it , however I will probably buy another one eventually with a few different things in mind . I do n't really care for the rotating beads - I used them the first couple of times and then just started turning them off because they were distracting and did n't really add any pleasure . I feel like I could n't get it deep enough or the ears would overshoot my clit . I still liked having the penetration though , so I would probably get one of the models that does its own thrusting or curves upwards for the g-spot or something . Other than that , it 's nice and quiet and has worked every time for me . I 'm really glad I saved the money by buying it here .
 I bought this for my fianc&eacute; for during foreplay it was the best thing I bought her ! She loves it it makes her go wild she has gets so horny while I use it on her and it makes sex a million times better ! She goes crazy while I pleasure her with this vibrator !

If any guys Re lookin to please there women to the max and than have crazy sex afterwords , buy this product cause you will have an expierance of a life time ! Awesome product and work amazing ! And this is the best price I found on the Internet ! Everywhere else I looked was a lot more than amazon ! Good luck
 I am a rookie when it comes to sex toys and have never owned or tried one . Needless to say , The Rabbit works like a dream!I 'm glad The Rabbit was my first choice , however , The size was intimidating but once I got over that aspect of it , the width seemed integral . The rabbit ears are phenominal ! The 3 speeds are great for working your way up . The rotation is not that great but there is still good movement . The only bad thing I can think of is that funny burned rubber smell . I am more than pleased with the shipping . I selected the the 5-8 days and literally the product arrived the next day . Call this gal `` one satisfied customer . `` California Exotics Waterproof Jack Rabbit
 Arrived on time and in original packaging . The only thing that you may want to watch out for is the 2 little prongs on the vabrating part can hit certain areas the wrong way if you 're not careful ;-RRB- Besides that it is a fantastic product .
 This was huge when i saw it which is n't a problem . . vibration ehh i 've had stronger but it gets the job done . . not bad for the price
 Wow . What an awesome product . This was my first experience with a rabbit-style vibrator , but it more than lived up to the hype . The vibrating bullet boasts some serious power and several settings to build up to . Please note that the rotating beads are METAL , which makes them much durable than the plastic beads used in similar products . The length is perfect for me and the controls are surprisingly easy to access . There are a few downsides , but nothing that can not be remedied . The product does have that distinct skunky plastic smell , although after a few washes it fades a way . Plus , this product is n't really designed to be used by your nostrils . It is also girthier than its competitors , but with adequate lubricant it is nothing insurmountable , so to speak . Over all , I would recommend this product -LRB- but probably not for beginners -RRB- .
 My dermatologist tried to sell me these exact pantyhose for a cosmetic procedure I had done . I had some spider veins removed and was told to wear these compression hose after . They wanted to charge me $ 40 more than Amazon . So I bought mine here and they did exactly what I needed them to . I wore them 48 hours straight . . then daily for seven additional days . I actually found I liked having them on b/c they kept me super warm . Definitely would n't want to wear these suing the summer ! I never got a snag or run in my hose and I was n't gentle on them . I have small children and am constantly on the ground playing with them . I washed them in my sink with a little soap and hung them to dry . I 'm sure you could wash them in the washing machine on a low cycle but it only took me two mins to wash them by hand in the sink . So no complaints here ... good buy !
 muy buen producto . rapido facil y a tiempo la entrega . sin contratiempos en todo el proceso . lo recomiendo a a

 I loved this so much had to buy another one after my first one finally died after 5 yrs of use !
 I love this toy and I bought it for gifts for all of my friends . It 's true - it is only 5 inches long , but if you bend it the right way , it hits your G-spot . All of my friends love it .
 I have been using Chitosan since approximately 1994 . It is an amazing way of allowing you to indulge in slightly higher fat content foods , such as chocolate or pizza , and still not add fat or pounds to your body . It is made of crustacean shells -LRB- totally natural and healthy , unless you are allergic to shell fish -RRB- , and it works by binding dietary fat in the stomach and carrying it out of the body without allowing the fat to be absorbed . Maximum four capsules per meal recommendation must be observed . As far as I am concerned , it is a product I do not want to be without ! I wholeheartedly recommend it for weight management/maintenance . It is not a weight loss product .
 I got this chair a few weeks ago and I LOVE it . It really does a great job with massaging and really works out the knots in my shoulders . My friends and family have all tried it out and many are now considering their own . I thought this was a lot of money but now think it is worth EVERY penny!Update
 Although this chair is expensive , I 've found it 's worth the dollars ! At the end of a long day at the computer , this will make you forget your troubles . It 's like having a spa at home and with the programs , you can set the controls to exactly what you need for the day . This has helped my husband 's bad back -LRB- years of broken bones from gymnastics -RRB- immensely .
 The best part about my ijoy 130 is the price I paid . Day after Xmas Linens and Things had only the floor model left . Got 20 % off of that plus signed up for the credit card to get another 10 % off . 30 % off made the chair $ 500 instead of $ 700 . I am in it as I write this !!! Very nice and relaxing . Sometimes the `` percussion '' setting is a little too hard in some spots but otherwise it 's great . I would agree that I wish it went a little further up the neck . I just sit a little lower in the chair for it . Not sure if it 's worth $ 700 just because that 's alot of money but I 've got no problem with $ 500 . I think my wife and I will get alot of use out of it .
 The chair and ottoman was for my mother . She loves it . She says that the massage features are great . Thank you .
 For the man who believes that even at 50 he can still out maneuver the kids . This was a surprise gift for my brother 's 50th . It has been one of his favorite lifetime gifts . It 's his new best friend after rounds of golf , softball , Harley trips , you name it . He and his wife use it everyday often just before bed to relax into what they claim is the best sleep they 've ever had . The design is ultra-smart . It 's a lovely piece of furniture to fit decor in any room . I highly recommend this for wellness , too .
 I have used this solution for years because of my sensitive eyes . I believe that it is the only nonpreserved saline available . The problem is that the price has skyrocketed in the past several years for no apparent reason . When I first started using this you could buy a box -LRB- 3 bottles -RRB- for $ 3 when it was on sale . Now it costs $ 6.50 - $ 7.00 ! Even allowing for inflation this is outrageous . You can buy a 12oz -LRB- same total amount -RRB- bottle of lightly preserved saline for $ 2.50 . It does n't cost Alcon any more to manufacture the saline than other companies such as Walgreens . Sure , Alcon 's comes in 3 bottles rather than one but the additional plastic used in the bottles still does n't justify the inflated price . Alcon should be ashamed of itself . I do n't understand why other companies do n't manufacture preservative-free saline . I 've now switched to the cheaper saline rather than pay Alcon 's rip-off price .
 I purchased this Noni Juice from Sprouts Market but the price here on Amazon is much better . This product is only noni juice with no added fruit juice ... so it tastes terrible . However , you do n't drink noni because it tastes good but because of it 's incredible health benefits ! No matter how bad this stuff tastes , I will continue to buy it . Especially if it becomes Prime Eligible ; -RRB-
 This nail clipper does a great job of cutting my fingernails . It 's easy to hold in my hand and so far this has lasted me well over a year ! I also use this for filing my nails and cleaning underneath them . My nails stay nice and short -- and rounded off at the outer edges which is the way I like them!As the website indicates , you should have your nails wet so that cutting them will be easier . Cutting dry nails just does n't work as easily.I highly recommend this nail clipper .

 Item was easy to order.Item was delivered as promised on time.This item will be purchased again .
 Tried every kind of cholesterol meds and had a bad reaction to all -LRB- very bad body aches -RRB- . Cholestene lowered my cholesterol dramatically and I have no bad reaction to it . Have been on it for over a year and it really works . All blood tests are good as well . But check with your own doctor to see what is appropriate for you .
 Based on what I have researched/read each pill in this formula should contain 3.4 mg ofLovastatins , -LRB- Icluding monacolins KA form -RRB- . The FDA will not allow these companies to print this on the label . They want everyone reliant on large pharma . This formula was tested and contained no mycotoxin citrinin -LRB- thought to cause chronic kidney disease in the Balkans where this toxin is found in high levels -RRB- a dosage of three pills a day should be a good start and is the minimum effective dosage shown to work in clinical trials.I would also recommend taking a CoQ10 supplement like Q-gel which is solubilized in polysorbate 80 , for excellent absorption .
 On Sept 27 , 2010 I had my blood work done . Cholesterol was 244 , LDL 157 , HDL 65 and Triglycerides 109 . I read an article from mens health magazine about supplements , and Cholestene was mentioned . A year earlier I tried Cholestoff which dropped my levels by a few points but nothing to get exited about so I stopped.After reading the article I decided to give Cholestene a try . I was retested on Dec 6 , 2010 and my levels had decreased significantly . Cholesterol went down to 164 and LDL went down to 89.2 . Unfortunately Triglycerides went up to 124 and HDL went down to 50 but they are still within a healthy range . I did n't start any exercises to speak of . I followed the instructions on the bottle and that was basically it . I reduced my daily caloric intake to 1500 - 1800 which also decreased my cholesterol intake as well . This will help to keep my levels low over the long run .
 After making a dramatic change in my eating plan and increasing my level of physical activity , my cholesterol dropped to a very healthy range . I was still taking the cholesterol medication I had been on for a couple decades . Under the supervision of my doctor , I quit taking the medication , and my levels adjusted to just beyond what 's considered healthy under current standards . I added Cholestene to my daily supplements , and within weeks I was back within a healthy range . Would any other product have done the same ? I do n't know . But this one seems to work for me . I am no longer taking statins , and my bloodwork reports good cholesterol levels . Hooray !!!
 This was recommended to a friend of mine by his doctor . I 'm usually very skeptical of herbal treatments , but since the recommendation came from a regular medical doctor , I decided to give it a try . I am blown away by the results . I have been on this product for about 18 months , and my cholesterol has dropped from 252 to 192 . I made no other significant changes in my diet . What 's more , I am only taking two capsules a day instead of the recommended dosage of four per day . I 've read that the big pharmaceuticals are campaigning to require this product to be sold only by prescription . I pray this never happens .
 I have to say I am a sceptic with herbal cures but saw a short article in AARP so thought I would try it . I have been trying to use diet to lower my cholestrol so I could avoid medications but after a year of that and the cholestene my cholestrol was lower than it had been in 7 years , even my doctor was impressed . I am only able to take 2-3 a day since more gave me stomach problems like high fiber would.overall cholsestrol down 21 pts
 I have been taking prescribed statins for years and developed muscle pains in my legs that many neurologists can not diagnose . Finally , an alternative medicine doctor said it could be &#34; statin-induced neuropathy &#34; , so I stopped taking the prescribed statins.My cholesterol levels went up without the medications . I searched for alternatives to lower my cholesterol and came across the book &#34; Statin Drugs and their Natural Alternatives &#34; by Jay Cohen , M.D. . One of the things mentioned was Cholestin -LRB- Red Yeast Rice -RRB- . The first red yeast rice I tried was Choleast by Thorne Research and after 3 months decreased my cholesterol some but not to acceptable levels . Then , I switched to Cholestene by High Performance Formulas . To my and my Doctor 's surprise after only 2 months of taking 2 capsules daily , my total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels are down to acceptable levels . Even my Doctor asked what I 've been taking . Part of the message I wish to convey is that NOT all Red Yeast Rice formulas have the same effectiveness ... so be aware of this .
 I can not tolerate pharmaceutical statins and this product gives me excellent results without side effects , been using it for many years .
 I have been using this product for years and do not have to use the KILLER STATIN DRUGS to keep my cholesteral were it is suppose to be.HPF Cholestene Dietary Supplement , 120 capsules
 December 2011 , cholesterol level 400 , triglycerides also high . Started taking red yeast rice -LRB- cholestene -RRB- 1200mg a day and 1000mg flax seed oil , for 3 months .

 This product does make the appetite disappear !! However it made me very irritable while I took it . I took it for four days so I did not give it enough time to see how the fat burning part worked . The pills were also very long and caused me throat irritation . Everyone is affected differently when taking things so I would say give it a try you will notice the effects right away .
 I love this product . In combination with diet and exercise I have lost about 5 pounds , and I was n't heavy to begin with -LRB- all I wanted to do was tone up -RRB- . Instead of taking the recommended dosage of 2 capsules twice a day , I am taking 1 twice a day . I figured I 'd take it slow before I get too jittery . But it definitely curbs my appetite . I literally eat half of my usual intake . It gives me energy without making me feel like I 'm wired and I have n't had any shaking hands . I only had headaches for the first 2 days I took this , but now they are completely gone . I will continue to take this even after I reach my goal weight . It 's a great product .
 I like the Green Tea Diet pill for many reasons . First , it causes the bored eater -LRB- that 'd be me -RRB- from eating aimlessly throughout the day . Secondly , since I 've taken it for the 2 and half months that I have -LRB- actually this started happening within a few weeks and has continued -RRB- , the capsules have helped shrink my stomach to probably half of what it used to be , so that when I do eat , I do n't overdo it . Keep in mind that when I say stomach , I mean the one your food drops into , not your waistline . However , by no means am I saying that there 's no weightless physically . There is!So far I 've lost 15 pounds . Some of you might be thinking , `` Well that 's surely with exercise , and I 'm not one to have time to do that , or I hate exercising . '' You know what ? For those of you that DO exercise you 'll lose even more weight than me at the 2.5 month mark , because I go about day to day doing general stuff , nothing like walking or jogging for miles or riding a bike . However , I 've figured a few things are key to those that are n't too keen on exercise -LRB- the word alone makes me shudder -RRB- . If you do n't have time to exercise routinely or for very long , or you just hate the word `` exercise '' -LRB- I know it can cause terror within a few of us , do n't lie -RRB- then keep these things in mind when you take this amazing pill : - Going to the grocery store ? Do n't go when you 're hungry and do n't park in the closest to the building spot -LRB- unless it 's dark then it can be scary -RRB- . For obvious reasons , do n't go when you 're hungry , you 'll just end up popping everything into your cart -LRB- some stuff you do n't even know what the heck it is when you get home to unpack -RRB- . Instead , and I 'm sure you know this , maybe go after dinner or after lunch . What to get ? That 's another few paragraphs down.-Going shopping ? Does that word make you giddy with delight ? ... only until you realize you really do n't have the money to be doing it ? Alright , here 's the solution . Go to the mall or outlet stores or wherever else it is you could spend hours looking around at stuff . Park in the furthest from the building spot , leave the tempting ways of payment either at home or in your car -LRB- hidden with stealth ! -RRB- , go in the building and window shop ! Spend at least a half hour doing this to however long -LRB- though you 'll get kicked out if you try to stay past closing time -RRB- . If you think it 's weird to exercise in the mall/store , it 's really not . I know I 've seen a few power walkers in my mall and it 's totally obvious what they 're doing , but the thing is you DO N'T have to do that . Exercising this way is as easy as just browsing stores , circulating the mall , bypassing the food court -LRB- unless you need water -RRB- and checking out potential Christmas gifts while getting a regular workout ! - Play with your kids for at least a half hour a day -LRB- outside -RRB- ! Play hide and seek ! Run after them ! Shoot hoops -LRB- not only is it exercise , it 's helping hand-eye coordination ! -RRB- , throw a few balls , kick a soccer ball , play on the swing set , walk around the park while your kids play ! There 's so many great activities and family bonding time you can do and get an easy workout , too ! It 's a win-win for both you and your kids.-No kids ? Pets are the next best thing . I have three dogs and one cat . They 're the sweetest , most evil things in the entire world ! Not only do they make me take a run for my money -LRB- literally , cause they steal my shoes and anything else they can get and take outside -RRB- they also warm my heart and make me laugh and smile . 30 minutes playing with your pets is a another great way to help amplify the effects of this diet pill ! - Have a good laugh . Find your funny friends , people , and laugh as much as you can ! You lose loads of calories that way!There 's definitely more small things that can help you lose weight , especially when taking this pill , but what about what food is right?Stay away from carbs . Period . They are not your friend all the time . Especially since they let lose all the things your fatty cells need to keep their greedy little lives prosperous in your thighs/stomach etc. . Must have them ? I know your pain . Instead start getting used to whole grain and wheat . Do n't shrink in terror , it 's not that bad ! Eating habits , especially the bad ones need to be rethought when taking this pill for the best results!Well , that 's my review , and a little of what I 've done to help you get on your way to a better , happier , healthier you ! I hope this has helped at least some people ! This is how it worked for me , but keep in mind , every one 's body is unique and special and has it 's own way it likes losing weight , so just find that niche and you 're good to go!GOOD LUCK !!
 This product works great , so far I 've lost around 12 pounds , and I 've only been taking it for a couple weeks . I highly recommend it to anyone that needs to lose weight .
 I bought this product to use in conjunction with my `` new '' diet and exercise plan . I started really watching what I eat and stepped up my exercise big time in January , and I had been losing weight healthily and consistently -LRB- i.e. 2-3 pounds a week -RRB- . But once I lost about 15 pounds on my own , I hit a major plateau ... I mean my weight WOULD NOT MOVE . I started taking these , and I literally busted through my plateau . I only take one in the morn and one in the afternoon with my multivitamin . I also make sure I have something on my stomach before I take these , just to make sure I do n't get an achy tummy . On the downside , like a couple other customers , I had a couple of days where I got some big-time headaches . But outside of that , it 's great . I have also noticed that my appetite has decreased slightly and I also do n't have big cravings for the `` good stuff '' -LRB- i.e. Haagan Daaz ice cream , caramel cookies , etc. -RRB- like I used to . I have also noticed that my energy is just about through the roof ... I 'm even exercising at work by power walking for 30 mins . I NEVER even thought about doing that before these pills . I 'm a tea drinker with an occasional cup of coffee , and this gave me less jitters but more energy -LRB- if you can think of that -RRB- . No shaking hands , toe tapping ... just raw energy . I do n't get sleepy at work like I used to either . I 'm on my last few days of pills , so I think I 'm gon na take a break for a month and start back up with the Triple Tea ones instead . But I have to say ... like any other weight loss program , to get the best results , you got ta watch what you eat and you got ta move ... there 's no way around it ... at least for me . But give these a try ...
 Over the winter , i seem to gain alot of weight . As a high school quarterback , that is not acceptable . Last summer , i think i went from 160 to 150 . That 's my gross weight loss . I 'm not even talking about how much fat i lost . I gained a good amount of muscle over the summer , so i probably lost over 15 lbs of fat . I got my six pack back , and life was great . After the season , i just quit , and now my six pack is back in the fridge . I 'll probably order some up next week and start again . These are great , and the results are amazing .
 I rate -LRB- Green tea Fat Burner -RRB- 5 star . becauseI bot another called Lipoxinol 70.00 -RRB- and I bot another one called -LRB- Green tea fat furner -RRB- and it was better in quality wise and its only 14.99 at Costco.Lipoxinol is very good as well but more expesive . bot off amazon.it sais its -LRB- made canada -RRB- derctions say to take 4 pills in AM & 4pills PM . and man there great.the -LRB- green tea fat burners -RRB- in comparison dictions say take 2 pillsAM & 2pills PM . I over rall I think -LRB- green tea fat burner -RRB- makes me a little bit more hyper . the more hyper the more stuff I do , that means the more excerise I get , , , , , You will see Lipoxinal on amazon . its 4 star , this one has less rating for some reason , not many people said much about it , wierd , Americans like to pay more money when , this one can work just as great , not all work tho , but like I said this one was great for me in wise , I bot both , dont go off telling every one u are taking weight loss pills because people will get worryed , like theres no problem , people drink Coffee every day of there life , I told my mom and she thot I was crazy , but what dose my mom know , she never tryed weight loss pills , I tryed ntoher one from the natral food store call Mini skiny fat burner and I felt like I just shot my self with cocane , so be carfull , earbs have been used for thousand of years and can make u drug crazy ,
 I am a woman with Multiple Sclerosis who is ambulatory but has difficulty at times after steroid treatments , in the heat and with general stamina . I purchased this walker because I loved the fact that there was no assembly and it had a `` cool '' look to it . It definitely looked different from most.This thing is the SUV of walkers . It 's not feather light but it certainly is sturdy . There is no assembly required and you simply pull it out of it 's large box and go . One push of a lever and the rollator collapses -LRB- folds -RRB- vertically so that it can fit easily in a trunk or back seat . The wheels are large and smooth and this thing actually handles curbs and grass and changes of terrain easily . It 's rough and tough and looks like it can take a beating and handle abuse pretty well.The seating is very comfortable and this rollator adjusts easily -LRB- arm height -RRB- with simple lever pushes . There are no brake cables or anything to assemble . It 's ready to go out of the box and that is one of the reasons I chose it . I also bought this one because it looked a little different -LRB- resembles a baby carriage more than a traditional rollator or walker -RRB- . It drives smoothly , is easy to operate and is extremely comfortable . What more could I ask for?I bought the blue version since I saved about $ 100 on Amazon compared to the other colors . The blue and silver is very nice . This thing will definitely get a lot of use from me .
 My husband suffered a heart attack a few years ago becoming unstable on his feet . His first walker/rollator had 8 '' wheels and was handy and lightweight , good , but not the best in Alaska 's winter snows . Also the seat was not adjustable for height and it was n't exactly the right height for my husband . We purchased the Cosco rollator because of it 's sturdiness and even larger wheels and it is the most versatile item we own . As it is designed for use , the wheels are wonderful for crossing all kinds of terrain , level , snowy , or gravel . The seat adjustment is easy , quick , and comfortable . The Handles also adjust easily without having to take any screws out and move parts , as we had to do on his first rollator . It folds easily and transports in the back of our pickup without a problem . It is ` slightly ' heavy compared to other lighter weight walker / rollators , but it 's versatility outweighs the ` slightly heavy ' aspect . For those who are more active its great for hauling things . I am able to stack several pieces of firewood on the seat saving my back and arm muscles from fatigue . It enables my husband to do this chore too which he would not be able to do otherwise . When company comes I use it as my ` spare chair ' , handy and comfortable for me . I also use it as a foot rest since the lazyboy is always occupied.This is the second Cosco Rollator I purchased because of frequent loaning the first one out to others as needed . Now we do n't have to be without a Cosco . Bottom line - I just love this rollator and would keep it around even if it was n't needed for walking purposes.I was able to purchase by new blue Cosco rollator from Amazon , on sale for $ 107.-00 - a terrific price !
 This is a very good rollator . Very easy to adjust , very stable , rolls easily over grass and other uneven outdoor surfaces.The adjustable height seat is great .
 Concerns : In the 1 month that I 've used the Cosco Traveler Rollator , the front wheels have fallen off on two occasions . It was impossible to get through to the company on its 800 # After 32 mins . of elevator music , I gave up , and had someone else repair the wheels . The removable basket sits on the lip of the frame which causes frequent falling off , and it holds only 10lbs . The walker weighs approx . 18lbs and does not fold as compactly as the traditional walkers . The back wheels have a lever that brings the wheels in to meet up with the front wheels to fold , this is done while standing which takes up a wide portion of a car seat , and you have to allow for the height . All of the above has decreased the Cosco Traveler Rollator by 5 points.Now the 4.5 star points of the Cosco Traveler Rollator : It is not your traditional walker . It comes in great colors
 My mother used a traditional style walker which was unstable with small wheels , and she fell and broke her hip . She was nervous about getting about again until I bought her the Cosco Traveler Rollator . It is very sturdy , and has large wheels so she can use it outdoors or even for a stroll in the park . It has lots of adjustments -LRB- even the seat can adjust ! -RRB- and is easy to use , or fold up for the car.She really loves it , and it is great to see her out and mobile again.I would recommend this for any elderly people who would like the secure feeling when walking , or anyone recovering from leg or back operations.It is the perfect walker product .
 The awesome Cosco Ability Care Traveler Syle Rollator is the very best . It is very sturdy and easy to use . Easy to adjust handles and very comfortable seat . Also come with a back rest , that can easily be attached if you need one . This has sturdy oversized wheels and easy to use hand brakes . Rolls smoothly on any surface or yard and is not tippy like some . Easy to fold and put in your back seat or trunk.It is good for any height as the adjusting handles accomodate all . I recommend this rollator to anyone who is looking for a very sturdy piece of equipment . You will not be sorry if you purchase this item .
 I 've had the rollator for several weeks and absolutely love it . It has met all my expectations and more , with the large wheels easily traversing over all types of terrain . The one thing I did n't expect is the feeling that this is `` sporty '' and different , most machines of this type give the impression of being staid . It actually is very stylish and modern , with the ergonomics and attention to detail more obvious as you use it . `` It 's `` great '' .
 My dermatologist tried to sell me these exact pantyhose for a cosmetic procedure I had done . I had some spider veins removed and was told to wear these compression hose after . They wanted to charge me $ 40 more than Amazon . So I bought mine here and they did exactly what I needed them to . I wore them 48 hours straight . . then daily for seven additional days . I actually found I liked having them on b/c they kept me super warm . Definitely would n't want to wear these suing the summer ! I never got a snag or run in my hose and I was n't gentle on them . I have small children and am constantly on the ground playing with them . I washed them in my sink with a little soap and hung them to dry . I 'm sure you could wash them in the washing machine on a low cycle but it only took me two mins to wash them by hand in the sink . So no complaints here ... good buy !
 muy buen producto . rapido facil y a tiempo la entrega . sin contratiempos en todo el proceso . lo recomiendo a a
 excellent protection for aching legs . i wear them under my scrubs or with dress clothes for work . i am a medical student and by the end of the day my legs are normally hurting in a million & one places . these really help .

 I really love this protein source as it is unflavored and can be added to most anything . It is great for those people following bariatric surgery who need to beef up their protein levels . I highly recommend it .
 This is an excellent basic protien powder . It disolves easily and is almost tasteless . I add it to Instant Breakfast to add protien . I have added it to Crystal Light to get a very low cal protien boost . There is some texture change to the drink , but little taste change . Very easy to use .
 This has been really helpful for maintaining protein levels after my surgery . It really mixes well with sweet or savory foods . The only issue is that you ca n't get it too hot ; if you want to add it to soup , you 've got to let it cool a bit first .
 I must tell anyone who wears these stockings ... I wear them everyday ... thigh highs ... you need to get the Jobst `` It Stays '' roll on body fixative and just put a couple of dots around your legs at the top of where the stockings will be ... they WILL NOT ROLL DOWN ... They stay put ALL day for me . I would n't even put them on with out it .

 This is the ONLY deodorant I 've used that did n't make my underarms itch ... and since I wear Polo -LRB- classic green -RRB- cologne , the scent is 100 % consistent , which makes it even better ! Could n't be happier !!! : D
 I 've had my chair for a few weeks now . In general , I like it . But before you buy it , test it out . The channels for your calves are quite narrow . I doubt grown men could use this feature . Also be aware that on this model , massage functions stop at the upper neck and do n't really do shoulders or neck . It 's a little noisy as well ... the leather squeaks while in use . Wo n't bother you , but might bother others ! All that said though , I am enjoying it and it 's my unwind before I go to sleep at night .
 I have been taking this for a little under a week . I have noticed that my clothes are starting to fit more loosely . I have dropped about 5 pounds . No noticable side effects like some other products I have tried in the past . I am not jittery or my heart racing . Over all seems to be a good product .
 Works great for me ! I do n't feel sick when I take these like I have with other diet pills . They make me feel energized but not too wired or jittery and also suppress my appetite great . I 've lost 5 pounds in the first week and it 's not too expensive so if you personally are n't happy with it you havent thrown away too much money . I suggest buying one box at the drug store -LRB- 10 bucks -RRB- first before ordering a three pack , everyone 's body is different .
 Anyone who says this product has n't worked for them is n't using it properly . I take one when I wake up , and like a previous reviewer , go about my morning routine . It only works if you do it with diet and exercise , but I definitely feel a difference in my appetite . As a chef I am constantly around food . I find that I am able to go through my day being filled by just the food that I have to sample during the course of my work day . I 'm never hungry and when I do have a meal , I 'm always satisfied with reasonable portions . I 've always been in fairly good shape and was just looking for something to help me firm up before I go to Mexico in just over a month . I 've only been taking it a few days but I 've already lost five pounds !
 Tis is a high quality product . I have found it to be helpful to me . Remembering that not all products work the same for everyone , so you may find that it works better or less well for you.I wish you luck .

 I bought this for my dog , actually , as the vet prescribed 1000mg of Vitamin C per day for her . This dosage allows me to give 1 pill in the morning and 1 in the afternoon . It arrived within the anticipated delivery date window .
 I use this product over and over . Great colors and shine for your hair . Makes your hair feel healthy and full .
 I am a banquet cook at a large resort and frequently have to do tedious things like slice 2000 slider buns or cut 1000 tomato slices . Everyone who has borrowed this knife in the kitchen comes back to me and asks where I got it . It 's simply fantastic . The knife is light , the grip is excellent , and the blade is thin , which are all things you want out of your bread knife . Definitely keeps you going long after the guy with his 4 pound club has gotten fatigued . Would recommend to home cooks and chefs alike .
 As I stated in the title , I was very pleased with the product which I received in a timely manner .
 These things are great ! Helps relieve neck and shoulder pain and smells wonderful . Money well invested .
 I purchased the Large NeckEase by BodySense for my husband and the Sinus Pillow for myself and let me tell you , I can only say I wish I 'd gotten them sooner ! We both go to the Chiropractor and have the Mediflow Waterbased pillows -LRB- see my review for those and the pillow case -RRB- but the addition of these 2 items was a great investment . We both suffer from neck and back pain and arthritis so we have tried many different things to help ease our pain and discomfort.My husband has used the NeckEase several times already and I used it the other night ... heated it in the micro , wrapped it around my neck and climbed into bed for the night . Was very comfortable laying there with my head on my Mediflow Waterbased pillow and before I knew it I was fast asleep!I 've used the Sinus Pillow twice now . We live in West TN and this time of year we can have some crazy weather - in the 70s one day and down to the 40s the next . This weather wreaks havoc on my sinuses , causing me lots of sinus pain and pressure and some pretty strong and painful , pounding headaches . I just heat my Sinus Pillow in the micro for the recommended time , lay down and place it over my eyes and nose and once again , it 's not long until I 'm fast asleep . Now , I 'm not going to say it took my headache away completely each time , but it sure does relieve the sinus pressure and greatly reduces the pounding pain in my head so that I can relax and fall asleep quite easily . The various scents given off from each pillow is wonderful and very soothing.I would recommend both of these products and look forward to using them for years . And after reading the reviews of the BodySense Large Pack and Extra Large Pack I am putting those on my wishlist for purchase of one or both in the very near future !
 ... another awesome product by BodySense ! So comfortable , warm and soft while warming and comforting my arthritic neck . It is a great product and I recommend it to EVERYONE . Heats nicely in the miocrowave -LRB- start with a 1 minute increment , then remove from microwave oven , shake , and replace to keep pellets/rice/herbs within from getting too hot and melting the outer cover . -RRB- This is the second one I have had . They last a very long time and really work well ! Definitely a quality product that I will continue to use for a very long time . Also works on other specific pains where heat is required to feel better .
 The large NeckEase is a fabulous product ! It holds the heat as advertised and hugs the neck and shoulders comfortably . I would definitely recommend this product .
 I already had this item and purchased one for my daughter-in-law . She loves it ! Service from provider was excellent !
 For many years this amazing invention has been a lifesaver for me . When my neck , or any other area , starts tocause me problems , I grab my neckease . put it into the microwave , and within minutes I 'm on the way to feelingmuch better . I do n't remember how many years I 've had it , so that in itself tells that it 's been quite a few.Even if my neck is not misbehaving , sometimes it 's just comforting to have the warmth of it on dreary winterdays . A wonderful product , I highly recommend it.Grammy
 The NeckEase hot/cold pillow is wonderful . Microwave it for less than 3 minutes and you are left with one hour of warm , soothing neck relief . I bought a second as a gift and they really enjoy theirs too . Highly recommend wearing while watching TV or a late night movie at home.ps . The item arrived in its own packaging with instructions and a very nice hand written note of appreciation . This seller is the real deal !!!
 This long-lasting aromatherapy hot/cold pack will literally last for 10 years or more . The investment in your health and comfort level is well worth the price . The polar fleece cover makes this warm and cozy , while the black cloth on the other side makes this pack radiate cold better when the pack is put in the freezer . So , you can use this in the winter or summer or anytime heat/cold is needed.To heat , put in the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes . To cool , keep in freezer until needed . You may want to put this in a plastic bag first if storing in the freezer.Over the years , the aromatic spices and herbs seem to retain their scent and the rice never seems to dry out , which is quite amazing.Ingredients
 I think the most important part of any cleansing regimen is the moisturizing . It dictates whether or not your skin will produce more sebum , which , in turn , dictates whether the oil produced will be enough to moisturize or clog your skin.This product , one of my many moisturizers , is very good to not leave your skin dry or clog it up . It is a very light moisturizer , easily absorbed into the skin . The pleasant orange scent is very refreshing as well.The only downsides to the product , in my opinion , are the lack of product and the high price . Do n't let the decent size of the container fool you . It is a mere 1.7 ounces , which is enough for a few weeks if you are conservative about it . It retails for about 35 dollars , which is not cheap.Granted , it is a great product , but at that price range you can really get a wider variety of higher end products . Billy Jealousy , Anthony , Lucky Tiger , all of those are just a few other brands with great moisturizers for a much better price.Conclusion
 I 've broken off pieces of these and shared with fellow employees , and they usually want to know where I got them . When I 'm really busy they can make do as a meal because -LRB- unlike a Snickers bar with 350 calories -RRB- they really stay with me . I did n't like the apple Zoe 's bars and the chocolate peanut butter were really good , but these are just plain great . The soy crisps in it are almost like little peanuts and the chocolate flavor is very intense . They are just fantastic with a good cup of coffee or an espresso .
 Zoe 's chocolate energy bar is very yummy . It 's got a fudge-like texture with little bits of puffed rice towards the middle . What 's really fantastic is how good it is for you . It 's got plenty of Omega-3 fatty acids -LRB- really good for brain function and lots of other stuff -RRB- . It 's got whole grains instead of processed grains , etc. . Do n't make it a regular meal , but it 's a great thing to grab to tide you over until your next meal .
 My nutricianist recommended these and she was right . They hit the spot when I am hungry -LRB- or eating breakfast in the car . -RRB- and I feel healthy eating them . Good stuff !
 so far this has been the best tasting energy bar . I have had many . but this one is better tasting .
 This is very brownie-like and is a very nice energy bar as a snack . This does not work at all as a meal replacement but it wonderful when the expectations are to be used as a snack.Cheers
 I 'm a big fan of bars , and Zoe 's is the best ! I 've tried them all and keep coming back to Zoe 's ... and the Chocolate Delight is the best of the best.Refreshing , great texture , and the taste never gets old !
 This is an excellent tasting bar . The chocolate flavor rivals that of your favorite candy bar . There is no vitamin taste as found in many other health bars . High in protein and fiber . Fits in very well with any healthy eating program .
 I am absolutely addicted to this flavor as well as all of the other bar flavors . This is my breakfast , afternoon pickup or even sometimes my on the go lunch ! I am never hungry when I eat my Zoe 's Bars !
 Shape Magazine , August 2006 issue rated Zoe 's Chocolate Delight Bar as one of their favorite chocolate bars . The funny thing is that the nutrition facts for Zoe 's Bars have the same terrific nutrition as the bars that they selected for their high fiber category - that means high fiber and great taste . Ca n't beat it for energy and satisfying your chocolate craving without eating a candy bar .
 I loved the Chocolate Delight Zoe Whole Grain Bars . I really enjoyed the fact that I could eat these guilt free .
 Nothing can replace a skilled Soma practitioner - but this thing rocks . I 've had a bad back -LRB- herniated discs -RRB- for years . The discs are fine now , but the muscle over-compensation in my back is near-constant if I 'm active with basketball , golf , yardwork , etc. . In lieu of massage-on-call , this chair is a great addition to begin an energetic morning with loosening and close the day with a relaxing post-yardwork massage.Head 's up - if you have the lower-body -LRB- legs -RRB- setting on high , do n't panic ... it will let up eventually . I personally like the rough stuff , so that 's where I keep it .
 My brother bought this chair and I was a little skeptical . I have several of the very expensive put in your chair kinds , many large hand held and I have sat in the ones at the name brand places and not been impressed . Oh they felt okay , but did n't do the trick . When I went to my brother 's house , he sat me down and I sat there the entire night ! It was incredible . I have never felt anything so wonderfully relaxing other than my own massage therapist . This chair may seem expensive , but it 's worth every drop . I am waiting for mine to be delivered !

 These are a real hit with everyone , from kiddie parties to Bar-B-Q 's ! Lots of fun , and different than most novelty items . Put them in your glove compartment in case you get stranded , next to your bed in case the power goes out , toss them in the pool , the tub , the punchbowl , the fun ideas with these things are endless . Incidentally , these work just the same as all the other `` Waterless '' drink coolers that we 've had since long before the `` lighted '' ones arrived on the scene . Why-ever would you `` throw them out '' just because the light was done ??
 I encountered these cubes in a bar in the Netherlands last week . They are so cool , you put them in your cocktails and they light them up . You can also dance with them -LRB- if you want to -RRB- . The best part about them is that you can stop them working and they 're not like the glow snap stuff you get at Disney , that lasts a few hours and then dies on you . They last for ages !!
 I discovered these beautiful little gems at the Sci-Fi Dine-In Theater restaurant at Walt Disney World in Florida . In a darkened atmosphere like the Sci-Fi Restaurant , these cubes show up great.I would recommend them for holidays or theme parties as favors for your guests . Use lots of candlelight during your party rather than overhead lighting to provide a `` darkened environment . '' Litecubes are economical and will certainly provide entertainment for your guests.This would be a five-star product if the batteries would provide more than 10-12 hours of use . Figure on using them for 3-5 cocktail parties before replacing them . Batteries are not replaceable -LRB- unless you have the capacity to reseal the Litecubes -RRB- . Store your litecubes in the refrigerator to slow the battery 's decay .
 I purchased several of these little gems in various colors for the first time a few months ago , and I have to say that my drinks have never been the same since ! Their ability to add a whole new dimension to the ambience and conversation of a given party never fails to impress either the host or the guests . My only issue with the Litecubes is that once their batteries run out -LRB- about 8 to 12 hours depending on storage and usage conditions -RRB- , you have no choice but to dispose of them and purchase replacements -LRB- which can get rather expensive if you own several sets of them in different colors like I do -RRB- since it is not possible to reseal the watertight plastic casing that houses the batteries . It would have been nice if they had designed them so that the batteries could recharged by placing the litecubes on a charger base of some kind , which would solve the power capacity issue for the most part without having to physically remove the batteries . -LRB- An upgrade for Litecubes 2.0 , perhaps ? -RRB-
 After much hesitation , I purchased these in differnt colors for our annual Halloween Bash ! They were a little pricy for something disposable , but once I receive them I was blown away ! They light up very bright and the colors are very vivid . They are soooo much fun and I am so excited to see my guests reactions to them . It was money well spent . They are durable and well made . The only drawback is the fact that you can not replace the battery so when they die , the fun is over ! But I would definately recommend picking up a set just for the fun of it . Maybe the manufacturer could think of a way to make the battery replaceable !
 I gave a two sets to my in-laws and they have used it everytime they have friends over , and their reaction is of surprise and curiosity . They all have a lot of fun drinking with their litecubes on . I am ordering more for them .
 This is the perfect present for anyone . . especially good for those who already have everything . I got them for my entire family this Christmas . From the oldest to youngest , they were a hit . Just odd enough to be fun , but practical enough to get used . And after 12 hours of use , they just throw them away , so you have n't created any useless clutter . -LRB- Get yourself a set too . -RRB-
 I would recommend them for holidays or theme parties as favors for your guests . -LRB- It is such a great gift in festival 's sovenuior such as wedding , X'mas or Halloween . -RRB- Litecubes are economical and will certainly provide entertainment for your guests , especially in darkness environment .

 I must tell anyone who wears these stockings ... I wear them everyday ... thigh highs ... you need to get the Jobst `` It Stays '' roll on body fixative and just put a couple of dots around your legs at the top of where the stockings will be ... they WILL NOT ROLL DOWN ... They stay put ALL day for me . I would n't even put them on with out it .
 Works great at storing pills . You can either use it as morning/night sections for 2 weeks , or once a day for 4 weeks . Lids open and close well . Storage pouch useful for those who travel , though I do n't use it much . Very happy .

 I love the pen again pen due to my carpel tunnel syndrome . Amazon charges shipping per package so I order from the seller direct to reduce shipping charges on my large orders . The refills do n't last very long due to I write a lot and they are smaller than other refills in order to fit into the pens . Refills are the way to go as they reduce plastic consumption .
 This is a great product for a caregiver , as I am . The product gets rid of urine ordors in laundry basket and in air . I just love it .
 I bought this foot massager because I needed a footrest for my ijoy100 massage chair . I used it couple times after a long walk in the mall , and it soothed my aching legs . My sister bought it two years ago , and she said it improved the circulation on her legs .
 I 've been using ScarZoneA for about 2 weeks now and I 'm in love ! I started getting acne when I was 24 and it 's so embarrassing to have acne as an adult . Most products I 've tried make your acne worse before it starts getting better . ScarZoneA did n't do that for me ... it starting working right away . I just ordered 2 more tubes ! The smell is kind-of gross , but you get used to it ... just do n't put the cream on your upper lip and you wo n't smell it as much . The smell is a small price to pay for how well it works . Seriously . It is keeping me from getting NEW zits and it 's finally fading my old scars out . Try it !
 This product is truly great . I have used for a few months now . I had old acne scars on my face , arms , and shoulders . I had scars on my back that had been there for years . After a few weeks of using Scar Zone many dark scars have completely disappeared and the rest have become lighter and should be gone soon . On my face all scars are gone . I continue to use Scar Zone along with my acne treatment when I get new breakouts , always around my monthly cycle . For the first time in my life I am not afraid of the monthly breakouts ! I know that I can use the Scar Zone to prevent the ugly dark spots that acne breakouts leave behind . Thanks Amazon for carrying this great product .
 I first started using scar zone when the original formula without the green tea came out . This version with the green tea seems to take longer to produce results for me so it 's like you have to use more of the product to see a change . Scar zone is reasonably priced compared to mederma so I would definitely recommend it .
 After a recent surgery , my scar began to itch terribly . But what was more troubling was due to the placement of the scar from the surgery the nerves had been severed . So I was trying to rememdy my itchy scar and could not feel the relief from scratching . This product has helped calm the itchiness from my scar . The tip on the bottle is rounded and lends itself to helpful massage while applying .
 I used to use this about a year ago , but i stopped using it . It works well . . I was not disappointed even though it takes a bit longer for it to work . It does reduce redness in acne which is one of the main reasons I will be purchasing again . . Does clear breakouts faster and works for scars ... I do recommend this product to anyone .
 After I stopped taking birth control , my face started breaking out really bad . I have tried everything to fade my hideous scars and this is the 1st prodct in 3 yrs of searching that I have found that works exactly like it says . And , the product is very affordable . I am on my 3rd week of using and I already have better confidence and I do n't have to wear too much makeup ! I will continue to use ! Looking forward to my end results !
 I 've been using this product for a few years . It was recommended to me by a friend to help with a dog-bite scar . It worked ! I 've been using it ever since -LCB- 4 years -RCB- for the nicks and scrapes of everyday living .
 I must tell anyone who wears these stockings ... I wear them everyday ... thigh highs ... you need to get the Jobst `` It Stays '' roll on body fixative and just put a couple of dots around your legs at the top of where the stockings will be ... they WILL NOT ROLL DOWN ... They stay put ALL day for me . I would n't even put them on with out it .
 My son used this to help build up nasal membranes and it has helped cut down on nose - bleeds markedly . The only negative is that these are a fairly significant sized capsule which some might have difficulty swalloing and though my 10 year old takes them with ease , I know I would personally find them a bit daunting
 I recently ordered the Chamae Rose 2oz bottle and receivd it promptly.Item as described and I will absolutely purchase again !
 This is a good product . It will do exactly what it states , I suggest that you have time to spend at home when taking so that you will be near a restroom . The drops are potent and you do n't want to be too far away when it is time for you to go to relieve yourself .
 It took me a while to get used to the flavor
 This is product was very reasonably priced and for the improved absorption rate over regular vitamins you pay only a fraction of the cost . The dropper is also marked for easy and accurate use .
 Just to inform you ... . It is 4 droppers full that makes one single dose . I just started , but I was thinking when I bought it , one dose would be one dropper.But we shall see over the next few weeks if it works .
 I believe this product received a very unfair review strictly based on taste . I just received this bottle this week and I have to say , the Blueberry is much better than the banana ! It 's also important to keep this in the fridge after you open it.My naturopath doctor has me on this and about 3 other probiotic/flora supplements along with colostrum to treat both acid reflux and IBS . I 'm grateful to have found this on Amazon because his markup is at least 50 % . The important thing about taking a probiotic in liquid form is that sometimes it is important to have the beneficial bacteria colonize in the stomach and even esophagus . Capsules are meant to become available further down the GI tract to make your colon happy . I 'm finding that with the use of a good digestive enzyme and this liquid probiotic , I 've been able to go off my proton pump inhibitor -LRB- PPI 's like Prilosec and Nexium -RRB- which has given me stomach polyps from prolonged use.The theory is that regular use of anti-biotics , the stomach and intestines can become out of balance and unable to function naturally due to a lack of good bacteria.It 's important to take aloe vera juice regularly -LRB- 3x/day in between meals -RRB- to heal the esophagus and stomach . That in conjunction with a product like this can get you on the path to healing . I no longer have chest pain and I can also digest dairy . Amazing!A final thing about this . Some probiotics are designed so that you rely on them . The bacteria in them will not live longer than a day . I believe that this product is designed to actually grow and colonize to the point where you will not need it again after 3-4 months of use . The only time you would need it again is after taking an anti-biotic . Good luck and keep an open mind .
 Much cheaper and same product buying over the counterWe take this instead if medicationHelps settle indigestionGreat product
 I used this for my bunny rabbits that were getting the runny poo poos . They were quickly back to normal .
 I must tell anyone who wears these stockings ... I wear them everyday ... thigh highs ... you need to get the Jobst `` It Stays '' roll on body fixative and just put a couple of dots around your legs at the top of where the stockings will be ... they WILL NOT ROLL DOWN ...

 I can not keep house without this wonderful product . They do any job of scrubbing without scraping or scaring dishes , pans , or sink . They areflexible and easy to handle for all jobs . They are also great for difficult jobs outside or anywhere , and the price has always been right .
 Have been using Chore Boy Golden Feece Scrubbing Cloths since childhood , and that 's a long long time ago . The prduct scrubs pots , pans , sinks , counter tops , appliances , car rims , just about anything . Depending on frequency of use , one cloth can last months , If there were a 10 star rating , this product would get it . It 's rare these days to find a product that has remained on the market for so many years . What a shame it would be if this product left the consumer scene . Try it once and I 'm sure you 'll agree . Two cloths to the box , and well worth it . What else can you buy with so many uses , for under three dollars . Not much I 'd sayMichael McCannGladstone , Missouri
 Only type of fleece product on market . I 've been using for years as an all around scrubber of pots/dishes and to clean countertops , etc. . They last a very long time and never shred or tear .
 I 've been using these for years but for some reason they are no longer available in any of the grocery stores near me . I like them because they offer enough friction to clean tough stains -LRB- especially when used with BarKeeper 's Friend -RRB- but they do n't scratch my stainless steel pots the way steel wool used to . They also work great on my stainless steel cook top . I bought a case which reduced the price per item and spread out the shipping .
 chore boy flexible scrubbing cloths are the only thing I use to wash pots and pans , scrub kitchen counters , or scrub potoato skins . Hard to find on the Central Coast of California , thank goodness for the internet !
 The Chore Boy Golden Fleece are impossible to find in our area . Ordering was easy and the boxes arrived well ahead of the indicated date . I will order again when I am out .
 We ca n't find these in stores anymore , which is a shame , since nothing else works as well .
 Better than an SOS pad . It has similar scrubbing power ; and it 's safe to use on your non-stick pots and pans .
 Actually , I bought ten boxes for my mother who swears by these things . And she could n't find them here in Knoxville any more . She was so excited that I was able to find them at all , and more so because they were so inexpensive .
 These are just the beat scrubbies I ` ver used . They do n't scratch and they last forever . None of my local stores carry them anymore .
 Ace Hardware still carries this product in regular stock for 1.99 a box . Cheap.There 's you source . Sorry amazon vendors .
 We have used Chore Boy for several years and found it to be an excellent product for washing dishes . We could n't find them locally , so we ordered them on line . The charge for the product was not bad , but the freight was about a third of the cost . Maybe next time we will try a little harder to find them locally .
 I grew up using these on dishes -LRB- mainly pots and pans -RRB- because my mom always said they work the best at getting off stuck on food without ruining your pans . Then , once they get old , after a month or two , they `` graduate '' to scouring cloths for cleaning sinks ! Now that I am an adult , I ca n't stop using them . I even have my husband hooked ! These are becoming harder to find in local stores and grocery shops , so I ordered them ... and got a great deal !
 Like the other reviewers , I can no longer find this product on grocery shelves . I tried HEB , Target & Walmart and that 's about the only choices we have here in Texas . For some reason , periodically , stores stop carrying them . They should not do this , as they are absolutely the best for cleaning tough baked on things , as well as quick swipes before putting dishes in the dish washer . I have been using them for more than 40 years !
 I have used Chore Boy Golden Fleece for years and love it . I searched my area 's stores for over a year as my supply dwindled down and then my last one wore out . Still none to be found and then the internet dawned on me and I have enough to last for quite a few years .
 I would hate to try and survive without these . I panicked when I could no longer find them in the stores , and life was good again when I found them on Amazon !!! I know , that sounds a bit like &#34; over sell &#34; but , these little cloths are just so perfect for so many things
 Sooo happy to have found these again . Great product !!! Work just as well as I remembered . Thank you Chore Boy !
 I love this product and I do n't understand why it 's not available in most grocery stores . It 's the only thing that reliably cleans crusty pots and pans . So much better than steel wool or the inferior green rough sponges and similar products .
 My mom used these to wash her dishes and now I do . These squares of scrubbers are easy to hold and are the perfect tool to wash your dishes with . These scrubbers do n't hold a scent and are n't too harsh to you on your dishes . I love using these on pots and pans to get them really clean . They also work well for household cleaning to scrub at stains around the house .
 The product is quite good , but do n't overpay like I did . AG Industrial Supply LLC charged $ 5.99 for a two-pack . Now , I knew there were two pads in a box , but based on the $ 6 price , I assumed I was getting two boxes , not realizing I was being taken.My mistake , entirely . Hopefully , you get it at a much better price .
 The product came on time and as advertised , and it really works ! I have nothing but good things to say about the vendor and the product .
 These are the best scrubbers in the world . They last for a very long time and after they 've worn out for dishes and pots , I use them for all kinds of household chores .
 I have used this product for 15 + years and can not find it locally anymore so glad its available on line .
 Davidissimo is right . 1.99 at ACE HARDWARE . My sister just found them at Cooks Ace Hardware . She lives in Sacramento . The search is finally over for her !!
 I used these along time ago and could not find them anywhere . I then found them at my church when I was cleaning , and had a name to research . I looked on Amazon and there there were , they are great for all types of dishes and pots and pans . Do not scrub too hard on plastic as there will be scarring , but they clean and do not get smelly . Highly recommend . !!!!!
 I did a lot of research , and this product has the best ingredients , and the highest amounts of brown guggul . I have only been taking it about a week but I have lost about 3-4 pounds . It does n't contain any stimulant like caffeine , so I do n't get that jittery feeling . The suggested usage is 1-2 capusules twice a day , the bottle does n't say whether to take before or after you eat , but I take it before breakfast after my morning coffee . And I have no nausea or anything . I take 2 capsules twice a day , it does raise your body temperature , and has increased my metabolism . I have n't changed my diet or exercised and its working . I will be ordering this again when I run out . And this company had speedy delivery , I received my order within 3 days .
 This product was suggested to help with low thyroid -- and `` cold body syndrome '' which is related to low thyroid.My morning temperature was often 96 degrees or lower . Within one half hour of taking this guggul , my temperature was up to 97 or 98 and stayed there for about 4 hours . Increased metabolism is giving me more energy and I am losing weight.This brand seems to be working better than the other brand I took for a while .
 I have only been using this product a week . I did research like the person above . A trainer said it was n't effective alone but put with a thermogenic there was a slight increased effect . I also read that it was better at the thyroid than the fat loss.I have been taking it with cayenne fruit -LRB- supposed metabolism support -RRB- and I can say that together Ive felt an increase in heat , like Im sitting right now feeling warmer . I just ate and I think that helps . I take the guggul -LRB- 1 -RRB- at night before bed but Im not sure if that does anything , and I ca n't say that Ive lost any fat in this first week . Im also taking Fast Action Hoodia Diet by Irwin Naturals which is great to stop hunger and it has a high caffiene so along with the guggul I hope eventually after taking all three and intense exercise it all works.I think though I would by the NOW version of the guggul , it 's slightly cheaper and I think there might be more count per bottle , but Id have to do research.This is a good product but I would try to put it with another thermo , like cayenne fruit which is a cheap -LRB- 3-5 $ for 90 -RRB- no stimulant natural product , just a thought .
 This product is amazing ! I have maybe been on it a week with only small changes to my diet thus far and I am seeing amazing results already . Losing weight in all areas ! Highly recommended , if you drink too much coffee however , your heart pumps stronger so be aware if you are put off by that feeling . I have noticed this feeling lessen as I take more days of the pill . I take 2 in the morning , 2 in the afternoon . Definitely increasing your water intake is vital to helping you lose weight with this pill as metabolism needs water to function , simply stated obviously . Good luck and I highly recommend this product ! Just ordered more of it today !
 My temperature had been below 96 degrees and I was having a hard time losing weight . After looking at Dr. Oz 's page , I found out about Guggul and did my research and decided to give this product a try ... WELL my temperature is now between 97-98 degrees and I have lost 4 pounds and it 's been a week since I started taking it . Very pleased with the results so far . I have added Ginger tea and cayenne pills to the mix as well and made some adjustments to my diet based on some information I found on Dz . Oz 's page . The delivery was very fast too !
 Been taking this for about a month now . 2 caps twice a day . Seems to be reducing my cystic acne . No differance in oil production though if thats what you looking for
 Kind of weird writing a review for panty liners ... hah ! But , these are seriously awesome.They do the job they were intended to do and let 's leave it at that. : -RRB-
 This eyeglass repair case came just like advrtzd much better than what you can find at local wal-g or wal-m . I needed a nose pad not found in most kits . It came in the mail 10 min later new nose pad problem solved . Plenty hardware to fix most missing screw problems , worth the money .
 The sunglass repair kit actually works with prescription glasses too . My 7 year old 's glasses needed a new silicone nose pad , but I did n't want to go to the optometrist to have it replaced because of the hassle it would be . This kit had the nose pads , plus bunches of screws and the tiny screwdrivers -LRB- both phillips head and flat head -RRB- . I wish though that it came with a description of the different pieces in the kit .
 This kit has all the tools you 'll need for a simple repair . The biggest issue is that the screws will get jumbled and are easy to lose -LRB- including under the plastic -RRB- . Other than a little digging through for matches this kit has everything you need including hard to find matching screws !
 Love the this , have a wide varitey of screws for any kind of glasses . Would reommend to everyone who needs screws for glasses .
 When my Gucci sunglasses lost a screw , I looked everywhere for a gold screw that would fit . Without success , I opted for this case due to the various sizes . The price is right and it has all different sizes as well as the tools needed to fix your sunglasses or glasses yourself . My sunglasses are still doing good with the replacement screw and I 'm glad I have this kit in handy in case I need to do another repair . Be warned , when you get the kit , the screws are all over the place , which is inevitable . You are going to have to sort through the screws and put them in the right compartment .
 i didnt get chance to use it cause my kid threw everthing on the floor couldnt find most picesbut looked like it was a good item . . : -RRB-
 I 'd like to see this on stage , this performance certainly enhanced my interest in this work .
 Worked great . I found the screw I needed , and in fact multiple copies of it , including an even better fit than the original -LRB- slightly longer , making it harder to come out again -RRB- . I did n't need the mini screwdriver but it was a nice touch . The seller delivered the kit in time and in good condition .
 Although handy the box could have a better way to hold in place all the useful screws . Overall it is great purchase .
 Kit has a lot if parts . Some are great for certain glasses , others are too small . Would be great if half the kit was full of larger screws .
 Everything you need to fix your glasses . Nice kit . Do n't buy the cheap-o 2 dollar kits , you 'll still be left with broken shades . Indulge -LRB- haha -RRB- in the 6 dollar kit and you 'll be right as rain .
 This repair kit has an excellent selection of lots of various screw sizes and had just what I wanted for my glasses . The cost was not expensive and delivery was fast . I have to use a walker or scooter so going to the store to fix my glasses would have been a big chore . This kit enabled me to do everything at home quickly .
 This kit has everything you would ever need to repair a pair of glasses from screws to nose padsI received the kit real fast in about 3 days I was surprised at how many screws there were the screwdriver is easy to use and the nose pads so many this was better then described on amazon store page
 This is an excellent product for my needs I could n't find anything like this anywhere else in New York City
 Comprehensive Sunglass repair Kit . It includes 5-6 types of screws and Nuts of different sizes which helps to get best fit to your sunglasses . I did n't get any `` buyers remorse '' after purchasing this item ! :-RRB- Very Good Product .
 Every household should own one of these kits . This is the most complete eyeglass repair kit I 've ever come across . BUY THIS ONE !
 After my Gucci sunglasses lost the part that holds the screw I could not find a tool kit that coantain the part and I did n't want to throw my glasses away . I am so glad I found this kit in Amazon . Not only did it have the part I need it , it also has a small screw that attaches to your keychain so you can have with you at all times just in case your sunglasses get loose .
 I have some really nice reading glasses around that still have glass lenses in them . I plan on keeping them as long as my eyes do n't deteriorate more , -LRB- which they have n't in over 20 years -RRB- . That means nursing them for as long as possible with repairs and replacement parts . This kit looks to be as good as it gets here on Amazon , -LRB- and definitely superior to what I can find locally in stores -RRB- . The screw driver is of a nice furled design that opens up and has both a slotted and phillips head on either end , and a fitting that holds the little nuts as well . It holds and turns the screws as easily as possible in dealing with ones so small . In fact I have never used such a small screwdriver that had a phillips head that fit so tightly into the screws on my glasses . It 's been a perfect fit on all the ones I have used it on so far . As far as this kits variety trust me when I tell you that no matter what kind of hardware combo you have , there is a replacement one in this set . Most of the screws are slotted , but others have a solid head that utilizes a pressure system for those repairs that are either hard to fit , or where the screw slots have just been worn over time . I really do n't know how well they work for I have not as of yet had any need for them . But I know that they will be a good last resort repair if all else fails , and also know that the slotted screws can easily be stripped at times no matter how careful we are . Also , for what it 's worth I did not have the problem with all the little pieces being strewn about upon arrival like so many other reviewers here have complained about . Perhaps by this date they have read enough of the reviews themselves and learned to just seal the case for shipping like mine was . Or maybe I just got lucky . In any event , all parts arrived intact and where they were supposed to be.In conclusion , these kits are pretty scarce in stores , and usually one has little choice in the matter as to the brand and size , etc. . Even on Amazon there is not a large selection of them to write home about . Trust me when I tell you this is the most complete , and as good as it gets for repairs without dropping your glasses off at a shop . Great set , good price , and highly recommended ...
 This kit contains the special washer to repair my Gucci sunglasses -LRB- GG 2681 -RRB- . I have been trying to fix them for a few years with no luck until now . This kit is worth 10 times more than what I paid , it would have cost me a fortune to have Gucci repair them . Almost like buying the sunglasses twice ! In addition to the washer I needed this kit contains several screws of multiple sizes , washers , nuts , nose pieces , and the mini screwdriver tool to make it all work . This kit is a must have , Gucci sunglasses or not , it has it ALL.Thank you , Seanaroo
 Just what you need at home to replace those lost little screws from your different eyeglasses . It has some nose pieces and some nuts and plastic washers that may come handy too . A delicate arrangemente of parts that include ` friction tightening screws ' too , though I prefer to match the slot . One little piece of advice
 I recently uncovered my 5-6 year old pair of Oakley ` Why 8 ' wire-framed sunglasses that I had not seen since I lost a screw holding the earpiece to the lens . I bought another pair of glasses and sent these to the scrap pile thinking that would be the last that I would see of them . I misplaced my newer glasses one day and did not have a backup , only finding my broken pair . I took my old pair of glasses to the Oakley store and they were no help . They told me they could not fix it in store and would have to send it away ... sounds like a way to make some more money to me . The guy at the store did advise me that I could probably go to a regular eyeglass store and get them fixed . When he told me this , I realized I should have just fixed them myself from the beginning and looked to Amazon for an eyeglass repair kit with an assortment of screws . I was able to narrow down a few candidates for a replacement screw and simply replaced the missing screw and fixed my $ 200 + pair of sunglasses . The head of the screw I chose is a bit smaller than the original , but as far as I am concerned it makes no difference.One minor issue
 I lost a tiny nut from my eyeglasses and it seems the optical stores I went to did n't have a replacement . I saw this online and decided to try it and was very happy to find that in the assortment of screws and nuts , I found just the right size to fit . Not only that , the supplied tool that came with the tiny nuts and screws also was a bit help in the installation . Very happy with this purchase !
 I 'm rough on my glasses . Both nose rests came off . All parts and screws are here . The repair kit at the grocery store is useless . NB
 This product was far superior to other brands costing much more . Fast service as well ! Would buy from them again .
 The kit arrived and it does indeed have pretty much every little piece you might need . There was some jumbling of the contents and the little screws had escaped from their separate boxes , so things were mixed up . The tiny screwdriver tool worked , I was able to repair a pair of reading glasses and so 4 stars . The price is OK too .
 I bought this kit for the same reason a few others have mentioned
 I ordered this kit but received an incomplete set . Needless to say , I was very disappointed and let the seller know my displeasure . The seller promptly apologized and immediately shipped out a replacement kit . The product is what I needed , and the customer service was exemplary . I docked one star for the inconvenience of having to wait for the replacement kit , but otherwise , I am a happy camper .
 This is a good little kit that can be carried without too muct trouble . It cotains a nice veriety of parts to repair most any problem . There are n't a lot of unecessary parts to choose from but there is a good variety of parts normaly used .
 At this price order two & keep one in your travel kit . Everything you need for emergency repairs and even upgrades .
 What a great kit . It has everything you need for repairing glasses including those little-bitty nuts and wrench . This kit has really extended the life of both my reading and sunglasses .
 If you have designer glasses like Gucci or others this is the repair kit that has hardware to repair them . Great kit at a great price .
 I have a few very expensive pairs of sunglasses -LRB- wo n't buy expensive ones ever again -RRB- and this kit was exactly what I needed to tighten the screws that are constantly coming loose or falling out . Everytime I needed a repair it was $ 5 - $ 10 but with this kit , I do it myself and that was worth the money !
 One of my screw-on nose pads broke off of my glasses & I couldnt find a kit in any store that had the screw-on nose pads included so I took to Amazon -- and found this great kit.It an awesome little kit that has 4 screw-on nose pads , a screw driver w/both straight & phillips heads on either end , plastic washers , metal nuts , several different types & sizes of screws -LRB- with at least 4 of each type/size -RRB- , & some plastic end caps.Mine is different from the pic as I did not get a carrying cloth with mine & my case is clear with a black tray instead of white.The only things that would make this better would be a case where the cover is flush against the body so the screws , etc dont move around inside & a screw driver with a magnetic tip for dealing w/teeny-tiny screws -- but those 2 things didnt take away from the kit , imo , they just would have * added * to it.I 'll post pics of mine .
 The kit had what I needed to repair my glasses , including tools . The only thing missing that I could see would be longer screws used to retain the nose pads -LRB- I was able to reuse the existing screws -RRB- . Other than that , the kit was quite acceptable .
 Was very pleased with this purchase.The eye glass repair kit was just what I needed and as advertised . Fast response and delivery .
 Nice product , it had lots of pieces for all type of repair . I found it helpful in trying to repair some old glasses that I needed to fix instead of getting new ones .
 Received my initial kit and one of the nose pieces was missing . Today I received additional parts for this kit ! I 'm very pleased with my purchase and would do business with this seller again and again ! It is very hard to find great customer service these days , but you will find it here !
 It arrived at a decent time and the package was small . Comes with all the parts to repair a glass . I had two missing screws and the screws fits really well . The only complains I have is that the nose pad with the hole is a little long but still fits well and when the package arrived the screws were out of the holes and all over the place , it was hard to tell which was paired with which .
 I Have yet to see a better sunglass/eyeglass repair kit than this one . I wish it had more of the little nuts because I ca n't find them anywhere and I need more ! I will just buy another kit . You can not beat this kit if you buy one of those cheapo ones from the drug store you are wasting your time !!!
 My 1.5 year old son 's favourite toy is eye-wear prespcription glasses and sunglasses -LRB- both mine and my wife 's -RRB- and as a result , we had a lot of lost nose pads and loose legs on our glasses . Also recently bought some Banana Plugs for my home theatre system speakers from Lowe 's and to my surprise they were the ones with the tiny screws in them , not the screw on type that I had bought from Amazon earlier ,24 k Gold Connector Banana Plugs , Open Screw Type 24 Pack -LRB- 12 Red , 12 Black -RRB- . I did not have a screwdriver that would fit the small screws on those , so I needed a small screw driver -LRB- was using a pen knife earlier to tighten and loose those screwes and it is pretty much a very frustrating job -RRB- . So I started my search on amazon for a small screw driver and then thought about why not buy a glass repair kit and kill two birds with one stone , and stumbled upon this kit . Also read reviews and checked many other kits , while reviewing this and decided on this one maninly because of the price and it looked like it had a lot of pieces in it . Got it last week and overall I 'm extremely happy with the kit , except for the fact that it is the worst packaging I have ever seen for small products like these . Everything was everywhere when i got the case and could n't figure out which one went where and the fact that these pieces all require a magnifying glass to see them better was n't helpful.But anyways apart from that it was a great buy and did the job wonderfully , both with our glasses and the banana jacks , the nose pads fit very well and i could find screws the right size for our glasses and the banana jacks -LRB- I had lost one of them on the carpet earlier when i was meddling with my pen knife -RRB- . Overall we are happy , but if you expect a neatly packaged product , they have a warnign on the picture or product description about the pieces shifting , so you should n't expect it , I did not but was shocked even with low expectations . My question to the manufacturer or seller is why , how difficult is it to have a box with a lid which has place holding indendations or some kind of pegs whic when closed would cover the small holes on the basde box and thereby prevent the tiny screws and nuts from scattering all over . I would imagine if you can get all these small stuff made wellm , then it should ` nt be too hard for you to figure out a way to package them better . Please do that and you would have had a 5 star review !
 Well put together cup . Perfect `` Big Cup '' that fits in those small truck cup holders .
 We all know that brushing our teeth is important . Yet , sometimes it can still feel like a chore when we 're rushed in the morning or ready to go to bed at night . Thus , the `` little things '' in teeth care products are often what make the difference between brushing sporadically vs. on a daily basis.For me , this toothpaste is `` the one '' for two reasons :1 . Great tasting . Likely because of the Scope , this toothpaste has a very pleasant taste . It is n't chalky or bland like other varieties I 've tried .2 . Feels fresh . I 'm not a dentist , so I ca n't tell you the exact ion formulation that produces this feeling and gets the teeth clean , but suffice it to say that my mouth just feels fresh after I brush with this paste.Here 's the way I view this product
 The product -LRB- if it is the same exact one -RRB- has Flaxseed meal , defatted chia bran , orange pulp and peel , gum arabic and inulin-FOS . No wheat , no gluten , no soybeans , no dairy , no egg , no fish/shellfish , no peanuts/tree nuts.The products works quickly and effectively . It calls for two -LRB- 2 -RRB- tablespoons . I took barely ONE tablespoon and it worked within a few hours . The Flaxseed meal releases oils , the defatted chia bran is a fairly aggressive fiber , but the orange pulp and peel , full of natural anti-oxidants and bioflavoids is a key ingredient . Orange pulp is a digestive stimulant and encourages and increased the soft muscle contractions of the intestines , thus encouraging the forward movement of the bowel content . Orange pulp and peel is used in chinese medicine for the same thing - increasing digestion among other things.The taste is slightly strong -LRB- slightly bitter due to the orange peel -RRB- and it is a lot easier to get down than psyllium . It does n't stick to your throat .
 Healthy thing to do . Check for GMOs however with the company . Easy to take , I mix it in with juice .
 this fiber mix is great - truly gentle . They used a mix of various ingredients plus added natural orange flavor .
 These little petals do just what they are meant to . They keep the foot from sliding forward in the shoe , which would have created pressure in areas of the foot that should not have pressure . Makes wearing even new shoew easy . I wear an 8.5 shoe and these are a perfect size to fit in the area behind toes , without showing when worn . It is also amazing how well they stick to the insole of the shoe . They are still in place on sandals I wore last summer and again this summer . They were put in when the shoes were new , so I 'm sure that helped them stick longer .
 The replacement battery cartridge arrived a day early , was in great condition , and contained APC batteries as described . As a busy Network Administrator , receiving the correct replacement part as described and a day early is the best case scenario . Thank you .
 Reason for 4 stars is that batteries are two different brands but at 3 months they seem to be providing satisfactory service .
 I have purchased several of these battery packs and I am pleased with the quality of the item and the cost . They do not use original APC batteries but they seem to work well . Batteries are from different manufacturers and can both be different in the same unit . This is the only reason I did n't give 5 stars -LRB- the picture shows the original batteries from APC -RRB- . So far , so good !
 I rarely write reviews of products , but was prompted to do so for this one . I 'll start of by simply saying that it 's a great product . If you do n't read any more of this , that 's all you need to know . If you 're like me and really do n't like shaving , then go out and by some of it and you 'll figure out why it makes an otherwise tedious and potentially painful task , smooth and easy . I have sensitive skin and was prone to in-grown hairs due to those ` lift-and-cut ' style razors with ten thousand blades . Sure they give you a smooth and easy shave , but they also can be terrible for your skin . After switching to an old school safety razor with a single blade , I was having trouble finding a good shaving cream that gave the same smooth , easy shave . I tried several products and finally settled on this one after receiving a shave from my barber . This is what she used and it was great . Have n't looked back since . Sure it 's only 4 oz , but you really do n't need much to get that painless , smooth shave you 're looking for . Notice how many times I 've said ` smooth ' in this review ? Hint , hint .
 These things are great ! Helps relieve neck and shoulder pain and smells wonderful . Money well invested .
 I purchased the Large NeckEase by BodySense for my husband and the Sinus Pillow for myself and let me tell you , I can only say I wish I 'd gotten them sooner ! We both go to the Chiropractor and have the Mediflow Waterbased pillows -LRB- see my review for those and the pillow case -RRB- but the addition of these 2 items was a great investment . We both suffer from neck and back pain and arthritis so we have tried many different things to help ease our pain and discomfort.My husband has used the NeckEase several times already and I used it the other night ... heated it in the micro , wrapped it around my neck and climbed into bed for the night . Was very comfortable laying there with my head on my Mediflow Waterbased pillow and before I knew it I was fast asleep!I 've used the Sinus Pillow twice now . We live in West TN and this time of year we can have some crazy weather - in the 70s one day and down to the 40s the next . This weather wreaks havoc on my sinuses , causing me lots of sinus pain and pressure and some pretty strong and painful , pounding headaches . I just heat my Sinus Pillow in the micro for the recommended time , lay down and place it over my eyes and nose and once again , it 's not long until I 'm fast asleep . Now , I 'm not going to say it took my headache away completely each time , but it sure does relieve the sinus pressure and greatly reduces the pounding pain in my head so that I can relax and fall asleep quite easily . The various scents given off from each pillow is wonderful and very soothing.I would recommend both of these products and look forward to using them for years . And after reading the reviews of the BodySense Large Pack and Extra Large Pack I am putting those on my wishlist for purchase of one or both in the very near future !
 ... another awesome product by BodySense ! So comfortable , warm and soft while warming and comforting my arthritic neck . It is a great product and I recommend it to EVERYONE . Heats nicely in the miocrowave -LRB- start with a 1 minute increment , then remove from microwave oven , shake , and replace to keep pellets/rice/herbs within from getting too hot and melting the outer cover . -RRB- This is the second one I have had . They last a very long time and really work well ! Definitely a quality product that I will continue to use for a very long time . Also works on other specific pains where heat is required to feel better .
 The large NeckEase is a fabulous product ! It holds the heat as advertised and hugs the neck and shoulders comfortably . I would definitely recommend this product .
 I already had this item and purchased one for my daughter-in-law . She loves it ! Service from provider was excellent !
 For many years this amazing invention has been a lifesaver for me . When my neck , or any other area , starts tocause me problems , I grab my neckease . put it into the microwave , and within minutes I 'm on the way to feelingmuch better . I do n't remember how many years I 've had it , so that in itself tells that it 's been quite a few.Even if my neck is not misbehaving , sometimes it 's just comforting to have the warmth of it on dreary winterdays . A wonderful product , I highly recommend it.Grammy
 The NeckEase hot/cold pillow is wonderful . Microwave it for less than 3 minutes and you are left with one hour of warm , soothing neck relief . I bought a second as a gift and they really enjoy theirs too . Highly recommend wearing while watching TV or a late night movie at home.ps . The item arrived in its own packaging with instructions and a very nice hand written note of appreciation . This seller is the real deal !!!
 This long-lasting aromatherapy hot/cold pack will literally last for 10 years or more . The investment in your health and comfort level is well worth the price . The polar fleece cover makes this warm and cozy , while the black cloth on the other side makes this pack radiate cold better when the pack is put in the freezer . So , you can use this in the winter or summer or anytime heat/cold is needed.To heat , put in the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes . To cool , keep in freezer until needed . You may want to put this in a plastic bag first if storing in the freezer.Over the years , the aromatic spices and herbs seem to retain their scent and the rice never seems to dry out , which is quite amazing.Ingredients
 Very nicely constructed , and the service from the seller was truly rare in it 's excellence and personally professionaly touch.The zafu was a tiny bit smaller than I expected , but it was exactly what it should have been . It was my expectation that was off . Great item .
 Wonderful ingredients , super moisturizer , and beautiful fragrance . Reminds me of hikes through a botanical garden in the tropical forests of Maui ! I loved the heavenly fragrance of the white ginger plants . This brings me right back to those gardens and the scent of those lovely blossoms ! I use this oil instead of lotion and it absorbs and moisturizers nicely .
 I love this stuff ! I first bought in Hawaii and it made my skin feel and smell so wonderful . So I bought it online to bring me back to those great hawaii memories when I cant be there in person !
 I first bought this oil while visiting Hawaii.I love it.I 'm glad I can buy it now at home . When I use it it 's like being in the Islands .
 This glucose meter markedly improves the process of checking blood sugars . The drum is preloaded with 17 test strips . Just turn it on and a strip drops into place , turn it off and it releases into a sharps container . Especially useful for older folks with poor eyesight , tremors , or coordination issues . The softclix lancets are especially nice . Virtually no discomfort from the puncture . The device stores readings for a physician or an aid to check and record for future reference . With different settings , it can be used on the forearm , but I have n't tried that since the finger puncture is pain free and as a pre - diabetic , I do n't check my sugar that often .
 I trust the Crest name and the fact that `` rejuvinating '' is in the title , makes me feel good
 I 've been using EPO on the advice of Court Street Midwives , Plymouth , MA , the BEST OB-GYN care I 've ever had , since they guessed I might be peri-menipausal . They said whether or not , it was strongly recommended taking these twice a day indefinitely in lieu of taking hormones which have always been bad for me and chances they are bad for you too . My body is in GREAT shape , I look younger than ever , feel good and have no post symptoms of `` the change '' or side effects . Remember this is an all natural alternative . Do yourself a HUGE favor and buy these and be diligent to them everyday - you 'll look and feel GREAT for it ! -LRB- Start with 500 mg and ease up to 1300 - do n't miss any !! Take with Vitamin ACE & D per doctor 's orders AND Omega 3-6-9 -RRB- .
 Primrose oil is excellent for peri-menopausal symptoms . I was experiencing the beginning of hot flashes and an irregular heartbeat -LRB- a little known symptom of menopause -RRB- . Within a week of taking primrose oil the hot flashes ceased . Soon after , I no longer had the irregular heartbeat . A side benefit is I no longer have cramps during my period !! I wish I had known about this long ago!Highly recommended for peri-menopausal symptoms - an excellent and simple solution in the maze of peri-menopausal products . Note
 If you have bad periods ... . this will help tremendously !!!! Plus it really helps give your skin a glow ! I used it for years but quit once I got pregnant . My daughter is 3 and I finally got sick of having terrible cramps and mood swings every month so I started back on this ! It is a good product ! I have only used this brand and one other and they both seemed to do the job equally . This one is a little cheaper and more potent!Good for us girls !
 As a recent breast cancer survivor , I lived with a difficult and stressful problem , hot flashes - or as we callthem , `` power surges '' . A good friend and mamography tech suggested trying evening primrose oil . She specificallysuggested NOW SUPER PRIMROSE 13MG SOFTGELS . After researching this on Consumer Lab -LRB- a testing facility forherbal remedies -RRB- I found that NOW SUPER PRIMRPOSE 13MG SOFTGELS had been tested and approved by them . I looked for the NOW brand and found it on my Amazon link and ordered them . My friend had specifically told me to use the NOW brand and to take two in the morning and two in the evening for the first week . Then for the second week take one in the morning and one in the evening and continue this from then on . She also told me to not get discouraged if they did n't work right away . I followed her schedule and had some relief the first week andthe second week most of the nightly rolling power surges stopped . PHEW !! Now , a month later , I only havea few during the day , usually when I 'm stressed , and no longer have any of the rolling-power-surges at night . When I told my MD at my six-month checkup a week ago what I was doing ... he said , `` Jennie -LRB- his Physician 's Assistant -RRB- has been recommending evening primrose oil to her patients for hot flashes and they seem to work '' . I kiddingly told him that it 's too bad I was n't seeing her instead of him . He laughed!Nothing else worked for me and was very please to be able to order them from Amazon -LRB- I also order my Omega 3 capsules from Amazon -RRB- ... I hope you 'll try them and find the same relief I found .
 I turned 50 in February ! I did n't know that some months later I would be bombarded with hot flashes . The hot flashes have made my life miserable and almost unbearable . Taking hormones are not an option for me ; so I got on line to see what I could possibly take that was natural , that might help . While visiting Amazon site , I came across the NOW FOODS SUPER PRIMROSE . I read the reviews and decided to try them . Let me make it very clear that I do n't write reviews , but I do read them . This product forced me to write this review in an effort to help some other women who are experiencing the hot flashes . I started using them exactly 18 days ago . My hot flashes have decreased substantially . I take two in the morning and two in the evening and feel like myself again . My plan is to do this for another week and then reduce to two soft gels per day . Otherwise , I will have to purchase a bottle per month . Ladies , they have helped me so much ! I still have some hot flashes but not nearly as frequent or severe . It 's worth a try if you are as miserable as I was ! Now , I do n't always look like someone has thrown a bucket of water on me . LOLSigned , SINCERELY GRATEFUL FOR THIS PRODUCT
 I was looking for a higher mg Primrose Oil and chose this one . Because of the higher mg I was expecting a larger sized pill , but these are huge ! As a person who has trouble swallowing pills this was a bit disappointing . They are soft however so they 're not terrible to swallow , trying not to scare anyone away from taking these just be warned for those of us who do n't like taking pills that these are quite large .
 My midwife suggested evening primrose oil in order to help soften my cervix when I was 36 weeks pregnanat . Worked great after just two weeks . This particular brand worked well for me and the capsule dissolves completely .
 I like the product . I have used others and this one seems to work the best so far . would recomend
 I use these softgels in conjunction with other products to help with hot flashes . They seem to work just fine . I tried using a lesser mg of another brand Evening Primrose Oil but found they were not helpful . I need the 1300mg once per day .
 I had used primrose oil in the past , as it is very good for women health I 'm using it again . Now 's primrose is Hexane free and has a high potency , that makes it a very good choice .
 I ca n't say enough great things about this product ! I order super primrose because I was having trouble with my skin and joints . My skin has completely cleared up and I am free of joint pain . Great product !
 The Pills are gel caps a lil larger than i thought they would be , but i bought this to clear up acne and control pms symptoms and so far i love it and my skin is looking amazing after only 3 days so i would reccomend this to every one also a plus my cervical mucus is back i was dry before so i just love this product
 I ordered this item for my sister and she was pleased with it . It arrived quickly and in good condition . I would certainly use this company again . Grace
 nice oil for women - ca n't see much difference but sure looks large and in a great quantity - I 'm sure it is helping on some level I am no aware of yet - highest mg I 've seen out there - NOW seems a good company from the products I 've had so far .
 This product was exactly what I expected when I received in in the mail and matched the description on the website
 Helps reduce menstrual cramps when taken daily . Large softgels , little taste if broken open . Great supplement for women or men .
 The reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse , it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise . Nowadays , the world we live in -- we affluent , industrialized citizens , with perfection the expectation -- the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be . You will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations , my expectations , have gone through the roof . The secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the secret to happiness is low expectations .
 I bought these based on the reviews . The pills have no offensive odor and have not caused stomach upset . Although the pills are quite large , they were not overly difficult to swallow . I will continue to purchase this brand .
 I purchased these hoping to balance my swinging moods and night sweats . I 've taken these for about two weeks and I notice I am sleeping better and seem a little more at ease . I have n't really noticed if I break out sweating at night still yet but , the biggest noticeable result is my finger nails ! I am a life long nail biter and within this short time I 've grown a pretty strong healthy set of nails . Very nice affect . I 've increased my dose to twice daily and I will purchase these again !
 The evidence is not yet in whether these are doing anything for me , but it is supposed to take up to six months so I am patiently waiting . In the meantime , I can say that the price is right compared to other retail suppliers ' formulations and that delivery has been prompt and reliable .
 This stuff really helps improve your CM if you need a little help in that area . I 'm on Clomid which unfortunately dries you out and I had heard of EPO on a forum I frequent . I took one pill with my mother meds after dinner and could already see an improvement by that night . The next day my CM was creamy , and without the EPO I would have been dry or sticky at best . By the third day I was borderline wet/creamy . I 'm only on CD6 now and did n't ovulate until CD20 last cycle so I imagine by the time I need fertile CM it wo n't be an issue .
 I honestly forgot why I ordered these , but Dr. Oz said they were fantastic for something , so I thought I would give them a try . The softgels are rather large , but I do n't have trouble taking them . I will update my review if they do something life changing : -RRB-

 I bought this product as a gift for a fussy relative who has everything and is very difficult to please . She loved it ! Worth every penny .
 The quality and delivery of this product is very good . It works as well as the scotchgard brand and much much less in cost .
 I first heard of eleuthero as being an herb that can relieve joint pain . A lifetime of athletics and skiing has left my knees in something of a less than ideal state . So , I found a product here at Amazon called Good Earth `` Ginseng Green Tea '' with eleuthero -LRB- aka Siberian Ginseng -RRB- . The tea helped . Within a few days , I experienced a little less swelling in my knees , much less pain , and greater agility.Thereafter , I sought a stronger source of eleuthero , and let me tell you , they abound on the internet . However , I wanted eleuthero in veggie caps . I do n't eat meat , and most pills are bound with gelatin or sold in gelatin capsules . Gelatin , like the product Jell-o , consists mostly of what 's left of an animal below the knees . The butcher grinds that up , cooks it , and there you have it
 I suffer from CFS and feel tired all day . Ever since taking Eleuthero Root twice a day , between meals , I feel a lot better ! Stuff really works ! Very good product and I 'll be buying again .
 this is siberian gensing and the quality of this product is supreme . I take one capsule and i have too much energy to spend . I was looking for something reduce fatigue and my inability to wake up in the morning.This product gives me so much energy to the point that it is too much . I ca n't take it everyday bec it make me sleep less than 5 hours per day and the rest of the day i feel like i am on speed . It is very good for studying and physical effort or hectic days .
 I 've used these for years as I 'm prone to carpal tunnel syndrome . These support gloves are comfortable and flexible and help anyone who has to do a lot of repetitive motion activity like typing . They wash up pretty well , too . I would not hesitate to recommend these to anyone who does a lot of typing or fine needlework or anything of that nature .
 This glove was recommended by a neurosurgeon for my mild to moderate carpel tunnel . I wear them at night while sleeping and when I am doing activities that might aggravate the wrist . They have been very helpful in my case .
 My mother who is 90 and suffers from arthritis recently went to the ER with pain in her right arm . When she left there they had given her a bulky brace which made it very difficult to do for herself at home . After the healing process of a couple weeks , I got her these and she was amazed at how she can have the support but with the open fingers still able to do everything she needs to do , even sew ! I would recommend these to anyone needing wrist support . The small size was great too , as most others come in only med . and large .
 I have tendonitis in my hand that 's probably caused by writing too much and pressing too hard on the paper . I have to routinely grade many papers , so writing a lot is necessary . During those times , the tendonitis in my hand gets pretty bad , it 's painful to even hold a fork , and on the worst days I can feel it all the time even when I 'm not holding something.I 've tried many things -- more ergonomic set-ups , different kids of pens , other braces , hand stretches , but this has worked best of all . It allows full hand motion unlike the thick braces.Perhaps I 'm lucky that my hand size is good for this glove/brace . It puts a good amount of pressure on my palms . I 'm unfamiliar with the biology behind the pain , but that `` squeeze '' seems to work , especially when combined with a little Icy Hot balm -LRB- do n't use the cream or gel with it as it 's too messy -RRB- . The glove is stretchy and could probably accommodate a range of hand sizes , but I imagine that if your hand is too small or exactly in the middle of two sizes , it might not work well . Give it a try though.The only complaint I have is that the part in between the index finger and palm has a tendency to stretch and become thinner , even if the rest of the glove/brace does n't stretch that much . As a result , you will have to replace your glove regularly if you use it often.Still , the price of the glove is nothing compared to the benefits that it brings and the ability it 's given me to grade so many papers without pain .
 Although this product did not meet MY needs , it certainly would meet the needs for someone who needs functional joint support in their thumb , wrist , and index finger . It provides just the right amount of compression to make your hand actually FEEL better.Unfortunately for me , I need support for all of my fingers - which is why I did n't purchase this product.The only cons to this product are that it is n't sold in pairs , and the Velcro is so sticky that it was a struggle to get it off.You should try on the product at a store before buying it , so that you can be sure that the size it right . -LRB- Not too tight , and not too loose -RRB- . When wearing it , you should only feel the same amount of compression that you would when sticking your hand into a deep bucket of water.Being a slightly petite teenager , the Small one fit me perfectly .
 My drug store no longer had this essential type of wrist support . I immediately thought of Amazon and was fortunate there was a link to Futuro and the exact support I needed .
 My wife recently purchased 2 types of wrist support devices . One for rigerous activity -LRB- like yoga -RRB- and one for other things like knitting - which she does a lot !! The Wellgate for aggressive / weight bearing activity and the Futuro for knitting . The Futuro works great for her knitting and other fine work requiring extensive use of the fingers . It is supportive , provides warmth and relief , yet permits the full range of motion and use of fingers required in knitting . She would whole heartedly recommend to anyone for this kind of application . Note she does not recommend if you are looking for extensive wrist support .
 I love this product I work on the computer 5 days a week 8 hrs a day and I get wrist fatigue . This has helped tremendously !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 These feel great . I have a set at work and one at home . Whenever I 'm sitting at my desk I roll them around under my feet . They 're a little stiffer than ones I 've had before which is nice - I can press as hard as I want and they do n't cave in on me . They 've helped my poor feet feel better during and after a long day.Another product I really like that you might look at : Rosallini Compact Foot Care Relax Plastic Roller Massager Pink White
 I can not stress enough how good this feels on your feet . I tried it at my friends house and it literally changed my day . Its sooooo cheap so it seems fishy but I swear get one and youll be posting a comment here too .
 Although I did n't read the details about the size ... wishing to have a larger ball for stretching my back , these balls are great for my neck . They are sturdy ; they came quickly , and I have no complaints .
 I was hesitant to buy these online without being able to see/touch them , but I 'm so glad I took a chance -- they are exactly what I need to get into painful areas on my back , and I even carry them with me to places like movie theaters when I know I 'll be sitting for a long time and leaning back on one or both of these gives me a lot of relief . They are a good size , and exactly the right firmness . I 've had physical therapists suggest using a tennis ball for the same purpose , but tennis balls have never &#34; dug in &#34; the way these balls can because of the little spikes . If you have back or foot or anywhere pain that is relieved by massage/pressure , buy these !
 I got these to use to massage my feet at the end of the long work day ... they are great , not too hard or sharp , just the right texture , esp for the arch . If have ticklish feet , try first while wearing socks to get used to it . I also keep one on my desk near my keyboard , feels great to massage my palms intermittently while working on the computer .
 I 'd like a hundred of these to pass out to friends and family . Every person should have at least two . You can put them in a sheer hosiery sock -LRB- one that wo n't easily run -RRB- and then lay on them . Wonderful !
 I bought a couple of these so I could use them at home , office and pack one for travel . Really refreshes feet after a long day or a strong workout . Not too pointy , just right to stimulate a tired foot or use during pedicure/home spa . Packs easily and is just the right thing at the end of an active vacation day with lots of walking/hiking - or after you kick off the high heels .
 Awesoma for back masages , feet massages.Balls looks exactly as seller shows in picture.Very nice prroduct for release stress .
 These are great on your feet , back , legs ... anywhere ! You can put two in a sock or grocery bags and roll them around on your back . I have had one tear open , but it 's still functional .
 Wonderful ingredients , super moisturizer , and beautiful fragrance . Reminds me of hikes through a botanical garden in the tropical forests of Maui ! I loved the heavenly fragrance of the white ginger plants . This brings me right back to those gardens and the scent of those lovely blossoms ! I use this oil instead of lotion and it absorbs and moisturizers nicely .
 I love this stuff ! I first bought in Hawaii and it made my skin feel and smell so wonderful . So I bought it online to bring me back to those great hawaii memories when I cant be there in person !
 I first bought this oil while visiting Hawaii.I love it.I 'm glad I can buy it now at home . When I use it it 's like being in the Islands .
 This is a good toothbrush ! It 's much better than a manual toothbrush . My Sonicare broke and while I was replacing it I went back to using the Crest spinbrush . It brushed my teeth well . It did not hurt my gums or my sensitive teeth . It stimulates and cleans my gums and gets my whole mouth clean . I make sure and use a good sensitive toothpaste and it works well . My last dental cleaning went well and all I had been using was the spinbrush . I use my rinses and floss daily but I think the spinbrush did most of the work . I wish it had a little timer on it . I have to guess how long to brush . You do have to replace the batteries kind of often and changing the brush heads is kind of difficult .
 So far so good ! This toothbrush is just as good . My last toothbrush lasted for 5 years and is still working well .
 This tastes and smells amazing , like Nutella ! The texture is great , very smooth . And the ingredients are all good for you . I do n't know why the ingredients are n't listed here ; I think it would be a great selling point . The ingredients for all of the flavors are listed on the Ganache for Lips website , -LSB- ... -RSB-
 I first received a tube as a gift , and I quickly fell in love with the product ! I used to use ChapStick , Blistex , Carmex , etc. but I love the feel of this so much more . I have also used the Chocolate Mousse and Chocolate Mint flavors , which are fine , but I ca n't get past my love for the Chocolate Hazelnut . I have a tube in the bathroom for after I brush my teeth , one in my purse for re-application throughout the day , and one in my nightstand for before bed . It keeps your lips extra-moist without the antiseptic odor of some other products.The only thing I do n't like is that there is no SPF , but that 's not a huge deal for me because I 'm hardly ever outside for any length of time.Enjoy !
 These things are great ! Helps relieve neck and shoulder pain and smells wonderful . Money well invested .
 I purchased the Large NeckEase by BodySense for my husband and the Sinus Pillow for myself and let me tell you , I can only say I wish I 'd gotten them sooner ! We both go to the Chiropractor and have the Mediflow Waterbased pillows -LRB- see my review for those and the pillow case -RRB- but the addition of these 2 items was a great investment . We both suffer from neck and back pain and arthritis so we have tried many different things to help ease our pain and discomfort.My husband has used the NeckEase several times already and I used it the other night ... heated it in the micro , wrapped it around my neck and climbed into bed for the night . Was very comfortable laying there with my head on my Mediflow Waterbased pillow and before I knew it I was fast asleep!I 've used the Sinus Pillow twice now . We live in West TN and this time of year we can have some crazy weather - in the 70s one day and down to the 40s the next . This weather wreaks havoc on my sinuses , causing me lots of sinus pain and pressure and some pretty strong and painful , pounding headaches . I just heat my Sinus Pillow in the micro for the recommended time , lay down and place it over my eyes and nose and once again , it 's not long until I 'm fast asleep . Now , I 'm not going to say it took my headache away completely each time , but it sure does relieve the sinus pressure and greatly reduces the pounding pain in my head so that I can relax and fall asleep quite easily . The various scents given off from each pillow is wonderful and very soothing.I would recommend both of these products and look forward to using them for years . And after reading the reviews of the BodySense Large Pack and Extra Large Pack I am putting those on my wishlist for purchase of one or both in the very near future !
 ... another awesome product by BodySense ! So comfortable , warm and soft while warming and comforting my arthritic neck . It is a great product and I recommend it to EVERYONE . Heats nicely in the miocrowave -LRB- start with a 1 minute increment , then remove from microwave oven , shake , and replace to keep pellets/rice/herbs within from getting too hot and melting the outer cover . -RRB- This is the second one I have had . They last a very long time and really work well ! Definitely a quality product that I will continue to use for a very long time . Also works on other specific pains where heat is required to feel better .
 The large NeckEase is a fabulous product ! It holds the heat as advertised and hugs the neck and shoulders comfortably . I would definitely recommend this product .
 I already had this item and purchased one for my daughter-in-law . She loves it ! Service from provider was excellent !
 For many years this amazing invention has been a lifesaver for me . When my neck , or any other area , starts tocause me problems , I grab my neckease . put it into the microwave , and within minutes I 'm on the way to feelingmuch better . I do n't remember how many years I 've had it , so that in itself tells that it 's been quite a few.Even if my neck is not misbehaving , sometimes it 's just comforting to have the warmth of it on dreary winterdays . A wonderful product , I highly recommend it.Grammy
 The NeckEase hot/cold pillow is wonderful . Microwave it for less than 3 minutes and you are left with one hour of warm , soothing neck relief . I bought a second as a gift and they really enjoy theirs too . Highly recommend wearing while watching TV or a late night movie at home.ps . The item arrived in its own packaging with instructions and a very nice hand written note of appreciation . This seller is the real deal !!!
 This long-lasting aromatherapy hot/cold pack will literally last for 10 years or more . The investment in your health and comfort level is well worth the price . The polar fleece cover makes this warm and cozy , while the black cloth on the other side makes this pack radiate cold better when the pack is put in the freezer . So , you can use this in the winter or summer or anytime heat/cold is needed.To heat , put in the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes . To cool , keep in freezer until needed . You may want to put this in a plastic bag first if storing in the freezer.Over the years , the aromatic spices and herbs seem to retain their scent and the rice never seems to dry out , which is quite amazing.Ingredients
 take two of these compared to 4 gas-x and all is well . cheaper and less pills . this is a great product at a great price .
 Good product . Purchased the same once before so I knew what I was getting . If I can get something that works for me and pay half the cost of a famous name brand , I 'll certainly do it . Was shipped quickly as usual . What more can be said about this product , ahhh , not too much . Thanks amazon.com .
 This is a great product . Works quickly and is very inexpensive . One thing I would note is that it comes in a non-child lock container so be careful if you have kids in the house ! I plan to order again and is much cheaper hear than anywhere else I 've found .
 I use these 4 times a day so the money adds up and this is by far the lowest price I have found . If you are both poor and flatulent . . LOL . . this is the seller . Also faster shipping than previous seller .
 What a relief it was to find that this product works as good as the brand name Phazyme . Great savings , great product .
 I bought these in place of the name brand Phazyme , which is what I normally purchase . While these pills do work well if you have indigestion gas or minor gastric episodes , you will wait for relief a bit longer than you would with the name brand Phazyme pills.But these are still a good purchase esp . on your wallet if you do n't suffer from severe gastritis .
 This gas relief gel capsule actually works . Ive been taking it during meals and Ive only had very small amounts of gas . However I think the shipping was just about the same amount as the product ; but at least it works well .
 This product is fully recommended especially for those who have bought the `` rival product '' under a brand name . -LRB- I am one of those people -RRB- Look at the contents of both the name brand and this one . IDENTICAL ! They certainly work the same for my wife and IJohn ... Springfield OR .
 Great product ! This has the 100 % identical active ingredient as the brand names , such as Gas-X . And it works in the same very fast and effective way .
 This product worked better than Gas-X , Beano and Phazyme . Plus it is way cheaper . The strength -LRB- 180mg of simethicone -RRB- is not easy to find in stores . As someone who eats a lot of broccoli and lentils , I can tell you this product is a Godsend .
 I love that these have no mint flavor . My dog needs these for his stomach problems but the mint flavored ones he does n't like and then I have to wrestle him to take them . These hide in dog food and get eats them , none the wiser . Small enough too , that he just swallows them.I suspect they work well on humans too . : - -RRB-
 Good size , great price and it does what it is supposed to do . Works quickly and not side effects . I would definitely purchase again .
 This product is the same active ingredient as BEANO for a lower price . Not only would I buy it again , I recommend it to friends .
 Now that I 'm 88 and have been taking VIAGRA , testosterone , and ground tiger penis for years to enhance my jaded failed sense of my libido -LRB- with which myself is intimately bound up ... having no definition or self understanding beyond my sexual prowess -RRB- I finally came to need this product , as the river of piss which my John-Thomas spews forth , like a giant fire hose , was far too much for an adult diaper to contain.Hence
 This `` grabber '' is the best designed unit I 've ever purchased , and I 've had several different designs . I strongly recommend it for purchase by those having trouble stooping , bending , or reaching .
 Well constructed and designed . Needed something to help me do maintenance on our swimming pool since I have difficulty stooping or bending . This device is perfect to extract the skimmer basket from a standing position . Additionally , it firmly holds the water test apparatus so that I can get a water sample from the pool with stooping down or bending as well .
 On time and works great -- everyone that needs to get off a lawn mower to pickup track need one of these
 Being alpha-lipoic acid , I cant really say `` this product totally works '' , since it 's application is really only anecdotal . So I 'm giving this product 5 stars based on the fact that it does n't have any crap ingredients -LRB- like titanium dioxide that is in other ALA supplements on Amazon -RRB- its made in the good ol' USA , the capsules are small and easy to swallow , and it has specific instructions on how to use it for increasing the absorption of creatine , which is what I use it for . For more information on ALA and R-ALA , just search on google .
 I take to improve insulin sensitivity for my type 2 diabetics and dispose of excess glucose , allowing me to maintain healthier blood sugar levels . My A1C and daily readings `` seem '' better and my personal data collection supports same . Scientific evidence is still in question by many but I find it helpful for me .
 I think this is one of the better values for r-ALA . But the powder in my caps are slightly hard due to moisture/humidity getting into the caps . Not to big of a deal , ca n't roll out the hardness with my fingers . So had to use a few wacks with the back edge of a knife to break it up a bit so I could roll it out with my fingers.First time that happened , but various supplements are prone to humidity . Ca n't comment on its effectiveness ? Just going with the available online research . Seems like a good antioxidant .
 This is good stuff , but I 'm still iffy on major differences in the noticeable effects on the `` outside '' . I did great with NOW Foods ALA in regards to shifting fat off the parts of my body that I was exercising.With these types of products , one really has to be in tune to get the benefits . Some days , you just know that it 's not working and some days it feels like I 've wasted it ... I take it intermittently now . I 'm gaining some weight , but it does n't look bad - which I attribute to this product . I ca n't afford the others , which is what I 'm really getting at . I know that it 's helping the free radicals for sure .
 Bought this as a lower-cost alternative to Futuro 's `` Infinity '' knee support -LRB- see my review of that -RRB- . This is reasonably supportive , does the job I need it for , smaller -LRB- so it works better under clothes , etc -RRB- but less comfortable than the `` Infinity '' . Not as good kneecap stabilization , either . I use this for shorter and less vigorous workouts and sometimes normal day-to-day activities ; bends more easily than the larger support so more comfortable to sit . Pretty much stays in place -LRB- if you measure and get the right size ... -RRB- . Box says `` hand wash '' but I use washer/dryer cold/low and it seems fine . Latex rubber so those allergic need to beware .
 Much better than ACE knee braces . Lasting much longer . Collateral ligaments supports so so thought slightly better than Ace counterparts .
 These are the best . I 'm a folk dancer - lots of pivots & twists . Also , the flesh color makes them less obnoxious .
 Have searched for product and was unable to locate locally . Found on Amazon and am completely satisfied with product and delivery .
 This product is great . Your milk supply will increase just like promissed in 1 - 4 days . The only down side is the taste . I recommend positioning the dropper way at the back of the throat so you do n't taste it as much when you drop it in your mouth . After a little while , the taste does n't bother you as much . It really works , so I truely recommend it .
 This product definitely works . It did n't work as quickly as it said , but I would recommend it to anyone wanting to increase their milk supply .
 Noticed a significant increase in my milk supply once I started taking them . I have even cut back on the dosage because they worked so well !
 This product has considerably increased my milk production ! Its taste is strong , but it works . I will now try the version without alcohol . I hope it keeps working .
 My son was born quite large -LRB- 11 lbs 2 oz - and no , I was not diabetic -RRB- , and we struggled getting him to regain weight lost after birth . I have always strongly wanted to exclusively breastfeed him . We saw lactation consultants several times and by all accounts everything was fine - our son just would n't gain weight . At our two month checkup with our pediatrician , he was still below birth weight . Even though I did n't necessarily have a supply issue , our pro-breasfeeding pediatrician suggested I try MotherLove to see what happens . I bought the tincture and while the taste was shockingly unpleasant at first , I have definitely gotten used to it . I ca n't say that I noticed a HUGE increase in supply , but I did feel it made a difference . Four weeks later , we confirmed my suspicion with a weight check , and our son had gained 11 ounces in those four weeks . That 's more than the previous 8 weeks combined . It COULD be coincidence , but I ca n't help but think that MotherLove More Milk Plus increased my supply just enough to meet the growing needs of our son . I was n't necessarily worried before , but now I can rest easy knowing that my milk is giving him everything he needs . Highly recommend for anyone with supply issues and/or growth concerns as with us !
 I love this produict the taste is some what bitter , but dilluted in a few ounces of water you cant really taste it . I drink it once or twice a day and I produce enough milk to feed through out the day and night .
 My only thing with it is how BAD it tastes you ca n't have it alone nor can you drink it with juice or milk or so the insstruccion say I do it any ways and it still works .
 When I started using this , I was a bit skeptical . But within a week I saw a differences . I use to only be able to pump 2 oz at most and after starting with this product I would get 6 - 8 oz every time I pumped . Its great ! Yes the taste is bitter but the milk starts flowing !
 Great product ! Really worked for me . Two downsides
 My daughter was having weight gain issues at 2 and 3 months . I started on this and started producing a lot more milk . She has gained 1 1/2 lbs . in 3 weeks -LRB- since adding this supplement -RRB- . The worst thing is it tastes AWFUL ! Still worth it though . I 'll stay on it as long as needed .
 Great product Just as promised . It really does work . just dont drink anything before or after using it . I highly recommend it
 I am mom who has a 2 month old and a 2 year old . With my first son I had a low milk supply and tried every thing to up my milk supply . I tried Pumping and drinking beer and eating oatmeal , you name it I tried it . I used a whole bottle with my first son and got a second bottle for my second son . It tastes bad but it works !
 I had a hard time producing enought milk . I used this once a day and saw a significant increase . I only used one bottle , but when it ran out my supply did n't go down .
 I have been using More Milk Plus for three months now and started using it when my son was a couple of weeks old . My first son fussed while nursing causing me to be frustrated with it and pumping upon returning to work was stressful . I nursed him until he was a year and could n't wait to be done with it . My three month old does n't have a problem at all nursing , every three hours my breasts are full and ready to nurse , I pump every morning to store additional milk -LRB- I 'm now up to 200 oz . in the freezer -RRB- and I take More Milk Plus three times a day . I will not stop taking the supplement for fear of my supply decreasing . Anyone out there looking for something to help , this is your answer . The taste is pretty bad but mixed with 1-2 oz of OJ make it bearable . An 8 oz supply lasts me about a month and a half .
 I started taking this after my baby started losing weight . I had nursed my other 3 children before her , the first two being twins , and not had any problems producing enough milk . I 'm not sure what the problem was this time , but after using this for 2 weeks , her weight increased by nearly 2 pounds . The taste is absolutely horrid , but I found that taking it in apple juice made it much better than taking it in milk or water . And I never even took as much as I could per day - I generally used 1-2 doses instead of the 3 it suggested . I also talked to a good friend of mine who is a lactation consultant , and she said that fenugreek is more effective when taken with blessed thistle , and that it is absolutely safe to take for as long as needed .
 After struggling to keep up with my 5 month old -LRB- baby # 3 -RRB- I was up to giving her at least 10 oz . of formula a day because I just did n't produce like I did for the other 2 . I was up to 9 Domperidones and 9 fenugreek + about 4 + blessed thistle a day and STILL had supply issues . And , I smelled like an Indian grocery store and had constant heartburn from the pills getting stuck in my chest.I tried the nursing tea in the past and it helped a bit , but tasted like dirt , was inconvenient and to be honest I think 50 % of its effectiveness comes from making sure that you are properly hydrated because you are constantly drinking it!Anyway , fast forward , I finally broke down and bought the MMP liquid . Yes , it 's expensive and yes it 's inconvenient to take 20 minutes before or after water , but it totally works . My supply after the 1st day was up at least 40 % . Even my mom , when she saw the bottles I had pumped asked `` whoa , what did you do ?? `` To me , it 's worth the price , even if it is kind of nasty tasting .
 Having a milk supply problem , my lactation consultant advised to start using More Milk Plus . In my area , I was only able to find it in 2 oz bottles for $ 20 . The 8 oz is a much better deal . Although , I am still having to supplement with formula , I have had a measured increase in my milk supply . My only complaints are it tastes really bad , you have to take it 4 times a day and you have to be consistent for it to work effectively . I would recommend More Milk Plus . It has made a big difference for me .
 Item works as promised ! I was a big skeptic - but it worked quickly within 24 hours to increase my low supply . I mix mine with a little bit of orange juice or lemonade and it covers up the nasty taste perfectly . I take it 3 times per day and will continue till my baby weans herself . I highly recommend this !!
 I was literally pumping only 2 to 5cc -LRB- 32cc make an ounce -RRB- for my newborn who was almost 5 days old when my lactation consultant told me to try this . Within days I noticed I was consistently pumping an ounce then gradually more , by day 10 I was barely supplmenting with formula . This stuff is like a miracle worker . Be sure to not drink anything before and after wards for at least 20 minutes . This makes the product more effect.Yes it taste pretty bad but order the alchol free and no problems . It 's so worth it , it 's for your baby . They deserve the best and our breastmilk is what 's best for them .
 This product is great . Your milk supply will increase just like promissed in 1 - 4 days . The only down side is the taste . After a little while , the taste does n't bother you as much . It really works , so I truely recommend it . I bought the big bottle and use it to refill the 2oz . bottle that comes with a dropper . I recommend positioning the dropper way at the back of the throat so you do n't taste it as much when you drop it in your mouth .
 I ordered this after my milk supply had dropped . My daughter was 7 months old at the time . It tastes terrible , but I did see an increase in my pumping sessions by at least 2oz each time . I am currently not using it , but will take it again if I need to .
 After 3 mos of successful breast feeding I had gallbladder surgery and I 've been struggling with my milk supply since my baby is now 7mo and I 'm only able to pump out 1/4 ounce total from both breast , a couple of days on more milk plus and my milk went up to 1 to 1 1/2 ounces total from both breast and continued that way pretty much till I ran out of drops so I talked to a lady at motherlove -LRB- very nice people -RRB- and she asked me a few ? about how I 'm taking the drops and then she asked if my breast size had gone down and I told her my breast size has went from a full D to now a small C she thought I would do better on the special blend b/c it has goat 's rue which helps build the mammary gland -LRB- that holds the milk -RRB- she thought that maybe my body absorbed some of my mammary gland -LRB- after my surgery -RRB- and that 's y I could n't produce enough milk even while on the more milk plus . so I 'm waiting for the special blend and I will post a review on motherlove more milk special blend once I try it .
 I 've been using this product for over a week after having supply issues at 11months when i started working , it workds for sure , tastes like crap like everyone says , the only weird thing that i have n't read anyone else say is ... my armpits smell diferent ! like the maplely smell the product has ... i tried taking the pills instead and the same thing happens , ut does n't bother me that much i just find it funny
 ... but it 's disgusting . It 's taste equivalent would be what I imagine stuffing your face full of dandelions and old socks would be . It says not to drink but 1-2 ounces of liquid after you take it but it 's a nearly impossible task , unless you like suffering . I would recommend it only to those who do n't gag very easily . But if you are desperate for help with milk , hold your nose and droppers up !
 We bought this watch for my 6 yr old daughter and are very happy with it . She wears it everyday and reallylikes it also . The voice speaks clearly and loudly enough to be heard easily . It 's easy to set the time and alarm.It 's sturdy enough for play and my doughter like to show her friends how it works . Nice product .
 I chose this product because of the TV advertisement . It does seem to whiten teeth just like it claims . I like the fact that it is not abrasive and will not damage the enamel , even when used every day . The only downside is that it is a little pricey and I 'm not sure I could afford to continue using it twice a day , every day as suggested .
 The small mitt is great and came right away . It is definitely small , so if you have large hands , you need the large mitt . It is very comfortable and stays warm for a good amount of time . I use it with a parrafin bath and it really makes my hands feel better .
 Heat these in the microwave and have them set out where you are going to sit watching TV while you moisturize your hands after a paraffin dip.After dipping your hands , you can then place them in a plastic liner or plastic bags work well too . Then , place your hands into these mitts.Your moisturizing results will double when you continue to heat the paraffin on your hands . Spas tend to use electrically heated mitts , but these do n't need to be plugged in and are also calming and aromatic because of the herbal mixture inside the gloves . ~ The Rebecca Review
 My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl / wa7AI , with $ 10 off and free samples . Great stuff !!!!! I was told the enormous benifit of Oregano
 Seems to help with candida but can not be certain as to what levelwith all the other supplements I am taking simultaneously . It definitely tastes good .
 I do n't know it it is helping me to be healthier , but I will take until the bottle is empty .
 As with all dietary supplements , who knows if they work . I 've been taking this for a while and hope it ` skeeping my innards in good working order . I 'm alive , happy and healthy . Has this or any other supplement helped ? Who knows ? I was alive , happy and healthy before taking them .
 Buying oil of oregano can be confusing , as there are many plants which are colloquially referred to as `` oregano '' . I do n't know why the FDA does n't require all these products to provide the latin name of the plant on the label and in the advertising , but they do n't . Fortunately , the Nature 's Way brand tells you it 's from origanum vulgare hirtum , which is the good stuff . They also contain soy lecithin , which is from non-GMO soy .
 I take this daily and it seems to have assisted with my acne and other health complaints . A higher dose helped considerably with the common cold -LRB- along with taking Vitamin C and garlic -RRB- ; the extra immune system boost helped me get over it within 2 days as opposed to the usual 5 with garlic/C . I cut one vcap open to help with a cystic acne spot that was bothering me . I rubbed the oregano ointment on the skin , let it sit overnight covered with a bandage , and the spot had shrunk considerably by morning . Is this the placebo effect in action ? Perhaps , but I do n't see the harm in using it if this is the case . At least it seems to help .
 Nature 's Way Oregano Oil along with lots of Vitamin C was recommended by my holistic doctor to keep my stage one cancer in remission . The plus side of NW Oil is that it has no side effects or interference with other meds . Plus , it actually cuts down on lactose intolerance so I can enjoy yogurt again . Feaked out when you ran out of it awhile back !
 My brother was the first one to inform me of using oregano oil to help fight off colds . And my sister recommended I also try olive leaf extract for the same purpose.Prior to using these products , I would get about 2-3 colds a year for as long as I can remember . The first symptom would be general fatigue , followed by a sore throat , a runny and/or stuffy nose , then coughing and congestion . The mild symptoms would last about 1.5 weeks , but unfortunately sometimes the congestion would linger for weeks.Then I started taking the oregano oil and olive leaf extract . What I 've discovered over the past 5 years is this . If I start taking these herbal supplements when I start getting a sore throat , then usually I never get any chest congestion . In addition , any symptoms I do have are generally milder . So for the past 5 years , I 've only had 3 serious colds , and one of those was linked to allergies -LRB- I live in Central Texas , and cedar allergies are common , although I 'm not usually severely affected by them -RRB- . Prior to taking these herbal supplements , I would have averaged about 10 colds in a 5 year time span.To achieve my results , I take 1 oregano pill and 1 olive leaf pill with every meal , 3 times daily , as soon as I detect the initial symptoms -LRB- usually for me it is a sore throat -RRB- . I continue this intake for about 5 days , which is usually when the soreness in my throat subsides.Overall , I 'm SERIOUSLY pleased with my results . Whereas over-the-counter medicines might make you feel better , they do nothing to actually combat the virus itself -LRB- they just might make your nose less stuffier , or abate your headache -RRB- . Based on my personal experience , I feel like whatever compounds are in these herbs do actually assist your body in fighting the viruses .
 I truly believe in this product , i have an autoimmune disease that i have to take an immune supressant for , and i used to pick up every virus i came in contact with and had lots of sinus problems and colds , since i have been taking the oil of oregano for the last three years , i have not had a cold or sinus infection , and this is the only thing i have done differently , so i will continue ordering this product on Amazon.com , bcause this is where i get the best price and it really works for me .
 Granted these are n't quite as strong as some of the other brands but at 6.95 in the subscribe and save the price is the best around . I take it every couple hours if I need to use it in place of an antibiotic ... and it has worked very well . It also seems to be the only brand that has the veggie capsule for those of us that only eat clean foods.Good product , good quality , good shipping ... Thank you Nature 's Way for providing the veggie cap .
 Oil or Oregano is becoming popular as a herbal medicine and when I saw that Natures Way had them in capsules at reasonable price I ordered them and will order again they are awesome
 I purchased this item because it received good ratings on other sites . It is the best bargain for it potency .
 Oil of Oregano is a must for a low immune system or when you 're ill . It tackles those viruses and bacterial infections . I do n't have any repeating tastes w/this one , either !
 For its functional use , this watch is great . As a nurse I find having a time piece hat allows me to keep exact time for documenting events with a push of a button extremely useful . Having to wash my hands repeatedly , I need a watch that offers some resistance to water damage . It is also inexpensive and the price makes it all the more appealing .
 Works fine , but unfortunately , the person who ca n't see well hears poorly , too . Her hearing aid usually does n't work , even though it 's of top quality , and has been re-adjusted four times in the past 10 months .
 this is a very useful purchase -LRB- especialy for those that are blind or have low vision -RRB- my only negitive comment is that there 's no volume control so it 's sometimes hard to hear .
 The watch speaks the time clearly , and it is easy to set . What I did n't like was that the watch is not water resistant.The company that actually sells the watch -LRB- Maxiaids -RRB- is outstanding . I had a problem after receiving the watch , and they exchanged it with absolutely no hassles . They even paid for the return postage .
 Got this for my father in law who was having trouble seeing the buttons on another talking watch . This one is much easier to use . His only complaint was that he wished it also said the date and day of the week .
 I bought this for a family friend . He has been blind since birth . This watch allows him to know what time it is with a push of the button . He loved it .
 Actually , it was a stocking stuffer for a blind friend who also has the problem of low sensation in his hands . The design passed his test because he could use it . I could n't say that for other products that are designed for the blind yet did n't work in a design sense .
 I bought this for my FIL is 91 and blind . He thinks this watch is wonderful ! He keeps poking all the other buttons , but he 'll learn .
 My girlfriend purchased this watch for me for christmas , I 'm 23 , and love it !!! Now instead of answering my friends for what time it is , I just push a button . lol , Seriously awesome watch !!!!!
 We bought this watch for my wife 's 100 year old aunt who is legally blind -LRB- sees only shades and shapes -RRB- . It took a few tries for her to be able to consistently find the blue `` demand '' button , but once she found it a few times , she had it pretty good . A texture -LRB- e.g. raised bumps , cross , etc. -RRB- could have helped find it more easily . All in all a great watch for this purpose for a very reasonable price .
 Very happy with this purchase . They work great and fit perfectly in my Pulse Spinbrush . Came on time and the price was right .
 I bought the battery operated toothbrush about 3 years ago . Of course , I 've replaced the unit itself , but I love the way it cleans my teeth so much better than a regular toothbrush and the replacements last about 3 months . Would definitley recommend these replacement bristles !!!
 I say that I 'm biased because I am selling one on Amazon at the time I 'm writing this , and wanted to offer full disclosure -LRB- too bad our politicians do n't do that ! -RRB- . I bought one of these for my wife about 6 years ago , she loved it and still uses it to this day . Being a typical husband , I was shopping for a thoughtful gift a couple of years ago and bought her this unit , not realizing it was the same one she already had -LRB- oops -RRB- . She is happy with the one she has since it was pink -LRB- the new one was white -RRB- . It works well in the shower and she likes the massage it gives when exfoliating . The first one is still working great so we have no complaints about the quality or durability of the unit .
 I have been taking these for 6 months - I do n't love taking 6 tabs a day , but they seem to work best when you do . The price is better then some of the other products on the market also .
 I like the price , I feel this supplement will help . I exercise 6 times a week .
 Love Redkin Spray Starch ! I can go to bed with wet hair and still style as usual in the mornings -- -LRB- and my hair does n't break or feel damaged ! -RRB- I would definitely recommed this product for women with longer hair styles - mine is about shoulder-length . Feels sticky at first , but the heat breaks the product down and hair feels natural .
 The HoMedics SQM-B1 Squish Massaging Back Pillow is just what the doctor ordered . It is firm and the massaging action is perfect . I liked this product immensely and was thrilled to find in on Amazon.com I 'd been looking for my Squish Pillow all over my area and just could n't find one . Very good product . Thanks for letting me review it .
 This product is just what was ordered and will be well appreciated . Received the order in a timely manner . Thanks .
 I love the SprinBrush heads for my toothbrush . These work so much better as both heads move and give me really clean teeth .
 This product is exactly what it 's described as . They are the heads for the SpinBrush toothbrush . Exactly what we ordered and needed and lower priced than anywhere else !
 Since I have n't found these brush heads in the store , I think P&G may have discontinued the line in favor of the Oral-B brand . In any case , it seemed wasteful to dispose of the toothbrush handle so long as it still worked , and I was happy to find these heads online .
 this is an excellent battery operated toothbrush . it gets in the places you need to brush nicely ; handles well and has a long battery life . . and very reasonably priced
 Simple enough . It is a small first aid kit , people . It wont save your life but it will make it more comfortable !
 I use it when I play polo , before I got these my tennis/golf elbow pains would not let me use force . Now I can whack it as hard as I want
 Best yet . I have used 2 other designs . Do n't be afraid to use 2 , as you can always give it to someone else . I use it only when playing tennis . Easiest yet to use.I believe however that the best solution is a tennis instructor who will correct your incorrect technique , in combination with using this - this item . Tom
 It works well compared to others I have tried . I have severe tennis elbow on both arms . It is a great purchase for myself because it comes with two . Awesome !
 this product was shipped promptly and is of good quality . it helps relieve the pain of tendinitis in the forearm but most importantly , when worn , it is a constant reminder to take it easy . pains often come on quickly but healing requires time .
 These are very comfortable and wear for a long time . . This is my third purchase since being diagnosed with ulnarneurapathy and these keep me employed .
 I 've tried many products from Band-It to other no name brand elbow braces and nothing worked -LRB- other than the Aircast Armband which is not very durable -RRB- until the Futuro Tennis Elbow support . It is similar to the Aircast Pneumatic Armband but is a ton more durable.Pain in my elbow has always been there and this just helps to manage the pain but has not eliminated it completely . Do n't expect any miracles but this surely does help you get back to the things I love to play and do -LRB- tennis and gym -RRB- .
 Works really well for me . Support is execellent . Does not pinch the skin when tight and can be washed . I got 2 for the price of 1 on amazon and that was a great price .
 This product really works . My elbow injury made sleeping really difficult but wearing this brace all day really cuts down on the swelling at the end of the day .
 I developed tennis elbow a couple of months ago from excessive guitar playing . Even though I stayed away from my guitar for a month -LRB- sob , sob -RRB- , my elbow just was n't healing . I wore this for a few days straight -LRB- daytime only -RRB- , and my elbow pain decreased significantly . The band is easy to use and comfortable to wear . I 'm sure there are other bands that do the same thing just as well , but this one is reasonably priced . I imagine that once my elbow heals completely -LRB- I hope -RRB- , I 'll be doing strengthening exercises and wearing this thing every time I play guitar .
 This is the most comfortable tennis elbow support on the market . For the money , the set of two is a great deal !
 Thank goodness I bought these . I have tennis elbow in both elbows because of my career . -LRB- Flower design . -RRB- I have been suffering for quite awhile and I just got these braces and put them on and I can immediately feel a difference . My fiance better watch out , I can already tell this will help my bowling ! A great relief for a great price !
 I have severe tendonitis -LRB- or tennis elbow -RRB- and this helped alot in my continued workouts . I even use these when I need to do strenuous elbow activities like washing and waxing my car .
 You get two for the money . Maybe give one to a friend ? Its pretty good for tennis elbow , but the Serola Gel Arc is the best of the 3 I tried . The Serola is more than double the price though ...
 Received quickly and works for my wife.My wife uses these when her arms begin to hurt from the repetitive motion she does at her workplace.They have really help with the discomfort .
 These are pefect for small forearms . They stay on the arm through the toughest workouts . I have tried every forearm band on the market . These work for me !
 I 'm experiencing classic tennis elbow , from too much bad technique with the backhand , and playing a guy who hits the ball with a lot of pace and deep into my backhand corner . The elbow support works pretty well . Stays in place w ' the velcro strap . Only thing I 'd suggest as improvement is a somewhat larger , higher area that pushes down on the forearm muscle and tendon . Overall , it works well .
 First I am going to say it is a great price what I paid at Amazon . I have looked at the local box stores and you will get only one with that price what Amazon is charging.As far the product goes it is a great product to take care of your Tennis Elbow . Recently I got Tennis Elbow . I have tried physical therapy , medication , other Tennis Elbow support products and none of them work as this Futuro Tennis Elbow Support . Some of them I had worked for couple of weeks and then it worn out . In addition to take care of my Tennis Elbow for me it do give great use to take my luggage in out of luggage carrousel because I travel every week and it do not put that much pressure on my elbow . Thanks Futuro making a great product .
 I like this elbow support very much . I am wearing it right now and have had it on all day . It is very comfortable . It is so hard to find the right support , that I was so glad that I found it on Amazon.com . I have had a nerve problem for many years and have had to wear a support just about every day . If I do n't I have major pain down my arm and into my fingers . This support does what it is intended to do .
 This band provides excellent support for elbow tendons . The healing process is very long , but I am able to perform most tasks without futher aggravation of these tendons . Highly recommended .
 this elbow brace is extremely comfortable , easy to use and effectivelyhelps stop soreness . i am a repeat buyer . great price too . the last one ibought lasted 3yrs . glad i was able to buy the same brace again .
 I went to CVS to purchase this exact same item and it was $ 15 for one of these braces.It was a no brainer to get two for $ 18 from Amazon.The item helps greatly with tennis elbow problems ...
 I have had several different kinds of tendonitis supports , and have settled on this one -LRB- so far -RRB- as being the best of the group . I like it because it is easy to put on , comfortable to wear , and best of all , it works . The `` pressure spot '' built into the band must be placed over the affected tendon just in front of the painful spot . The pressure spot creates a new fulcrum for the tendon and allows the damaged portion to rest and heal . I have severe `` tennis elbow '' and this allows me to function and do things -LRB- even play limited tennis -RRB- as the tendon heals . It must be tight to be effective , for it must place adequate pressure on the tendon in order to work . I wear an ace bandage beneath the support so that I can cinch the support tighter and not pinch the skin.One universal rule in healing any injury is to stop doing anything that hurts the injured area . Do not try to go through the pain , it will just make the injury worse and set back the healing time . Therefore , if an activity is causing pain , even while wearing the support , stop doing that activity and let time pass to allow for healing . Tendonitis injuries heal very slowly , some taking as long as a year to heal . Be patient , do something else to stay active , but above all , do n't irritate the tendon!Thisis a good effective product at an affordable price.kone
 I had been suffering from pain in my elbow brought about by a fall . I eventually went to see a doctor , by which time it was too late , as arthritis had set in , due to not treating the elbow early enough . I could not do barbell or dumbbell curls without considerable pain and discomfort , until I bought this just yesterday , despite my wife 's skepticism . I have just gotten back from the gym , where I did my standing barbell curl -LRB- 55lbs -RRB- and hammer curls -LRB- 35lb -RRB- and no pain or discomfort . I am very happy , and I am back !
 Do n't get me wrong - it 's not a cure or a perfect product . But - for such little money , if you suffer from tendinitis , this support ca n't be beat . I found it from a fellow golfer who said it was the only one that helped her . It has to do with the unique element that sort of digs into the arm.The great thing about it is not bulky . I too can where it sleeping or awake ... If you 've tried everything else , give it a shot ... And of course RICE
 This is a good , durable tendon strap . I suffer from pain in my forearms , just below the elbow . I also sometimes get pain on the outside , just above my elbow . The strap greatly helps both . I position the gel pad where it hurts on my forearm , and I instantly feel better -LRB- it 's a very comforting feeling having support against that tendon -RRB- . I find that by using these for a day or so -LRB- including overnight -RRB- at the first sign of a flare-up , I can often avert what used to be several weeks or months of mobility-limiting pain . I 'm not sure if it 's because the strap actually protects the tendon or if it 's just because wearing the strap makes me acutely aware of overuse -LRB- a flexed tendon really strains against the strap -RRB- , but whatever the case , it works for me . I 've been using these for over a year now , and I have n't had an acute flare-up a single time once I resolved the flare-up I was having when I bought them . I initially needed to wear them most of the time for several weeks . Once I got better , I only needed them for a while every couple of weeks . Now I only need them every couple of months.I 've never used other brands of straps , so I ca n't say how these compare , but these are comfortable , easy to use , and effective . My only complaint is that the Velcro goes all the way to the edge , so when I bend my arm , it can rub uncomfortably against my upper arm , but that 's a fairly minor point . I would definitely recommend these .
 The usefullness of this brace depends , I suppose , on what exactly is going on in your arm that is causing the pain . I am about 5 ' 10 '' and nearly 200 lbs . Very active , but not a tennis player . I was cleaning my lawn with an electric leaf blower . It gets tiring , so I was switching between arms . The next day I decided to clean my hanger out with the wonderful blower . So imagine you are holding a heavy leaf blower in your left hand , and rotating it towards the left ... the muscles , tendons and ligaments involved in that motion became the problem.These muscles were again recently damaged in an accident . They really never get time to heal , as it can take many months . And I was always banging my elbow in to things ... So this brace , which is very robust and larger than the ace models , not only provides security for the muscles connections , but also keeps you from banging your elbow ... which if you are reading this , know how it hurts.Within two days , I was able to regain the ability to make a clenched fist , and slowly reach for the shoulder belt without great pain . Scratching your back with a damaged elbow is tough , but I can now almost do it . I did a great deal of moving over the last few days -LRB- picking up rubber maid containers -RRB- and the pain is only moderate and occasional , vs continuous all day long.The pain was diagnosed by a local neurologist as referred pain caused by chronic compression of the C5-6 vertebra , which would probably need to be fused ... hmmm.So , I am pleased to wear this brace rather than face spinal surgery . The human body is wired quite mysteriously , and one persons pain solution does not uniformly work for another ... but this is the highest return for money spent on any gizmo in my entire life .
 After being diagnosed with tennis elbow , I decided to try this support -LRB- purchased locally -RRB- rather than more expensive units as I really did n't think it would do much . I am pleased to report that it did work ; after a couple days of continuous use , the soreness in my elbow has decreased dramatically . I plan to continue wearing it most of the time , especially when doing physical activity . The fit is good and does n't slip down my forearm provided I wear long sleeves . It has to be adjusted firmly but not so tight that it prevents proper blood circulation . All in all a good purchase .
 The Futuro Tennis Elbow Support is a good value . The product is durable and provides good support . One unexpected problem was the width of the product . For Tennis it works well . For lifting and carrying things the thickness prevents full flexion of the elbow and causes irritation by rubbing .
 I bought a pair of Futuro tennis elbow supports because I 'd recently started to have some pain in my elbows and forearms . They arrived one day before I had to help a friend move , and they made a huge difference ! I was able to lift and grab with little to no pain . I 've even slept with one on and felt some relief the next morning . My tennis elbow pain is gone now , but I use the still supports when doing any heavy lifting or grabbing . The material of the strap is soft and is relatively easy to adjust and tighten .
 I am very pleased with these elbow supports . I had previously worn the ace brand supports for years but had to find a new alternative when the velcro gave out . The futuro provides the support I was looking for with my moderate pain in both arms . They also stay put . The only reason I gave 4 stars is that after wearing all day at work and sweating in them , the blue pad leaves a stain on my arms . It usually comes off in the shower however .
 Faster and cheaper than buying at my local store . This stuff really works on my pine-bark allergies !! I keep a supply around the house .
 In the gut it speeds up peristalsis . It some times cramps a little but used every day it just works without side effects .
 Jarrow is a solid company that has tested well in independent labs . And it 's just B5 , so overall I give this 4 stars . However , I took off a star because I bought it for my wife for some acne issues . Has not helped at all . Not to say for others it wo n't , but for her it did not .
 Green Wormie is my new best friend.Take him with you into the shower after a long , stressful day and let him vibrate all of your worries away.Now if someone asks you if you have worms , you can proudly say , `` YES ! ''
 Best massager we have ever owned - very powerful and the only one we will ever need . Highly recommended for all ages and activity .
 This is a delightful toy and very powerful . The downside is that it is very loud , looks like a child 's toy , and it is a lint/hair magnet . However I would still recommend this product . It is a great product for misdirection or concealment if you at all concerned about getting flack for having a vibrator because the average Joe is n't gon na realize what it is unless you tell them . Great for travel since I personally think that it would be less embarrassing for some airport attendant to pull this out of your bag at checkout/check in then a different style vibrator .
 This product is good to your muscles after a long hard day . Do wash it before first use , because it has a rubbery smell .
 I have tried a couple different probiotics , including Align . Kal contains more types of probiotics than Align and at a much lower cost . Also from most of what I have read it is a big plus if the probiotic should be refrigerated , and this one clearly states on the package `` refrigerate '' . Definitely glad I found this product .
 This is simply one of the best probiotics out there . I 've tried others when I 've been travelling and none work like this one does .
 Well you know your really never sure about taking a pill with no actual effect like a pain reliever but all my research on Vitrin points out that its one of the best out there on the market especially if your not getting all your fruits and Veggies !
 Vitrin has everything you need for your daily requirements of fruits , vegetables , vitamins and minerals .
 I like that blend does not contain megadoses of B-vitamins and it 's a good product . However , the more I 've researched it , it 's basically just Centrum with a fancier label .
 I would recommend this product as a vitamin supplement . I was very pleased with this product .
 I received this item very quickly and was very pleased . I would recommend this product and the seller .
 I love the little brush on the end of the pick . It works between the teeth really well.I would recommend them above others i have used .
 Ordered these for my sister because she could n't find any locally . Both our families use them and love them .
 It was good to find these online . The stores where I bought them in the past no longer carries this brand . The new brand they have are n't like these . They look similar but the brush is stiffer and hurts my gums .
 I 've been using these brush picks for years , usually purchasing at Osco or CVS . Have n't been able to find them , so was glad to see them on Amazon.com . They really are better than wood toothpicks !
 I really like these toothpicks . They do n't break off in your teeth , and they are comfortable to use .
 Both my mom and dad grew up poor and had problems with their teeth and gums , so when they started making good money , they impressed upon me the importance of taking care of my teeth . Because of this , I 've always made flossing a priority , but to be honest , I find it takes a lot of time and is n't really efficient , so I keep looking for alternatives . Over the years I 've tried flossing handles , individual floss picks , etc. , but never found anything that was an improvement or worked even as well as regular flossing . Until now . Based on an online review I picked up a box of these Brush Picks . I 've been using them for a month , and I can say that I do n't think I 'll ever go back to regular floss . Not only is it easier to care for my teeth with these picks , I think they actually do a better job than floss .
 good cheap workseasy to usehmm . . nothing more to say . . buy it if you need to go b/w teeth or dental work
 Not for those with tender gums , but THE BEST I have found for cleaning between my teeth . My Dentist was so impressed that she ordered some for her husband and some of her patients .
 This is an excellent oral hygiene product . So good and so cheap that they took it out of my supermarket and replaced them with other items that do n't last as long and do as good a job .
 Doctor 's Brush Picks are the best product I 've ever used . Very hard to find in stores and was so glad to find them online .
 These brush picks really work . If you want to clean between teeth and massage gums , this is certainly an effective way .
 Been looking for these for yeas . I 'm glad that i finally found them ...
 Used to be able to get these at the drugstore but all I find now are the 50 count packges . I carry these in my vehicle and find that most folks riding with me on different occasions enjoy them also .
 This does wonders for teeth and gums.First time I ordered although I used it often when in N.Y.where relatives introduced me to this product .
 These brushpicks are absolutely THE best toothpicks around . Doctor 's brand are the thinest we have tried and work so well . My husband and I have used them for years and have had great checkups at the dentist 's office . I highly recommend these !
 I keep these in my kitchen always . When company comes and needs a toothpick they always LOVE these . Every single person that has used them ends up writing the name down so they can get some . They work so well . I will never go back to those old wood ones .
 I usually use the Soft-Picks , but purchased Brushpicks because the pricing is much better . First time I used one , I poked my gum . Ouch!So I 'm more careful now and they do work well . I have a broken tooth waiting to be fixed in a month . It collects whatever I eat and the Brushpicks do a great job of cleaning it out.I do like the case . They do not spill and dispense easily .
 They work just fine . I 've used the pics for several years . They are really good at getting food particles from between ones teeth .
 Bought these as I was unable to find or buy another brand previously available in retail stores . These are great and I prefer over wood .
 This is much better than ordinary wood , bamboo or plastic tooth picks that are too thick . These tooth brushes not only do the job of getting rid of food debris between your teeth , but they will not be pushing your teeth further apart and create more gaps for food debris to be caught . Excellent product .
 I love this brushpicks ! I always have a hard time using floss because it causes my gums to bleed . But , this brushpicks allow me to get rid of food and plaque between my teeth , keeping my teeth clean and my mouth free of bad breath ! best of all , my gums do n't bleed anymore ! love it !
 My friend gave me one of these brushpicks , they were so great at cleaning between the teeth , I have been looking for them for quite a while . I am very pleased I found them . I would recommend them to anyone .
 I have these in the car , house , wherever i go ! Great for mid day floss or if you hate flossing . These are a godsend for me because my teeth are so tight together , flossing is miserable . Maybe I 'm being dumb , but these are a great substitute , and much better than not flossing ... BY FAR . Always help get stuff out ... so I know my teeth are much better off . LOVE THEM !!!!!
 These are absolutely the best toothpicks you 'll ever use ! Love the brush on one end and the tapered end on the other . These work great !
 When I ordered these , I thought they were nylon bristle brushes on one end . They are not ! They are a flat bristle molded as part of the toothpick . So much the better ! I wondered how they could be so cheap . They are simply molded plastic toothpicks with tiny flexible tines on the other end . Oh , and the pick side has a few small ridges on the flattened sides , for clearing plaque.Let me tell you
 These are great , far better than floss . A friend turned me on to these and now I do n't go anywhere without them . Cleans between teeth , stuck food , without pulling or fraying like floss . Amazing what little bits of food they find .
 When I am feeling lazy I love that these are quicker and easier than flossing . If you 're careful they do the trick every time -LRB- but do n't tell your dentist - he 'll say they hurt your gums ... sure - if you use them like a pick axe ... -RRB- . Only problem
 I love these picks . I have trouble flossing , teeth are too close together and little places you just ca n't get to or the floss breaks . If this describes you at all , these picks are for you . NEVER , have food stuck in your teeth again . My dentist says my teeth have never been cleaner since I started using these a year ago . The hygienist says I have very little plaque at all on my teeth now . I am totally addicted . I pass these out to my friends and they all love them too .
 Exactly what I wanted . It 's easier than flossing and better than using a tooth pick .
 I have used dental picks for years , I have found them to be better than flossing and much easier to use . These dental picks have a new wrinkle for me , one end is brush-like and it is really useful for getting under bridges where food has a tendency to accumulate . Nice product .
 Face it - Guys like tooth picks better than floss - if we will use floss at all . If you are not into flossing try these picks . They work very well at getting between teeth and removing food that floss will miss . The tooth pick tip is tapered and ridged to get between teeth and clean out the tartar as well as food particles . The ` feathered ' end is great at removing the smaller particles -LRB- similar to floss -RRB- . These will improve your dental health when used regularly , and they are way easier to use than floss .
 my teeth are very close together and flossing is always a chore . these things are very nice cause you can slide them in easily at the gumline and swoosh them around . i used to use wood toothpicks and various dental type implements , but these are more durable than toothpicks and more effective than most of the dental tools i 've used . plus they are compact and work fast . i wish i 'd discovered them a long time ago .
 This is a great product , and even cheaper that in Walgreens . However the package contaings 275 picks , no 600 as the product detail says . Just keep that on mind , but still really cheap !
 I had been using this product for years after finding them in a local grocery store with shelved medical type items . Then both the grocery store and Walmart discontinued stocking them.I found them at Amazon , and ordered some spares . These are easy to use , can get between closely adjacent teeth and the reverse end has tiny brushes built in that are very helpful for certain uses when cleaning teeth . Also , they are washable/reuseable . They beat any wood toothpick I have used .
 Cool and refreshing picks . Love these and keep some in the car and some in the house . Great product and best price . Reusable and easy to store .
 These work well ! And you ca n't beat the price ! Easy to get one out of the container and they hit the really small spaces between teeth .
 I discovered these toothpicks about five years ago and now we always keep one box on the table next to the salt and pepper and one box in the cupboard so we never run out . The small brush on one end helps to clean between your teeth . They are not available in every drug store so we buy several boxes at a time on line .
 Brushpick toothpicks are the pick of the crop . They do n't break , like wooden ones . They have a feathery end and a sharper end -- dual use . They last ! It took me six months to find my supply dwindling before I had to reorder . Five stars for Brushpick !
 I have had 8 root canals followed by 8 crowns , and food always gets caught in between the crowns . In the past I used floss and water picks , but these work much better and I keep them in my purse so I can use them after every meal .
 Practical , my teeth are much together , hard to use the dental floss , the bristles were perfect for daily cleaning .
 Been using these for the past 6 mos . My gums have always bled cause I only flossed before going to the dentist -LRB- about every 6 mos or so -RRB- , regular floss never really worked me , my teeth were too close together . The last visit my dentist said my gums were getting inflamed and was getting the periodontal thing . I researched alternatives to the floss and found these , also researched the proper way to brush teeth and started using the total care mouthwash . My gums stopped bleeding after about a month of using these and I would use the regular floss about twice a month just to get a little more thorough removal of junk in there . These could be a little more sturdy on the brush end of them as I have had a few bend and had to throw out but that 's a few out of 250 which is n't bad . My next dentist appt is in a month so i 'll see what they say . Hopefully they 'll say , wow !
 `` Doctor 's Brushpicks '' from MedTech Products , inc. are the best on the market . Seeking to replace my dwindling supply I turned to Mr. Medical on Amazon.com and they re-supplied me promptly , accurately , and at a good price ! I recommend them highly.The Doctor 's BrushPicks Toothpicks
 Exactly as advertised and works much better than the Walmart brand which was tried after the original container of Doctor 's Bruhpicks was depleted .
 This good for front teeth , it cleans very well at front but not the back teeth . I still prefer the floss to clean the teeth that I can not clean with this brush pick .
 I have purchased other brands and they are not as good as this one . We use them all the time . They are great to keep handy
 Everything went the way it was supposed to . I received the item I thought I purchase with no drama .
 I found Doctor 's Brush Picks several years ago & fell in love with them . I find them gentle & easy to use which translates to my be able to keep my gums healthier . Unfortunately I can no longer find them in stores . The price on Amazon is good & being able to purchase in a larger quanity is a huge plus .
 My husband loves these brushpicks . They are more effective and durable than wooden toothpicks . The non-brush side is great for getting at debris stuck in a tooth or gumline , and the brush side is great for sweeping away food . Highly recommend .
 The delivery of this product and the product itself is a great product . You can not ask for anything more .
 These are absolutely the best tooth care items around , aside from brushing . When I used to brush & floss my dentist reports were so-so , but now that I moved to using these Doctor 's brush picks after each meal I get perfect reports and no , I do n't work for them , I have tried all other kinds of devices including looking in drug stores when in England , etc. and these are the best . Depending on your sensitivity you may at first wonder if you can get the brushes between your teeth but they are the smallest of this kind of device and if you work carefully you will find they get left over food out better than anything . Floss still may be required for celery strings trapped where your teeth are close but floss does n't get out the between the teeth stuff as well as these brush picks . try them .
 I was hunting for another product very similar to this one . Decided to give the less expensive product a try . It is very good for the money , but is not as soft as my original choice . These certainly can and should be a part of complete oral care program . The dispensing carry case is handy . If a person does not have access to floss , or any other between the teeth cleaning items this product is definately worth a try . I will likely buy them again .
 these are great to have if u are trying to quit smoking . helps keep mouth busy and will not splint . of course , great for getting between teeth to help promote dental care .
 These brushpicks are the best on the market . A friend got me started on them and I used to buy them at a chain store , but now they do n't carry them anymore . I could not find them anywhere until I looked at Amazon . I am so glad the Amazon still carrys them . Please Amazon , always carry this one product .
 You 'll never use a wooden pick again . A staple in our house and cars . Once you use them , you 'll want more .
 Excellent product and much better than standard toothpicks . Easy to get things lodged between teeth out and the soft plastic is easier on gums .
 This is a good product . I get these for my husband . We can no longer find them at the local store so looked online for them and found them at Amazon . He loves these toothpicks and when he runs out , I have to go looking for them . I was so glad to find them at here , but I got enough to last him for a while .
 Love these toothpicks -- makes well and very functional ... have a bridge and this toothpicks works great / highly recommend .
 Even floss does n't clean those nasty crevices -LRB- or is it Crevici ? -RRB- like these wonderful things . Has two ends , one brush , one pickand is a great prelude to brushing .
 My first product review , and this was the product that got me hooked on Amazon Prime . Simply because I could never find these in the stores , and when I did , I simply bought every pack they had . My wife , sister in DC are addicted to these . I use them twice a day at least . My dentist told me he had never seen the sides of teeth so clean . And the added bonus is that it 's so relaxing just sliding and gliding away .
 These toothpicks work very , very well . The brush on the end is particularly effective . When the current supply is finished , I will reorder !
 These are the Greatest Toothpicks I have ever used in My Life . They get stuff regular toothpicks do n't even come close to , I have Been a user for a few years now & I think everyone should give em a try . . I 'm Happy !!
 These are the best at cleaning between teeth other than floss . I never leavehome without em . They are good , good , good .
 I was a little worried that these picks would n't be the same as the ones in the small red container . They ARE the same , the same nice and skinny perfect picks.Walmart stopped carrying these , I tried a couple of others that they did have and they were so fat I could n't fit em between my teeth - whats the point of that ? These picks are perfect , I have one or two spots that I struggle to fit it in , but otherwise they work perfectly , and are the same picks I 've used for a very very long time .
 These brushpicks worked and did what they said they would do and most of them were excellent , but more than a few had rough places on the pick and the brush which was the reason I gave them 4 stars . It would help if they were uniform in quality .
 These brushpicks are easy to use with a great price and get the job done when you dont have time for flossing .
 The picks tiny hairs tend to bend very easily so that you need more than two to cover the entire mouth . other than that its quite good .
 Doctors brand Brush Picks make floss and other toothpicks obsolete . I do n't even understand why they keep selling the other stuff . If you know a store that still sells Doctors brand Brush Picks please let me know .
 works better than wood do n't break and splinter or get stuck . Made well and refurbishible . Nice in tight spots helps get it out .
 These Brushpicks are wonderful for removing food in those hard to reach areas between the teeth . I could no longer find them in the local stores , but Amazon had just what I needed . The order came in good time , and exactly as ordered .
 Better than toothpicks and dental floss . A friend turned me on to these and I only like using them . They really clean between the teeth .
 These picks are effective , very handy and come in a compact container from which they are easily removed , but wo n't spill .
 I love these little gems . I 'll never use a toothpick again . I even keep some in my vehicle.One end is a brush which fits between even the tightest spaced teeth and the other end is a flat curved surface which is good for larger spaced teeth . The plastic material is thick enough that it wo n't snap yet flexible enough to manipulate well in the mouth . I would recommend these , in fact I give them to my friends and they want to know where to buy them .
 I love these brushpicks , even though my dentist does n't . I 've always hated flossing , so when I found these , I rejoiced . These little devils get food particles out from between my teeth like nobody 's business , and I 'm very happy to have found an alternative to regular floss . At night , I follow the brushpick process with my Water Pik , and that takes care of cleaning my teeth as well as massaging my gums . I recommend this product .
 I need to floss my teeth to keep them clean , but flossing never really cleaned in between my teeth . I tried this brand of Brushpicks and was blown away by how great they work and leave your mouth feeling so clean . This product is one of those produced that after you start using it you will never stop using it . It will be a staple in your life . They are hard to find in the stores for some reason and similar products are NOT as good as this brand !
 I 've been a perio patient for a few years and my dentist and I have been working on 1 specific problem pocket area . I used the Brush Picks for about 2 weeks before my last check up and the measurements my hygienist takes between my teeth and gums that were terrible -LRB- high -RRB- numbers are now 2s and 3s -LRB- very normal range -RRB- - a huge improvement . During the first 2 weeks using the Brush Picks I was pulling out a lot of blood and gooey-looking stuff but that completely cleared up and now the Brush Picks come out clean.I highly recommend using these Brush Picks even if you have great gums and take good care of your teeth to help prevent becoming a perio patient like me . And , at this price , it 's completely a no-brainer since taking care of your teeth is one of the best things you can do to improve your overall health .
 These picks are great for your purse to keep your mouth feeling clean and tidy . I have irregular spaces between my teeth and find these very refreshing after lunch . Great product and very handy in the hard case .
 I purchased this product as a replacement for a more costly one . It performed perfectly and , for the price , is hard to beat .
 Who knew they could improve on the toothpick ? These are amazing . The little fishbone pattern on one end gets into all the little spots traditional toothpicks miss . And the subtle ridges on the larger end work in the bigger spots . I love 'em .
 These picks are wonderful . My 6 month dental checkups are great and I have very little plaque from using these several times a day .
 The large muff is a great product for someone with circulation problems . Holds the heat for hours .
 Well lets face it , who does n't like a nice warm muff ? No seriously this thing is great . It warms up nicely in about 5 minutes in the microwave and stays warm for a good 10-15 minutes , which is plenty of time for me to warm up my wrist before stretching exercises . Also , it smells great , although some in the house have complained that the aroma is overpowering - get bent . It looks to be well constructed and I expect it to hold up for a long time . Sure it was a little pricey considering it 's a freaking bean bag , but it definitely performs as promised so I ca n't complain .
 I bought this talking compass for my grandfather who is blind . He has enjoyed taking it on his walk to the mailbox in order to make sure he does not get turned around .
 This chinese herb is incredible ! I purchased it for its reputation as an immune booster , and indeed it is . The recommended dose is 4 capsules per day - I decided to take only 2 capsules per day . I have been taking this product for 23 months now and have not had a single symptom of anything - no colds , no sore throats , no flu , nothing !!! The research says there are essentially NO side effects or dangers with taking this herb - it has been used for 1000 years in China with no ill effects - a pretty good trial , I would say . It also is reputed to prevent or diminish the progress of cancer tumors and many other illnesses - certainly worth the effort and price , since there are no ill side effects . I am very impressed with my experience with this herb .
 I bought Gaia herbal astragalus supreme after reading about some research showing that astragalus extract may help repair telomeres -LRB- in DNA strands in our cells -RRB- . If that 's accurate , we might live significantly longer by taking it.So far I have n't really noticed a difference . But I take a lot of supplements , so it 's hard to be sure . It could be having an effect without my knowing it . Also , I 've been taking only one or two caps a day ... . the directions say to take four . So that may be why I have n't noticed much happening yet.One person wrote a review saying the caps were only half full of liquid . The ones I 'm taking are about 3/4ths full . I 'm not sure if that 's good or bad really . -LRB- Were they totally full when packaged ? Is this really an issue ? -RRB- I have n't run into any negative effects at all , just uncertain there is any effect.Anyway , I like the idea of taking astrgalus , and I like Gaia 's approach go herbal supplements . I 'm giving it four stars based on wishful thinking.If I end up living forever , I 'll post another review : -RRB-
 I use this along with the echinacea goldenseal as my go to for immune support . I love this product the very best due to it 's ability for an all around immunity support . -LRB- I 've just reveiwed the echinacea goldenseal - so this is part is a copy paste since it applies here as well -RRB- I really like the liquid caps . I get the benefits of fast absorption of the liquid and the ease of a capsule . I also have found that Gaia is the best for Astragaus . I get consistent results .
 There was a period when I seemed to get a cold every couple of weeks . I was really run down . My acupuncturist recommended that I take Astragalus every three times a day for a couple of months to rebuild my immune system . I have no idea how it works , but it did make a huge difference . I stopped getting colds . -LRB- And when I do feel I 'm about to get one , the acute remedy is Gan Mao Ling -LRB- see separate review . -RRB- -RRB- Now that I 'm feeling better , I take two capsules just once a day as part of my overall vitamin regimen .
 I started taking this supplement with a recent illness and the feeling an over stressed immune system . I took it until they ran out and felt great during that time . I had no reoccuring sickness but once I ran out about a week now I 'm starting to have more issues . I am buying again to take these for the next couple months to see how I do . Overall I do think the benefits I had were from taking this product .
 When taken at the first sign of illness this product has helped me fend off a few colds and who knows what else.The key is to have it on hand and use it ASAP , drink plenty of water , eat well , you know the rest.It gives your immune system an added boost .
 I used to buy these at my store and when they stopped selling them i became sad . When I found them on here I was way overcome with joy ! These things work great , being that I 'm too lazy to tweeze . I would recommend this to everyone who wants to shape their eyebrows without all the painful tweezing . I 'm buying more !
 I got these for my 12 year old daughter because her eyebrows were really getting `` out there '' . I did n't want her to start trying to do it on her own , and get her brows all messed up and over tweezed , and manually tweezing took too long and hurt . We found these and thought we 'd give them a try . NO pain whatsoever , easy to use , and got the job done wonderfully . She has perfectly groomed mistake proof eyebrows . I did it for her the first couple of times , and now she can do her own about every other month . We both love them . I decided to start using them myself !
 Ugh I hate tweezing ! This is the very first time I ever tried cold wax strips and I 'm very pleased by the results . If you follow the easy instructions inside the box , this is a relatively painless product , compared to tweezing . It 's fast , easy , simple , lasts a long time -LRB- compared to tweezing -RRB- and is a great price and value . I would purchase again for sure .
 Nothing in the stores works for me as well as this product ... unfortunately it has been replaced in the stores w/useless products . Glad to find it at a fair price . It was at my door w/in 2 days . Thanks !
 I do n't know why these are n't more popular . This is the best thing on the market for keeping eyebrows in shape.There is no need for nasty , expensive waxing.This is fast and so easy .
 As long as you wash your face free of the oils this product works wonders . You do n't have to worry about all the time and pain involved with tweezing . Less time with remarkably less pain . This beauty product has a permanent spot on my shelf .
 I tried this product when they used to sell it at Walgreens , as soon as I fell in love with it they stopped selling it . I ca n't seem to find a place anywhere who sells it . Its pain free and works really really well for something that looks like a sticker . I do n't even get my eyebrows professionally done . I use these shapers above my brow and tweeze underneath . They make my eyebrows look perfect !
 I ran out of these and have not been able to find them again . I thought of doing an www search and voila ! I will be ordering soon ! They are quick and easy and less painful than the beauty shop .
 I bought this stuff with hesitation but the price was so good I figured it was worth a try . I did check reviews on Amazon before I used it and after reading mostly positive I decided to go for it . I was pleasantly surprised how well it worked . I made sure my face was clean of all lotions , etc and was conservative w / the placement for the first try - and wow - it worked nicely . Just follow the directions and it should work for you . Needless to say the shapers they have may not match your eyebrow shape exactly so you might have to shape the strips yourself a bit w / scissors or just be careful in your placement on the brow .
 Ever since going to get my eyebrows done and ending up bleeding , I have been reluctant to go get them waxed again . These work pretty well though the contour is a bit off and you may have to use more than one to get the precision that you need . They take off the hair pretty cleanly and the cold wax job lasts long enough . Plus , they 're pretty cheap .
 i absolutely ADORE this product . I am very finicky about beauty products and have bought numerous hair removers - my eyebrows have been through hell and back ! i have gotten them professionally waxed , threaded and plucked ... and i 've tried at least 6 different products at home . None of them worked as quickly or as efficiently as these . And of course , now they are nowhere to be found . I had to buy those stupid hair remover mitts just because i saw `` Bonus ! free instant eyebrow shapers ! '' hahaI will definitely be ordering more from amazon now that i know they are here!ps - to everyone who said they are just like scotch tape - you either have really , really thick hair ... or you are not doing it right . directions come in a box for a reason . : - P
 I 've been searching for this product ever since Wal-Mart quit carrying it . These are the best facial hair remover strips I 've ever used ... better than some salon eyebrow waxings I 've had , and less costly . Just remember that after you apply , to pull off in reverse direction of how the hair grows . Otherwise you 'll get no better results than if you used scotch tape .
 these brow shapers are amazing ! I do n't know what I did before I found them . Actually I just went around looking hairy and scary ! Thank you for this wonderful product !
 Love it , had been looking for it and finally found it on your website . Just wash your face before use . It removes the stray eyebrows and I do n't have to worry about shaping .
 I got some like this at a store . I like them a lot , BUT the shape they give you may or may not fit your eyebrow shape . I had to use scissors and trim each one to fit MY eyebrow shape . Have to use more than one to get it all . Once you cut them to your size they do work really well.Easy and fast .
 Really works and is convenient . I do n't have to go to the salon anymore . The cold wax is more effective than hot wax .
 I 've been using these for sevral years and havent been able to find them in stores anymore.I 've read some reviews saying they 're like scotch tape . . wow.As long as you follow the directions , esp . make sure you wash your face very well , these will never fail you ! I have VERY thick , VERY wide brows normally.I have them done in a salon every few months but I love using these in between , they keep my brows perfect.I always do a little tweezing here and there but with my brows it 's a must.These little stickers remove -LRB- on one strip -RRB- ALL hair they touch w / the exception of 1-2 here & there and like i said , my hair is THICK.Just wash the area really good and you shouldnt have any problems !
 This particular product has done a wonderful job ... This is the only product I use nowadays . . I would definitely recommend it .
 product disappeared from store shelves here . Glad to find them online . Very quick and easy to use .
 This product looks like a cheap little sticker , but do n't judge too quickly . It works wonders ! People tell me ALL the time that my brows look professionally done , like a supermodel 's or someone in Hollywood.My only caution
 I have found these to work extremely well . I am happy to have found them here as I can no longer find them in the stores . Just 2 days ago I had my brows waxed professionally and they did n't do nearly as good a job as I have done myself with these strips . I also still have bumps and redness from the professional job and none of that with these strips . These strips wisk off every single bit of hair that I want removed quickly and with no pain or bumps . Inexpensive beauty!Safe to say I adore this product and have never had an issue with them not working though one must know how to use them and a couple of tries will be needed if you 've never used them to acquire your desired shape . Then , it 's off and running to beautiful brows effortlessly , pain free , bumpless and bat those eyes !
 These have worked well for me each and every time and it does n't hurt.My brows now are even and the right amount of hair is removed , this has n't always been the case at a salon and these are way cheaper!I 'll never overpay again , especially when I get a great result at home , and no waiting around for the lady to finish with someone 's feet .
 I love using these . It is so easy and I have to buy them online , anyway , because my town 's stores do n't carry them .
 These worked well for me ... sometimes took more than one to do the trick in some areas , but all around a great product !
 I used to be able to buy this at Walmart . They stopped carrying it a while ago . So I had to resort to using the other wax strips that are just not quite shaped for the eyebrow . Thank goodness I found it again .
 I bought this originally for my mom and she loves it ! It is easy to use , large , and the two sides help smoothing the skin even more ! it 's best to use after soaking your feet a little so the skin is not too tough . The file is very sharp so you do n't need a lot of effort to get those extra skin off ! Great product !
 Easy to use , very effective . The price is great for pack of 3 . My feet are very smooth after using it .
 Pedicures can be expensive at the spa so I prefer to do them myself . This pedi file is the same quality used at the spa for a fraction of the price . As I 've gotten older I have trouble with dry skin on my heels that cracks and peels if I do n't keep the callouses filed . I use this file on dry heels once every week or two along with daily moisture cream to prevent that from happening .
 I love this neck massager . Whenever the stress starts building in my neck , triggering a headache , I lay down on this neck massager . It slowly works away the painful muscle tension . Wonderful product !
 I 've been a personal trainer for 13 years and I 've tried so many products out there . I believe this one is great . Only been on it for 4 weeks of a 12 week cycle it 's been great thus far . I sleep better , wake better it 's just been great . As for muscle improvements I 've gained some muscle mass and leaned out rather nicely thus far . I 'd recommend this product to anyone looking to help even things out within their own body . Also this was recommended to me for anti-aging I think it 's great .
 My first cycle of Symbiotropin was back in college when it first came out . Somewhere around 2002 if I recall . I have taken this product on and off for 1-2 month time-frames as I have started and stopped workout cycles . Like the other reviewers have stated , sleep quality and energy increases . What they fail to mention are the muscular gains if coupled with a serious anaerobic workout regiment and nutrition program . I recall in 1 month adding serious strength gains and shedding pounds . You will go throughout your day full of energy and workout recovery is simply phenomenal . I recommend actually doubling the dosage -LRB- never tried Meditropin which is 2x strength -RRB- to 2 tablets at night and 2 in the morning . The absolute key to this product is taking it on an empty stomach . If you fail to do that you will not see any of the benefits . I 've also often thought that another bonus of this supplement is the sustained energy and recovery times I noticed . Maybe it was placebo effect , but I worked out harder and faster and retained the energy to really push my workouts . The mid-workout plateau or burnout stopped after a few days on this . Follow the directions , eat healthy and add two doses of Designer Whey -LRB- second product I recommend ... -RRB- throughout the day and I 'm positive your results will be similar .
 This is an excellent product , i use it for 3 months and rest one , it makes you sleep very well , and the next day you will feel with a lot of energy , and those amino acid really works , it helps you drop fat , and its perfect if you do excersice it 's the perfect combination with a good diet plan!it really works on me !! The only cons is the price , but worth for the money !
 I have been taking this product for 4 months now . It takes a month or so to notice the dramatic results , but it 's worth the wait . I have more energy at the end of the work day . I thought I was sleeping well before taking this product , but now I 'm experiencing a very deep sleep . I have vivid dreams . I awake refreshed and ready for the day . I have not been exercising much since taking this product , but hope to start soon now that I have more energy .
 I used Symbiotropin for one 4-week cycle . I ca n't say that I noticed any changes in my body composition . My skin healing might have improved , but I 'm unsure . Very noticeable , though , was improved sleep . For a few months , I had been unable to sleep over four hours straight -- and had low sleep quality -- what I could do twice a day but still miss proper restoration.The first night on Symbiotropin , I slept about six hours -- with decent sleep quality . My sleep remained about like that until week four , when it suddenly went to 8 hours , a few nights in a row , not great sleep quality yet good sleep quality . -LRB- That fourth week I tried a strategy different from taking Symbiotropin right before bed . I took Symbiotropin , waited an hour or two , then ate -- whole raw eggs , soured raw milk , unheated honey , sometimes banana , blended -- and only then soon went to sleep . -RRB- After four weeks I ran out of Symbiotropin . Gradually , over the past two weeks without it , my sleep has deteriorated , and I 'm sleeping about six hours straight , decent quality . I wanted more Symbiotropin -LRB- if not Meditropin -RRB- , but it 's too costly for me right now . So I bought some of MHP 's Secretagogue-One . I 'll see how that goes , and , after four weeks or so , maybe post of review of that product , too . -LSB- 2011 Oct 1
 I love this product and was so glad to find it on amazon because I have had a hard time finding it . I feel better and have alot more energy when I take this . I do n't sleep as long and get up more refreshed . I call it my kick in the but morning drink . After taking it for a week or so I notice that I just feel better overall . It 's not a miracle but I can tell when I have been out of it for a while . That tired sluggish feeling comes back . Even my husband notices a differance in me when I take it . Although he says it does n't effect him the same .
 Symbiotropin is an essential part of my life . I have taken it for 5 years -LRB- according to the recommendations of going off of it every 6 months for 2 weeks - during which I notice changes which make me look forward to taking it again -RRB- . I am 61 years old and although I practice a healthy life style of whole foods , regular exercise , and take bio-identical hormones , I have noticed that when I take Symbiotropin I recover quicker from my workouts , have more energy , and get better results from workouts -LRB- build more muscle and have less fat - as I did when I was younger -RRB- . I have also noticed that my immune system seems stronger when I am taking it . Although it is difficult to say if it has helped me to look younger , people regularly think that I am 20 years younger than I am . It is a blessing to be aging at a time that Symbiotropin is available to increase the quality of my life . -LRB- Before I decided on Symbiotropin I tried about four other cheaper hgH products - none of which worked as well as Symbiotropin . -RRB-
 This product is the best . I have been on it for 3 years . It takes six weeks to notice a difference. , and . 6 months to see a difference . The key to lose fat is toning ; this product does helps with that ! As we age our body needs protien to supply energy , and balance our homones . I take this product during the day and one packet at night . I am 42 years old
 I am really happy with the result of this product . Just follow the instruction , take it regularly . You 'll be able to get the result within one week . Now I feel better refreshed , better smashed . Thanks to the company for making it available in the amazon .
 I have used this product over the last seven years and I bleiwvw it is the best OC HGH product around . Better then progene by far . I saw results in about three days .
 This company did a good job making something wrong turn out right ! Not many companies do that ! I received my product and it is working GREAT ! Thank you !!!!
 I have psoriatic arthritis in my hands and I need to write plus do my crocheting . All other grippers were made for pencil diameters only until I found these . There are 2 of each size and I immediately slid one on a large crochet hook - it worked!I was hoping that they would be more squishy and soft feeling but they are n't . Soft enough to use , though !!
 This is the best antiperspirant/deodorant I have ever used . It does not leave marks on your clothes . It keeps me smelling fresh all day long and then some . I have tried many others and nothing holds up like Mitchum . I have recommended it some of my friends and they love it also .
 I have used the product before and ordered on line for a better price . It arrived in a timely manner as expected .
 Worked great the first few times . But does n't work near as well after that . It may be due to the large number of prescription drugs I take -LRB- blood pressure , chlorstereol , narcotic pain pill for chronic head paink etc -RRB- . I also take a lot of supplemnents -LRB- vitamins B12 , C , D , COQ10 , Cinnamon , ... -RRB- . I would recommend you to try it .
 I love Bodysense products.They stay hot for a long time . I use them in my massage practice as hot packs . The smell is great and it lasts quite awhile . The only thing is as large as it is you need a big microwave to heat it . I wind up folding it then it stops roatating so I have to stop and adjust it . UGH it is a pain . Have n't figured out how to arrange so it heats evenly . Otherwise I love it .
 We 've tried alot of different coQ10 , but for some reason this brand seems to work the best . Seems like its absorbed better .
 I have had problems with my feet for many years . I have visited a Podiatrist once a month to have calluses removed . I just changed to a different Podiatrist and he suggested I use the shower foot file . I am amazed with the results . I no longer have to see him every month . This file really works . I use it everyday in the shower . It is so easy to use . The results are much better then using a pumice stone . I am buying this as a gift for my mother and daughter . It is a great product .
 Pedi-Quick Step-N-Smooth Shower Foot File is perfect from mobility impaired people or anyone that wants to use it . Due to an accident I am unable to easily care for my feet . I keep this the foot file on the floor of my shower and stand on it . Moving my feet in different directions removes old skin and caluses from the bottom of my feet . I hate those little creatures stuck to the bottom of the shower to prevent skids or falls . When I stand on this , not only am I gooming my feet I am not slipping and falling so not only does it groom it makes it safer for me in the shower . I had had one some time ago but it was damaged in a move . I was so thrilled to find I could purchase this at Amazon.com .
 Have to take it easy on this file as to not rough feet up too much . Have been using this every other day . Seems very good quality .
 My sister uses this and recommended it to me . It is easy to use , convient and the results are immediatly visable . I use this file in between professinal pedicures . Place the file in the shower and pull your feet across it - you can see the dead skin coming off . Leaves your feet amazingly improved . Priced well .
 We bought this to attach to my Mom 's walker and it works perfectly . Since she lives alone and uses a walker , this cup holder allows her to manipulate her walker safely and provides a safe way to carry her coffee to the den . We are very pleased with this item !
 I was very happy with my order . It arrived on time and as described . Thank you !!
 First and foremost make sure you DO NOT let this tea steep too long . If you let it steep for the recommended two minutes , you should n't have to run to the bathroom like your pants are on fire ! If you let it steep for the 2 minutes , it 's a decent trip to the bathroom ... not explosive diarrhea.With the way we eat -LRB- mostly women -RRB- we need to clean out our plumbing every once in a while and this is a fabulous way to do it . It 's not recommended for everyday use !
 I did not buy this tea through amazon . . But from my grandmothers cabinet -LRB- haha -RRB- . I have been dieting for the past 3 months now , and i was completely oblivious to special teas for cleansing although i know of drinks/pills that cleanse , I wanted to steer clear of any type of pill and again oblivious to benefits of cleansing -LRB- even when not dieting -RRB- . Now I tried this tea two months ago & only because of the words `` Super Dieters '' I thought ohh special tea so i drank it -LRB- in the evening -RRB- it did for me do its job and loosen things up which i found odd at first then i read the package , and then I got it . So for me it did help being that I usually dont um go as much as I should and this has helped that . Not only that but since I have been using it along with my eatting habits , and exercise my diet has been showing better results nothing drastic but still better results and that is always great ! This tea -LRB- Cinnamon Spice -RRB- I think tastes devine , I do add not even a teaspoon of sugar but I think this tea does n't even need sugar at all -LRB- i just like it sweeter -RRB- . But all in all I do and have recommended this tea to a few family members and friends -LRB- who do and dont diet -RRB- because i love the taste and the results I 'm having with it .
 This product is great it really works . I have lost a total of 15 pounds in two months wihout exercising . I reconmend this product to everyone .
 This tea product got me running alright , to the crapper . But it did help loose about 10 lbs , mostly compacted fecal matter . I also feel more energized and feeling alot better . Before taking this product my best friend was a couple of cups of black coffee but since taking this for the last month my craving for coffee and sweets has subsided , however i now have to bulk up on toilet paper . Great product great buy !
 I love this product , it helps keep things moving ! I use it twice a day afternoon and evening while dieting . A great product for helping maintain your weight .
 I have used this product in the past and was highly satisfied . It works very well . I would just caution first time users not to make the tea too strong or your results may be `` too good '' .
 This product works very well . It taste great . Its a nice touch to the end of a day . PLEASE USE AS DIRECTED ! PLEASE !!!!!
 I have been using this tea for a few years now , and I drink the full 2 cups every night before I go to bed . It begins to take effect the next morning . I gave a bag to a friend to try & she loved it as well , she now orders it online .
 Works great for me and also help me with my weight . I do n't like the drink as much but I drink it as needed .
 When doing a low-carb diet , constipation can often be a problem , especially in the beginning stages when the carbs are the most restrictive . It 's a complaint many people have about low-carbing . Now , if you 're doing it right , it should n't be that way , but sometimes it just happens . Also , someone with chronic illnesses and also those who take pain medication regularly might find themselves with a bout of constipation too . So while I know this is called a ` dieter 's tea ' and I know that some people use it for cleansing and even for dangerous weight loss by drinking too much of it to ` flush out ' the foods they eat , this tea can actually be used safely and for good purposes when used properly for constipation relief.It takes a little bit to find the right level of brewing to make this work for you . Too little , and it does n't do much , too much and you 'll explode and run to the bathroom almost right after drinking it . Find the right balance , the right steeping level vs. water for you , and you 'll simply have a normal , easy relief the next morning . Once or twice per week , after a meal , works great for most folks I 've talked to . Works wonderful for me when needed.The flavor is great too . I 've tried the other flavors of this brand , and I do n't like them . My best friend likes the lemon though , so to each their own , but for me , the cinnamon is the best . It 's lightly sweet on its own , but sometimes I 'll still add a little honey.Good stuff , and if properly steeped , it does n't cause cramping or pain or unflattering gas , with a decent taste . Definitely recommend if it 's something you need .
 While this is a product that I purchase regularly -LRB- no pun intended -RRB- , there is a better value on Amazon that is double the number for about the same price . Unfortunately , I picked the wrong one .
 A lot of tea for the price ... ... no sweetener needed ... The product works better than I expected it to . I also did n't realize how much I was ordering . I am enjoying this product . Has very good taste .
 This tea has a superb taste . I actually look forward to drinking this tea with my dinner . Now that it is summer I drink is as an iced tea , but this is also a very delicious hot drink too ! I use splenda and fresh mint when I brew it . Fabulous !
 Reality strikes . I have been drinking this tea every night for 10 years ! It is the best thing to keep me on the straight n narrow !
 Ok , so the `` Dieter 's '' part is just a gimmick . But this tea really does a great job of keeping things moving , if you catch my drift . Follow the directions carefully ! Steep it too long and you will spend a lot of time in the bathroom . This is my favorite flavor .
 I recieved the product in a nice time frame and it lived up to my expectations . I would recommend it .
 I like this product , but I would n't use it daily . I learned this the hard way . It is stronger then you think !!!!!
 I 've used this product for the last 15 or so years and it is good for one primary thing
 This tea works on my fiance 's digestive track as she has an issue with colitis and this product along with essential enzymes helps her to absorb and digest foods that otherwise would give her pains while in her digestive track , Thank you for making this product we plan to continue using it as long as we can .
 One must know that this dieter 's tea helps mostly by moving your bowels along . Be careful at first , or it will be unpleasant !
 I love this tea the taste is really good and it smells good as well my husband and I are year around tea drinkers and also we dont even have to add any sugar -LRB- well I use honey on some teas -RRB- but this one you do n't need anything extra and I will say it really does work drink plenty of water threw out the day ... . And usually in the am you will be cleaning it out lol ... I did n't have any stomach pains or anything but I eat well also !! I recommend this to any and everyone !!
 I never drink this tea alone . I always steep it with another tea , such as Oolong or Jasmine because the taste is n't the best . I use honey and sugar to sweeten and down the hatch it goes ! Expect some , um , gastrointestinal responses the next day . Sometimes I feel a bit of cramping and sometimes I do n't . Sometimes it will take most of the next day for it to ` work ' ... and sometimes it wo n't !!
 I 'm going to talk about poop in my review , so if that offends you , please skip reading this ! I 've tried the `` original '' flavor -LRB- which is ... herb-y and kind of gross -RRB- , but this is a review for the cinnamon spice -LRB- which is still slightly herb-y , but tastes pretty decent . -RRB- I never understand why these teas are marketed as `` dieter 's tea '' . Do n't use this to lose weight . The only weight you 'll lose is from all that crap and water you 're expelling from your bowels -LRB- literally crap . I made a poop joke . Hehe . Okay , sorry . Back to my review . -RRB- If you want to lose weight , eat less `` standard American diet '' foods , eat more veggies , and move more . The end . Seriously , do n't use this as your weight loss method . I 've tried it , and it just gives you stomach cramps for a few weeks , and you 'll lose more friends than pounds because basically you just have diarrhea all the time.The real purpose of the product ? It 's for pooping.This is a laxative tea for when you 're constipated . If you 've never had this before , here 's what I discovered about a decade ago , when I was a teenager with body image issues and found my mom 's `` dieter 's tea ''
 Have used this product for many years - but only as a way to &#34; regulate &#34; ... . My husband fights keeping his bowel movements regular daily - I just have a little cup of &#34; diet tea &#34; every evening - and &#34; wallah &#34; ! no problems here ... lol . I do not use it as a weight/diet program ; but for this reason , it works for me ...
 I have been using Laci Le Beau Super Dieters Tea for years . There is no subsitute . Many women in my family use it as well . This keeps me moving better than anything else and I suffer from Chronic Constipation . I would recommend this to anyone who could use a gentle , natural laxitive . I 've never felt like I 've taking a harsh stimulant , it just makes you feel & go like normal :-RRB- I hate poop talk but this is worth sharing ! LOL
 I do n't use this tea for dieting but more so for a natural cleanse to keep the body free of harmful toxins . It is very effective have used it for years ! First time users may experiece cramping but , after awhile they cease . Great Effective Product !
 I use this tea regularly . It really does the job and keeps things working ... if you know what I mean . I reuse the tea bags .
 LL is a great cleanser but be aware that when it goes to work you should be near a facility . I find it a bit harsh and prefer Mirolax which is tasteless and has a much milder effect ... at least for me . However , the first time I used LL , I lost 5 pounds in 3 days . Everyone is different so do n't take that as &#34; your &#34; baseline . Ca n't hurt to try . I usually mix it with a flavored tea -LRB- berry , peach , orange etc. -RRB- as the taste alone leaves a bit to be desired for my pallet .
 I 'm sooo happy I found this tea on Amazon.com . The price for 60 bags is unbelievable at best . I have always purchased this tea with 30 tea bags for 8.99 from a local merchant in my neighborhood . In an attempt save more of my hard earned money , I began checking prices of my favorite things elsewhere and low and behold I found my tea on Amazon.com . I now get 30 more bags -LRB- a total of 60 -RRB- for about 3.00 more . I have a good mind to stand outside of his store and advise the patrons to check Amazon for any products he sells . I 've already found several at much cheaper prices on Amazon . Hell , he probably orders from Amazon and re-sales the product . THANK YOU AMAZON !
 I love this tea . The taste is great and works well . I drink 2 cups a day and feel amazing . Will keep buying for sure .
 On days when ice and snow lasts for weeks , and when I know I need to have a boost with cleansing , and do n't want to drive , free shipping and great pricing make this an easy choice for purchase on Amazon !
 This is far and away the best cinnamon tea I have ever found . It 's quite difficult to find a cinnamon tea without added flavors like apple . This is just cinnamon tea , and it 's aroma and taste is that of fresh cinnamon . Also I drink this after dinner to curb my carb cravings , and amazingly , it does the trick .
 The tea is delicious , but I have n't experience the &#34; runs &#34; as mentioned by other reviewers -- even when I let it steep for a long period . I have , over a period of a week , found myself to be more regular . Overall , I like the product and will continue to use it to promote regularity . Maybe being more regular will get that scale moving downward again . : -RRB-
 Sometimes this tea works as I tended other times it does n't . This may be because I have IBS , and the senna in tea sometimes upsets my stomach . You need to drink plenty of water though or it 's less effective .
 The Detecto Model 437/439 -LRB- the 439 has the height measuring rod -RRB- balance beam scale is virtually idential to what you are used toseeing in a doctor 's office . I need to check the next time I 'm inmy doctor 's office but the 437/439 may be of lighter construction -LRB- but perfectly adequate for the typical home environment -RRB- . In the several weeks that I have had the 439 -LRB- I ordered the Model437 but the box contained the Model 439 -RRB- I have been impressed at : a. -RRB- How repeatable the measurements areb . -RRB- How the scale 's calibration stays thesame even when the scale is moved.The scale arrived in a very rugged cardboard box and the onlyassembly was to attach the vertical upright portion of thescale to the floor assembly -LRB- that you stand on -RRB- . I think that there could be a slight weakness in the design inthe way the two pieces attach as there might be a problem withmetal fatigue if the scale was dragged around a lot by it ` svertical member.The floor assembly has two metal ` tabs ' that project up and itis over those ` tabs ' that the vertical member is placed and thensecured with four screws on the back and two on the front . Thevertical member exhibits good stiffness when exposed to front-backpressure but it shows less resistance to side-to-side pressuresbecause there are no securing elements in those directions.Long-term I may buy some small metal angle-brackets and mount themto the left and right of the vertical member to provide support inthat plane -LRB- but I may never get around to it because in my householdthe scale will not be abused and so will probably never have aproblem -RRB- . My overall evaluation of the product is that it 's a bargain for thecouple of hundred dollars that I paid for mine through NorthShoreSupply -LRB- and the people there seem like nice folks -RRB- .
 Having been on a diet over the last nine weeks and after being weighed weekly at the clinic I was using , I decided that I needed an accurate scale . It became obvious that it was an absolute necessity to continue the diet and to control my weight . My previous experience has been with standard bathroom scales either electronic or spring . They all have their limitations from being downright inaccurate to a pain to keep in batteries . Since my doctor had been weighing me on a balance beam scale and that the scale could accurately measure within a quarter pound I decided that was what I needed . After doing some research and just happening on a How It 's Made program featuring a Detecto 437 I came to Amazon and purchased one . It came as a complete suprise to me that a balance beam scale was very reasonable priced for what you get . The assembly was a breese and the calibration was fast and easy . When I stepped on the scale it was within a half pound of the scale I had been on at the doctor 's the previous day . I was sold ! If you need an accurate and reliable sale look no further than the 437 . And it is made in the USA !
 After having numerous store-bought scales , always thinking , Geez , I do n't weigh that much or WOW , I lost a few , only to find out the scale was the culprit . The adjusting wheel would only `` Zero '' the dial , and not correct the problem . The Detecto `` physicians scale `` Detecto 437 Balance Beam Doctor/Physician Scale , 400 lbs , Made in the USAis just what I was looking for . After an easy assembly and adjustment I checked the accuracy by putting various weights on the platform , from 25 #s to 250 #s and it was `` right on '' . I wish I would have bought this sooner , and it 's `` Made in the USA '' !!!!
 I have found this scale to be very accurate and reliable . I can recommend it to anyone who needs an accurate weight check .
 It took awhile , but I was finally able to purchase this at a reasonable price . The product arrived in strong packaging , so it was in good condition . I did not find it difficult to assemble , since I had someone to help hold the top part while I hooked it to the mechanism in the bottom portion which makes it work . It would be hard to do alone . The instructions for fine-tuning it were clear and easy to apply . It is vary accurate . The readings on our scale matched the readings on the scales of 3 different doctors offices .
 This scale is very accurate . It is easy to assemble . The first time I stepped on the scale I discovered I was 12 pounds lighter than my old bathroom scale said I was . If you are seriously dieting this is the scale you want .
 I placed an order on May 16th , and the scale arrived on May 20th , 4 days before the estimated delivery date . Very fast . It took me 25 minutes to figure out how to put it together . If you have someone who helps you to hold the rod with the beam -LRB- it is pretty heavy -RRB- while you adjust the rod to fit the hole underneath , then it makes things so much easier . While your helper still holds the rod , you can screw the thing tight -LRB- 4 screws in total -RRB- . The final step is to remove the carton board box underneath and put the hook in the right place . Stand on it , then you are in business ! The scale is consistently accurate , and because the design uses the level principle , it is extremely precise and its accuracy is not affected by the local gravity . $ 135 -LRB- plus $ 21 for shipping -RRB- is a bit extravagant for a home-use scale , but this scale will last you a life time and it will always tell the truth . * UPDATE *
 The Doctor/Physician Scale I purchase had very little assembly needed and directions made it very simple to put together . As for the delivery time from this seller , I expected to receive it between 5 and 12 days and was very pleasantly surprised to receive it within 3 working days . I would use this seller again with no hesitation.http : / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FGDXL2/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
 We received our item very quickly and found it easy to put together . Very accurate device . We would highly recommend this to anyone .
 I bought this scale for home use because I wanted something accurate and was tired of cheap bathroom scales . First , it was a little tricky to put together , because you have to attach the internal linkages , but nothing too bad . Second the scale is delicate , like all precision scales are . If you move it , you have to set the tare again . It has to be on a perfectly flat surface as well to work right . The scale is well built , same exact scales you will find in the doctor 's office most places . Also , I 'm a mixed martial arts promoter , so I took this scale to my events for the fighters to weigh themselves on , while they are trying to make weight . We compared this scale against the athletic commission 's certified and very expensive electronic scales and all across the range this scale was dead on accurate . I expect these scales will last me the rest of my life .
 Perhaps real accuracy is not necessary in the ordinary course of living and if accuracy is possible , why not have it . I like having a balance beam scale in the house . I trust this one and I do n't trust the electronic `` bathroom '' scales we 've had in the past .
 Product arrived with all parts , good condition , easy to assemble , decent instructions , and it works just fine ! Compared it to two balance-beam scales at the YMCA , got same readings . Could n't ask for more .
 great product , great service , well made , well balanced and holds its balance , nice looking product . Best is it is made in USA .
 I agree almost completely with Mr. Nix 's well-written review of August , 2008 . A tool which makes the assembly a bit easier is a pair of pliers for grasping the hook which attaches to the base mechanism . While I bought Model 437 you should purchase either Model 439 or 339 if you 're keeping track of growing children .
 This is a great scale that is accurate and the results are repeatable every time . I was very pleased with the quality and the price . The item got to me quicker than was promised . Although there are many great attributes for this piece of equipment , there was one that stood out more than the rest . The item is made by my fellow countrymen -LRB- and countrywomen -RRB- right here in AMERICA -LRB- and not China -RRB- . Thanks for a great product .
 Not much to say other than it does the job quite well . I have compared it to my old scale and the reading appear to be accurate . I guess the only complaint I would have is that I need to adjust it frequently .
 Solid , easy to assemble -- once you line up the loop for the base -- and accurate , easy to read . Price not bad for the quality either . Four stars only because I hold out to see how the durability will be , and only time can tell .
 I was looking for a good set of scales because I recently had started working on tracking my weight loss . I wanted to make sure that I could track my downward journey in quarter pound increments . I sometimes need a little mental boost to keep me on track making all of the changes to keep my attitude positive . This scale fits the bill . I highly recommend that if you are looking for a scale that is reasonably priced and accurate you look no further . I was surprised that when I was going to health clubs to find one that I wanted to join , that in the men 's locker room , I saw a few of the exact scales that I purchased in a health club . That confirmed that I made the right decision . And , yes , I would buy the scales again and recommend these to a friend .
 That 's why we bought it . It 's American made and it 's made well . I use it everyday . It does n't take up a lot of space and it 's accurate .
 I gave this product five stars in spite of the fact that it arrived with a ding in the column due to shipping damage . I 'll cover the product and assembly first , since you 'll probably be luckier than I when it comes to shipping damage . ** UPDATE ** I 'm inserting this paragraph up front so that you do n't overlook it . Detecto -LRB- not the vendor -RRB- sent me a replacement scale , and I was allowed to keep my damaged one until I received the replacement . Here 's the news
 I wanted an accurate scale , which is a lot harder to find than one would imagine . This scale fits the bill , although the post is not as firmly attached to the base as I would like.What is really annoying is that the the scale must be assembled by the customer , and unless you have a PhD in mechanical engineering , the instructions are totally confusing even though I 'm very mechanically adept . They are printed in small type with tiny assembly drawings that utterly fail to explain the assembly process . I 'd guess that the assembly instructions were published in the 1920 's when paper and ink were expensive . This is unforgivable . The instructions should have been MUCH larger , clearer and more detailed , and there should be a link to a web site where an assembly video could be viewed . The kit also included a metal nut wrench which had no apparent purpose that I could discern .
 I bought this scale for my medical practice . It is easy to use and accurate . The price is good compared to other brands .
 I have sons that wrestle . They need a scale that they can depend on . They check there weight multiple times a day . It was easy to put together and is very accurate would highly recommend .
 This Detecto beam scale is a quality -LRB- MADE IN THE USA -RRB- product . The assembled product feels rigid - NO loose pieces - NO bent metal ... . SOLID construction . Just like the ones in the your physicians office.It is shipped in one large flat sturdy box . Inside are two components ... one inner box contains the base plate/stand and 6 screws . The other piece is the upright center column.Assembly is quite simple ... connect center column to base plate . I must confess , at my age I needed the assistance of my son to do the actual assembly.Once assembled ... the calibration is very simple . I was weighed at my physician 's office this evening , and the weight matched the Detecto scale weight.This same scale is just under $ 275 at a medical supply store in town . My cardiologist 's technician informed me where to purchase this scale ... . my cost in Amazon was under $ 165 ... . thank you AMAZON
 We have ordered 3 so far and they work well and are shipped out in a very reasonable time . I would recommend this to who ever needs it
 Glad I made this purchase . Enables me to track my weight ; this scale gives me a reading comparable to what I get at my doctor 's office .
 It came on time in good shape . Was easy to set up and use , nice size platform to stand on wile weighting yourself.I do not regret buying this scale .
 First let me say that I 've owned a number of highly rated step on scales that were all disappointingly inaccurate and inconsistent . This scale agrees with the one in my doctor 's office , so seems to be accurate . If you get off to re-weigh yourself , it will give you the same result again . You wo n't gain or lose 3-5 pounds in a few seconds by getting off and on the scale , or by leaning a certain way or placing your feet in a certain spot , so it is consistent . It could be a little sturdier , but it 's fine for home use . We 've had it for at least a year or two with no problems . I give it 5 stars for home use .
 This is perfect for anyone in need of monitoring their weight who wants better quality then those bathroom scales . I 'm a big guy , 6 ' 7 '' 300 lbs and I needed accuracy and durability . I have it set up in my office bathroom and can now get serious about watching my weight . The unit needed some calibration out of the box ; a very easy set screw adjustment but was right on the money on my first weigh in . Assembly was quick , but not as easy as advertised . It helps to have a helper and it is somewhat unclear in the directions as to what needs to happen in the base of the platform . Once I figured it out , it was no big deal , but the instructions could definitely be better . All in all I feel this was a very good choice for my needs .
 This is an excellent and accurate scale . It 's just like the one my doctor uses . Assembly is simple and take maybe 5 minutes .
 I 'm the kind of person who needs to be reminded to do the right things for her health . Keeping track of my weight is essential so that I can see if I 'm on the right track or need to make some changes .
 If you hate digital scales and their preset values -LRB- how is it that I jump between 189.2 and 189.6 back and forth exactly and never anything in between -RRB- then this is the scale for you .
 THIS WEIGHT SCALE WAS JUST WHAT I WANTED . IT WAS EASY TO SET UP AND USE . THE SHIPPER WAS VERY FAST IN GETTING IT TO ME , AND OVER ALL I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE .
 I have wanted a Dr. scale for years and now I have one ! The only problem I have with it was putting the 4 screws in the long pole .
 This long-lasting aromatherapy hot/cold pack will literally last for 10 years or more . The investment in your health and comfort level is well worth the price . The polar fleece cover makes this warm and cozy , while the black cloth on the other side makes this pack radiate cold better when the pack is put in the freezer . So , you can use this in the winter or summer or anytime heat/cold is needed.To heat , put in the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes . To cool , keep in freezer until needed . You may want to put this in a plastic bag first if storing in the freezer.Over the years , the aromatic spices and herbs seem to retain their scent and the rice never seems to dry out , which is quite amazing.This truly will relax tense shoulders when heated in the microwave . Can also be used on lower back if you are in bed on your side because of the shape of the product and how it will conform to your body.Can also be used to create what we call a `` kitten spa . '' We heat this and put it under blankets for our cats . It makes them especially happy and must be very comforting since they will sleep for hours . So , if you have pets who need to be put down for a nap - due to being high strung or just having an annoying day - this works very well and can also give you a much needed break from pet parenting duties.Would also be wonderful for older pets with achesand pains . ~ The Rebecca Review
 I have several different products from this company . They are amazing . The first one I purchased I have had for almost 12 years now and it is still in great condition . The only downfall is the bigger ones do n't fit as well in my microwave so I have to take them out halfway through and move them around to make sure the entire thing heats well . But they are amazing ! I got into a pretty severe car accident and they do wonders for my back and neck problems !! And now they come with covers that you can wash ! I LOVE that !
 Went for a massage . This was used during the massage . Came home and ordered it . Love it . Smells great . Perfect size .
 This product is much better than medication to cure aches and pains . It warms nicely in the microwave and stays warm for quite a while . The only concern I will share is not to keep it in the microwave for the listed times ... using 1 minute increments guarantees warmth without melting . If the pellets/rice/herbs within get too hot they might melt the nylon-type covering . Something to be aware of . The comfort and durability of fabric on the exteriorconsistent pain relief from using it far outweighs any other tiny issues .
 I purchased this for my grandmother who has severe back pain . We warmed it in the microwave for 5 minutes and as soon as she used it she breathed a sigh of relief . Excellent for therapeutic pain relief .
 My husband got this most heat pack for me a year ago . I have Raynaud 's syndrome and Rheumatoid Arthritis , and it has really helped with the freezing feet and stiff joints . It smells yummy , too .
 Much more practical than an electrical heating pad.It wo n't fail like those do .
 Appears well made . Size is perfect for my needs . It covers the area from my coccyx up to and including my lower thoracic spine . My only complaint is the pad does n't stay cold as long as my gel cold packs .
 REALLY GOOD QUALITY - BALANE MECHANISM STAYS IN PLACE UNLIKE MY LAST SCALE . IT WAS NOT TOO DIFFICULT TO PUT TOGETHER.Detecto 339 Balance Beam Doctor/Physician Scale w / Height Rod , 400 lbs / 180 kgs , Made in the USA
 i really like this scale for the money.what i dont like is it weight pointer never stops moving so it can be hard to find an exact weight
 The Detecto Eye-Level Scale 339 that I purchased was easy to assemble and has worked reliably . It takes about as much floor space as I 'd expected . What it lacks in portability it more than makes up in ease of reading and precision .
 Hard to believe you can find something made in the USA . Item exactly as advertised . No regrets at all in this purchase .
 We are very pleased with our new scale , it works great . It was easy to assemble too . They shipped it right away . Bev
 The quality was n't what I was expecting -LRB- lightweight metal construction -RRB- but ca n't complain for the price . Arrived in perfect condition , was easy to install and works great !!!
 I 've had this product over 6 months and moved it in a truck to a different house . It works great and is very dependable ! It 's heavy so it 's not rickety and is attractive too . Mine is white and black . Very pleased with it and how easy it was to put together , take apart to move and put back together again . Recommend it highly .
 Scale was delivered quickly and in perfect condition . Easy and quick assembly . works great and easy to use . Made in USA is a big plus !
 I was so tired of purchasing inexpensive weighing scales that are inaccurate and so breakable . Since I have the room I decided to purchase a real scale . It was so easy to put together and will last a long time .
 The first thing that attracted me to this product was that it was MADE IN THE USA ! Our family has used this scale for over a year and it is still accurate to the 1/4 lb . It was easy to assemble and wipes clean with a damp cloth .
 my scale arrived on time and in great shape . scale works great and can measure in quarter pound increments.eceeded my expectations . great product .
 Great price . Happy to have purchased a Made in USA product . Not as ` nice ' as the more expensive Health O Meter that I use at the Fitness Center , but I did not have to assemble that one . Seems a little ` cheap ' with mating parts not fitting like they should . The scale is best used on a very hard surface . Our carpetted area with a large piece of 5/8 inch plywood underneath was tippy . Cement basement floor is solid with no tipping . I would recommend this scale.Amazon Market Place seller , Center Aisle LLC , fulfilled and shipped the scale quickly . Five Stars for them .
 Great product , I purchased this scale for my office and am very pleased with how easy it was to set up and use . The scale came complete and was packaged well . I received the scale within 3 days after order , very pleased with the quality and promptness .
 This is exactly what we wanted after tiring of other scales . It arrived in perfect shape , was easy to calibrate , and my 3yo digs the height rod . BTW the unit without the height rod -LRB- 337 ? -RRB- costs about the same -LRB- actually a little bit more when I bought my 339 -RRB- . As an added bonus , it is USA made , and the unit came with well-thought-out documentation and signed inspection papers . In English .
 Did a bit of research on less expensive balance beam scales and decided on Detecto 339 . It was fairly easy to assemble . Quite sturdy for home use . Very happy with my choice .
 Excellent . Assembly easy , works perfectly and is made in USA.Highly recommmed Detecto products .
 buying on line I always worry about the quality of my purchase . the reviewshelp alot and so I am offering mine . this scale is typical of those found inthe doctor 's offices . That 's what I wanted and that 's what I got . easy to put together and very exact to use . I 'm very happy with my purchase .
 Just what we wanted and needed . Our scale arrived in very protective packaging . It was easy to assemble , but took a phillips-head screwdriver in addition to the tool included -LRB- no big deal , just an extra trip to the garage -RRB- . The scale is easy to use and , with a morning trip to the doctor 's office including the same weight measurement on their scale as this new home scale , very accurate . A good purchase and great value .
 We bought one of these about ten years ago from a different mail order company . We are totally pleased with this product . Zap it in the microwave for a minute and the warmth stays around like they claim . Or put it in the freezer and have a cold pack that works great .
 Very pleased . My compact washing machine does not accept liquid bleach . I could n't find powder bleach in the stores . These packets are perfect . I use 1/2 a packet in each white load . Very economical and I have clean white clothes .
 I have purchased SEVERAL scales in my lifetime and I have finally found one that WORKS and IS EASY TO USE . Worth the $ and the shipping cost : -RRB-
 Received order quickly . Straightforward directions , easy to assemble.This scale is very accurate , consistent , and easy to use.We strongly recommend this product to anyone looking for a scale .
 Love it !!! The best purchase I have made in a long time . I 've thrown away so many scales - this one is a keeper . I would recommend to anyone .
 Bought this for my daughter . She loves the ease and accurcy of the scale . Just like the doctor 's office . There 's nothing like a balance scale & this one will weigh you over 400 pounds !
 Works great and very precise . I received it in just a few days and it was a snap to set up . All settings preset at factory . All I had to do zero it out .
 Love the new scale . Was easy to assemble . Fits nicely in my bathroom and is so easy to use ! The fact that it was made in the U.S.A. is a large positive for me and my family .
 I received this scale just last week , and I am happy to report that it is everything I expected . I was sick of spending money on expensive digital -LRB- inconsistent -RRB- models , that stopped working after only a year or so of use . This unit provides consistent readings at eye level . It was simple to complete assembly of the two main pieces shipped in the box , and was simple to balance -LRB- and rebalance as necessary if the scale is moved -RRB- .
 Purchased at Amazon , but did not include free shipping . Have to say that this scale was easy to assemble . The scale is accurate and is worth every penny ! Also like the fact that it is made in the USA .
 This scale is great . It is very accurate and is also accurate for repeatability . It 's easy to read . It came mostly assembled . I only had to screw 2 parts together.I would highly recommend it for anyone that wants accuracy to a quarter pound .
 This scale really works . Finally got serious about dieting and this scale has helped to keep me on track . Weighs the same as when I am weighed at the doctor 's office . Very good to have a scale which weighs accurately and does not vary by several pounds from day to day . Very pleased with another Amazon purchase .
 I am very pleased with this scale . I like that I can get an accurate , consistent reading every time I step on . It was easy to assemble and really did n't cost as much as I thought it would .
 I have always wanted one of these scales in my home . It is identical to the kind you will find in a doctor 's office . It gives consistent readings from day to day . For some reason , other scales I have owned would vary in their readings up to 7 pounds from day to day , maybe because of the temperature or weather , or may be because they are just cheap . The $ 200 price was acceptable to me in exchange for an accurate reading . My recent beginning of a diet to lose weight was the primary reason for purchasing this scale . With my old scales it was imnpossible to know if I was gaining or losing weight until a change of 5 or 10 pounds had occurred.When selecting a Detecto scale there are many features to consider that may look confusing at first . After researching the Detecto web site I got all the data I needed then returned to Amazon to make the purchase . Basically there are two main groups which are BALANCE BEAM or DIGITAL . I went with BALANCE BEAM . Then there is METRIC -LRB- Kilograms -RRB- or ENGLISH -LRB- Pounds -RRB- or BOTH . Other features are HEIGHT ROD , HANDLES -LRB- to aid a person stepping on or off the scale -RRB- and WHEELS -LRB- to easily move the scale -RRB- . The reason there are so many model numbers to choose from is because Detecto has provided nearly all combinations of these features .
 This product comes in 2 parts held together with 4 screws . Unfortunately , one of the screw holes was not threaded and I had to tap it out with a 1/4-20 tap . I suppose someone got distracted on the assembly line . I do n't think many people would have a tap set on hand to fix this themselves . I suppose I would have simply had to leave one screw off if I did n't cut the threads in the hole . Once I got it together , it worked fine . I prefer digital scales , but home digital scales just do n't seem to last more than 6 months . This balance bar scale should last forever .
 I was tired of the uncertainty of several electronic scales I used , and wanted to get back to something that was mechanical and certain . And made in the USA . Thus the Detecto 337 . I purchased it through Amazon.com -LRB- and their agent , Wholesale Point -RRB- . When I got it , I failed to examine closely one aspect of the assembly , and as a result , mangled the `` draft rod '' ... both Detecto -LRB- thanks , Charlie ! -RRB- and Wholesale Point -LRB- thanks , Lisa ! -RRB- were very responsive , and in relatively short order I received a new part and got the scale assembled . One neat thing I discovered is that on the Detecto.com website they have a video from the `` How it is Made '' TV series , and you can actually view a # 337 being manufactured and calibrated . And , it is made in Web City MO ... outstanding product !!
 Scale arrived quickly and setup was very easy.Setup :1 . unwrap two parts2 . Connect two parts using 6 large screws3 . Attach hook on the bottom - DoneI 've had the scale about a week and it is reliable and consistant .
 Read everything there was to read . Ordered this scale from Center Aisle , through Amazon , on 10-27-11 . It arrived , UPS , in a perfect , strong , tight as a duck 's butt box , on 11-3-11 . Had it unpacked , set up , and zeroed out , in 10 minutes flat . It 's very accurate , in repeatable , 1/4 lb . increments.Unless you maybe have wienie arms , just disregard any feedback that whines about a difficult assembly . Unless you think your cranking bolts on an M1 tank , disregard any feedback that suggests the screws strip easy . Just use your God given common sense.Regarding the instructions , as is common , they make the assembly seem more difficult than it is . So , in plain English ... . fully unpack , remove all protective packaging , do n't forget the cardboard wedged into the lower housing . Put the base on the floor , stand the column into it , lay it , gently , on it 's back , on a rug . From underneath , hook the rod 's hook onto the mechanism . Grab that hook , gently , with needle nose pliers to do that . Stand your scale back up , gently . Install the 6 phillip screws , with their lock washers . Carefully place the scale in your desired place , zero it out with the adjustment screw on the read out head . Enjoy an accurate scale for the next few decades .
 I wanted a scale that would finally be an accurate measure of weight and after reviewing many balance scales on Amazon , decided on this one . I 've had it now for about 6 or 7 months and it performs beautifully . I 've checked it against the scales at the gym and doctors ' office and it weighs perfectly . We do n't really have a lot of space for it so it 's sitting behind a door in the bathroom . We unfortunately kept forgetting it was there when we first bought it and kept hitting it with the door as we went in and out . Thankfully , the scale is sturdy enough to take the hits without hurting the mechanisms at all , and still works perfectly . I 'm VERY happy with it.So why did n't it get 5 stars ? Well , the numbers on the beam are so small I ca n't see them when I 'm weighing myself . They could make this better . I have to get off and stand back to see the weight . From looking at the scale it does n't seem that making them this small was necessary to fit all the numbers on.I definitely can recommend this scale to others . The price was good and the scale is great .
 The seller of this item ships for free and they are quite fast getting them out the door . I was worried about installation and the column seemed slightly flimsy at first , but assembly was a snap in spite of not reading the directions very careful , and it seems quite sturdy once assembled.The accuracy itself seems to be great . Like all balances , the accuracy is phenomenal . No stepping on and off and getting wildly different results like with most scales I have had.Definitely worth the price if you are serious about watching your weight .
 These Scales are very accurate . I have checked them against calibrated scales where I work by weighing myself right before leaving work and as soon as i got home about 20 min . later . They were dead on . Also , they were a great value . You can not beat the price . Electronic scales , contrary to popular belife , can be wrong . The scales I had before these were digital and were giving different weights . That is why I bought these . I know they are always right .
 Northshore , the vendor , very professional and prompt . Would definitely use again!The scale is very accurate - just like the doc 's office . The yoke arrived a bit off center but customer serviced responded to my email very quicky with exact fix-it instructions . Very easy to assemble . Thank you !
 This long-lasting aromatherapy hot/cold pack will literally last for 10 years or more . The investment in your health and comfort level is well worth the price . The polar fleece cover makes this warm and cozy , while the black cloth on the other side makes this pack radiate cold better when the pack is put in the freezer . So , you can use this in the winter or summer or anytime heat/cold is needed.To heat , put in the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes . To cool , keep in freezer until needed . You may want to put this in a plastic bag first if storing in the freezer.Over the years , the aromatic spices and herbs seem to retain their scent and the rice never seems to dry out , which is quite amazing.Ingredients
 I was not sure if this product would really work . After using this product for a little over a week it is incredible . It does everything it says and I will be purchasing all the scents very soon !
 This stuff is amazing ! I apply it a bit more liberally than they recommend and I always use Sassy disposal bags for the dirty diapers , but this spray is a lifesaver ... especially if you are out & about . It can save you much embarrassment . Our baby has a partial intestinal blockage , which makes her diapers smell like something caustic and this spray even masks that !! We keep a small bottle in the diaper bag and a large one at both changing tables .
 We store our diapers in a dry pail in the baby room and some days , it 's pretty unbearable in there . As much as I love everything about my baby and do n't mind his poo much at all , he will have weeks when he 's sick and the smell of his poo tests even a mother 's love . That 's when you need this .
 This is amazing ! It works in the nursery as well as on the dogs ' beds . Our house does NOT smell like a huge dirty diaper . Whoever developed this product is a genius !
 I have been going to my dermatologist to get rid of some very small warts on my toes , and this wart stick seemed to do just as well of a job with a lot less cost ! Great product !
 This is the ONLY product that has worked for me in the removal of plantar warts . I highly recommend both the product and the shipper . Great service , timely shipping and again a great product .
 This works freaking ridiculously well . I had a massive plantar wart , about the size of a dime . I only put it on for 4 days -LRB- a few times a day -RRB- , and maybe did n't even need that much . Within a week , all the dead skin came off to reveal a perfectly health foot below .
 I had a wart follow me through 2 tours in iraq , 2 navy corpman cutting it out freezing burning shaving it . Nothing worked untill i tried this stuff . It really does work and it gets rid of the biggest warts you could possibly have believe me because my planters wart was . . the biggest ...
 I 've only been using this product for about two weeks , but so far , so good . The wart is shrinking , so I 'll continue using it for several more weeks until I 'm sure that it 's gone . I like the stick much better than a liquid . It 's also less expensive to use than the pads .
 It is all in the title . It is nothing more than applying chapstick to the affected area a few times a day . Yes , it may take a few weeks depending on the stage of your wart ; however , the painless procedure is worth the results . Plus look at the price ! cheapest stuff on the market . No Pain . No Wart . I 'll take it !!!
 I had a huge wart at the bottom of my big toe a few months ago . I used a brand that says PAINLESSLY REMOVES ... apparently it was painless for the wart , bec . it was so painful for me when the wart swelled to 3x its size and some form of liquid inside . A few more days of pain then the swelling started to subside and wart came off ... BUT WAIT ... its not done ... after a couple of months , I noticed more warts growing ... like 7 ~ 9 more smaller ones at about the same area.I ordered this last week , didnt start using till 2 days ago ... and I was surprised after 1 application , the smaller ones just peeled off in the shower and the bigger ones are not looking as tough and seems about to fall off in another couple of application.Now any suggestions how I can keep them off me?PediFix Wart STICK
 1 star because it is messy but this is AMAZING . I 've used the freeze away crap and it does n't work and is too expensive . This is cheap and will work within two uses . Make sure you wrap the area tight though !
 I 've never had a wart before and I guess I just got lucky when I bought this wart stick because one , it was the cheapest wart product I 've seen and two , it actually worked ! I 've read other reviews before buying it so I did n't bother reading the instructions . Just cut a glob of the wart stick off , put it on tape or a bandage , stick it to yourself , replace it daily and scrape off the dead skin while in the shower . Mine flattened out within two weeks . Does n't look gross or contagious . But I 'm not a wart expert . Will it come back ? I do n't know but if it does I have 95 % of my wart stick left to go around .
 This stuff is strong so be careful . It has 40 % acid which is stronger than my prescription liquid wart remover . Apply only to wart and avoid surrounding tissue .
 Like many others , I struggled for MONTHS with an inconveniently located wart on my finger . I tried three -LRB- 3 -RRB- other kinds of retail removal products , and I was thinking that perhaps I was just out of luck . Then , I read through the reviews for this PediFix Wart STICK and was encouraged enough to try one more time . The product arrived quickly , AND MY WART FRIEND IS ALMOST GONE ! Excellent .
 I tried various wart removal products over the counter and online . I had a quite a big size wart on my left hand . I tried Wart Stick for few times then quit using it because I thought this wo n't work either like other wart removal . Few months later I started using this product again and now after about a month of using this my wart is almost gone . I usually use about 3-4 times a week and its working . I hope it wo n't come back again .
 With this product I was able to get rid of warts I had for years . Now my daughter had them and it is helping her too !! Yay !!
 The product actually works ! It works best for warts on the hands and feet . For safety reason , I advise that you do not use it on facial warts . It might work , just make sure you do n't get the product into your eyes . It 's cheap and effective .
 Works perfectly . did n't evaporate like Compound W did . Wart is gone . Apply and then cover with a band aid . did it every day .
 I unfortunately discovered 7 plantar 's warts on my feet in July . I searched online for the best solutions and overall this seemed like the best option from all of the other reviews of this product . They were each slightly smaller than the tip of an eraser and now they are all completely gone ! I applied the product once a day by getting a small amount out with a nail file and applying a good dab to each wart and used a fabric bandage . You do need to be careful about applying it only to the wart itself , but I was never in any pain . Every once in awhile I would feel a remotely small sting , but it happened when I was on my feet a lot . I am going to describe the process here for me because I kept trying to find that in other reviews . A couple of weeks in , the skin around the wart became very white and it was dead skin and when I began to peel this off , a layer of the wart came with it . This was the moment I became a little worried since I was taking off quite a bit of dead skin and I could see the root of the wart lifting some when I pulled the skin off . I would scrub my feet in the shower with really warm water before bandaging and when I started to remove dry skin I was applying Neosporin to the areas around the wart . Again , no pain , just got me worried . After this , I was even more careful to make sure the wart stick was only applied to the wart itself . Also , the little black specks of the wart become more prominent and once I could no longer see these I knew the wart was dying completely . Every week I would peel off another layer of the wart and it does n't really just fall off , so do n't expect that . At least , that 's not what it did for me . Maybe I lost patience , eventually I peeled off a layer and it appeared white underneath but I would not see the root of the wart anymore or any of the black specks . I then applied some more neosporin to the whole surface and woke up the next day to healthy skin ! I 'm still working on getting rid of some dead skin around the areas , but they are all healed up with no wart in sight ! One of the warts was gone in about 4 weeks , but the others took six , so also know they did not all heal at the exact same time . The others were within days of each other . This treatment only required one stick.Good luck , this is an awesome product ! Just have a little patience and if it hurts at all , leave it alone ! Just give it a couple more days of applications and you should be able to peel away another layer . If I ever have this issue again , which I hope I never will , I will definitely be using this product !
 This stuff truely works for my sons planters type warts on his feet . The freeze off stuff from the store was a waste of 15 bucks , but this t suff is awesome .
 My boyfriend had two fairly small but stubborn warts , one on each thumb . After continuous application 1-2 times a day -LRB- I think a little more than half the stick was used -RRB- , they 're gone ! It has been months and they have not come back . Be sure to try to apply it only on the infected area otherwise non-infected skin will feel raw . Cover with bandage if possible .
 This stuff WORKS ! The stubborn wart on my thumb -LRB- frozen off by a dermatologist TWICE -RRB- is gonW My daughter 's plantar wart , for which the derm perscribed and $ 800 dollar RX that did n't work , -LRB- luckily I had a copay card ! -RRB- is almost gone!TIP FOR GETTING IT ON JUST THE RIGHT SPOT : This stuff is strong , and it 's in a chapstick type roll-up tube , so getting it on just the wart can be tough . If you get it on healthy skin it will disolve it too . I use a tooth pick edge to scrape a bit off the top of the stick and use that to spread it on just the wart . then cover with a bandaid , or a Dr. Scholl 's palntar wart cushion for a plantar wart . YAY !
 I grew a small barnicle on my forearm and it annoyed me during yoga class . I priced other wart removers -LRB- pricey -RRB- and also thought about going to the derm but did n't want to take the time or spend the money . I happened to see the reviews for this little stick and liked the priced . I am shocked by how well this worked . It 's like a chap stick with acid in it . I applied it whenever I thought about it in the morning -LRB- not even daily -RRB- and it gently melted off the wart , layer by layer , until it was all gone . No pain , no burning . And it only took a couple of weeks . I even skipped the band-aid that they manufacturer recommends . Nice and neat and CHEAP ! I love it when a product does what it 's supposed to do .
 I have been fighting warts in the palm area of my hand for years with various brands of 17 % solution . It 's unsightly ... all that white coating ... and only seemed to put the warts into hibernation for a couple of weeks only to have them reappear and initiate pain.I used the wart stick by scraping a little bit from the stick with a flat toothpick -LRB- it has the consistency of a lip balm -RRB- . Then I applied the waxy substance directly on the warts , followed by applying a waterproof tape made by Nexcare . 12 hours later I removed the tape and scraped off any skin that the wart stick wax killed . I waited till the next morning and repeated this procedure.Waited again , till the next day and did this one more time , and when I scraped off the skin , the warts came with it , leaving little craters where the warts had been . These were deeply embedded warts and in three days they were gone . I just ca n't say enough good things about this product , other than you had better get some before they take it off the market . That 's what seems to happen with products that actually WORK .
 I understand some people 's frustration but this stuff really does work . If you have a big stubborn wart it 's going to take longer . I was vigilent using the stick 3 to 4 times a day and when the wart would dry out I would file it down . At one point my wart was a little sore so I left it alone for a week and then started the process again . Now about 2 months later it is entirely gone . I also heard that Duct tape works the same way . . -LRB- Of course I found this out later -RRB- Like to hear if this is true . Apparently you cut a piece to cover the wart for a few days . When the skin cells die you file it down and keep putting the duct tape on until the wart goes away.I 'll have to try it if I ever get a wart again.Good Luck ! : -RRB-
 After 2 weeks of appling this to my 4yo 's foot , after she fell asleep each night , the wart was gone , avoiding a tramatic and expensive trip to the doctor , highly recommend this product .
 great stuff , and to think it 's so cheap ! i 'm unfortunately prone to getting warts on my hands and feet . i 've tried everything from store bought remedies to the full grade freezing at the doctor 's . nothing worked for either the plantar or the common warts . i eventually got them burned away by laser . that was a pain ! plus we 're talking about maybe four a year and i do n't always have a lot of pocket change to do that . a common wart on my finger was visibly gone within a week but i still used it for some time afterward to make sure the root was gone too . as for some plantar warts on my feet , i ca n't really comment on because i 'm still in the process of removal . the plantar warts must be rooted a lot deeper , but i 'm confident this stuff will do the trick . bottom line is this stuff is great ! not dangerous at all . use as needed.buy it !
 I just bought this product ... it totally removed my wart on my index finger ... i am amazed how fast it took , when i tried other products which took forever and still the wart came back.thank you for making this product ...
 I had a very obvious wart on my upper left arm for the past five or six years . I was self-conscious , and it often became irritated and red , making it even more embarassing . I had a few other warts on my hands , as well . I chose this product because it had the highest amount of salicylic acid I could find . Within one week , literally , the embarassing , fairly large wart was completely gone . I actually had more problems with the adhesive from the bandages I bought than from the chemicals in this , and there 's no scar or sensitivity . I keep looking at my arm and smiling . Right now , I 'm treating the warts on my hands , and I 'm very satisfied .
 It 's nice to have a product that works without the smell of liquids or the pain of freezing . This one does the job .
 I just started using this , so maybe I should have waited a little longer , but here it goes . I think that for plantar warts , the best thing that works are the Dr. Scholl callus pads , however , they are expensive , and you have to keep them on for 48 hours , which is hard when you shower everyday , and it is located on your foot . The nice thing about the stick is that you can replace the bandage , or whatever you use , everyday . I tested out a spot on my foot without a bandage to keep the wax in place , and I still noticed something , so the people who said they might as well have been rubbing chapstick on their skin clearly did just get a dud . I ordered two sticks just in case that happened . The bottom line is , warts are stubborn , nasty little bastards , and no matter what you use to get rid of them , you have to be relentlessly consistent . This stuff is not going to make your wart go away overnight , but it definitely works , it does n't smell at all , it 's very easy to use , and the price is good .
 Okay , so for the skeptics , I will try to keep this short and to the point . I am in the process of using this product . I did not get it from Amazon , I got it at a local CVS . I was looking for the Freeze stuff -LRB- I was totally in the dark about wart remover things -RRB- and saw that they cost upwards of 16 or more dollars . I decided to go with the stick instead . I have been using it for a few weeks . I applied it to a wart that has been on my finger for a while now , and after maybe a week it started to peel off . I.was.a.mazed . I would rub the edge of the stick around the wart to try to keep it from getting all over my finger -LRB- since the wart is fairly small -RRB- . This has kept the peeling down to a minimum on my good skin . I have let it dry for a while to allow my skin some heal time , but I will continue treatment this week . It really does work -LRB- so far , to an extent -RRB- .
 I highly , highly recommend this product ! It removed my wart in two weeks -LRB- with less-than-consistent usage -RRB- . I recommend using the isolation method described in another review as a precaution , but I did n't notice any damage to the skin around my former wart . Also , remember to alternate treatment with airing out -LRB- if nothing else , letting the wart dry shows you how the treatment is working -RRB- .
 I had a large wart on the palm of my hand that was bothering me . I purchased two items from amazon.com
 I held off doing a review until it worked on a subborn plantar wart on my foot.I have tried all the other methods , the hard to use liquid , the freeze method , the pretreated pads and even duct tape . All these methods are either too messy to use regularly or too expensive -LRB- pads -RRB- . Duct tape I do n't know . Duct tape does cause the skin to die and come off but I do n't know if it would actually get rid of a plantar wart.Because of the hassles with these methods I was never consistent with using them . If I had used them for the same length of time I used the Wart Stick they likely would have worked but what a pain.I got my Wart Stick and started using it EVERY DAY , changing the medicine and bandaid each day . On occasion I would go two days if the bandaid was adhearing well . When the skin would peel off , I would remove all the skin I could get off without getting into live skin . After 15 weeks the wart was gone . This was all done with one wart stick and there is likely still enough to do another wart . So it lasts a long time . Who would n't pay 5 bucks to get rid of a wart.Bottom line it works , it does take persistence and this is a good value . My only question is , why ca n't I buy this in a local store anywhere ? Oh well , Amazon is my go to store !
 I bought this because of all the great reviews I read . I have to say , it is amazing stuff . It is like chapstick . You take a toothpick -LRB- or in my case , a floss stick -RRB- and place a little dot/chunk on the wart . I put it on my son 's wart -LRB- Palm -RRB- and cover it with a bandaid before bed . After maybe just 5 nights , the wart scabbed off !! It did not go away completely , so I waited a week to let the redness go away and I am going to start again , but I think it is a great product ! He is only 5 years old and he has never complained about it burning or hurting his palm , so I am not afraid to mash it on there and cover it with a small patch band-aid . Major Results guaranteed !! I will review again once the wart is completely gone , but I wanted to make certain he did n't irritate the skin surrounding the wart too much before we started another round of treatments !
 Just started using few weeks ago and flat warts I have on my legs are slowly going away . I apparently got one , shaved it accidentally which caused several more to appear - I 'm elimating them one by one !!!
 Great , easy to use product . Warts gone after about six weeks of vigilant application . I Would definitely recommend this product .
 I got this product for my 5 year old daughter . She had 2 huge planters warts , went to podiatrist , and that helped some . The doctor said that we would need up to 6 treatments in her office , costing a total copay of $ 300 . I decided to try this and wait and see . It worked great and saved me $ 250 !!
 As I was preparing to order this little gem of wart removal , I found an old one that I had used 3-4 years ago on an aggravating wart in my hair on the back of my head that I can not see and keeps coming back every few years . I can not use the Dura Film without a great deal of discomfort involving double mirrors . I once had it removed by a dermatologist who told me about this stuff which is no longer to be found in the drug stores I 've searched . To the rescue is Amazon and their army of Sellers . I 'm thrilled to find it here and am saving it and using up the old one which has nearly done it 's job . I can feel my way through my hair with my fingers , using both hands , one to hold the hair back and place a finger exactly where I need it and the other hand to rub on the magic 40 % salicylic acid potion in a wax compound . Using a couple of times a day will usually do the trick in about a week . Highly recommend .
 I have the most stubborn plantars wart and after about 2.5 months of applying this every night , my wart has finally gone away . It does n't hurt at all , as the acid just kills the upper layers of the skin cells . I would recommend taking a shower or at least getting the wart moist with a washcloth so that the medication works the best . I left it on over night and just applied it with a Q-tip with the end cut off , then covering with a bandage . Killing some of the surround skin was a huge concern , because in my opinion , the skin on your foot is thick enough to withstand it . While I do n't know if I would recommend it for everyone , I used a cuticle clipper to cut away the dead layers of the wart so that the medication would be able to kill the wart faster . When I did n't , the skin would n't peel off like it would for some of the other reviews , and it worked fine .
 I have tried the wart bandages , the liquid remover as well as the freeze off kinds -LRB- do it yourself and at the doctor 's office -RRB- without any luck getting rid a couple of warts . In a desperate attempt I even took a razor blade and attempted to cut them out . I will never have to try that again . PediFix Wart Stick is amazing . I have not had any issues of redness in the area it 's being applied as some of the other reviewers have stated . After using for about 2 weeks , the warts have been shrunken to roughly 1/4 of what they were . I just wish that I had tried this product sooner .
 Came on time and exactly as described . Please follow instructions for best results . Would most definitely recommend this product to anyone . .
 I have had an extensive area of warts on the heal of my foot for several years . My dermatologist prescribed the 17 % solution and 40 % urea cream . I have gone through an unknown number of bottles of the solution and several huge tubes of urea cream to no avail . The solution would just eat away at the periphery of the problem area and would not affect the majority of the wart area . I have treated the area twice with the Wart Stick and a good size area of the wart has already dried up and peeled off . After applying , I covered the area with duct tape to keep the medicine where it was suppose to be . This stuff will kill good skin so be careful where it is applied . I have to give this product two thumbs up along with the five stars . I do not know how long this product has been on the market , but I wish I would have had it years ago .
 This product makes MAGIC !!! My daugther had a wart for more than 2 years n her hand . I used everything I could find over the counter . I brought her 4 times to her Pediatrician to freez it . Nothing worked until I bought this . The first time she used , 70 % of the wart was gone . I only used 5 times and now it is 100 % gone . I ca n't be happier and greatful w this product ...
 I had used it for less then 1 mth on over 10 foot warts and it worked beautiful ... . Supper product .
 Got my first wart of my life between 2 of my toes . I kept wart stick in my desk and used it whenever I thought of it ... with in 2 weeks the wart came off leaving no trace behind
 Wart STICK works like a CHARM ! As long as you actually follow the directions , and , um ... use it . LOL ! Chasing after warts may be one of the most boring and tedious things you 'll ever do , but the reward for success is ELATION . This is the EASIEST and MOST CONVENIENT way to apply salicylic acid , no doubt about that . It has the consistency of a lip balm for chapped lips , so you can have an idea from that how great this stuff is . This thing is
 It 's been about a month and my wart is almost gone . It 's still visible and I 've scratched at it like a scab a couple times , but it definitely works . Great product !
 Suggested by our family Doc . To my surprise I could n't find this at my local Walgreens ... they had never heard of it ! My 6 year old daughter complained of the smell of the burning sensation from the liquid stuff . This has very little odor , stays in place and can be applied like lip balm , with a cotton swab , or with your finger . Took care of a tough foot wart for our 6 year old .
 I am in the gym a lot and I have gotten a few warts on my hands over the years from likely the weights . This product is simply far and away the best one to use ... period ... the acid % is much higher and it 's easy to travel with ... no messy/stinky liquids , over-priced bandages , etc. . . Simply apply to wart area , cover with band-aid -LRB- inside also line with this stuff -RRB- , and cover with duct tape ... the combination works great and it will rid you of your warts in very little time.You literally have to burn into them with the acid to kill the root ... it might take a few weeks , but it does work ... I 've had to do this several times in the past ...
 I have to admit , after trying an array of OTC products to get rid of my son 's wart with no success , I was skeptical about paying for another . And it was just by chance that I happened upon a review on amazon for this product saying I needed to give it a try that they had found success where they had n't before ... so I gave it a try.After one week of application of every night - my son 's wart is completely gone . Day 1 and 2 we did n't notice any change . But day 3 - a major portion fell off completely . -LRB- The wart was the size of a pencil erasure . -RRB- Day 4 and 5 you could tell the day after that it was affecting the deeper potrion -LRB- core -RRB- of the wart , and by day 8 you could n't even tell anything had even been there.I recommend this for anyone who has a stubborn wart - it work ! You just have to stick with it.It comes in a convinient size no mess stick -LRB- Like chapstick -RRB- that lets you apply directly and sticks to where you rub it on . In our case we did cover up the wart with a bandaid - just so he would n't get the medicine on carpet , upholstery , ect . ect.-I wish I had started with this first ! But in the end it save a trip/and money to the dermatologist !
 I had a nasty wart on the side of my finger for months before I decided to treat it . . Used the PediFix stick and it was gone within two weeks ! However , peeling off the nasty dead skin was pretty gross .
 I was so worried I 've have continuing wart problems , and I was worried that my big plantar wart would leave a large crater in my foot if I was able to destroy it . Neither of those things happened , and I am so grateful for this product because of it.I will tell you what I did , and perhaps it will be helpful . First off , I want to say what I did prior to using this wart stick because -LRB- a -RRB- I feel pretty sure that home remedies were n't working , and -LRB- b -RRB- home remedies might have softened my wart up a bit for this wart stick.I got a big plantar wart . It was very painful and I spent about three months hobbling around due to it . During those three months I tried diligently to drown the wart . I soaked it often to no effect . I also put duct tape on it for at least a month -LRB- periodically replacing the duct tape -RRB- . This seemed only to make it angrier . The wart got bigger and grosser . The surrounding tissue got whiter and much more unhealthy looking . The strange thing is that while the wart got bigger , it also seemed to become more superficial . I wonder if it was coming up for air or something . In any case , it used to feel like I had big wedge in my foot , but as it got bigger , it just felt like there was a dime attached to it . I ca n't tell if this is just because the surface area of the wart got bigger or it really did become shallower.I gave up on this , especially since the wart was getting bigger and it was freaking me out . I bought this wart stick and here 's how I applied it . I washed the area thoroughly , and dried it thoroughly , then I got some duct tape and made a hold big enough for the wart . I applied the tape and let the wart stick through . I then daubed a bit of this on the wart and covered the tape and wart with another layer of duct tape . I waited 24 hours and then took off both tapes and repeated the procedure . I did this a total of three days , and I was going to let my tissue rest a bit before attacking again , but this was it . The wart died after that .
 This simple and safe product works so well , my 5 year old son has had a series of wart problems , spent money on doctors and was going to spend more on one big one that he had on his finger and under his lip , I used this product as directed , cleaned and soaked warts so they `` open up '' and after drying them I applied product directly on wart a couple to three times a day , in just four days the face one got black , dry and fell off after a bath , and the one on finger is about to fall off too , this finger one we tried everything on , it is literally dried out , this product sucks the life out of them , it is so inexpensive , efficient , easy to use and I fell it 's safe , even though I just put it directly on wart , not near healthy skin . I would recommend this product to everyone !!!! thanks for the comments that made me buy it !!
 I started using this on the large warts on my hands . One was on my knuckle , one on the inside of my finger and one under my thumbnail . At first the warts got really nasty and looked like they were turning white and puffy . It was also annoying having to keep bandages on all the time , however I learned after a while that it is best to keep the bandage on for most of the day and then take it off around 4pm or so in the evening . Eventually , the trick is to peel off the warts after a couple weeks of using the PediFix Wart Stick . Then apply the stick for another week or so and it should be all but gone . Mine took me a little longer because I was n't consistent which I 'm assuming is what most people will do so do n't give up ! Also , I never used a Q-tip or duct tape or anything like that to apply the stick although many recommend it . Whatever works for you .
 This was a purchase for my Son . We had been putting the Dr Scholls brush on wart remover on for over a year with NO results . This has worked so well that we 're both shocked buy the success ! I put it on the warts and then cover them with a band aid when he goes to bed . He takes the band aid off if the morning . So they are untreated all day and this process has worked very well . If I was doing it on me I 'd reapply in the morning and put another band aid on . They 'd be gone even faster !
 Did a review for this and bought more . Took 3 months to remove a stubborn planters wart . Nothing else had worked .
 OK , this stuff works great because it 's very strong . I had a wart on my hands that was there for YEARS and not it 's gone . I even had my doctor freeze it twice and it still did n't go away . This stuff got rid of it in about 15 days.HERE 'S THE TIP : The key is to isolate the wart so the medication does n't affect the good skin . This is especially important for small warts.Tip # 1
 I am so happy I found this product ! It just works!I was horrified when I found not one but two plantars warts on my 7-year-old 's feet . I 'd had such warts myself in the past , and removing them was a painful and not always successful experience . I saw this Wart Stick , was impressed by the 40 % as opposed to usual 15 % active ingredient , and thought that the wax base might keep the medicine in contact with the wart longer -LRB- an issue with an active kid ! -RRB- . Over the course of a few weeks I rubbed the stick onto my daughter 's warts , and occasionally used an emery board to take down the surrounding callous and dead wart off the top -LRB- which was a painless experience for my very sensitive girl , hurray -RRB- . The first wart fell off her foot last week , and the second is about to break off . They just dry up , darken , and fall off ! What a relief ! I 'm always having some of this on hand . No pain , no smell , no mess , and the warts just go away . What more could you ask ? I 'm a very happy customer.Kathy in S.B.
 This thing is better than the fluid wart removers because :1 . The wax base makes it easier to place EXACTLY .2 . The acid is 45 % rather than the usual 15 % . I rub some wax on a band aid , then put the band aid just where I want it . I seal the band aid with waterproof adhesive tape and wear it for a few days.Maybe the stronger acid will act in an evil way , so PAY ATTENTION .
 I 've had a single wart on the back of my hand for years & I had no problem w / it until I moved ; apparently , some warts can get worse -LRB- i.e. spread or become larger -RRB- when moving to a different environment . I went from one wart to about 16 warts in a various of sizes . I was skeptical about this product but I saw the reviews & proceeded down to my local Walgreens to purchase . After 2 days of using WartStick my warts had a dramatic improvement ! Now , a week later my warts are not protruding ; only evidence I have that I had warts are tiny blemishes & I 'm sure those will go away . I 'm ecstatic about this product and will continue using it for years to come -LRB- because I know they 'll probably come back . -RRB- Oh , by the way , it was not messy , painful and did n't turn white like those liquids such as Compound W & also quicker . Highly recommended!UPDATE
 Let me start right off by saying this stuff works . It works so well that its hard to believe that it was so ineffective for some of the other reviewers . But unfortunately that sometimes happens even with the best of products . Like all wart removers I have read about , one must remember that patience is a virtue , and this stuff is no different . Despite touting its extra strength it still takes about 10 days to two weeks on average to really remove all of a wart . But just about 5 days into the procedure you will see the wart beginning to soften and dry up . You can pick at it and remove the dried up tissue as you go along , or you can just allow the stick to do its job thoroughly and pretty much brush it away once its dead and nothing but flaky tissue . Using it is a breeze . You merely rub the stick on your wart with a light coat and then bandage it , once a day . For those that are impatient , you will not see any discernible difference in the first couple of days . But in about 5 days or a week , the results really start to show and you are on your way . This is my first time around with warts , so I ca n't attest to its being better than any other treatment around . What I can say is that this stuff is painless , very easy to use , and most effective . I recommend it ... A few other observations . This stick is the exact same size and shape as a tube of chap stick . It even has the same consistency . I suggest if you are one to keep chap stick lying around you make sure you separate this from it , or be careful and observant . I would n't want to think of what this stiff would do to someones lips . Also , the directions state to apply and then bandage , but it does n't tell you for how long . So I apply it in the morning and keep the bandages on till they are starting to get dirty or annoying , -LRB- ` round late afternoon or so -RRB- . One last detail , with all due respect to the other reviewer here that described a home made system of cutting up a bandage to protect the good skin around a wart , I simply apply this to my wart , and then take a cue tip and clean all around it after application , thus cleaning up most of the excess . I removed three warts on my hand this way and suffered no drying up of good skin , or flakiness around them . All in all this stick is not one of those treatments that sacrifices effectiveness for it 's convenience . Figure on about 2 weeks or so of once a day application , and you will be wart free and feeling spry in no time . Highly recommended ...
 I had a stubborn wart on my finger , and I tried everything to make it go away . I tried Compound W Wart Remover bandages , and though I thought my wart was completely removed , it returned a few weeks later . I found this product upon searching for wart remover , and I was desperate , so I just went ahead and tried it.Because it is a stick solid , it is easy to apply exactly where it is needed , instead of using a bandage with a pre-applied remover compound . It took only a few weeks for my wart to be completely deadened , and now you ca n't even tell that I used to have a terrible wart on my thumb . This product is great !!!!
 Way better than most other over the counter products . 40 % rather than the typical 17 % salicylic acid . And in a semi-dry form which can be used later if needed unlike the liquid products that become useless after opening the container a few times . Very effective even on the stubborn issues . `` I did n't really want to write a review on this , but we all have problems from time to time , so I hope this helps . ''
 My children have all had issues with warts . We have tried many over the counter wart removers , freezing them off at the doctor , and treatments by a dermatologist . Our dermatologist told us about this product and it is fabulous ! I had to search high and low for another tube since we finally went through our original tube . Ifinally found it on Amazon . This is a great product , you wo n't be disappointed . For best results at bedtime soak affected area in warm water for about 5 minutes , file wart with a nail file , then apply the Wart Stick .
 I wrote a mostly decent review for this product about 4 days ago , but for the sake of people who might be reading it , I MUST edit it . For some reason , though , I ca n't edit the stars.This stuff is WICKED . Unless you have a wart that is equally wicked -LRB- meaning , huge and stubborn -RRB- DO N'T USE THIS PRODUCT . It 's 40 % salicylic acid in a waxy base . This makes for a very dangerous combination , as the acid is more than capable of burning off perfectly good skin and the wax holds it in place as it does it . My desperation to have the tiny warts on my hands gone superceded my biochemical knowledge , and I put on a little bit more than the directed `` thin layer . '' Now , I am nursing first degree burns wherever I put on the product.If you have a monster of a wart , this stuff will rip right through it . It will do the same to your skin , though , so be very , very careful . I went to my doctor , and he prescribed Aldara cream . It 's much easier on my skin .
 I rarely write reviews for products , but I had to for this one . I had a wart on my pinky finger that would not go away . I tried to freeze it multiple times and tried other products . My doctor even attempted to freeze it once-it blistered but did not come off.I decided to try this product . Within a day I could tell my wart was disappearing . It was amazing ! I had no bad side effects like some of the other reviewers but I was careful to only put it on the wart . I highly recommend the Wart Stick . And it 's cheap ! I 'm going to attack my plantars warts next !
 Background ... I have been battling warts for over a year now . My first wart showed up about 5-6 years ago on the heel of my right foot , it never bothered me so I never thought about it and figured/hoped it would just go away . A couple years later it turned into 2 warts ... then I got another one on my left heel about a year after that . Now I 'm getting worried but still not taking action -LRB- much to my regret -RRB- . This goes on until last summer when I realized I had a cluster of about 5 warts on my right heel and 2 warts on my left heel . I started out with the banana peel and duct tape treatment and kept it up for almost 3 months with no success . I switched over to Dermasil Wart medicine -LRB- awful smelling stuff ! -RRB- and used it diligently for another couple months with no success . Keep in mind when I say that I tried a treatment I gave it the best shot I could , applying it multiple times a day . Then I started combining the banapeel , dermasil and a good long ACV soak daily . The warts looks agitated but were not diminishing , turning black , or dying in any way that I could tell . I tried coconut oil , did n't work . I tried garlic , did n't work . I tried getting it frozen at the doctors , did n't work . I tried Forces of Nature Wart control EXTREME Strength , did n't work . Thuja pills and cerate , neem oil , and probably a few more that I tried and forgot about.Current ... Now I 'm at the point where I 'm considering cutting the darn things out with a scalpal by myself because I 'm just that frustrated . As a last ditch effort I ordered this stuff because It could possibly be the ONLY thing I have n't tried yet . I started using it 3 days ago . I started out by applying a very little amount on my warts and covered them with a bandaid . Checked on them 3-4 hours later and the surface of the wart and skin that came in contact with the wart stick had turned deathly white and became very firm , so firm that I ca n't file it off with an emery board or pumice stone . This excited me so I put more on the wart , MUCH more lol . For the past couple days I fill in each little divit of a wart with the waxy like substance and reapply about every 8-10hrs . Every so often I can feel a little tingle but no discomfort.Earlier today I tried very hard to clean out the surface of the warts with some tweezers and noticed I had virtually no sensation in or around the warts so I started picking and plucking and twisting and tearing . I did n't get a whole lot of the wart but enough to give me hope that this might actually be working . I am determined to kill these nasty parasites and show them who 's boss ! After digging a small crater in my heel I reapplied a good helping of the wart stick inside this newly formed crater and covered it back up . I think I might buy a razor blade or scalpel to assist with the removal of the dead tissue.So all in all , out of the roughly 10 + methods I have tried in the last year this one has showed the most promise . I will update this review in a couple weeks or when I notice some sort of change for better or worse . Wish me luck !! Edited to add -LRB- 7/20 -RRB- : I failed to mention in my original review that I had a wart on the middle finger of my left hand that I was using the wart stick on as well as the plantar warts . The wart on my finger is gone now so I 'm really excited that it might be working on my feet as well . The area on my foot where the warts have been living for several years is softening up and from what I can tell the root system seems to be gone . I used to be able to feel a lump under the skin , i assumed it was the root system . Right now , aside from some dead skin where the roots were , my heel feels normal to the touch . I am really hoping that this means the warts are gone . I will keep up my application of the wart stick for a few more days before allowing the skin to heal . I guess after the skin heals I will be able to tell if the warts are truly gone . I 'm trying not to get my hopes up because I 've been let down so many times before
 Ok , I 've always felt guilty that I use product reviews every single time I purchase something , but never have I left a review for anything I 've bought . I swore , though , when I bought this that if it actually worked , I would finally get on here and write a review for something . I had 3 plantar warts on the bottom of my foot for over 2 years . I spent a ton of money and tried everything to get rid of them so I could start getting pedicures again . Gels , freezing kits , liquid treatments from all major and generic brands . Then I tried the home remedy route . Apple Cider Vinegar did work for one of them , but it was a long , smelly , cumbersome , painful process . Banana peel , duct tape , grapefruit seed extract nail polish ... I tried it all . Little did I know that relief was in this inexpensive , simple tube . At first I applied as I had read in the reviews but I personally found it easiest to scrape some off with my fingernail and apply to the warts that way . I would then cover with bandaids that sealed all the way around and leave on for as long as the bandaid would stay . I noticed serious improvement after just a few applications . Within 10 , all warts were gone . I am dumbfounded and so grateful . I hope to not have this experience again , but if I do ... this will be my first course of action .
 I purchased the Wart Stick from Pedifix for a wart i had on my thumb . My doctor recommended it . It did wonderfully well . I had the wart off within a week . It did its magic .
 This really works to eliminate stubborn warts . I apply it after showering so my skin is at its softest , then cover with an adhesive bandage . Pain free .
 This product was recommended by our doctor to use in-between the liquid nitrogen application in their office . We found it to work very well when applied at night , and then covered with a band-aid . It also is recommended to soak the wart prior to application , which we found was helpful .
 I had a wart on my finger for years now and have tried at home wart treatment , Dr. Scholl 's freezing , the doctor 's office freezing , and it got so stubborn , it 's core has changed into a dark color . Then one day I looked on Amazon to see what people say works out there , and found PediFix Wart Stick . Since it was a verys tubborn wart , it had to take off 4 layers before the wart is completely gone . Each layer took about 4days to come off . I am amazed at how effective this little stick is . Now , I am wart free !
 This product works great !! Dab some on a wart put a bandaid on it and repeat a couple times a day and in a week or so the wart is gone !!!
 Thankfully I never allowed myself to be deterred by the negative comments , because this product works great . Within 2 weeks the warts on my hand disappeared . I even defied the label and used a little on some small warts on my face and these are gone as well and I did n't discolor or scar my skin in any way . I hope it works for everyone else as well as it has worked for me . No problem mon !
 This product worked great for my 10 year old daughter . We tried many remedies including doctor 's visits for freezing the planter warts without much success . The PediFix began to work he first night and within 7-10 days the wart was completely gone . I do agree with the other reviews , this product is strong . You want to concentrate on placing the product only where it 's needed . I was skeptical but this stuff really works . Another word of caution , the package closely resembles chap-stick . Keep it away from smaller kids .
 I have had numerous amounts of flat warts on both of my hands for many years and I have used both medicated band-aids and the salycic liquid with neither of them working . I decided to try the wart stick just for the heck of it and , within a week , I noticed a HUGE difference . I have always been embarrassed by my hands and I can finally wave my hands without covering them up with my sleeves ! I am extremely happy with this product . Your warts will peel , but that just means that it 's working ! I ca n't believe how incredible this stuff works . I would recommend it to anyone !!
 Want your Wart Died at any cost ?? Then , Pedifix wart stick is what you are looking for , whichcost less than 10 $ and contain 40 % salicylic acid . This is very powerful stuff that can kill anything . If you are not careful , this stuff can kill more than just your wart , but rest assure , your wart will definitely die . The question is when . The more you use the wart stick , the faster it burn the wart , but you will lose some of your skins around it . If you apply the wart stick in a thin layer daily according to the recommendation , it might take couple weeks depending on the size of your wart . In fact , i think this stuff kill all skin diseases . Just be careful with it because this is powerful stuff .
 This stuff really works , and for the price you ca n't pass it up . I used it while in Iraq . At first I did n't think it would work , but was amazed to see the end results . And do n't accidently put it on your lips as I did once .
 ok We just got this stuff 2 days ago & I HAVE to tell you how amazing it is lol . Nope , it has not removed my daughters Wart or my Skin Tag -LRB- hanging mole thing lol -RRB- But it has started to!I put it on my daughters wart the day we got it following the advice of a previous reviewer -LRB- TY For the tips !! -RRB- I used a regular bandaid though because that is all we had . . I took a hole punch & used it to get threw the plastic part of the bandaid . . then took a Qtip & cut the tip off of it . . Used that to dig the medicine out because ours is indented for some reason . . But I used a big glop & cover it up . . After the first day it turned all white & red around the edges . . Just put the second round on last night . . anxious to see what it looks like tonight!Now me . I put it on mine just yesterday . I already peeked at it and it too is all white now ! Amazing . . Simply amazing ! I will update when it actually takes them all off . . I have a few I need to do & my son has a wart as well . . Fun fun fun.But for under 6 bucks . . and no pain . . it is worth the wait !
 I had 2 warts on my hands for months which would n't go away , and plantars warts on my foot for over a year and a half . I tried freezing , the liquids , duct tape , and vinegar but nothing worked . I liked the 40 % salicylic acid strength so I decided to try the Wart Stick . I used it on my hands first -LRB- everyone sees those -RRB- . It took 6-8 weeks , but this did the trick ! It is the same consistency as lip balm , so application is very easy -LRB- just do n't mix it up with your chap stick ! -RRB- . The warts have been gone for 3 months now , no sign of returning.I am now using it on those stubborn plantars warts on my foot . It 's taking a little longer , but two are gone and one is on its way out . This stuff is great !
 Purchased this product a few weeks ago for my tween son . He started with one wart on his foot but soon others developed . Previously we were using Dr. Sch **** for several weeks and it just had a minor effect on the warts . So , after some research I decided to give Pedifix a shot . It is working very effectively so far ! No pain at all when he applies it . This is my 1st review written on Amazon , but not my 1st reading of reviews . I glean a lot of info from reading and analyzing reviews . I am glad I chose this product .
 I 've had warts come and go for many years and have tried every over the counter remedy available . I found the PediFix WartStick in a closeout sale at a drugstore . I guess it did n't sell well because it has a horrible product name and looks like chapstick . So it 's easy to miss it on a rack.But this stuff worked great . I had 2 stubborn warts on my thumb almost under the nail . I had tried the liquid and gel versions of Compound-W and Dr Scholls , but both products would flake or peel off pretty quickly . The Wart Stick , on the other hand , adhered to the skin better . Sometimes before reapplying , I would pull away some dead skin on top , but in general , I could tell it was removing the wart better than the competing products . After 2-3 weeks , the warts were gone.I highly recommend this product and hope that Pedifix continues to make it even if it does n't sell well .
 My son had two plantar warts on his foot . Went to the dermatologist . She froze one , but the other was not a candidate for freezing -LRB- since it was right where he puts pressure when he walks , she does n't freeze those types to avoid the chance of a scar , and said it could feel like he was walking on a pebble for the rest of his life if it scarred -RRB- . She sent us home with a Wart Stick . Name sounded hoakey , but we used it . She said it will work , but the problem people have is not using it each and every day . We made it a routine and did n't miss but maybe 1-2 nights over three months and they are gone now . It 's painless and odorless , no mess , quick , no big deal . Set it by your bed and make it a routine . You 'll be happy you did . It was an interesting progression watching those gross things die . It was about $ 7 . Saves you the expense of a doctor 's visit .
 This thing is amazing !!! I tried everything to try to get rid of a wart that I had on my foot with no success . I used this item for a week and it was gone !!! It kills the skin in the area and after about a week the entire skin in the area just falls off and the wart is totally gone ! I would highly recommend this product .
 I ordered this from Amazon and with regular shipping and received the product 2 days later . I bought it due to a recommendation from our pediatrician and it does work . You must use it daily and we have not been as vigilant as we should .
 I love this product so far my warts are going away this stuff really works ! its better than wasting 8 dollars on 12 wart band aids
 My son 's dermatologist recommended this to him for the wart he had in the palm of his hand . The Dr. told me he could treat it but we 'd have to come back and it might take a few applications for him to treat in his office . This stick was inexpensive and works !!! I do n't have medical insurance so I saved a lot of money using this instead of having the dermatologist remove the wart . I will use this in the future instead of paying a doctor to remove warts whether I have insurance or not . It costs less than one co-payment and is way more convenient !
 My only issue has been how to get a good amount on the wart , it wo n't rub on well enough . Once on , its doing a good job on a very persistent wart I 've tried the liquid stuff and freezing etc. .
 You certainly ca n't beat the price . I 've tried several over the counter freezing products , several patches , and several liquids . Nothing worked on a wart I 've had for 20 years , but this did . I assume that is due to two factors
 This stuff worked so well for me . I had several warts on my leg - they were gone less than two weeks after I started using this stick , and they 've stayed gone . Some other people may have gotten a dud , but mine worked just fine . Very happy with this purchase .
 Most OTC wart removal products from your drug store are 17 % salicylic acid -LRB- the active agent -RRB- . This is 40 % and the difference is noticable.You do need patience . I put a generous dab on my wart -LRB- s -RRB- , daily if I can remember , and then cover with a band aid to prevent my clothes from rubbing it off . Some warts take a week or so before falling off and some much longer . I am just rid of one which took over a month . Did I mention you need patience?I suspect the OTC stuff would work too ; it would just take a * lot * longer .
 We were advised by my son 's dermatologist to try this product . It 's easy to use and works great ! We followed our doctor 's instructions to the letter and after two weeks , some of the smaller warts are GONE and we 're making great progress on the big ones . I was worried that it might hurt since he 'd complained of stinging with the liquid and we were switching to something stronger but there is no pain at all . Compared to the 12 weeks we tried with a messy liquid product , lots of complaining , and very little success , this stuff is absolutely the way to go!I did find it odd that I stopped at three different pharmacies on the way home from our appointment and nobody had heard of a Wart Stick but it was easy to find on Amazon .
 I had warts on my fingers that grew over time . I had tried every remedy possible plus all over the counter treatments and finally freezing them at a doctor 's office . The doctor guaranteed me that after several painful treatments they would fall off but it never happened . I tried ordering the `` stick ' guessing it would also fail . I applied it to the area in the morning and night and kept it covered with a band aid because the medication is very powerful . After 2-3 - months of consistantly doing it twice per day , every day they completely disappeared and even the scars have healed . It was painless compared to other treatments and did not irritate the surrounding skin even when it came in contact . I feel the band aid was an important part of keeping the product from washing off and being less effective . Even if this does n't work for everyone for the price you have nothing to lose if you have dealt with painful warts before .
 I have had a wart on my thumb for over a year . This has worked after many other products including Liquid nitrogen at the doctors office and Freeze Away . It did take a little while but it has n't returned yet .
 We have used this several times on my son and it totally gets rid of the wart in about 1 week .
 I have never written a review before , but this product was fantastic . I have a plantar wart on the bottom of my foot that was about the size of a quarter . It was a complication from having my previous wart at the location burnt off ... the blister popped and the wart spread to a larger area . Having it frozen off at the doctor 's office was unbelievably painful , so I thought I would try this wart stick . In less than two weeks , my wart is completely gone . I am actually in disbelief how fast it worked , and for the first time in over two years , I 'm excited to get a pedicure again !
 I have some flat warts on my face for over 10 years , I tried several other methods and products before , non worked even a bit . This product , however , was effective after just a few days of application . I am super impressed . It 's so cheap and yet so effective , amazing !
 My daughter had a heck of a time with warts and we tried many products . This one did the trick after applying for 3 straight weeks twice a day . We also put this on our 3 year old who got the warts from his sister and they too went right away after 2 weeks .
 I had several warts on my neck and chest for 2 years . This product removed most of them in 6 weeks . I used this product every day for 6 weeks . During the usage of this stuff , my skin around the warts turned to brown because of the acid but it recovered 2-3 days after the warts were removed . I have only 2 tough warts left which they have got dried and it is almost the time for them to get off my skin . I preferred to use the stuff with a pin instead of rubbing it to my whole skin . Also , I have 4/5 of the stuff left for the future !
 I have a wart on one of my fingers for years and could not get rid of it , but now that i use the Pedfix wart stick it has resolve my problem . Great product at such a great price !
 Impressed to say the least . In less than two weeks the wart on my finger was gone . No pain , no mess ... just have to go through a few band-aids . What a great product !
 I had a wart on my finger . i put Wart Stick on my finger for about a week and was almost completely gone . Very nice product . I purchased this product on AMAZON .
 a great way to apply just the amount you need just where you need it . We had to use a small applicator to target the wart and miss surrounding skin . The wax base is good to keep it in place . We covered the plantar wart afterwards with gauze and tape to protect and keep the product in place .
 Pedifix Wart Stick is amazing . The warts disappear and leave the surrounding skin without irritation . Recommended by my granddaughter 's pediatrician , both her warts and mine are gone .
 My 5-year-old daughter has had warts on her hands for a couple years . At her last checkup , I had gotten a referral to a dermatologist , but had n't followed through yet . This summer , as a last ditch effort before calling the dr , I searched amazon for wart removal products and found this stick . I kept putting off using it because my daughter kept taking the bandaids off . Then I realized that even though she would n't keep the bandaids on , it was working anyway -LRB- and this was with not remembering to put it on every day -RRB- . For just about a week or two I 've been making sure to use it every day , and most of her warts are almost gone . This is with just applying it once per day and not putting bandaids or anything over them . The bigger ones on her fingers are totally gone . She had two little ones on her forehead and it wiped them out in just a couple applications ! -LRB- I think it says not to use on the face , but it did n't irritate her skin . -RRB- I ca n't believe this inexpensive little stick saved my daughter from having to see the dermatologist !
 I purchased this item for my 11 year old son who developed 2 warts on his finger . He was embarrassed and I looked on Amazon -LRB- my online site !! -RRB- and read the reviews for the wart stick . He is already seeing improvement in 2 weeks . The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because it is hard to keep right on the area at night . Otherwise , great product !!
 MY husband regularly gets little warts on his hands and they drive him nuts . He has used the freeze stuff gone to the doctor and usually ends up taking a razor blade to his hand and cutting as much as he can which is NOT healthy . I looked at the reviews for different products and let me tell you this looked the best , because it it ! Within one week of use he was able to shave most the wart off , not butcher his skin like he used too . Being the stick form it is was much easier to handle and apply then those liquid ones . He is a mechanic and needs his hands all day and this never interfered with his work.I do however think they need to change the shape or at least the label because it looks just like chap-stick . Yes people should look before they put something on and thank goodness I did but he put it right next to the chap-stick and I cant tell you how close I came to putting it on when in a rush . Im thinking households with children need to very careful this is put out of reach but maybe Im just an idiot . Could you imagine how bad your lips would burn though ?
 My dermatologist had frozen off the warts on one of my toes before , but they came back multiple times . I had tried the do-it-yourself freeze off products , too . Nothing worked long-term until I tried the wart stick . It 's very important to apply the product to the wart and ONLY the wart . Getting the product on skin around the wart will lead to irritated skin ... My only other advice is to apply the wart stick as directed . I used it every morning until my warts went away . They 're still gone six months later !
 Normally I do n't write reviews for anything , however after months of trying other stuff I got this.I used toothpicks to apply it , bandaids to cover it , and a thin but blunt metal object to peel off the dead parts.It took about a month but killed everything .
 I was a little skeptical about using this product , thinking that it just would n't work , but after a week or so of of using it religiously , soaking my wart , applying the product , and covering it with a bandage twice daily for a week , my wart is gone ! Wish I would have done it a long time ago !!
 I bought this stuff for my daughter who has lots of planter warts on both feet for the past 5 1/2 years . Was skeptical at first after reading reviews . But I thought I would still give it a shot . After a week and a half it does start to get rid of them . Her feet look so much better than they have in years . Make sure you soak your feet , use a pumice stone to slough off dead skin . Apply wart stick and cover with medical tape or duct tape . I have her change it daily and yes this stuff is great . Much better than anything we ever bought in the stores . Even freezing with make them worse . So yes this stuff does work . Very happy with the product .
 I started using this the day I recieved it in the mail . I had 3 . . one larger and 2 smaller plantars warts on the bottom of my foot . I have had them for years and did ` nt know what they were until I did research and figured out what they were . I have been using this stick every day 2 times a day . It has been about a month and a half and they are GONE ! I also used a file to take off the dead skin and would wipe alcohol on it before applying acid stick again . Keep using and do not give up . THIS WORKS Great !
 I have had a massive planters wart on the bottom of my foot for years now and have tried everything to kill it . I went thru bottle after bottle of salicylic acid w / no results . I decided to give this a try after seeing that it was 40 % SA . The highest I 've ever seen w/o an RX script . I have been using it now for about 2 months and am so surprised with the results ! This stuff has killed the wart significantly . I lather the stuff on after a shower and using a pedi-stone to take off any dead skin . I then place a large band-aid over it . I did n't have a problem with having it effect the area around the wart because it 's such a large area that I 'm treating . This stuff is awesome !! Will be purchasing again if I need to ! Do n't waste your money on small percent salicylic acid products that cost double if not triple the cost of this thing ! Worth every penny !!!
 I ordered a two-pack of this item since my 13 year old daughter had a wart on her finger . When I first read in the directions that it may take up to 12 weeks of use , I was thinking a trip to the doctor 's office might be a quicker solution . We gave it a try anyway applying it twice a day and covering the area with a band-aid ; her wart practically disappeared within 5 days . Great little product and does what it promises .
 My daughter had horrible planter warts on her feet . She was embarrassed to let anyone see her feet , always wore socks to hide them . She had been to the doctor , and got shots . She had them frozen , and even tried the liquid wart remover , which by the way the bottle wo n't dry out if you keep it stored upside down . All those did n't work . I bought the wart stick , and she tried it , but due to lack of patience gave up , after it did n't work . Well , she saw some feet commercials for stuff she wanted but would n't due to the warts , so she started using it again , and did it daily . All her warts are gone after 3 years of trying different things , thanks to the wart stick !
 Like so many other reviewers here , I had several stubborn warts -LRB- both on my hands and bottom of my feet -RRB- . I had nine sessions of cryotherapy with my doctor , which included paring the wart down to the root and a treatment of liquid nitrogen . This treatment had little to no effect on my more than two dozen warts.I tried liquid salicylic acid for weeks upon weeks , and it was successful on the smaller or weaker warts.I finally tried this wart stick on my most stubborn warts . After about 3-4 weeks of consistent -- practically religious -- use , I had great success . You should be aware that this 40 % strength product will irritate healthy skin . But I tried to limit the wart stick to just the wart , and I used it every day for about 30 days -LRB- and using 10 cheap nail files to file the dead skin away -RRB- . At a certain point , the warts just became so soft that I could file away chunks at a time.I can definitely recommend this product . But like any product that affects your body , take care when using it .
 Spring 2009 , I went to a Dermatologist to remove my plantar warts . He suggested the allergic immune response method using DNCB . That stuff is a known mutagen , burned like crazy , ate deep holes in the bottom of my feet , and took six months for me to see any results . I also had to go in the doctor 's office every two months to get the 2 % solution applied to my warts . Ca n't remember the exact out-of-pocket expense , but it was way more than $ 6 , and inconvenient . Much to my disappointment , this spring , they all reappearred . I was n't going back to waste more time and money at the doctor 's office . I found this product and decided since it was only $ 6 and a lot stronger than Compound W that I 'd give it a try.I 've been using this for 3 weeks max . I swiped a fairly good amount on my warts once a day , then covered the areas with bandaids . First gone was a single plantar wart that came completely off/out . I have mosaic plantar warts on the balls of both feet . I ca n't see or feel them anymore , but I will continue to apply the Wartstick for another couple of weeks to make sure it removes the layers deep enough to get them out.The only complaint I have about the product is that it 's difficult to get it on a single wart without getting it on the adjacent , unaffected skin , but I 'll happily put up with a little peeling of some nearby skin to get rid of these warts . The stuff does work ! Try it . It 's only $ 6 !
 I had a very stubborn wart on my right index finger , very close to my fingernail . I tried everything to remove it , from the over-the-counter freeze-off stuff , the typical paint-on salicylic acid -LRB- Compound W and another store brand -RRB- , and even went to a dermatologist -LRB- twice -RRB- to have it treated with some pretty brutal acid that appeared to work at first but did n't completely get rid of the wart . After this , the wart came back with a vengeance , and I was at a loss as to what to do . After looking at the reviews of this product , I thought I 'd give it a try . The wax-based formula makes it easy to use -LRB- the paint-on liquid kind is hard to keep only on the wart and also tends to dry out in the bottle fairly quickly . -RRB- The Pedifix took a while to work , but I used it nightly and put a bandage over the wart , then took the bandage off in the morning to let the wart dry out during the day . At night , I filed the wart with an emery board and applied the Pedifix and a bandage . About 3 weeks later , my wart is completely gone . The process was pain-free too . Great product !
 i had a 3mm skin tab on each eyelid . a dermatologist had frozen them off in the past , but they kept coming back , so i figured it was time for some self help . i drilled an 1/8 '' hole in a plastic spoon to press lightly against my eyelid and isolate the tab from the surrounding skin , then used a Q-Tip with the cotton ball ends cut off , to apply a bit of Pedifix wax . i did this several times each day for 2 weeks as the skin tab culiflower 'd by turning white bulbus hard and finally fell off leaving a smaller nub that later scabbed and healed . on the other eyelid i simply used aCuticle Clipper by Premax . Made in Italyand 5x mirror to pull and snipe the skintab off - it was a bit painful and bloody -LRB- do not use a styptic pencil to stop the blood -RRB- , but it clouted within 10 minutes and after cleanup was left with a 2mm scab -LRB- clean area with alcohol then relieve and relax skin with petroleum gel -RRB- . both eyelids healed up looking the same , but I 'll probably just snipe it off next time than go through the 2-3 daily lightly burning ritual of putting this wax on . so if you have a high pain thresh hold and steady hand , just cut the skin tab off - if not , this wax and some persistence may save you the expense of going to a doctor .
 OK , this stuff works great because it 's very strong . I had a wart on my hands that was there for YEARS and not it 's gone . I even had my doctor freeze it twice and it still did n't go away . This stuff got rid of it in about 15 days.HERE 'S THE TIP : The key is to isolate the wart so the medication does n't affect the good skin . This is especially important for small warts.Tip # 1
 I had purchased my wart stick at a liquidators store so I did n't know what I was really getting . I had a painful wart on the ball of my foot which I had been trying to remove for some time with various methods . I used the stick and the wart was gone in a very short time . I was impressed . It was gone for a year and now it is back and I started using the wart stick again and than misplaced the stick . I just found it in my medicine cabinet . I am bookmarking this item on my computer . I want to know that I can always have this item if I need it . It really works and fast !!!!!!!!!!
 I have n't been using this one very long , but so far it seems to be working great . Thankfully there is no pain . It may take longer to work than the freezing a doctor would do , so be patient . The planters warts on the bottom of my foot have been there for a long time . Thought they were calluses until my doctor told me otherwise . I started treatment as soon as I got it in the mail . So far it seems to be working great .
 My dermatologist said this is the best over-the-counter product available , and after trying it and Compound W , I completely agree . It is easy to apply , creates no mess , and definitely did a great job killing my plantar wart .
 Salicylic acid is widely recognized as one of the best ways to safely remove warts . There are face masks used in beauty salons that are 30 % salicylic acid , so this stuff really is n't dangerous at all . I had a wart on my toe . It slightly stung , like hydrogen peroxide would . It took multiple applications over a week or so . At first the wart puffed up , the skin opened up a bit , and then it died . I used it after showers so my skin would be soft and the salicylic acid could be absorbed . 40 % is the highest percent you can get without a prescription I think .

 Worked in just a few days on simple warts and is working on plantar warts . Easy to apply . Shipped fast and affordable .
 Great product , works . My wart is gone and not coming back . It has been several months since my wart has disappeared . I also did 2 treatments with dry ice , but remember you MUST BE VERY CAREFUL , Otherwise your skin around the wart could be damages . In addition , I used 7 treatments with patches with medicine in them already , bought it from a Drugstore . Therefore , the combination of all 3 treatments and being consistent meaning a treatment every day works ! I think it took me a few weeks . It is definitely worth it . I hope my ugly wart never comes back - it was on the inner side of my right hand.Benefits
 For a mere 5.00 , this stick has to be one of the best remedies I ever ever used !! Its doesnt happen over night if you have a big one or a small one for that matter.But over time a daily application , it will start to vanish.I would just fine any kind of medical tape , or something that will temporally stick to the skin.To tape off the good skin around it , this way you dont eat the good skin off as well.Nice product !!
 I think this item worked excellent compared to the other liquid based removers which seem to take forever to work . My foot doctor recommended this to me and it 's hard to find in local stores . It is stronger so watch you do n't use too much because your skin will get irritated around the wart site . One tip my dr. gave me was to use a Q-Tip to scoop some out and then apply to the wart . That way you do n't re-infect yourself ! I would definately purchase this again .
 This product which my dermatologist instructed me to buy and use works well and the cost on Amazon.com is much less than on other medical and non-medical websites .
 I have been trying this on three different flat warts about 4-5 days a week for the past few weeks . I put a good glob on there and cover it with just the sticky part of a bandaid . After the first day a thick layer came off , which was encouraging , but since then I do n't really notice them getting smaller although each morning when I remove the bandaid it is white so I guess that means it 's trying . I have n't found anything yet to make flat warts go away completely - if and when I do I will let the whole world know !!
 I had a small wart on the side of my thumb for a couple of years . After about a month of using this daily , the wart is gone .
 Painless and simple to use . My warts are in the process of dying and I could n't be happier . However , my warts are still slightly there so I plan on using this product till they are completely gone .
 I had warts build up on my palms and fingers . They started out small till I tried tofreeze several of them off or pullout them out -LRB- ouch -RRB- . Went to the doctor to freeze , and my own freeze can from Dr , Scholl 's and nothing . Used a special natural oil , nothing.Used Terrasil and nothing . But the stick cleared them all up a tad over 3 weeks ! I usedit before bed . At times used it twice per day . After three days you see change with thewart drying out and shrinking .
 I like the clean applicator of this medication , rather than the gels/liquids which tend to get gunky quickly . The only drawback is that it appears like a lip balm , so you 'll want to keep it kept away safely for young ones and make mention to others who do n't look closely at labels . I also like that the percentage of the active ingredient is much higher than other brands . We 've only been using it a five days and we 're quickly seeing the efficacy of this product .
 i tried many products and it didnt work , but this stick i put it on my grandson wart and after 3weeks the wart started disappearing and after 2more weeks it was gone , but it is strong , so for kids , watch how much you put on them , but this stuff really works !
 This really works ! I had a wart on my foot that I had for over a year and went to 2 doctors and it would not go away until I used this stuff ! I put a hunk of this stuff on the wart and then covered it with a bandaid . I did it every day for 2-3 weeks . After a week the wart and the skin started peeling off . After 2-3 weeks it was gone !! I 'm am so happy ! It is important that you use it at least 4 to 5 times a week or it wo n't work . My daughter tried it but put it on sporatically and it did n't work for her .
 THIS PRODUCT WORKS WELL WITH OUT DAMAGING MY SKIN ... ! ITS SHRINKING THE WART , AND I HAVE VERY SENSITIVE SKIN , CANT EVEN USE MOST SOAPS ON THE MARKET , BUT HIS PRODUCT WAS KIND TO MY SKIN ... !!! YOU HAVE TO USE IT ALL THE TIME TO GET ANY RESULTS , BUT IT ALL DEPENDS , BUT IF ITS NOT WORKING FOR YOU , I WOULD TRY A SMALL PIECE OF FRESH BANANA PEEL TAPED OVER THE WART . . ! OR OVER THE WART , USE SOME DUCT ON THE WART ... ?
 Our nurse practitioner at out Pede 's office suggested this stick . It is the best wart remover ever . It does not stink ! It is not messy ! Use this with some duct tape twice a day and the warts are gone quickly . I had a wart on and off for two years . Nothing worked ! I got the wart stick and duct tape and 2 week later it was gone and months later has never came back .
 Planters warts on the feet are uncomfortable and difficult to treat . This wart stick makes it easy to apply the medicine exactly were you need it .
 Edit * Sorry I wrote this while I was a little excited the first time so let me reword it.Anyways . I had tried many other products to remove a wart that was growing on my thumb in a place that was very noticeable . I could n't even caress my fiances skin without bothering her with it 's roughness . This worked when others did n't . It was funny since I had tried everything from burning the wart off to cutting it off and then burning the wound , so that the wart would n't come back . That was after I tried too many over the counter meds that did n't work . This worked for me an it might for you . It 's awesome that the wart fell off with this product , after it had regrown back so many times in that same year!PS . I mostly used it 3-4 times a day and covered the spot with duct tape , every time.Be careful though , it looks just like chapstik . Your kids might put this in their mouth thinking it is !
 This item works wonderfully . I had tried tons of things for my son 's wart , but this got rid of it within a couple of weeks . I highly recommend it .
 I 've been using it for about 3 weeks and have n't been very good at remembering to apply it every day but it seems to be working . I 'm sure it would work better if I were more consistent .
 This product has the best strawberry flavor . It tastes like an actual lollipop . There is no hint of latex . Highly recommend . I have tried the Lifestyles flavored condoms , but they are no comparison . Durex rocks !
 I have used this product for years , as a matter of fact I bought two so I can always have one ready . I keep it in the freezer and use it to provide comfort at night . Every night , I get in bed and then ask my husband to `` go get the thing '' . I also use when I get migraines . Do n't get me wrong , this wo n't cure a true migraine - likely need some real medicine - but it provides a great deal of comfort while I am waiting for the drugs to work . It is just the right weight to provide some relief when placed over eyes . I highly recommend this product .
 I purchased the Large NeckEase by BodySense for my husband and the Sinus Pillow for myself and let me tell you , I can only say I wish I 'd gotten them sooner ! We both go to the Chiropractor and have the Mediflow Waterbased pillows -LRB- see my review for those and the pillow case -RRB- but the addition of these 2 items was a great investment . We both suffer from neck and back pain and arthritis so we have tried many different things to help ease our pain and discomfort.I 've used the Sinus Pillow twice now . We live in West TN and this time of year we can have some crazy weather - in the 70s one day and down to the 40s the next . This weather wreaks havoc on my sinuses , causing me lots of sinus pain and pressure and some pretty strong and painful , pounding headaches . I just heat my Sinus Pillow in the micro for the recommended time , lay down and place it over my eyes and nose and once again , it 's not long until I 'm fast asleep . Now , I 'm not going to say it took my headache away completely each time , but it sure does relieve the sinus pressure and greatly reduces the pounding pain in my head so that I can relax and fall asleep quite easily . The various scents given off from each pillow is wonderful and very soothing.My husband has used the NeckEase several times already and I used it the other night ... heated it in the micro , wrapped it around my neck and climbed into bed for the night . Was very comfortable laying there with my head on my Mediflow Waterbased pillow and before I knew it I was fast asleep!I would recommend both of these products and look forward to using them for years . And after reading the reviews of the BodySense Large Pack and Extra Large Pack I am putting those on my wishlist for purchase of one or both in the very near future !
 Well I did n't know it was a health food ! I just bought it because friends were always bringing some tasty dish to a pot luck , and when it was one of those creations that made you ask for the recipe , well , most of the times the 'd say `` and it has some Bragg 's amino 's in it . . '' Kinda salty , not in a bad way , kinda like soy sauce , like a rich expensive soy sauce , kinda smokey , like adding a special kick to some foods ; greens , mashed taters , soup , rice , even popcorn.Contains Amino Acids ? like in protein ? yep . And it 's cruelty free eating , so there .
 Like many americans , I am trying to eat better , I am lowering my intake of sodium , fat , and all those extra calories that condiments can bring ! I love soy sauce , it adds so much flavor to my meals and yet the sodium content is through the roof , i might as well spoon the salt right on my carefully prepared dinner . Bragg Liquid Aminos -LRB- could the name be more non appetizing sounding ? -RRB- is a product that claims its just like your go to soy sauce but with no calories and more importantly less sodium , and its all natural.I really love it , and was pleasantly surprised at how it tastes . It is almost undistinguishable from regular soy sauce , it is a bit `` heartier '' in its flavor but that just means a little will go a long way . I highly recommend it to anyone trying to cut the sodium out of thier diet but not the taste !
 Braggs is so delicious that I am tempted to drink from the bottle . It 's good on everything ! It 's more than a soy sauce substitute and tastes so much better . I ca n't explain it ... It 's just delicious . Oh on mushrooms !!! My mouth is watering right now .
 I learned about Bragg Liquid Aminos from my daughter , a fitness expert . Always wanting to limit sodium and additives , she is a big fan of this product . So , I bought a bottle at my local health food store and have been very impressed!PROS : Very tasty , especially when I substitute Bragg for soy sauce in my Mongolian Beef dish.Has become readily available in grocery stores ... . this should eventually help the cost factor.Much lower in sodium content than soy sauce ... all natural protein made from soybeans and distilled water . ** NOTE
 My hubbie wanted this since he read about it 's health benefits -LRB- we all need amino acids ! -RRB- . We have found that it is really yummy - a great salt substitute -LRB- kindof tastes like soy sauce , and is pretty salty tasing - though not actually high in salt -RRB- . We even use it as salad dressing and veggie dressing , in addition to in stir fry and other -LRB- roasts , casseroles -RRB- .
 This is a good product and it smells nice . I intend to keep Mango Magic Foot Lotion in my home from now on . Not only is this a good lotion to use but the company , Pedifix , is responsive to the needs of customers and handle all complaints quickly so I will be buying from them .
 Purchased at local store and was doubting the lotion working but loved the smell right away . Took home applied to feet thinking I would be slipping and sliding on my wood floors but after a minute it had absorbed completly into my skin and my feet feel supple and non-sticky . Smooth and Soft . I now use head to toe and love the way it makes my dry summer skin feel soft and smooth . Love the smell but it is not to over powering like some bath and body lotions or body butters . Will definatly purchase again .
 Mango Magic Is the best I have ever used.I am a Diabetic , I need cream to keep feet In good shape.It dries fast and keeps feet soft.Try It you wo n't regret It .
 I love this lotion - it 's not just for my feet ; it 's great for the whole body !

 Having used an over the counter well known corn remover brand with success , but which took to long , I decided to go with this product . It was easy and worked in half the time of the product I previously used . Highly recommend to anyone who has problems with corns .
 this beats repeated wimpy 2 % liquid applications to pieces ! it is a stronger solution in wax and stays PUT , especially if you put a bandaid over it . it will destroy a wart and even callous tissue when used properly . If you do n't want the rest of nearby skin to get irritated , then put a protectant over it before applying the stick , and ONLY use the stick on the area you need removed ; this is CONCENTRATED .
 I had three corns in different areas under my feet . Tried many , many things -LRB- including Dr. Scholls ' liquid , patches etc -RRB- but none would actually take work till the end to remove the corns . Pedifix is actually quite strong , but its very convenient to use since its a stick and thats why I could use it even on the one corn that was in between my toes . None of the other patches , liquids or stuff could be applied there . I absolutely love this thing . As a matter of fact I still have 80-90 % of the stick unused -LRB- even after removing 3 corns -RRB- .
 This really is a miracle cream for dry , cracked feet . I 'm surprised this is n't more well known or advertised . I do n't have to use it every day , but at first just apply it , put a sock on and wear it all day , no need to do it at night , unless you are comfortable wearing socks . In 3 days the cracks were gone and the skin on my heels was soft . I only wish the seller did n't take 3 months to ship it to me . I 'll have to find another supplier in future . The 2nd half of my order finally arrived on May 21 , 2012 .
 Cream feels fabulous ... already seeing a difference in my heels ! I bought the heel sock with it and it works wonderfully ! Highly recommend .
 Recently had foot surgery that left my feet dry and flaky . My cousin had the same sugery a few months earlier and purchased this cream at the podiatrist office and highly recommended . I found it at Amazon for a fourth of the price she paid , so I purchased 2 for her and 2 for myself at about the same price she paid for one jar . The cream is great and does the job compared to other procuts I was using including vaseline which is greasy .
 This cream is the best I have tried for dry feet . It 's not going to take off a corn -- still need a dermatologist for that . But it will help quite a bit for relatively little money .
 I tried this product first , and then went to another one for comparison . I came back to Deep-Healing as I feel it worked best . I would recommend it .
 I have been fighting dry cracked heels for years.Mine have gotten so bad that they crack open and feel like I 'm walking on a nail with every step . I have tried tons of different creams to try to alleviate the painful cracking and this stuff works by far the best of any I have tried in the past . I use it with the Visco-GEL Heel-So-Smooth Heel Sleeves which I got on Amazon too . Together they are awesome !! Do n't know if the cream works as well by itself because it works so well with the Visco-Gel sleeves I have n't tried it any other way .
 I have cracked , dry skin on the heels of my feet . . This cream was soothing , but I have to use it morning and night in order to feel results.If I skip a day , the skin is dry again.I must use it on a regular basis . .
 ONLY thing that has worked on my feet ! Had huge crack and could not walk for months . Will get more when run out !
 bought it for my heels , great my fiancee loves it , hope to buy a few more , it keeps the heels very soft .
 My podiatrist recommended this product . Does a wonderful job of keeping feet free of dry skin . Not greasy ... readily absorbs into skin .
 Pies agrietados , cansados , esto soluciona eso y mas hasta para los codos y partes del cuerpo rugosas sirve con unas cuantas aplicaciones se soluciona y deja los pies suaves y con una sensaci&oacute;n de frescura luego de caminar todo el dia
 Recently purchased a jar of this from a shoe store and had seen such a great difference in the softness of my heals . It 's not greasy either , which is a plus ! Use it twice a day -LRB- when I remember -RRB- and recommend it to anyone with those annoying cracked heals . Foot Cream Deep Healing Pedifix - 4 OZ
 I 've been using the foot cream and foot wash for a little more than a year now.I have some foot problems that just wo n't ever go away , but this helps a lot . It still wo n't go away , but it 's much more manageable than it ever was.Great product and I have n't found anything that 's worked better yet .
 This is the only foot cream that actually works wonders on my dry , cracked feet . . and I 've tried them all ... Used regularly , it works like magic .
 Great Suplement for deficiencies . Makes a good difference in how my brain feels ... after feeling like I was somehow missing something . It was n't a headache .
 This is my first review evever but after having problems with Athletes Foot and Heel cracks for almost thirty years this stuff has cured it in less then 4 weeks . My feet are looking better then ever and now I am actually realizing that it removes the callus built up as well . I have used this in conjunction with a tea tree oil that I massage directly to my feet when in the tub maybe once or twice a week . The only negative I realize is that my feet are smelling and sweating a little now which they have never before . But this is a small sacrifice now that I am able to walk on them without the pain and bleeding.I am reordering now . Get the soap , it works .
 This product helped clean up my skin fungal infection and it smells great . I love hot the peppermint tingles your private area .
 The smell is kinda strong , but it is working like a charm . My feet do n't smell bad and my feet are less sweatier . I recommne
 I just received this product and I already see a difference in the texture of the skin on the bottom of my feet . I have only used it twice ... but the dry skin is starting to crumble off . I am not saying that this is a miracle soap yet ... I will have to see if my toenails improve . I would expect this to take a month or so . And I also bought it because I too am going through menopause and as one user stated , you sweat in places that you never did before . Especially good for underarm perspiration . The soap has a strong smell at first but it does subside . You will feel clean , clean , clean and totally refreshed . I am skeptical of reviews that state the toenail fungus disappeared in a week or so ... but this soap so far is excellent as a body wash and foot soak . So for this I will rate it a 5 at this stage .
 Great soap , leaves you smelling fresh and clean . Great as a body wash . I do n't believe reviews are fake . . there are still some great products out there . People rate a product when they are really happy or really disappointed . In this case , this is a terrific product and worth trying .
 I purchased PekiFix for a diabetic family member who was going through a cycle of infection on her feet that nothing seemed to help . Even the products recommended by her physician seemed to do little to help . When she tried this soap , the relief was notable , and I immediately reordered for her continued use.This is an excellent product , certainly worthy of a try .
 It worked to calm the athletes foot , the itching but it does not go away completely . Definitely did help , it helped make my feet smoother and not crack .
 Wow . This product is marketed and the instructions are for use on athlete 's foot , but obviously Jock Itch is the same type of fungal infection . I was having trouble with recurring infections , even though I kept curing them with Lotrimin . They kept coming back . But this soap works amazing . It cleared up any fungal / bacterial nonsense that was still cooking down there , and now I use it every time I shower . It 's basically a male douche haha . Smells like Pine Sol , and it has peppermint oil in it so it cools the skin with an icy sensation . Also if your skin is already red and angry , you should expect this product to burn when you apply it to the affected skin . But it 's not too bad as long as you 're expecting it .
 If you 've smelled tea tree oil , you might think this product will not smell very good but it really does . It has a type of minty smell while showering and the tea tree oil smell does not cling to you after your shower.This soap works very well if your skin is prone to fungal infections . Works on feet and is an effective all over body wash . I 'm really pleased to find products that just do what they say they will do and this is one of them .
 This is my first review and I must say it could not be for a better product . Unlike others on the site , I bought this to combat my stinky feet issue . Which may be disgusting to some people , but it happens . It was not due to fungi or other similar problems stated in reviews , but more because of a general forgetfulness in bending over to wash and DRY -LRB- which is so important -RRB- my feet . I also wear ballet flats often , which do not require socks , so my feet get dirty easily . I must say that just soaking my feet in this soap has done wonders . My feet stink no longer . I would highly recommend this wash/soak . I soak it in warm water for a good 30 minutes and my feet just feel -LRB- and look -RRB- clean . I would also recommend Avon 's Foot Spray and OdorEaters . They 've all worked very well.P.S . The FungaSoap 's tingling sensation feels so very good .
 Really like this product . It is really cold in the north-east and I wear socks all the time , even like to sleep with socks and it was making my toes itch . The first time I used this , it stopped the itch . I just put a couple of drops on a small sponge and wash my feet with it . The itch is completely gone . Great product . Will purchase it again .
 It takes forever to secure an appointment with my dermatologist , obtain a prescription , and finally have the tinea versicolor treatment available at my local pharmacy . If I 'm lucky , it would take 1 week for the entire process , and that 's if I 'm even able to schedule an appointment within the next month -_- On top of that , the prescription shampoo and ointment that I receive for my tinea versicolor smells like sewage , takes forever to work -LRB- approximately 3 months before the spots and shiny dry patches start to disappear -RRB- , and stains my clothes if I accidentally touch them with the shampoo on my skin.I ordered Fungasoap because my dermatologist appointment was n't until next month , but I really could n't wait to treat my tinea versicolor -LRB- it spreads and gets worse every day ; it spread from my stomach to my back , and from my underarms to my arms -RRB- Wow , does this stuff work . I am so so so happy with the results ! I 've only been using this for a week and a half ... . The spots are already fading , the itchiness from the dry patches of skin are subsiding , and this stuff is really not a hassle to use , unlike my prescription treatment . I 'm not saying this will definitely work for you if you have tinea versicolor , because I 've tried other remedies like selsun blue and it did nothing for me . Then again , it really does n't hurt to at least try this soap !
 this stuff is awesome -- if you have athletes in your family this is what you need -- we tried everything including prescriptions to get rid of athletes foot fungus and rashes to legs -- kept getting reinfected every time they went back to the tumbling mats and gym ... UNTIL we started using this -- washed all equipment in this soap , and our athletes use it daily in the shower on all exposed skin surfaces year round ... it only took about a week of consistent use and the fungus was completely cleared up and has not been back ... I even used it on my dogs feet and it cleared up the rusty looking stains on his feet that he chewed constantly despite Rx from our vet ... we are on the auto delivery program for this stuff and never want to give it up
 Wonderful , we picked up a fungus down in NC , soap has been super in taking care of the issue.Relieve the discomfort of itching and dryness
 This stuff works ! It totally does . Yes . Like it works on all parts of the body . It 's great . Really . I hate having to type so many words for a review .
 Feet smell goes away fast after wearing tennis shoes or hiking boots for long days . Gets rid of itching and sensitive spots from shoe rubbing are not bothered by the soap . Strong smell - not really good or bad to me .
 This is a very good product . Refreshing smell and does a great job . Buy the large size for twice the size but less money . The small does n't last long enough .
 The product has a nice scent -LRB- slightly strong - but does not last -RRB- . It lathers well and makes feel clean and feel fresh . I am not sure how effective it really is on eliminating fungus but still like the product . It is worth purchasing . I would have given the product 5 starts but the spout on top of the container is not effective and lets more soap out than needed . A top like on a dish soap bottle would have been better or at least one with a smaller opening .
 Ok , I had a bad case of big toenail fungus , about 90 % coverage and my nail was falling off , picked this up after reading about tea tree oil , and I can happily say that my nail is now completely clean and healthy ! thanks to this soap.I tell you a bit about my regimen , maybe it will help somebody , the first thing you will notice is , well basically nothing ! for more than a month of use I could not tell if the product was working , in fact at times it seems that my fungus had gotten worst , nonetheless I kept using it ; I would trim my bad nail as much as I could and I would wash my toe with the soap , when I shower , which generates plenty foam , sometimes at night before going to bed I would apply a few drops of the oil undiluted.I did this everyday for more than a month until empty , and I was really disappointment because I did n't see any improvement , I went ahead and cut the rest of the bad nail , which it seemed to fall off rather easily , and started to look into more expensive alternatives , but a couple of weeks later I noticed my nail starting to grow back , and this time it was clean ! none of the discolored , thick stuff!I 'm happy with this product , my nail is completely cured and as much as I hope never having to use it again , I would trust it 100 % .
 I pruchase this to help with a toe nail fungus that had gotten so bad that the toe nail had to be removed . I have had bad heel calouses all my life . 1/4 '' thick and cracking that I put lotion on every night . I started washing my feet with this product when I had my toe nail removed , and I washed my entire foot with it . Whithin 1 week I noticed a difference with the calouses on my heels . I am amazed , my heels have not looked this good in years , no lotion , vaseline and socks , have ever done this good of a job on my heels .
 I have treated a variety of symptoms with this wash ! Our family keeps it regularly in the showers . We have bathed away many irritants from dermatatis to athletes ' foot . It is gentle , smells fresh and we use it daily with wonderful results . Combined with keeping the shower floor cleaned up with some Clorox spray , this keeps our athletes ' foot away .
 This product worked better than I could have imagined . I have really tried it all , athlete 's foot has been a problem all my life . Playing sports or being active to where my feet were constantly an issue , I was finally able to find something that worked , and did n't just work a little the first time and than leveled off . It feels great to use , and I could feel the tingle of the soap working almost immediately when I used it . TRY IT - YOU 'LL LOVE IT !!
 I have been suffering from tenia versicolor and acne on my back for almost 10 years . I have tried many products
 When i was 13 i ended up with tinea versicolor , which is a fungal skin infection that changes the normal pigmentation of the skin and i ended up with discolored white patches of skin everywhere ! . My skin was very severe , it looked like a frogs skin . The discolored white patches were everywhere , my back , chest , stomach , arms , butt , face and thighs . Doctors gave me many different lotions , pills and creams to try to get the pigmentation to go away and reduce the look of the white patches on my tan skin . Nothing worked that the doctor gave up , so i searched the internet desperate because i was sad everyone kept staring at me when summer comes . Then I heard about this funga soap.I didnt trust it but since i tried everything else I gave it a shot . I used it everyday for a week . And two weeks later the patches are fading and some areas dispeared ! some are really small , some blended in with my regular skin . I was so happy . I cant wait to finish this bottle and see how my skin will look after . Nothing worked and this did , after many years of stuff i was given . How i used it
 I 've never left a review for anything but I felt like I needed to for this . I 've had a bad breakout of ringworm on both of my legs for the past few years . I 've tried every cream and spray but nothing seemed to phase it . After about 2 weeks of using this soap every day , my infection cleared up almost entirely . I really could n't believe it . This product has been a real life saver .
 This is really great for getting those tough fungal infections . I have constantly battled with several infections all over and have done many things , over the counter ointments and sprays , prescription drugs , etc. . The only thing that remotely worked was vinegar on my feet and it is tough to bathe in vinegar -LRB- as well as costly -RRB- . This soap worked really well for me , and I started seeing results within a few days . My only complaint would be that it does n't come in a bigger bottle as 6oz is not really enough to use as body wash on a daily basis . I would not expect this to rid you of an infection in a week or two but I would say that I have had much better results with this than anything else I have tried .
 My boyfriend had the world 's WORST SMELLING feet !!!!! So his socks constantly smell like death and normal laundry soap just does n't get rid of the smell . I decided to use FungaSoap along with our normal detergent to see if it would help with the smell ... boy it sure did ! Using FungaSoap as an additional detergent really got rid of the smell , so I recommend this product to anyone who might have a foot odor or body odor . Just add one squeeze around the washer .
 My daughter has tried all medicines , but this used twice per dayfor 4 weeks got it to a point where you could not see it.great product and I like the smell .
 I have had nail fungus under three toenails since I was a young child . I have tried many products both prescription -LRB- Lamisil and Penlac -RRB- and over the counter and none have made any difference . I work at a drug store and have tried virtually every product we sell and they have made no difference . I have tried all the home remedies such as soaking in vinegar , vaseline , tea tree oil , etc. . The vinegar and tea tree oil have done more than anything else . When I saw this I thought it was economical and I would try it to see.While some have doubted the reviews as being original , I was willing to give it a try . It is too soon to gauge if this is a miracle product and I am sure it will be months before I know it it works or not . What I can say it that I really like this product and plan to continue its use based solely on my first months of use.I use it daily in the shower . It lathers well and it does n't take more than a teaspoonful on a new nail brush . I lather up the brush and briskly scrub my toes and toenails . Then I scrub the remainder of my feet as well . What noticed is that my `` healthy '' nails are bright white on the tips , the rough skin around my toenails is now sloughed off , and my feet in general look healthier . After one month I can see that the nails with the fungus are growing out without any of the usual deformity at the base . I will update as time goes by and these nails grow out.This product has a very fresh and somewhat medicinal smell which disipates after a few minutes out of the shower . I have recently purchased the foot soak that is the complimenting product to this wash and will review it after a few uses as well .
 This past summer I 'd done quite a bit of exercising and work around the house -LRB- building decks in sweltering heat , etc -RRB- and it was the first time I 'd ever gotten a heat rash at all . Kept getting them every couple of weeks , and eventually when none of the cortisone cream worked to fully remove it for any great length of time , the fourth time I got a heat rash it developed into something else . I did n't know if it was a jock itch type fungal rash or a yeast infection on the skin , but it was getting red and scaly and was burning rather than itching , and being in my hip flexor area rather than the groin area , it was an odd place to have gotten it . As usual I Googled the hell out of whatever rash it could be , and something was mentioned somewhere about something similar to this . So when I came to Amazon and searched that product , this one came up in the search results as well , and had many more happy reviewers and more 5 star ratings . After reading of all the success others had , I ordered it , and used it just as the directions state on the bottle . You can feel the tingling sensation when you wash the affected area with it , and just for future reference , the less it tingles , the more your infection/rash is going away . Immediately after using it I had some relief from the burning heat it was throwing off , and literally within 3 days , it was as if the rash had nearly disappeared . Some have said it smells badly , but I think it smells great . Almost like a Vicks type smell , only with more of an earthy scent than a menthol one . Three washes , it was almost totally gone . Once it was gone for good , I would use the soap on the same area every few showers or so , just to keep it in check . Once the summer was over , I did n't need to use it anymore , but now I know what I 'll be using from now on through each and every summer to prevent them from happening . DO NOT HESITATE TO BUY THIS PRODUCT !!! It truly is like watching a magic trick happen , that 's how fast and drastic the healing was .
 I began having tinea versicolor my sophomore year of college on both of my ankles . At the time I thought they were just a strange arrangement of freckles so I did n't do anything about it . Flash forward 4 years and I still had n't done anything about it , but by know both patches had grown to cover the posterior aspect of nearly my entire lower legs , and wrapped around to the anterior portion of both legs . I began using both 2.5 % selenium sulfide and 1 % clotrimazole to treat it . The clotrimazole seemed to work well at first but then I began to have a skin reaction to it . The selenium sulfide worked minimally , I 'm guessing because the tinea had been growing so long.After 2 weeks of minimal results I switched to this FungaSoap Tea Tree oil . This has been the only product with which I have seen a marked improvement in my tinea versicolor ! In about a week 's time , the patches have dramatically faded , nearly to my normal skin color , and the borders of each patch have shrunk to about 1/2 their size before treatment began . This is a great product that has worked many times better than prescription strength products.A few things to keep in mind
 I had a mysterious rash on my Rear -LRB- crack -RRB- for atleast 6 months . It felt like athletes foot ; it looked like a diaper rash ; one doctor thought it was 5 different skin conditions and test cultures came back with 7 different mysterious results -LRB- no diseases -RRB- ... which lead me to a fortune of prescriptions . Another doctor had his own opinion and recommended more prescription meds & treatments . I researched every rash on the internet and tested out as many over-the-counter treatments as I could find -LRB- soaps , creams , everything ! -RRB- . Additionally , I changed my diet and tried natural remedies too . I suspected , through all my research , that I get a skin rash called Intertrigo . -LSB- ... -RSB- Eventually , I came across this product on Amazon . Already , many dollars in debt and my booty still hurting , I purchased `` PediFix-TeaTree Ultimates-FungaSoap '' & `` Baza-Moiture Barrier Antifungal Cream . '' Whatever the reason this has happened to me , sweating during exercise , chaffing panties , hormonal imbalances . . I 'm prone to this skin condition . THE ONLY PRODUCTS THAT NOT ONLY HELPED , THEY CLEARED UP MY RASH were `` PediFix-TeaTree Ultimates-FungaSoap '' & `` Baza-Moiture Barrier Antifungal Cream . '' I HONESTLY & HIGHLY recommend these 2 products !!! I use both as preventative treatments now . I also read that `` Zeasorb AF powder '' works great for this so I 'll be buying that too.Burrows solution did not work and the Domburro powder I ordered never arrived -LRB- do n't waste time there ! -RRB- The doctors did n't help me . I had to be my own advocate and research my own symptoms and cure . These 2 products are the only treatments that helped me !
 I love pedicures . I get them year round . Unfortunately to much nail polish can be bad for our toe nails . . My toe nails began to change a yellow tint color . I bought this product it has cleared my nails ! Now I sometimes wear only clear polish to show off my clear nails !
 I purchased this product after a need for it developed in my armpits . I had been using Terbinafine Hydrochloride 1 % for a few wks to no avail . I did n't -LRB- and have n't -RRB- seen a doctor due to no insurance and costly dr visits , but am about 99 % sure its a fungus . What makes this product so effective is the Tea Tree oil . I have been using this which has keep the fungus in check and prevented it from spreading , in combination with 91 % rubbing alcohol and a switch over to Butenafine hydrochloride 1 % . I like to wash n rinse with the soap 2-3 times in the shower , then when I get out take some toilet paper w / the alcohol and just hold it over the rash for a good 2-5 mins -LRB- longer in the beginning stages -RRB- then dry off the area and apply the cream . I have also been using this soap all over and have notice that the bottoms of my feet have softened up tremedously , and the acne on my face has cleared up along with its complexion . I will be replacing my normal body wash with this and using it on a daily basis.You have to help your body fight off these things just not rely on creams and soaps . There are foods out there , such as garlic , onions , coconut shreds etc. that aid your body in clearing it up quicker . Do your research ! Usually what your see externally is just a piece of whats happening internally!Funguses are growing more prevailant in our ever growing sterilization efforts as a society due to their mutations to adapt . I attribute my inability to iradicate the fungus in a timely fashion to this . Ppl do n't be afraid of a little dirt and grime it makes us stronger in the long run .
 I , like a few other folks in the reviews , picked this FungaSoap up for my feet . I noted the smell was a bit like a bathroom cleaner at first , I 've grown to be okay with it and when you wash the soap off you smell `` clean . '' I noted on the bottle to use it as a full body wash , and it 's definitely awesome for that . I have very sensitive skin and prone to bad breakouts on my shoulders and back , however I noted a large improvement since switching to this . Recommended .
 I purchased this product because I was going camping and spending time at the beach . Knowing that things live in the woods and sand that are very fungal and like human skin I figured I would be on the proactive side of the attack this time . It has been wonderful . I knew it had tee tree oil in it but was pleasantly surprised with the Coconut , Olive and Peppermint oils . This product attacked a fungus I did not even know I had but can guess I got it from the local pool too . I now use it after every time I am in public spaces , especially the watery kind .
 I am a diabetic & I was lucky to find this product a few years ago when phlebitis and cellulitis in my legs were a big problem.Not only is Pedifix 's Funga Soap easy to use it 's also soothing and helps to keep the irritation under control.You can feel the relief immediately . I would highly recommend this product to one and all!The quick & efficient way Amazon was able to provide me with an inexpensive yet dependable source made my orderingeasy & the shipment was sent immediately.I could n't ask for a better service .
 The best stuff to get rid of Filicilitis , tried everything the doctor gave us and this I found on the Internet ... the best by far
 Thank goodness I found this product it has been heaven sent ! I used to have the worse ring worm problem behind my neck . Since I was always surrounded in moist areas due to swimming and working out . I had to be on a strict regimen of apple cider vinegar and putting that on the affected areas with a cotton swab everyday and it stung a lot . It comes and goes but since I started using this product I dont always have to be on the apple cider vinegar because I can wash my neck and my face with it -LRB- since I have the same small problem near my eyelids . It really is a relief and I tell you what , it is a great product for the money . My fungus problems are almost gone which is why I definitely recommend it .
 Does exactly what it says.It has natural ingredients and serves as a good preventative.Feels fine on my sensitive skin .
 Husband gets poison ivy rash every weekend on our farm ! This product , one from a wide variety tried and tested , works ! It relieves the old man 's irritation and my sanity from his complaining . I like it also . We now use as a body wash . No other product needed !
 I love it , it 's a great soap to have . My skin loves it and it does n't dry you out . It gets your body very clean , better than ordinary bar soaps .
 I have been using this product now for at least 3 years and there is nothing that works better for keeping your toenails healthy . Tea Tree is excellent for any fungus and is also good for the body . It is non-drying to the skin and makes your skin feel very clean . I recommend it ! Amazon is one of the only places I can find it .
 It just does n't smell that good -LRB- to me -RRB- . . Maybe it will smell like bacon and eggs and fresh coffee to someone else . No but seriously , this stuff works . I work out three times a week and I started to get athletes foot so I started using some cream but putting on the cream everyday is annoying . If you just wash your feet with this stuff every time you shower you should not get any fungus . It will clear up any you already have . Buy it . It 's way cheaper than the powders and creams too . .
 I work retail and am on my feet constantly . Before I discovered this product my feet itched and burned no matter what products I used . Now I just wash my feet everyday with Fungasoap and I do n't have problems with my feet anymore .
 This product seems to work very well . I like having it on hand to use in the shower when I feel it is needed.Wouldn ' t mind the price to be a bit lower .
 This product was not as &#34; tingly &#34; as some others , but did provide solid anti-fungal protection while I was traveling . I think that the product does what it says , but it 's hard to truly quantify it since I was using it in conjunction with other products .
 Product has a strong odor but keeps your feet dry I loved it.No more sweaty feet not sure about how it works on fungus because I do not have any but worked good for sweaty feet .
 It makes a difference . I used it last night and feel it really is helpful in treating foot fungal problems .
 Works perfectly for any kind of itch wether jock or around toes . Just apply to affected area and massage in medicated soap and you 'll feel it work instantly , removing the itch . If you 're situation is n't too serious just get the 6oz bottle . For me this was more then enough . Still have 70 percent of the bottle left . Wan na buy some ?
 I love this product it works !!!!! It gets rid of fungas on your toes and it leaves your feet refreshed !!!! I bought this product in the past on saw a big difference on my toes !!!!
 I bought this product based on other reviewers liking it to banish fungal foot problems . I started taking yoga class at the gym twice a week and , after the 1st week , noticed a peeling toes ! They were mostly peeling at the tips where you place them on the mat for downward dog . Anyway , I was grossed out since I usually do not have athlete foot problems . So I used this for 2-3 days in a row and then a couple times a week after yoga class once the problem cleared up . And you do not need much , use a few drops on a nail brush for each foot and start scrubbing the fungus away . It has a strong tea tree scent , but I like , and I know it is working and it dissipates in a few minutes . It 's worth it ! It 's also worth to clean the yoga mat periodically to get rid of the fungus from the nasty gym floor .
 First of all , if you do n't have acne -LRB- like me -RRB- and you are n't sensitive to tea tree oil , this is a great wash for your face . Check out those ingredients ! All very good stuff in there . I use it to remove makeup from my hands after applying it , and I do use it in the summer time and before pedicures because it 's got a great fresh smell . Too bad the name is kind of embarrassing , but I do n't mind . It 's too good !
 This product is no longer sold in stores but is extremely effective and worth every penny . Best remedy for treating funal problems .
 This seems like a great all around body wash soap . I love the smell and effects of Tea Tree Oil on my skin and it is great to wash with !
 Worked really well . I have been using on a rash area on my back & now is almost all gone .
 It smells a bit weird . . Like floor cleaner , but this soap gets the job done and actually cured my athletes foot that I had for quite a while -LRB- and would not go away with the other treatments -RRB-
 This product arrived on time . Does what was promised . I would recommend this product to anyone in need of its specialty .
 I would highly recommend using this immediately before applying fungal medication topically . Use both twice a day . Most fungal infections take some time to eradicate , so do n't quit the treatment too quickly . Several weeks of treatment are usually needed , sometimes several months . This soap greatly aids in treating fungal infections .
 I really felt like this was great for a nice clean wash - not sure how effective it is , as Tea Tree is one of the later items on the list , but it smelt like it .
 I love the price and convenience of this soap . I had been using a more expensive anti-fungal scrub recommended by my podiatrist and was elated to find this on Amazon . I like the convenience and the price .
 Fungus of the foot is the worst , and so hard to treat and cure , how ever this helped a little bit , I like to see this product with a anti itch ingredient .
 My little boy had a rash on his neck and back that would not go away . His doctor did n't think it was anything serious and recommended hydrocortisone ointment -LRB- which did absolutely nothing and I am not a fan of continuous use of steroids , even if its over the counter -RRB- . I jumped on amazon to see if I could find something mild to use on him . I found this item and was immediately interested because I often use tea tree oil for many different reasons . Once I received this product , I immediately began to use it once a day on during his bath on the rash on his neck/back . Within 3 days , the rash was gone . This product is lightly scented , mild , and does not leave any residue . I even use it to wash his hair -LRB- it helped his dry scalp -RRB- .
 I LOVE this product . This is my second purchase . It gives me relief from the plague of athletes foot . I appreciate this soap very much and am glad I gave it a try .
 I read all of the previous reviews and thought I 'd give this product a try . I have had cracked heels for years that my husband has repeatedly told me was due to foot fungus . I 've tried athlete 's foot sprays and creams which work for a while but then stop . After only a few days of cleaning my feet with this product my heels are almost completely smooth ! I 've never had that fast of a response using sprays and creams . Plus , I 've been using it as a body-wash and have noticed a decrease in body odor after I exercise . I love this stuff !
 Worked well on itch . Its certainly no miracle cure . Like other reviews say you have to use it everyday . I will probably buy this again .
 This is a good product . Our family is using it to discourage mites , scabies , etc as we are exposed to these things in the mountains with the friendly outdoor critters at our door to be fed daily . I researched and the products designed for this are expensive . This has many of the same ingredients , such as tea tree oil . I mix it with an antibacterial product . Even use it as shampoo and body wash for myself and on dogs too . I do not like these pesky little irritants ! Nor do my little dogs , who had never had a flea before we moved here . It is not just for feet . I recommend it .
 I picked this up to use as a cooling foot soak , and when I read on the bottle that it can be used as a body wash I tried it.After spending nearly 35 years struggling with a skin rash that did not respond to dermatologists ' treatments , I found this product began to heal my rash the first time ! I was so excited that I continued using it on the areas with the rash and it compeletely went away . When I ran out , I did n't get a new bottle right away , and the rash reappeared ! I immediately purchased another bottle , and the rash went away as it had the first time.Based on my experience and reading those of other reviewers , I have to say that this is truly the most versatile product I have ever used !
 I have been using FungaSoap for 5 months for toenail fungus on all five toes on one foot -LRB- go figure -RRB- . I just use it in the shower with a soft nailbrush all around all five nails . My new nails are growing in beautifully . And , I have nailpolish on my toes and it 's still working !! I use it in combination with Clearly Confident Antifungal cream . I had been using the cream for over a year with minimal improvement , but when I added the fungasoap , it really started to clear my nails up . I use the cream at night and then scrub it off with the fungasoap and nailbrush in the morning in the shower . This combination is working well for me !! Halleluia !!
 I 've been suffering with a stubborn ringworm infection for the past 9 months . I 've tried everything from over-the-counter creams to prescription topical and oral meds . Nothing has really worked . At one point my torso was completely covered front to back , as were the backs of my thighs , and I had a few spots on my arms , neck , calves , and between my toes . It spread so quickly I could n't keep up with it , even with the prescription meds , and I used everything as directed religiously . The main problem with my infection is that it would appear to be responding to treatment , and then all of a sudden `` jump '' to a new area of my skin and flourish . As soon as one section cleared up , another section would get really bad , and it would take another two months to get it under control . Meanwhile , a new section would pop up , and so on . I finally got tired of going back to the doctor and decided to do some research on alternative remedies . I happened upon FungaSoap , and have been using it along with 100 % tea tree oil for about three months with excellent results . I use the FungaSoap as an all over body wash once a day , and after I shower I apply the tea tree oil with a cotton ball to the affected areas . This combination helped get all current areas of infection under control , and I strongly believe the FungaSoap stopped the cycle of spreading . I am down to a few almost indistinguishable spots , with no new breakouts in over a month . I 'll continue to use both products until everything is completely gone , and for a couple of months after that to avoid recurrence . I could n't be happier with this product . I was desperate and embarrassed and dreading the warmer months , but now I can wear my bikini again with confidence.A note about the smell
 I really like that not only did this product help with my little `` fungus problem '' but it also makes a great everyday cleanser ! The only problem I have with Tea Tree Ultimates FungaSoap Cleansing Wash is that you ca n't use it for shampooing -- why ? why ? Why have the gods of convenience forsaken me ?
 using this soap daily as a body wash for about 10 days took care of tinea versicolor -LRB- covering the whole back , some neck/chest-possibly misdiagnosed ?? -RRB- that we 've been struggling with for over 3 years ! doctor prescribed pills , it always came back . doctor said use tea tree oil and nizoral , it helped a little bit but could never clear up the problem . I happened to stumble on this soap when searching amazon for nizoral.so far so good with fungasoap ! We 're using it every other day or so now ... I 'm not sure if the tinea versicolor will return but at least there 's something that finally works . I 'll probably always try to keep some on hand .
 Love this Tea Tree Oil Soap . My son takes a lot of serious seizure meds and went through aggressive chemotherapy for testicular cancer two years ago . I believe both of these issues are the reason he is having so much trouble with his skin , hair and nails . It is likely that his natural immunity to minor bacterium and fungus has been compromised . He uses tea tree oil soap once/day now , every day and I believe it helps a lot and makes his skin just feel good . We 're hooked .
 If you suffer from Intertrigo , this product is a life saver . It cleans and soothes so much better than regular soap products , and a little goes a long way .
 I could n't get along without this product . As soon as the hot weather comes I have a hard time controlling the itch in my feet -LRB- fungal problems -RRB- . This product works wonderfully - I use it as the last thing I do in the shower and the effects last most of the day . I hardly have to resort to anti fungal creams at all . It 's just terrific .
 I use this on my feet a lot , either in the shower or my foot bath machine . My feet feel great afterwards . It has a nice scent to it as well . Though my only complaint would be the price ... $ 16 is a little expensive to me so I try to use it carefully .
 A bit like a cleaner on the smell , but it 's effective against athlete 's foot . It clears up the itchyness sometimes almost instantly after washing . The patches seemed to disappear after 1 week .
 This product is works well . Definetly worth buying . I 've had Tinea Versicolor for years . After a couple of weeks , it is all gone .
 My 12 year old daughter has battled the curse of stinky feet since the poor kid was about 5 . This has been most effective compared to our arsenal of powders and creams . Impressive !
 This tea tree oil product was very helpful for my daughter , who has an ongoing problem with white patches on her skin that she finds unsightly . The product does n't cure the problem , but gets it under control and smells pleasant too .
 I used to travel the world and I always used a fungus product of some sort . I recommend and business man or traveler to use this produc
 I had been battling athlete 's foot for about a year and a half when I decided to try this stuff . I started noticing improvement almost immediately , and after a week or so of using it once daily , things were almost all the way gone . I 'd recommend it to anyone trying to get rid of athlete 's foot , nothing I 've tried comes close to being this effective .
 Very good soap . That 's pretty much what it is . Soothing too.I would recommend getting this one compared to any `` conventional '' soaps from supermarkets . This one cleans well , has very strong but relaxing smell and on top of that makes skin less dry.I 've yet to see some serious effect on ringworm I have . I bought it to treat ringworm infection I have . For now , after four days , what it does is it makes skin much less dry . A good start ...
 This soap is easy to use and very effective for removing foot fungus and healing the skin . I found it very effective .
 I have been looking for this type of product for years and was very pleased with this body wash I will be ordering more in the future ;
 I have a 14 yr old special needs son with horrible athletes feet and ingrown toe nails . This stuff has worked so well for him he brings me the bottle so I can use it with him . I noticed a drastic difference in his feet just after the first try.This stuff does smell ... it 's from tea tree oil so thats a given . But if it smelled like roses it probably would not have worked lol . Once we all adjust to the smell we are going to try it as a soak in the bath for him because he also has a rash that just wo n't go away no matter what the docs do .
 This is excellent soap . I had one foot that was all cracked and blistered . I used it once and the foot started healing !! It is completely healed now . I am so impressed that I intend to keep some of this stuff around in the medicine cabinet for those times when you get itchy feet . It instantly stopped the itching and burning .
 I first bought this for rashes I was getting on top of my feet . Do n't know what it was but it was not athletes foot . It itched and was terribly red from all the scratching . I bought this product having no idea if it would work , but thought i 'd give it a try since I tried everything else . From the very first time I used it , It felt so cooling and refreshing on my skin . After about 2 weeks of using this product , once in the morning , and once at night , my rash completely disappeared . My husband used it for heat rash he was getting between the legs . It took care of that in no time . A little goes a long way . I find the scent to be invigorating . We live in Florida , and sometimes after a long hard day outdoors we will use the funga soap as a complete body wash . How refreshing . This is honestly the best soap I 've ever used . It 's not oily or greasy on your skin , and washes right off in a matter of seconds , leaving your skin feeling completely revitalized .
 Since I was a teenager -LRB- long long time ago -RRB- I have had to deal every summer with athlete 's foot . It arrives with the hot and humid days , and does not truly go away even with daily washing and application of an over-the-counter anti-fungus cream and powder . It goes away with cooler weather.This year I saw the claims for Funga Soap and decided to try it . I 've been using it in my nightly shower for 2 weeks now , followed by anti-fungus powder in the morning , and -LRB- dare I say it ? -RRB- so far , not a peep out of the athlete 's foot , in spite of very hot and very humid weather here in the northeast . It works for me !
 My husband has had problens with his feet for years . He 's tried all the lotions , sprays , and powders and they work for awhile , but he has troruble remembering to use them and he also does n't like the mess . This product is easy to use daily , in the shower , and it really works ! His feet have cleared up completely since he started using it .
 I bought this for my basketball playing son ! It worked great to cool and combat -LRB- athlete 's foot -RRB- . I used it as an all over body wash and felt so clean and fresh afterwards that I immediately purchased more . The ` tingle ' is an added bonus ; o -RRB-
 First off we need to clarify a few things . While tea tree oil and tea tree products are amazing antifungals , a significant portion of the population is allergic to them -LRB- nothing to do with the burning sensation , that is the fungus dying off -RRB- . Depending on the severity of your case -LRB- especially T. Versicolor -RRB- you are going to have to follow a rigorous hygiene schedule . For best results YOU MUST use pure tea tree oil in conjuction with this product . Put the oil on your spots 1 hour before getting in the shower . This will kill and remove a large portion of the fungus , but it is still on your skin . Then you hop in the shower LUKEWARM TO NOT IRRITATE THE SPOTS ! DO NOT USE A SQUEEGY OR WASHCLOTH AS THESE WILL SCRAPE THE SKIN AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE FUNGUS TO RECUR , ONLY USE YOUR FINGERS AND MASSAGE THE WASH IN . When you are done , dry yourself with a towel being as careful as you can to dry the infected areas last to prevent spreading . IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT YOU DAB THE INFECTED AREAS , NOT RUB AS THIS WILL CAUSE SPREADING . Use a clean , new towel after each shower . The fungus lives off of fats that you eat , so try your best to maintain a low fat diet . When you sleep make sure you change your bed sheets every two days . You must also put a hand towel over your pillow if you do n't want to change the pillow case every night . YOU MUST WEAR CLEAN , LOOSE FITTING PAJAMAS TO BED EVERY NIGHT TO KEEP THE FUNGUS OFF YOUR SHEETS FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE . On average it takes people with T. Versicolor 4 MONTHS to see an extreme result , BUT YOU MUST PERFORM THIS HYGIENE PROCESS FOR A MINIMUM OF 6 MONTHS TO A YEAR TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INFECTION WILL NOT RECUR . IF YOU ARE NOT SURE THAT IT IS T. VERSICOLOR PURCHASE A BLACKLIGHT AND PUT IT NEXT TO THE SPOTS , THE EDGES WILL GLOW YELLOW-GREEN , trust me I have one . You can either step up and do this routine or live with the infection for the rest of your life .
 I never write any reviews but since I have suffered from Jock Itch for quite a while and this thing has cured my problems so I thought its worth spending some time in writing a review.If you suffering from Jock Itch , I would recommend following things -- 1 . Every time you exercise or feel like you had sweat , take a shower and use this funga soap to clean your private parts .2 . After you take shower make sure your private parts are dried properly . Dont use your towel , use a soft cotton cloth and change this cloth every week .3 . Change your under garment every time you take shower .4 . Try to eat 2 slices of garlic everyday . You can add garlic in your food . Garlic has very strong anti fungal properties . Dont use garlic tablets or slices , use fresh garlic in your food . .5 . Avoid caffeine and soft drinks and drink lots of water . .6 . Avoid alcohol specially beer if you still do not recover . .7 . Take multi-vitamin to rebuild your immunity ... I hope if you follow these things , your problem would be resolved . .
 My boyfriend 's jock itch affliction had gotten to the point where he was constantly sneaking behind bushes or disappearing into hidden alleyways because he was desperate for a good scratching . Of course , scratching temporarily provides relief but the end result of incessant scratching is usually a full blown rash . I bought FungaSoap because the key ingredient is tea tree oil , which has anti-fungal/anti-bacterial properties . Now my boyfriend swears by it and ca n't get enough of the `` refreshing sensation . '' Using the FungaSoap with a decent anti-fungal cream has worked wonders . I had to order the larger size because he likes to use it as a body wash as well.For jock itch , his routine is as follows ... Pour a quarter-sized amount in your palm , then massage it into the affected area -LRB- s -RRB- . Really work it in until it gets sudsy . Try to use the soap at least twice a day . My boyfriend will use it during his morning shower then have a quick body rinse after he gets home from work . Rinse and dry thoroughly then apply a fast-absorbing anti-fungal cream like Lotrimin AF . Does n't matter if it 's marketed as a foot fungal treatment as long as it has the anti-fungal ingredient clotrimazole . In fact , the foot treatments are generally cheaper than those advertised for jock itch but it 's practically the same thing . Cheaper products with mineral oil as the base do n't work as good because petroleum by-products trap moisture on the skin and fungus thrives on moisture ! No matter what you use , be sure to rub in the treatment until the cream disappears . Afterward , try to keep afflicted area clean and dry as possible i.e. no nut-hugging underwear and/or tight hipster jeans . Give your jock and nuts space to breathe ! Hope this helps .
 PediFix FungaSoapLiquid with Tea Tree oil , 6 oz.Excellent product . Does an excellent job . Smells real nice too ! It cured my problem when I soaked my foot in water with the finga soap added .
 I use it after my working out or after using the Sonna or steam room . My only problem with it is the cap , it usually breaks off .
 This product refreashes tired sore feet.My feet feel all tinglely and nice . It does a very very , very good job on fighting foot ordor . My feet sweats and this product does the trick for me . Try it ! You 'll like it !!
 This stuff really works , i can tell a big change in my feet they have really softened up . I use this soap with the soapy suds scrubber in the shower . The tea tree oil is the ticker , but it has a strong smell so the shower is the right place for it .
 Bought this and Fungi Nail Anti-fungal Solution - 1 fl oz for my wife . Both her big toes were gross and cloudy and cracking . Why it does n't bother her more ... I do n't know , but I took it upon myself to buy her these two products.She started using them , and within a week or two ... both nails fell out . It was super nasty ... but I 'm guessing both nails were so unhealthy , they probably would have come out regardless.Over the last 6 months , they 've been growing back . One of them looks great , but the other is cloudy . Why ? Because she does n't use the stuff I bought her . : -RRB- I ca n't say what the two products do individually ... because she only used them together . For the price though , it 's worth some of the more expensive options at the doctors office . But you have to be disciplined and actually put the stuff on !
 My son has been struggling with athletics foot fungus for over a year . The doctor has given him multiple prescrition medicines with very little help . He has been using this wash on his feet twice a day for a week now and they have improved greatly . He likes the smell of the soap and says it leaves his feet feeling refreshed and clean . My only complaint would be that the cap is not very sturdy . As mentioned he has only used for one week and already the cap has broken off from bottle . Great product . I would reccommend to anyone .
 This stuff works . I was not sure about it , but I tried it cause I have used many things for my feet . Worked after first use .
 The Doctor told my brother to use this product.He had a problem with 3 infected toes.I tried it . Makes your skin feel really clean .
 I use this product all the time . Its great for when I workout and it leaves me feeling refreshed and clean .
 Instead of pharmaceutical drugs and ointment , I decided to use natural products that is safe . I used this product to treat the ringworms -LRB- fungi -RRB- in my hands and lower arms , which I could have got from the soil or natural fertilizer in our home garden . I started using the PediFix FungaSoap liquid after I finished gardening even if I use garden gloves . I gave the other bottle to my husband to use on his feet . After washing with this liquid soap , I can feel the tingling feeling `` fresh '' of my skin .
 Bought this soap after reading the reviews . It has eliminated all traces of body funk from hot summer activities . My feet look and feel better too.The name is horrible , my girlfriend saw it in my shower and commented on it , I told her to try it on razor burn she had on her leg , cleared it up that day . Do n't let the name spook you , this stuff REALLY cleans your skin and
 Dear Amazon Shopper , I purchased this item to clear up a rash on my legs and it was successful in accomplishing that task in short order -LRB- with twice-daily application in the shower -RRB- . For those with sensitive skin , the potency of the tea tree oil can be felt upon application but does not cause any real discomfort . The pros and cons of this item are as follows : Pros :1 - Appears to be effective . Within a few days of using this soap twice daily in the shower the rash on my legs diminished to insignificance and was completely gone shortly after that .2 - Non-toxic . Using creams containing miconazole , ketaconazole , or one of the myriad agents used to combat the growth of fungi carries with it the risk of building up toxins in the skin . While using the creams as directed -LRB- for the duration directed -RRB- is typically safe , overuse or misapplication of pharmaceutical antifungals can cause the level of toxins in your body to reach dangerous levels . This risk is not present with FungaSoap .3 - Less expensive than pharmaceutical creams / powders . As of my writing this review , a miniscule tube of Lotrimin Ultra is over 60 % more expensive than FungaSoap . Add to that that it is designed for the acute care of rashes and that frequent use builds toxicity and FungaSoap looks like a bargain .4 - Preventive . Unlike pharmaceutical creams which are designed for the acute care of rashes -LRB- and are far too toxic to apply as a preventive measure -RRB- , FungaSoap acts to prevent rashes before they afflict you.Cons :1 - It 's not perfume . While I did not find the smell at all unpleasant , other reviewers have indicated that they do not share my sentiment . Since , unlike other soaps , FungaSoap does not smell like a rainforest populated by lilacs , its controversial scent gets chalked up under `` cons . `` 2 - It 's not very viscous . Due to FungaSoap 's lack of viscosity , it pours from the bottle more readily than one might expect . The first time I used it , I turned the bottle completely upside-down and got drenched in the stuff for my troubles . Just be certain that when you apply it , you are mindful of the speed at which the soap drains from the bottle . Overapplication will serve only to more quickly diminish an already not-cheap product .3 - It 's expensive compared to other soap . As of my writing this review , at 80 % the cost of FungaSoap you can get three times the amount of Dove . That makes FungaSoap almost four times more expensive than a respectable competing soap . While it 's true that this soap cures fungal rashes , it is designed primarily to be used in a preventive capacity , meaning this will be your soap from now on . A price comparison to your current soap is worth making .4 - Results may vary . As I said , it appeared to work very effectively for me . Others , however , have claimed that FungaSoap worked less effectively for them . Unlike pharmaceutical creams , FungaSoap , to my knowledge , does not have the imprimatur of the western medical community as an effective cure for fungal rashes . Consider this for what it 's worth.The bottom line is that this soap works as advertised . It 's true that it may well quadrouple your soap budget , but your soap budget probably is n't that high to begin with , and the few extra dollars are likely worth avoiding the nagging discomfort of a rash.Thank you .
 Product is wonderful , all natural relief that works , takes away burning , cracking and itching . Wo n't buy anymore over the counter chemicals , will keep buying the Fungasoap .
 A very good soap , especially if you are known to have problem skin -LRB- rashes , irritations , etc. -RRB- . This soap kills any viruses or bacteria on the skin giving a more complete wash than normal soaps . The tea tree oil in this soap is known planet-wide for it 's healing capabilities . Give this product a shot and you will not regret it !
 This stuff works . I 've been using this along with a brush to clean the infected area underneath my toenails , and I 've seen drastic improvement in just a couple of weeks . Had I know it would be this affected I would have taken a before/after picture to show the results . Of course I would n't post them on the internet unless there was a high demand for it . Either way , take my word -- it works .
 Had a really bad case of jock itch -LRB- like could n't sleep at night -RRB- and wanted to attack the itch from multiple solutions . This paired with Lotrimin Ultra and after two weeks , no more itches . The smell is tea tree . I do n't think it smells awful , more medicinal . Kinda pricey but when it itches down there , this is well worth it .
 I use this soap after I workout . Either cardio/weights or bjj/grappling . I have tried multiple different Tea Tree oil based soaps , Bath and Body Tea Tree Oil Gel , Defense Soap and Gel , SuperBodyCare . This soap is fairly soluble and watery . It comes out fast and I need to use a decent amount each time . Likened to the consitancy of dish dish soap . I use 2-3 doses of 2x2inches on to my Salux Nylon Towel -LRB- loofa towel -RRB- . In contrast the Bath and Body uses about half the amount and lathers much more . The Defense soap bar lathers a lot as well , but it goes down fairly fast imo , I 'd use the gel over the bar if going with Defense . Overall I like this soap , the primary drawbacks are it is watery , and of the TeaTreeoil based soaps that I have used , it 's the only one that actually has a menthol like feel on my package , not particularly painful , but it does give it a slight burn . I am not aware of it 's therapeutic effects on active fungal breakouts , I use it more as a preventative measure . Rinsing , then lathering up , letting the soap sit on me for roughly a minute then rinsing it off . If I do no-gi I may opt to lather up twice . There is a residual medicinal smell . If I plan on going out then I use a normal shower gel or soap bar .
 I recommend this product to whomever like to feel the cleanness and freshness on your feet . I am a very active person and I tried many products but nothing like this one . 100 % recommended
 Loving it . Makes your feet feel brand new . All the unnecessary dirt washed away with this soap , which is good because it keeps fungus away .
 I must say I am amazed by how well the Tea Tree wash has improved my toe fungus . I got toe fungus from the injury , more than 20 years ago ; I have tried many products and by far this product works the best !
 This soap CLEANS and kills fungus !!! I use it regularly on my whole body after any outdoor activity.After the beach or after the trails , gone hunting or fishing.Athletes foot ? Give it a try .
 I will say that when i was going to order this i was unsure about the product , and i am not one to write reviews . I did read a couple of the reviews on this product which persuaded me to purchase . For over a year now i have dealt with jock itch and trying to get rid of it . i have spend so much money on every type of spray , power , and cream to cure it and nothing . i even went to a doctor and got some antibiotic which only helped for a couple weeks then it came back . But when i read the reveiw that some others had a similar issue and this cured it i thought hey lets try it . So i got purchased it . The shipment was fast . I tried it and within 3 days it was gone !! i was shocked . it worked . something finally worked . so it has been over 3 weeks and still working great . i am so appreciative to this product . it was amazing . i ca n't say enough about it .
 I found this soap that because it has tea tree oil in it , it actually prevented the spreading and healing of heat rash -LRB- fungus -RRB- under my belly . Used daily , redness and fungus gone . Great for hot months or year round . Must be diligent in using regularly . I have recommended this product to several of my friends .
 I have a very bad case of tinea versicolor all over my shoulders and back , so I tried out this stuff . It took about 2 1/2 weeks to start seeing results , but the stuff is nearly gone . It did not cure all of it , but my back almost looks normal again . My shoulders have basically completly cleared . This is much safer to use than some of the pills they give you at the doctor and the pills usually do n't work anyway . I am a believer in this soap now . : -RRB-
 This stuff is great ! Not only does it smell good , it feels great and lathers up nicely.Oh and it is doing wonders for my feet , which have a history of being dry n flaky and not super awesome to look at.With any luck , and the continued use of this , my feetsies shall once again see the public light of day !
 This stuff smells like it is working . It will clear up your sinuses a long with cleaning up your body . It is that strong .
 I was suffering from a severe fungal infection on my arms and legs , and prescriptions from the doctor were having no effect at all . My sores would ooze a honey-like liquid , fooling us into thinking it was a bacterial infection . I started searching for natural things that may be able to help.If you read what the ingredients are for Fungasoap you wo n't be able to believe that it will work for a fungal infection , but it really does ! I would rub it on the infected spots and leave it on for about 10 minutes before getting in the shower , but if I forgot , I poured some on a wet cloth and washed with that , and it seemed to work almost as well . When the infection was particularly severe I would wash a couple more times during the day with Fungasoap , and get relief . I could see the difference the first few times I used it , but as it healed the effects were n't as noticeable.I did use other things in conjuction with Fungasoap . As we live near the ocean , I found that going in the ocean and letting the salt water dry on my skin , worked well to clean the ooze and help it to dry . The second thing I used was GSE , putting that on after a shower and a couple more times during the day . Make sure you dilute it . Then at night if the infected areas became itchy and irritated , I used Vetericyn gel , which is really for animals , but it 's the same formulation as the Puracyn made for humans , yet is half the price . I squirted a substantial amount onto an area , then covered it with toilet tissue , -LRB- strange I know ! -RRB- and then covered it all with either a large band aid , or an ace bandage to hold the tissue onto the area . This seemed to help it to dry up much quicker .
 I think this is doing some good , at least the coloring of my toe nails seems better . I 'll get back later after I 've used the rest of the bottle , but so far , seems to be making some difference .
 This has helped so much with fungal type wounds on the body . I can hardly wait to try it on husbands athletics foot .
 If your fighting with the issue of fungas on any level , thus is a absolute must have in your arsenal ! Great service and prompt.communication .
 My boyfriend had suffered from terrible athlete 's foot for years when I met him . I 've made it a mission to help cure it . He said he 's been to doctors numerous times and it never improves . His feet are red , cracked , peeling and insanely itchy . The shower always hurts his feet and makes them itch more.After buying a few products from the store -LRB- lotions , etc -RRB- and not showing any improvement I started looking online which led me to this stuff . The product smells a little funky -LRB- the whole bathroom will smell like it after he uses it -RRB- but it has really helped . He 's nowhere near cured but the cracking has stopped -LRB- his skin has n't split in awhile -RRB- , the redness has gone down and they do n't itch near as much . We 're pleased with the results.More recently we 've also started bleaching his feet which sounds crazy but does help !
 My son has tried everything to clear the toenail fungus , so far this has been the best product he 's used . I 've reordered this for him several times . It must work well for him .
 Great body wash . Some may not like the smell of team tree , but I love it . I even use this as a shampoo .
 no regrets or complains so far . the results come slowly but surely.it worked better then over the counter products .
 I think it 's working , my skin feels way better when I shower with this . It seems to help with athletes foot .
 Feet feel refreshed and moisturized . Cleaner feeling than soap . Toe fungus has dramatically improved . I would highly recommend this product to anyone for extremely clean feet .
 I bought this product for my granddaughter to try on her eczema . It helped with her itching . I also tried as a body wash . As a women going through menopause , there are places you tend to sweat wear you never sweated before . I was noticing an unpleasant odor and tried different things to help get rid of that . This product smells funny , but it rinses off . I no longer have the odor .
 This product is a must have ! I love it ! Forget that it says anti-fungal forget that it has anything to do with your feet . That isnt the whole case . This stuff is WONDERFUL all over your body
 very good product for treating skin affected with skin fungus ... I myself experienced some ringworm in some interesting places that looked just aweful . After continuted use of this product , I find it helps aid healing the skin and well worth the peace of mind it brings . The affected site returned to normal in about one week , and I am relieved.I highly recommend.Best Wishes to all , DL in NY
 You can actually use this as a body wash as well . Takes away underarm and foot odor ! I used to buy it at walgreens , but they have n't carried it for a couple years now . So , when I found it on amazon , I was so happy . It 's the best stuff and most convenient to use . Just leave it in your shower !
 I have bought A LOT of great things on Amazon . I am very busy and never have the time to write a review . For Fungasoap I am making the time . This was my situation : - 20 month old son had ringworm on his bottom - 2 weeks in -LRB- because I did n't really know what it was at first -RRB- I started using Lotrimin - 1 week went by with no improvement but did n't get worse either - 2 weeks in it suddenly spread all over his other cheek and was WAY more red - Tried Tea tree oil , rubbing alcohol , vinegar -LRB- which bothered him alot -RRB- and nothing was helping - kinda made it worseAfter researching OTC creams and home remedies and reading how they almost all failed I was in panic mode . Ringworm researching CONSUMED ME ! I found this on Amazon and the reviews sounded promising . Ended up finding a drugstore that carried it about an hour away in my sister in law 's city and she was kind of enough to pick up for me . Gave him a salt bath -LRB- lots of bath salts and regular table salt -RRB- - read that salt takes out the moisture , rinsed him off , scrubbed his butt with fungasoap and rinsed it off , repeated a couple more times before I took him out the tub and BEFORE MY EYES it was getting better !!!! Had a doc appointment the next day that had already been scheduled - his butt was so much better by the next day that when the doctor saw it she thought it was eczema ! After less than a week his ringworm was gone completely !!! To all the parents who might be going thru what I just went thru - this stuff is amazing !!! I have already purchased 2 more here to always have it on hand . The seller shipped it out very quickly .
 I 've been fighting a bit of non-itching fungus for a while now on my stomach of all places . I 've tried the standard OTC creams and such , and while they 'd seem to knock it back immediately you could see the ` spots ' coming back in time for the next treatment with ` full bloom ' almost immediately once treatment stopped . I started using this product a couple weeks ago now , and while it did n't look like it was doing much at first after about a week the fungus was visibly disappearing . After the 2nd it appears to be gone , and this is just using it once a day as a body wash . In addition , a couple of callouses I had n't even thought were fungus related dried up / crumbled away to reveal fresh new skin . My skin seems healthier now than it has in a long time.Heh , it 's true that using this as a full body wash makes me smell like a tea tree , but I find I like the smell so it 's all good . It 's also not that strong except when you 're applying it . Even if I did n't like the smell I think it would still be worth using since it 's effective against what I had.Also , as another reviewer said a little goes a long way . It does n't take much at all to cover a large area .
 This soap is great for athlete 's foot and other fungal foot issues . I use it to great success for chronic athlete 's foot and toenail fungus . My feet have greatly improved .
 I have had a difficult rash - similar to Psorisis - for months . If I wash my hands with this soap several times a day it disappears . As soon as I stop . it 's back . I tried many things like Cortizon products even had one prescribed and sometimes it got worse . Used different cremes and found that this soap was the answer . Was upset when Walgreen 's discontinued carrying it . Probably it is just not a very well known product .
 This product is wonderful . I easily develop fungal rashes on my arms and legs and this is the only thing that works . I have been to dermatologists and they could n't find a antifungal cream that was strong enough . It takes a couple of weeks for the rashes to disappear , so be patient , but after dealing with these rashes for years I have learned that this is the only product to use . I only gave it four stars though because I ca n't stand the eucalyptus scent .
 I bought this pedifix fungasoap cleansing wash because I had a rash on my stomach , do n't know what it is but using this soap -LRB- twice so far -RRB- it has helped . It has n't gone away completely but the itching is much less . It has however , helped the bottom of my feet . This is a very nice unexpected surprise . I rub the soap all around my feet and boy , after the first time my extrememly dry , irratable feet became smooth . I got a cut about a year ago on the bottom of my right foot that never really healed and I could n't put pressure on that foot . Now , after using this soap twice my feet are soft as a baby and my cut does n't hurt anymore . I can even put pressure on my right foot now . My feet even look like I 've had a pedicure . Now , if only my rash would go away!Also , my husband has rosacea -LRB- sp ? -RRB- and his back is extrememly dry also . This has helped him a lot . He does n't often admit to liking many things -LRB- whatever -RRB- but he loves this soap ! We both love the cool , tingly feeling the soap leaves and it does help heal . I will definitely be keeping this in stock .
 I had purchased this first for my husband to use when he used to go camping with our son when they were involved in Scouting . I had been purchased at one of the local medical stores on the recommendation by a sales person when I explained I was looking for something to solve heat , yeast and other skin issues . It had solved the rashes they both got from the heat and then the other boys started to use it since they also started to get the heat rash and chafing . I started to use it as well since it solved my problem with getting the same problems since I drive a bus that has no A/C and cut down on my problems as well . Some people may or may not like the scent , I have no issues with it and the family likes the cool feeling get get from using the soap and the smell from the soap is great for guys and for me does not have all that perfume to it . I 've even used it on my Westie who has yeast skin flare ups from time to time without any problems , I just make sure I rinse him well and it keeps him smelling fresh for a longer period of time . Over all I have been very pleased with the Pedifix FungaSoap . It is not over drying and is fantastic especially in the summer time . I have taken advantage of the auto ship for the product since I have been very pleased with the product in the past and find using this wash on any skin issue I may have helps clear it up faster than using any powder or cream for the same problem .
 As many others have reviewed , this product is extremely effective against Athlete 's Foot . I 've tried medicated powders , sprays , creams , etc and all have only partially helped for years . Tea tree oil is such an effective and natural anti-fungal that I thought I 'd give this a go . I use a foot brush along with Pedifix FungaSoap about 3 or 4 days a week and I no longer have any issues . If I get lazy and stop using it for a few days it comes back quickly , so you have to be diligent . Excellent product that I 've bought multiple times .
 This stuff is amazing ! I was covered in a yeast rash and in 2 applications it was almost completely gone ! I will continue to use this as a preventative because I tend to get these rashes often . The prescription creams had stopped working on me . This is fabulous !
 My scalp has been flaky & itchy for the past year , i 've tried everything to help soothe it but had n't considered a fungus shampoo until just recently , so a couple nights back just before I shampooed my hair I applied a small-medium sized amount of this soap into my hair & rubbed it about , then I proceeded to shampoo my hair like normal.And I got ta say this really made a difference , the following morning when I woke up not only was I COMPLETELY free of an itchy scalp but my hair looked extremly healthy.It 's been a couple nights since -LRB- I wash my hair once every 3-4 days -RRB- & overall my hair STILL maintains that healthy look about itself and my scalp , while it has gotten partially itchy again -LRB- probably because of my being exposed to the sun yesterday -RRB- is nowhere near as bad as before!I 'm definitely gon na try this soap out again tomorrow night !
 I just received this soap today , and used it no more than 20 minutes ago . I have had a problem with insanely and painfully itchy feet for years now . With not the time or the money to visit a podiatrist , I finally decided to look into something like this . After my first use , my feet do n't itch terribly from simply touching them , and I 'm happy to know that it is working . The unaffected parts are extremely smooth besides . We 'll see how they are in a week , but I 'm pretty confident so far .
 This product works well . You will not be disappointed !! It is worth every cent and you will see results in a matter of days .
 Did n't cure my athlete 's foot like others claimed but it does seem to clean deeper than regular soap . A worthwhile investment .
 Helps get rid of foot fungus . I was a bit recluctant about buying this soap at first but I 'm very pleased with this product . If you want to get rid of foot fungus , also buy tea tree oil and use it twice a day .
 I have been suffering from dry patches on my skin and wanted something to alleviate the frustration . A friend of mine told me about this product , I read the reviews and decided to give it a try . Within one week , all dry patches were gone from my skin , I have been using the product about once a week and continue to be trouble free . Excellent product and Amazon provided great resources on helping making a choice to purchase and use this product .
 This soap has made my life so much better . Anyone with athlete 's foot knows how annoying it is ALL day long with shoes on . I am in the military and have to wear boots 14 + hours almost every day as I am on deployment . My athlete 's foot was getting out of control but luckily this has almost cleared it up in a little over 2 weeks of daily use . Creams and powders were n't doing anything to help but I noticed that this soap did something from the first time I used it . Smells great too ! I am going to put the rest of my friends and family on this if they ever get athlete 's foot !
 Bought this after reading other reviews . Now on my second bottle . It does make your feet softer and removes dry skin . As far as getting rid if the fungus in my toenails , there does seem to be improvement but I 'm still waiting to see if it all goes away . I 'll update later .
 Does anyone know if this product is safe to use by someone who is nursing an infant ? Am looking for a product that will provide relief and at the same time not have any effect on an infant .
 I have used this product for some time ... I just finished the bottle . . I had 2 bad really nasty big toe nails . . it took awhile . almost three months ... my nails are looking good ! Also my feet and sneakers do not smell like they used to . It takes time ... for your nails to grow ... it worked great for me ... this is the first review I have given a review to a Amazon . . great product ... very very happy . . bought right here on Amazon
 Because Im using this in combination with other products I cant say for sure which product - or all of them - is working , but my fungas is clearing up . It has a very medicinal smell that took a bit of getting used to . It is highly concentrated so a little goes a long way .
 It 's a good product and I do n't regret buying it . I think it had a beneficial result on my son 's skin . It indeed smells with specific odor , but this is not a problem for us.Thanks !
 I TRIED EVERYTHING !!!! Every over the counter cream you can imagine i tried for 2 months and could not get rid of the ringworm and kept getting more spots showing up . Looked around and based on the product reviews selected this product . It helps with medication that i was taking but i dont know by itself . That same day i was using this is also when i started on pill medication
 I think I must of had chronic foot fungus and jock itch . My feet were always periodically cracked and scaled from time to time . This wash helped a lot , my feet are no longer scaled , still feel dry sometimes but the cracking and scaling is what I could n't deal with . As for jock itch , well , it went away !
 I read most of the reviews about this product and normally I was very skeptical about buying something like this . I received it very quickly and tried it right away . It made my skin feel very clean and the itching was gone in 2 days . I wear boots all day long -LRB- military -RRB- and hate how my feet are always sweaty and hot and this product really helps keep fungus at bay . There are so many different types of toe fungus and this product might not work for all of them but I have taken pills and used every over the counter product and this product is the only thing that works . Only use a little bit , this product goes A LONG WAY ! The smell is great too ! I am going to tell my friends and family about this product and hopefully they find it useful as much as I do . There is a smaller size too if you do not want to buy so much at first .
 I am using this production for 2 weeks and not seeing big difference and at the same time it is not harming . I think it is too soon to decide .
 around the transition so spring i always get rashes and very dry skin . this liquid soap really helps a lot . although it didnt do much for my back acne but i just made this my official body wash . then lots of moisturizer or lotion after .
 I do n't know about efficacy with fungus , as addressed in the other reviews , but this soap smells great ! It 's powerful stuff . It smells clean and healthy , not medicine-y . Well worth the money .
 Very nice product . work well , it is the first time I 'm trying this product , in the future ordering some more .
 its a nice product . leaves you feeling clean and fresh , but the price is a bit outrages for the amount you get . -LRB- over a dollar an oz -RRB- . i might pay 7 or 8 bucks for 13 ounces but 15 ? no thanks . 30 dollars every month or so for soap does n't fit my budget . i gave it 4 stars for the product alone , but it certainly is n't a good deal .
 This stuff is the real deal . After trying to utilize Gold Bond extra strength body powder along with Lotrimin Ultra for the rash which was n't working , I saw the reviews for this and bought it.My case was severe and after 4 days of use , the rash is almost gone . That 's right , almost gone . I 'm using the wash in the morning and after I workout , Lotrimin in the morning and then Gold Bond 3-4 times a day and I have no doubt this soap has given me the upper hand to win the battle.Do not hesitate to buy and have extra stock on hand .
 When summer comes around this stuff is a must . I really have no idea why you cant find this in stores . It works far better than any other product i have tried and it works pretty quickly as well . I will definitely always have a bottle on hand from now on .
 PediFix Is a good product not the best but good . I would recommend getting it and see if you like it . It all depends on the person skin , he did leave my foot softer , what was before soo I give thumbs up for that . But it didnt totally clear my fungus I also included in my foot car an anti fungal cream and that helped a lot . Other than that I would recommend buying it .
 I use this on my feet every time I shower . This really does work . If you are skeptical at first I suggest you buy the 6oz bottle . Once you see that it works , buy the 13.5 oz bottle . This is a good purchase if you are embarrassed of showing your feet to people .
 I bought this for my mom she said it works pretty good for her . So I am glad that she finally found something for her feet .
 This product works really well . I have never seen it on a shelf in any store , so this is a good way to order it .
 I have very sensitive skin even on my feet area and regular soaps make my feet extremely dry . I was browsing on Amazon looking for foot soap and came upon this product , read the many good reviews and decided to give it a try . This works ! My feet actually feels very refreshed and the dry parts of my feet are n't that noticeable and slowly improving . I actually bought the bigger size one just recently since the 1st one I bought is almost half way and did n't want to run out off this soap .
 I love this product so much that it is my very first `` subscribe and save '' product . I ca n't live without it . I had laser treatment to clear up toenail fungus a couple of years ago , and I bought this as one of the products I use to protect my investment and ensure that the toenail fungus does n't come back . However , I 've ended up using it for so many other purposes . It smells so good . I just love using it anywhere and everywhere that I want to feel clean and fresh . I find that it even helps calm itchy skin . It really soothes the itch on contact .
 I had jock itch and used this after it cleared up to make sure it did n't come back . It is a bit harsh on the skin , but it works well .
 If you just wash your feet with this soap each time you shower you will not have any fungus form on your feet , and it will clear up any you already have as it did for me . Not only is it cheaper than the powders and creams that are made for the same exact thing , but it is so much more convenient to use this soap instead of dealing with smelly creams and messy powders.The magical ingredient in this stuff is the tea tree oil . I 've been using it for years , athletes foot being just one of the many uses . I also use100 % Australian Tea Tree Oil + FREE Tea Tree Oil Soap Barsfor my face and neck . I do n't really get acne but just for the way it makes my skin look and feel and getting rid of any red blotches , well this stuff is truly amazing.Do not try putting the foot soap anywhere but your feet . It would probably work on other parts of your body as well because of the tea tree oil but it does n't smell the greatest . That 's why if just apply it while in the shower , its no big deal and you get all the benefits without any issue .
 I could n't get rid of my tinea versicolor for three years after I got it on vacation in Malaysia . I tried topical creams prescribed by the doctor , Sporanox pills also prescribed by the doctor , and Lamisil OTC spray . I finally came across this soap and decided since I 've tried almost everything else , why not . The first time using it I could feel the tingle on my body parts that was covered with tinea versicolor . The smell of the soap will take a little getting used to but once you get over that it really is refreshing . A couple of weeks later and almost the end of the bottle , my tinea versicolor is gone . Just remember that you need to tan so that the spots that were formerly tinea versicolor can blend in with the rest of your skin . Definitely buying this product again just to make sure the tinea versicolor does n't come back . Glad this product exists .
 If you have any itchy spots on your skin that bother you - this is the product that will alleviate your problem . It is a great soap even for general cleansing every now and then to keep your skin healthy . The main tip is that it is kind of watery when you pour it on your hand so use it sparingly - then lather it in your hand and THEN wash with it . Otherwise too much gets wasted . For any athletes who have any fungal problems -LRB- groin , feet , etc. -RRB- this is the solution . Wash with it regularly .
 I agree with many of the reviewers regarding how well this Funga soap works.Some of the good : - The soap does what the product description states
 Too bad CVS does n't put this product on their shelves as Savon Drugs once did.I found this soap when Savon Drugs was still around and I gave it a try after reading that it is enriched with `` Tea Tree Oil '' and is excellent for other body parts as well . Pedifix is right and I can not agree more with them when they say that it cleans , refreshes , washes away bacteria , and deodorizes the body -LRB- especially the feet -RRB- . I usually wash my face especially near the nose area because this product somehow relieves my sinus problem . I love it when it makes that squeaky sound when I wash it away with water because it means that it 's clean . Funga Soap is also great for underarm cleansing as well . *** I have extremely sensitive skin and this product is safe for people like moi .
 I bought it but my daughter loved it so much it disappeared . She said it made her acne much better!We also loved the scent .
 Wow!What a pleasant surprise!This was intended for my husband , he has been having toenail fungus for a couple of years now.Not really knowing what to expect , having read and re - read the reviews decided to give it a chance.Wow!He has been using this soap for a month.Every evening before shower , he applies a few drops and rubs it on the affected nail and leaves it there for 5 to 10 minutes . A month later boy oh boy what a change!For a start the black colour on his toenail has completely disappeared , the overall condition has improved!Such a relief.Thanks again !
 This stuff is amazing ! My husband got trench foot in Afghanistan a few years back and tried a lot of different products but nothing took it away and it just got worse and worse . It was at the point where if he took his shoe off in the next room I could smell it and the whole bottom of his foot was dead skin , seriously . Well I researched products and thought I 'd have him give this a try . This is our third time purchasing it and we always get two bottles at a time when we order and I wo n't even have him try another product because this works so well . It has a kind of strong smell to it but MUCH nicer than what his feet smell like without using it . I can always tell the days when he does n't wash his feet with it after he takes off his boots because the smell starts to come back.There 's been a couple times I 've even used it when I felt I was getting athletes foot and it stopped the onset immediately . If you have a husband with a ` stinky foot ' problem this is the stuff to get . If you get athletes foot , this is the stuff to get . If your feet sweat all day and you have problems because of it , this is the stuff to get . You wo n't be disappointed .
 Recently my four year old had a play date who had a ringworm infection that spread to our family unfortunately , and we have been battling them for almost 2 months . After trying home remedies -LRB- bleach which makes it spread if rubbed FYI , vinegar , etc -RRB- I came across this and have been pleased . It 's very effective and everyone in my family can use it , even though my daughter and I have sensitive skin . I even added some to my body wash so that the smell is n't so `` medicated '' , yet it still gives the tingling feeling that I call effectiveness . Not that the smell is unpleasant , it 's very clean , I just found it a lot nicer when mixed with my own soap . Hope this helps !
 I am writing this review not from the medical point of view
 Beyond Awesome product . I ca n't begin to tell you I have had an itch on the heels of my feet forever . Sadly , I never thought it would go away so over the years I felt I just had to get used to it . I get my pedicures at home and the person who works on my feet always says a little bleach will do the trick . It did n't . Nothing ever did the trick . And then WOW ! I found this inexpensive product on Amazon , read the reviews and took a chance . I rubbed them on my feet and toes . Not only did the itch go away but the fungus/funny looking toe nail has healed in maybe ... 2 weeks . I 'm not joking . It 's like OMG ! Do n't get the 6 oz , go straight for the bigger one . If my children have an itch I bring this to the bath . Another thing I do is pour some on my foot stone and work it in my feet . My feet feel amazing . I happen to love the smell . It 's smells clean . Tea tree oil smells clean to me and more importantly , it smells like it 's doing something - and it is !
 I do n't have fungus , but after reading the product description decided to buy this product anyway . It 's a refreshing , non-drying foot soap . As a diabetic , I have to be careful about how a bath leaves my skin , especially in winter . This allows for a gentle , antibiotic cleansing . Revives the tired toes and soothes hard working feet .
 I bought this product for toenail fungus I had been battling for years . I spent hundreds on laser , creams and gels but to no avail . So decided to try a tea tree oil which worked okay , then I heard about this product . So I mixed the two and let my feet soak for 30 minutes every night . Within a week my toes started clearing up . I kid you not , within 3 weeks the nail on my big toe has begun to grow out revealing a clear new nail coming in . The other three infected toes , one of them has completely cleared ... the other two are clearing . The pinky toe was always fungus free . I can not tell you how HAPPY I am to have my feet looking nice again , FINALLY ! Looking forward to wearing flip flops / sandles without nail polish this summer.Also , you have to be diligent in keeping your feet clean and dry . I soak my feet every night before going to bed , then massage with tea tree oil . In the morning wash them again in the shower . I also cleaned all my shoes/boots with a mixture of bleach and distilled water . I spray the insides with Lamisil spray before and after each use . Lastly , make sure to sterilize all your nail utensils as well as throw away all polishes you used on your infected nails . Otherwise , you will only re-infect them.Wishing all the best to those who are considering trying this product . At this point , what have you got to lose ?
 Funga Soap is a life saver ! I had a severe case of jock itch that was n't responding to any other treatments . I tried Lotrimin Ultra , Lotrimin spray powder , Zeosorb , and the generic over the counter creams . Nothing worked . Finally after nearing two months with this horrible rash , my wife ordered Funga Soap . After just one wash I could tell it was working and my rash was drying up after just one use . It may sting a little bit depending on where your rash is located but only for a few minutes . After that there is a cool , refreshing feeling that sooths . Two days later -LRB- two treatments per day -RRB- my rash and itching were gone . Why Funga Soap is n't in retail stores I 'll never know . Funga Soap is amazing .
 The boys tend to get a little itchy & musty after multiple workouts and showers . This soap really took care of the problem . I use it on the gents and on my feet . It provides a slight tingle and is very refreshing . The scent is nice as well . Just what I was looking for !
 This stuff is awesome . I have been plagued by a rash off and on in my arm pits for two years . used this product and rash has been eliminated . You can be assured that I shall always keep this product on hand .
 Bought this for nail fungus on the basis of all the positive reviews . Over the course of a couple of months , the product has done its work and my nails all almost completely clear .
 used it several times and it clearly helped with my yeast problem on my head and chest . . my mom uses it to . . we think its better than Selsun Blue . .
 I experienced athletes foot for the first time in my life recently - I think I got it from trying on a friend 's shoe . Never had the problem before and suddenly I had all kinds of itching and discomfort on my toes and feet to the point where I could not sleep . I purchased 2 different kinds of creams - all they did was alleviate the itching , but did not solve/cure the problem.Finally I stumbled onto Pedifix and thought I 'd give it a try . After one use , I only had very light itching on the toe areas , after the 2nd day of use , my problem was completely cleared up . I do not usually write reviews , but I really want anyone who is having similar problems to try this as it does work . Do n't expect an ` immediate ' fix , but you will definitely get immediate relief - and if you continue to use for more than a day , it does exactly what it says it will - eliminates any kind of fungus from the skin .
 If you are trying to keep your scalp clean for whatever ales you then this is one product that can help you do that . have notice an improvement of my scalp since using this product and greatly calms stinky old men feet !
 I know Tea Tree Oil does the job and is a great antiseptic and that 's why I bought it . It 's a rather small bottle but not bad . One could most likely make their own version for less money , which is what I did with some Tea Tree Oil when this ran out . I gave it 5 stars because I 'm a firm believer in the main ingredient .
 If you get past the smell , this is a great shampoo to get rid of fungal skin problems in your hair . The smell is quite strong , but it seems to really help , so that is what is important .
 I like the smell of the soap ; very fresh and CLEAN smelling but I do n't really know if it will help with the fungus so I really shouldn ' t be writing this review but I DO like the smell hahaha .
 Just trying to find something to help my awesome co-worker . She tried all of the products I purchased for her .
 One product that does it all . Originally I purchase it for Tinea Versicolor but it does much more . It is now my body wash from head to toe . I use it on my face for acne . A great body wash for anyone with sensitive skin . It gives you a mint fresh feeling cause it has peppermint in it . I can shave my leg with it and it will leave it smooth . And on top of all that I wash my hair with it cause it is all natural and it is does a great job handling dandruff . I love this stuff . Try it for yourself .
 This product works very well for washing my feet . It lathers nicely , and I tend to like the ` clean ' smell of the Tea Tree oil . The natural antiseptic quality is a bonus .
 I use this on my whole body occasionally when my skin gets itchy . I would recomend this item , works for me .
 This cleansing wash is the best ever ! I have been using this now for over a month and I have yet to have a ringworm breakout ! I have been struggling with ringworm break outs for over 2 years now . The doctor told me the chronic ringworm is something I will just have to deal with because of my activity level and if you had it once you will definitely get it again - because the spores are so difficult to get rid of - you have to treat everything -LRB- towels , pants , shirts , underwear , etc -RRB- . This wash is fresh smelling , tingly , and wonderful . You know it is `` disinfecting '' the area that you are washing . I love this stuff . Use it every time I shower and I am confident in this product . I love that this is an `` alternative '' to taking orals Fluconazole -LRB- Diflucan -RRB- and using topical medication as well . Using this and the tea tree creme has changed my life . I am so happy and will continue to use this forever !
 My husband has developed a case of Tinea Versicolor in the last couple of years . Last fall , it got really bad , it was all over his chest and shoulders and was spreading up his neck . I found this product on Amazon and read a ton of reviews . I thought this would help him , or at the very least not make it worse . Unfortunately , it did n't have any affect on my husband , but ... in one of the reviews someone commented that their daughter took their bottle because it worked on their acne . I have adult onset cystic acne and it had exploded on my face recently , so I thought , `` Why not '' so I tried a little on my face and thank goodness . It helped calm my face way back down . It did n't happen overnight , but consistent use with my regular regiment really got it under control . So at least this product worked for one of us .
 I had a bad case of athletes foot which was bad then got to worse once it was starting to spread on my hands ! I started to panic and thought how much worse it will be to get it off my hands . I immediately started looking for a remedy , and stumbled upon this product . After 1 day of use , I noticed the fungus infected skin on my hand started to reduce in size , after about 1 week , it was completely gone , after 1 month , no signs whatsoever!This product has helped me get rid of the `` fungus-panic '' I have had over the several months . When I see signs of a single fungus infection , I just clean the area with this soap . It has a nice aroma to it and cleans very well !
 This is an awesome body wash and it appaers to do what it 's intended for . I have been using it for a month now and the results have been great .
 I have very sensitive skin and can wear only 100 % cotton . Any clothing label has to be cut off or I go crazy with itch and redness . My son is the same way . This is so soothing to itchy feet or belly button . It 's not a bad price , but I 'd like to buy a larger bottle if possible . It 's very thin , so watch you do n't lose too much when you squeeze the bottle . I actually just let it dribble out on it 's own . It does n't take much , so I feel it 's a good value and very soothing to skin .
 I like this product , it works pretty well for Tinea Versicolor , just give it time . After a week of treatment , my skin was already returning to normal , which is good , cause I do n't have the time or money to see a doctor .
 I had a bad fungus problem on my feet/toes and used this in combination with some other products to clear it up . Now I just use this to clean and maintain my feet and it seems to work well . It is very soothing on tired feet after a long day . It smells nice and has a strong smell of tea tree oil . The small bottle actually lasts a long time too when only used on my feet .
 I bought the smaller bottle to help with athletes foot . Now I use it as my body wash . The smell is strong , but after a few days I got used to it and it 's really refreshing .
 Excellance !!!!!!! Best product on the market for Itchy feet , and have fungus , or feet that sweat a lot . I use it on my hands , some body parts , just a refreshing and great product !!!!
 I have used this product for years , as a matter of fact I bought two so I can always have one ready . I keep it in the freezer and use it to provide comfort at night . Every night , I get in bed and then ask my husband to `` go get the thing '' . I also use when I get migraines . Do n't get me wrong , this wo n't cure a true migraine - likely need some real medicine - but it provides a great deal of comfort while I am waiting for the drugs to work . It is just the right weight to provide some relief when placed over eyes . I highly recommend this product .
 I purchased the Large NeckEase by BodySense for my husband and the Sinus Pillow for myself and let me tell you , I can only say I wish I 'd gotten them sooner ! We both go to the Chiropractor and have the Mediflow Waterbased pillows -LRB- see my review for those and the pillow case -RRB- but the addition of these 2 items was a great investment . We both suffer from neck and back pain and arthritis so we have tried many different things to help ease our pain and discomfort.I 've used the Sinus Pillow twice now . We live in West TN and this time of year we can have some crazy weather - in the 70s one day and down to the 40s the next . This weather wreaks havoc on my sinuses , causing me lots of sinus pain and pressure and some pretty strong and painful , pounding headaches . I just heat my Sinus Pillow in the micro for the recommended time , lay down and place it over my eyes and nose and once again , it 's not long until I 'm fast asleep . Now , I 'm not going to say it took my headache away completely each time , but it sure does relieve the sinus pressure and greatly reduces the pounding pain in my head so that I can relax and fall asleep quite easily . The various scents given off from each pillow is wonderful and very soothing.My husband has used the NeckEase several times already and I used it the other night ... heated it in the micro , wrapped it around my neck and climbed into bed for the night . Was very comfortable laying there with my head on my Mediflow Waterbased pillow and before I knew it I was fast asleep!I would recommend both of these products and look forward to using them for years . And after reading the reviews of the BodySense Large Pack and Extra Large Pack I am putting those on my wishlist for purchase of one or both in the very near future !
 I work on computer all day and after a while noticed the change in my vision . After I started to take Jarrow , I noticed my eyes improved a little . I would definitely recommend this product !
 If you have any problems after eating brocoli or beans , etc. this is what you need . These are great , I take two after eating the foods that cause me distress and I no longer have any distress . I always felt like I could n't eat raw veggies at lunch at work or bean soup and now , waa laa I can eat the healthy foods at work and not have to worry . Thanks for the product .
 The best diapers for our son because of the liquid capacity . Other brands just leaked . Also , free shipping at the best price anywhere from Amazon .
 These diapers are great for active toddlers . No leaks , no rashes , no problems . Excellent diapers !

 This product is a MUST have for all women . Why miss out on having the most powerful orgasims ever !?!? Your money will be very well spent ... I LOVE Zestra !!
 This product is certainly my favorite oil I have ever used , as well as my fav product from Indigo Wild . F&M ; is such a relaxing and rejuvenating scent to have as a body oil . I can totally understand why F&M ; continues to be a best selling product in much of the Zum line of products.After buying this oil direct from Indigo Wild for over 3 years , I have sadly found that shipping their products to me now is extremely expensive . So sadly I have had to go without Zum for quite a while until a friend told me I can buy it on Amazon.Those of you not familiar with Zum oil , let me give my two cents on why I 'm sold on Zum for life!The blend of oils used for Zum oil , is fantastic as well . Sweet almond , meadowfoam seed , sunflower , avocado , coconut & hemp oils make a great lube for the skin without being heavy or too thick . Great -LRB- obviously -RRB- for massage ... but my fav use is for after shaving my legs . Feeling something so soothing and luxurious on my skin after a shave ... well it is positively orgasmic ! : -RRB- Plus the scent is just enough to leave you feeling surrounded , but not so much that it chokes you out like some other brands I have tried.Thanks Amazon for carrying this product !
 I used this product to make Gold , Frankencense and Myrrh soap to give as small gifts at Christmas . It worked great . Delivery was fast , product was well packaged and in perfect condition . Met and exceeded expectations . The soap was really supposed to be for display , but many people said it lathered beautifully and they loved the fragrance and wanted more !! It has an earthy , relaxing aroma , reminiscent of patchouli , although much more subtle . Not a fruity or flowery smell . The oil is primarily almond oil and Shea butter , not thick or sticky . It has a very smooth feel and is good for massage or as a moisturizer . although the scent may be a little strong for some , it could easily be cut with additional unscented massage or almond oil . It was worth it . I am happy with this purchase .
 The aroma presented by this massage oil has both calming and exotic flavor to the senses . As being a present worthy of the King of Kings I had never smelled the two scents in combination ... Heavenly is my response and I highly recommend this for either personal massage or to bring to your own masseuse .
 I would buy this product over and over again . I absolutely love it ! Great fragrance and goes on smoothly . Lasts all day ! Excellent product . I would recommend this product to all my friends and family.All Natural Frankincense & Myrrh Aromatherapy Oil - Zum Massage & Body Oil by Indigo Wild , 4oz .
 This is one of those oils I would buy again . It smells great , nice to put on after you shave your legs or just rub on to smell nice .
 I use every night as a lotion for sunspots on my chest and they are getting better . Tanks dr. Oz .
 Wow , I have already reordered this product . It is just what I was hoping for and high quality . Lasts for a long time even though we use it every day . I wish it came in a bigger size . It is n't strong but is fresh and light .
 This is a great product ! I received the shipment super fast ! The product will go a long ways ! You only need to use a little bit and the smell is heavenly . Thank you !
 Stimulating to the mind body and soul . Leaves such a nice aroma in the air after you bath or shower .
 Thank you for zum good oil i used this oil for a mixture with shea butter to make it smell better and to make itmore creamy when i melt the shea butter i out some Zum Oil in it then whip it up to some creamy butter that smellgood , Thank you from Brother Paul
 I 'm and older woman and have recently started running , I was having trouble with my knees . Several of the women I run with said I need to be taking glucosamine -LRB- sp ? -RRB- so I bought some . Then one of the ladies told me about Joint Health and how it could take the place of all my individual vitamins but pretty expensive . I immediately went online and found it at Amazon for about half the price and it is awesome , been taking for about a month and it has made the world of difference . Love it . You can get a free sample at health food stores .
 This I did n't noticed how well it was working until I ran out then I could really feel the diferance
 Whether you are an athlete or just aging , this product is great for your joints . I was even able to cut out my arthritis pain med ! However , this supplier charged me more than what was posted on Amazon 's site and i have been able to get it for less from other distributors .
 A lot of vitamins for such a small price . I am very happy , I will be buying other vitamins from the same company .
 I 've been taking this daily with Vit D3 -LRB- 5000 IU -RRB- andJarrow Formulas JarroSil , Activated Silicon , 2 Fluid Ounce -LRB- 60ml -RRB- . I really noticed the difference , it really improved my skin , not much but noticeable .
 I took this product for years and had great hair and skin . I switched to a synthetic source , palmate , and my hair started to fall out very quickly . I am back although I do not care for the soy oil which I have read is not good for us and to be avoided .
 I love this brand . These vitamins are very good . Maintaining good health is important to me and vitamins are a welcome addition in my busy life . I would purchase them again .
 I am using this to help keep my acne under control . You have to be careful about the dose , I take it twice a day for a total of 50,000 iu which is a lot . I check my liver function tests on a regular basis . Liver toxicity has been reported on doses as low as 15,000 iu per day . Check with your doctor before you take this product . If your doctor has no idea , find another doctor !
 I have had no issues with this product . The gel caps are easy to swallow and have not caused me any side effects .
 Quality product and shipped very fast at a very reasonable price priced it at other sites and this was the best
 Got this in the mail about a week ago and have been taking it faithfully for skin issues . It 's working pretty well although at first it will `` purge '' the skin so to speak.Be careful never to take more than the recommended amount . The capsules are in a gel form and are easy to swallow and small , and for the price you ca n't beat how many come in a package . If you are deficient in vitamin A it 's also great and easy to remember to take them , more or less . It 's a high amount of IU 's so it will get anyone 's levels up . It 's best to take them on a full stomach as I 've experienced , but they have caused me no stomach discomfort even as I have upped my dosage -LRB- this is only what I have done for personal purposes , it is not recommended to exceed one a day -RRB- . I 've used Now 's essential oils before for various purposes and so far it 's a very good brand.Overall , a great brand and It 's part of my medicine cabinet now .
 I 've suffered from some bad breakouts and acne for a long time now , on and off . I do n't know why but I just got so lazy i do n't want to type anymore . Okay I 'm going to try and keep going . Anyway , like many others in this terrible world we live in , I tried absolutely everything for my face , washing it all the time , creams , soaps , acids . Up until now nothing really worked all that well , some might have helped a bit , and others made it worse . But then I had an epiphany ! after reading an article online about how apricots were good for your skin because of all the vitamin A , i thought , why do n't i just go directly to the vitamin and start taking it and see what happens ! Well thats exactly what i did , and let me tell you , this is apparently the only thing I needed all along ! After 2 days my skin was cleared up , and I 've had no breakouts in about 2 weeks ! Greatest feeling in the world and I owe it all to this product . Listened people , if you have terrible skin like me , it may just be vitamin A deficiency so try this out ... After all the wasted years . .
 after taking these vitamins , i notice a difference in my skin and hair . . its become better in texture , the skin is tighter , and i feel more awake
 After taking this I 've noticed a difference in my skin improving . I 've had fewer break outs and has been great for my vision as well . When at the range and focusing on the 300 meter target , it has n't been as blury . It was always hard to focus in on , up to this point . That was after taking this product for about 3 months.If you are n't taking this as directed by a doctor , then at least look up the facts from a credible source . One thing that I 've noticed is that when I take this before going to bed , I have very vivid dreams . Almost to the point of being lucid . That might be a common side effect .
 If anyone is looking for a way to fix your skin , I recommend taking these . Of course only under a doctor 's supervision.An early treatment of acne first used during the 1930s was high doses of the fat-soluble vitamin A -LRB- retinoic acid -RRB- . At these dosage levels -LRB- sometimes 500,000 IU per day -RRB- , sebum production is notably reduced , thwarting acne , but overly dry hair is a negative side-effect , and such high doses can lead to vitamin A toxicity . Use of animal-based vitamin A at nutritive levels -LRB- where the upper limit dosage is 10,000 IU daily -RRB- , taken over the course of a year , has also been shown to reduce acne.Source

 I 'm on my third bottle of this supplement , and I do n't know what I 'd do without it . I LOVE it . I break out mainly from hormonal and stress factors , but if I 'm using this product I do n't have breakouts . Ever.My dermatologist was n't too concerned since as I said , my breakouts are hormonal and stress related , but having medical school in the works did the job and motivated me to find a solution of my own . No more wasted time . I 've taken these gels once a day for well over a year now , and my skin looks flawless . I use tub Noxema during the week , and a Nuetrogena Benzoyl Peroxide mask/wash on the weekends since I have sensitive skin . Never had I ever been able to use Noxema without my skin looking like pizza the next morning until I started this Vitamin A regimen.If you have breakouts or even severe acne , skip the Accutane or Retin A and get on this . Give it about a month minimum to start working , and I promise you 'll never have flare ups again.I do n't really have side-effects . I can tell when my body is storing too much a though since I 'll get a slight ache on my left side below the rib cage -LRB- spleen -RRB- . When this happens I 'll drop my intake to every other day or altogether for about a month and it goes away . Any breakouts wo n't occur within a month off of the supplement . Also , when the splenic ache comes I 've also noticed that my water intake has decreased so it is most likely correlated even with fat soluble nature of Vitamin A.
 Very good price for the stonger dose of Vitamin A I look for which are not always easy to find without visiting a health store with overpriced products . This is exactly what I want and I am VERY pleased to find it in the dosage and price I was looking for . Expiration date of 10/2015 !
 I 've almost finished my bottle of this , and my skin has completely cleared up . It was n't that bad but it helped smooth everything out and I am thankful . I 'm going to go to a lower dosage now though -LRB- maybe 5,000 iu -RRB- because it 's not safe to take large amounts of Vitamin A over long periods of time . Even people taking Retin-A only do so for a few months . Also you should take vitamin D with it . Anyway , if you have skin problems definitely try it out .
 NOW is a well known brand , and this product does deliver . The results from the Vitamin A has not been that clear , but then again ... I take so many supplements that I would n't know where the results came from . My face has made a noticeable improvement though so I would recommend it .
 These bibsters things are just great , though they can get pricey . We reuse them if my son does n't make too much of a mess . They 're big enough to protect his clothing , and leakproof too . Just try feeding your baby outside in a public place , and you 'll see why these things are indispensable for today 's parents.The velcro-like neck seal is pretty strong , though my son _ can _ pull it off after some effort at 10 months .
 We 've been using this on our boy since he was 5 months old . Couple of features - waterproof back that prevent wetness going to clothes . The pocket in the front was useful in holding major spills.One thing I 'd like to see straps on the side . Our son sees the bib flapping around and starts yanking it . Straps on the side would secure it so that he does not see it.Other than that - completely satisfied .
 i was tired of always buying bibs expensive or not when ever they got dirty it would be something else i would have to wash . finally i tried the pampers bibsters , i cant even begin to say how much i love them , after every meal i just throw it away , quick and easy . no more washing by hand . i recomend these bibsters to everyone .
 I would recommend this product to every parents with a baby . Definitely a must have item . These bibsters are great for on the go ... ca n't live without it . :-RRB- : -RRB-
 2nd purchase , love them , they hold on my little guy well.i have tried other brand ... b r us ... theirs you must remove a small plastic tab , and if the get warm at all they wo n't come off ! i love my guy can eat a whole orange and they still wo n't leak through.a momma must !!!
 $ 6.49 at TRU and $ 6 + at Walmart for 32 Large disposable bibs . The bib itself is quite large and stays put . Too much liquid will leak at the bottom .
 We recently took a trip with our almost two toddler and purchased these bibs since we would n't have the means of watching bibs after every meal and packing space was limited . These worked great!The bibs stay on very well , unless your child deliberately pulls them off . I have received other disposable bibs as gifts before that simply had a sticker to keep them around my child 's neck , and they did n't stay on well at all . The size is great for covering the full front of your child 's clothes.The pocket is great for keeping messes out of laps . The fold over flap that helps keep it open did n't always stay down , but that was a minimal issue.Around the house I prefer to use cloth bibs that can be washed and reused to minimize waste . But I think these might be my new best friend to keep in the diaper bag for when eating out or on the go !
 I 'm not a fan of the using disposable things , but because these are very thin and I do n't use them very often I think they 're great . Tuck a few of these into your diaper bag and you will be ready for any messy eating occasion . Great for restaurants . My only issue is that they are easy for kids to pull off because the tiny Velcro fastener is n't very strong . And the `` Stay-Open '' pocket has n't proven to be that useful . But they DO NOT LEAK ; clothes stay nice and dry . They have a nice snug neck and they 're a good size . Being able to throw them away is fabulous . I would also recommend them if you do n't like having your bibs get stained with spaghetti stains .
 I am a Mexican Citizen living in Matamoros , Tamps , very close to Brownsville , TX . I recently went to a kids party with my sons in the US side , and the organizer provided me one sample of these Pampers Pocket Bibsters , and it was VERY USEFUL for me.I want to buy them , but unfortunately I have not seen them in Mexico side -LRB- Matamoros -RRB- even in the Mexican WEB PAge from you I could not , too !!!! I writting down this note from Amazon.Com site -LRB- by the way , IT IS NOT available here , too -RRB- This is a very useful option , specially if we are out of home . I do not like to use disposable things -LRB- except diapers , ok ? -RRB- at home , in order to do not contribute to the earth pollution . I do not know if these bibsters are `` biodegradable '' . If not , instead of 5 stars , I would provide 3 stars only .
 I would recommend this product to everybody with a baby in the house . First , it allows you to keep the baby clean , because the bibsters are quite big . Second , they are waterproof and learning to drink out of a cup is always wet . And , third , no washing and a new , clean , spotless bib each time . Makes parenting a bit easier !
 These bibs are the greatest . I used to wash so many bibs andall were getting stained . I use these for Breakfast , lunch & dinner . I save the cloth bibs for drool which is a constant thing . Now that baby is eating pieces of food the pocket catches the food . These are great for going out to eat too . YOu do n't have to put a dirty bib back in your bag .
 My daughter made a huge mess and I hated washing up those bibs after every meal . I brought bibsters the first time they were out and have been using ever since.I have some in my diaper bag . A few in the car -LRB- just in case -RRB- ... One thing though the velcro does not stay on well.BUT LOVE THE BIBS ... oh yeah I put them on when I give my baby juice to drink ... that cute pocket catches every little drop of liquid .
 I just started using these with my 10 month old when we 're out at a restaurant . Today , my daughter dumped over a half-bottle of water down her front , however , thanks to the Bibsters , her clothes remained dry ! I would n't have believed it if I had n't seen it . I 'm hooked !
 Definitely a must have for babies that have started on solids ... these are great , so handy not only for on-the-go but also at home when you run out of clean bibs ... you can never have enough of those ! . The crumb catcher is really neat , it catches dribbles , and spills from the baby 's mouth & no need to wash ... what more can you ask for ?? . The 32 ct for $ 7.69 is an awesome deal !
 We fell into the new items that seemed like must haves and found must we could live without . But Bibsters are a new item that we ca n't like without!We lost 3 before having our daughter so she is spoiled to say the least . She is typically dressed from head to toe in matching Gymboree so bibs are a must come feeding time . Cloth bibs were to messy to deal with so we picked up a box of these . These are great ! The big ones cover the entire front of her top and they absorb any liquids she might slip without allowing it to soak to the shirt . Plus when you 're done you toss them!But what would you expect from Pamper 's ... nothing less that a great item in our case !
 It drives my crazy when my daughter 's bibs get stained with carrots or some other kind of babyfood . These bibs are great for on the go or for foods that are especially difficult to get out of fabric .
 `` Stress is known to burn up vitamins like crazy . It 's another reason to take well above the minimum requirement because of the losses . '' ~ James W. IngoldsbyALL ONE products are my favorite supplements because they come in powder and tablet versions and the ingredients are pure .

 My wife is not real happy with this because it is to wide in girth ... the length is great ... gets right in there and the vibration is TOP NOTCH ... but she just thinks its a bit to painful because of its girth ... I suggest skinnier version ...
 Wife likes natural feel quite a lot . I really like the fact that she enjoys it so very much . Frankly , I hoped it would be a little thicker as I like watching the struggle , and it does have a little smell , but it does n't bother us . It 's a nice piece that looks awesome in my very fair skinned wife .
 Bought this for my wife on her 40th as a surprise , i did some looking around and found this one.it is big and thick , my wife loves the vibration on it , she says this is the best one she has ever had.As far as getting it in you do have to work it in , problem was solved with lubrication.It does have a smell to it which might put some people off , but other than that great toy and the vibrations are out of this world according to my wife .
 Pleasantly surprised with this product . First off , I will say that it was much bigger than expected in diameter . The texture is a very nice change from the normal rigidity of most vibrators . Overall , very effective . It does have a funny smell that I have not been able to get off of the product . Not a horrible smell , but it is noticeable .
 This vibrating dildo feels like the real thing and I love it !! I wish the vibrations were stronger but it does the job during solo play and with a partner !! I am so glad I purchased .
 This is the best lambswool duster I 've ever used . It has a very generous amount of wool and has a long sturdy handle . It does a great job in cleaning delicate items and more . Would buy again .
 I have this in my trunk to dust my car . It is purple and shows dust easily so in a couple minutes it dazzles !!!
 I was thrilled to find a wool duster . I find it to do what it was designed to quite well .
 It picks up the dust quite well . The only thing I wish is that the handle were coated with a varnish , which would make it more comfortable to hold .
 Proves we get what we pay for . I did n't like spending $ 17.99 for a duster but the quality is so much better than my cheaper one -LRB- which eventually broke -RRB- . It 's good quality -- lambswool attracts the dust like nothing else . Very pleased .
 Works wonderfully for cobwebs . I would n't use it for delicates dusting . Those still need a feather duster . This is sturdy for stabbing at the ceiling and in corners . Only wish I 'd gotten a longer stick
 Perfect for dusting the corners where the ceiling and walls meet , as well as the corners of the walls . Well-constructed , and arrived quickly . Purchased a smaller size for dusting the blinds .
 I wore the regulator for the first time last night . It was very comfortable and I awoke with my big to straighter than it 's been in a long time . I will be seeing a doctor for my bunions in a couple of weeks . It will be my first visit and I am hoping he will tell me that the regulator will keep me from having surgery on my foot . I 'm also hoping it will keep that burning in my foot from returning .
 These regulators do more than just ease bunion pain . I have the left and the right foot ones . If you have n't let them get out of hand yet , get these IMMEDIATELY !!!!! My feet are aligned again , and without surgery - which is what I had been told I would need ! I 'm wearing shoes that used to hurt , but without complaint now . and I walk straighter because of it . The first two times or so that you wear it , it does make the joint a bit sore , but that 's to be expected . After all it is stretching cramped muscle and tissue and realigning bones . But after a while you can pull it a bit tighter as the bunion responds to treatment . . I can wiggle my big toe which would n't move much before . All around excellent invention !!
 Great product . Have used it several times and definitely makes a difference , especially if you do not want an operation .
 I find the wide leather strap that rests on my bunion to be very comfy . I also found that the sizing choices helped get the most comfortable fit which is important since you sleep in it so after a couple of nights you no longer notice it . The plastic regulator 's bar that controls the amount you can spread your toe is rigid enough to hold . Others complained of different brands not being strong enough so I went with this one and I 'm glad I did ! I had a problem with the velcro strap 's tab separating where it was glued/heated together , but PediFix 's customer service replaced it ASAP with one call ! Great service from Amazon & PediFix .
 the product meets my expectations , the material is very comfortable , it helps relieve the pressure on my bunion . I get total satisfaction in the estimated
 works really well to keep my bunions small . over time the plastic support has bent and it doesnt work as well .
 Good quality . I am noticing much less pain and the size of the bunion has significantly go down . I have recommended this product to several siblings and cousins -LRB- runs in family no doubt -RRB- ... . even ordered one for a christmas present for my sister . She loves them !
 It was t the right product that got home on time.Great product & service.I will buy agin from the same company
 I wore some shoes that had been comfortable for a year , but I guess more poor feet are changing . They could n't cope with the stress of standing in those shoes for hours . A slight bunion got much worse after that day so I bought this splint to fix it.It did help . Wore it overnight and my foot was realigned in the morning . I hate having foot troubles but until I can afford better care , splints and other OTC remedies help . I write these reviews because I know how frustrating it is to try to solve foot problems . Even many podiatrists do n't have adequate treatments .
 I really like this item and it really helps to relieve the pain but you have to get used to it . It also takes a little figuring out to put it on .
 I got this as soon as I realized I had a bunion , even though I did n't have any alignment problems . Still , I notice a major difference after I wear this overnight . It 's actually fairly comfortable and I can sleep very well with it on . The only possible negative is that it 's made of plastic and thus a little unsteady . You ca n't get up and walk around with it in the middle of the night . But it 's not made for that so it 's OK .
 The product was received in a timely manner . I am anxious to see if it works as anyone with bunions knows , they can be very painful ! Thank you for your prompt service .
 Package says that it fits women 's sizes 8 to 10 and men 's 6 to 8 .
 My foot doc recommended I use this first instead of going in for surgery for a bunion . He told me to wear it for at least 3 months at night . So far , it 's been about 3 months , and I do see a minimal difference with the severity of the bunion . I can wear a pair of narrow shoes now that I previously could not . It 's not an overnight cure , but I would recommend this for anyone with a Stage 1 bunion issue . It looks cheap , but it 's surprisingly durable ! It may feel a bit uncomfortable for the first few nights , but you get used to it .
 I 've seen a marked difference of pain from when I first started using it over a month ago . I do n't have bad bunions , just the beginning of one and my shoes on my right foot always cause it to hurt , even my running shoes . But after continually using it , I 've noticed a decrease and in some cases disappearance of pain in the joint . Love this product , would highly recommend it
 FIT FOOT VERY WELL . HELPS THE PAIN WHILE YOU SLEEP . WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE.IT WILL HELP ALIGN YOUR TOE IN TIME . CAN PREVENT FROM HAVING SURGERY
 I did not think this would work , but every night I use it and in the morning it gets better and better . Thanks !
 Trying to put off fixing my bunion , this product seemed like a good possible solution . I 've been wearing it nightly for a couple of months , but missed about three days this past week.When I wake up in the morning , my foot looks almost normal . By the end of the day , it is back in it 's distorted shape , but I seem to have less pain from the bunion than I did before . And last week , after missing a few days of wear , I had quite a bit more pain in my foot.Overall , it 's not a magical cure , but it does seem to be a good way to manage the pain of a bunion . And I am still hoping that over time it will retrain my foot back to a more normal position . I do recommend this product !
 This is way more comfortable and works better than the footsmart one . The plastic on the footsmart one rubs , where this one is soft and comfortable .
 In the middle of the night some time last week I woke up in excruciating pain . The big bone/joint of my big toe hurt to the touch and I felt like crying . I attempted to get up to walk to my bathroom so I could pop a couple Ib profen . Well , that turned out to be WAY harder than it sounds . Could barely walk . Same goes for the next day , and the next day after that , and probably after that . I thought it was a bunion , upon research and finding out my dad has one too . These babies are mainly hereditary . It slowly got better within about a week , which is when I got my bunion regulator . It 's still a little tender but I am wearing this to bed . It is n't too uncomfortable at all , it just takes some time getting used to this `` thing '' around your foot . But I definitely recommend this product , as I can see it clearly pushing my toe in the direction that I want it to be . If this is a bunion problem , hopefully this realigns me and stretches out all those tendons like I want it to !
 Easy to use , slips on and maintains the angle comfortably . I tried another brand 's product and it was much more cumbersome to put on and uncomfortable .
 After several months of suffering from bunion pain I decided to try this product . Overnight my pain was gone and after wearing it for several weeks I 'm still pain free . It 's comfortable to sleep in and has held up well . I no longer wear it every night but when the pain flairs up I put this on and I 'm feeling great the next day . I highly recommend !
 My wife has feet issues and unfortunately has to wear these nightly . It is one of thew few products that genuinely make her feet feel better .
 This little device is very effective and easily forgettable when it comes to wearing it to sleep . I have faith it will work given time . I hope this is helpful .
 My feet are size 6 and I have the small ones with me . I 've just received the product today and have had it on for quite some time , like more than an hour . Well the instructions did say to put it on for at max 30 minutes initially but it 's really comfortable on me . So far I 've no pain problems with it . They do n't exactly straighten my big toes back to its original state but they help brace them to a better and more comfortable position . If there 's one thing I do n't like it would be the way they space my big toes far off from my other toes . But for a price like this I 'm really happy with it . Getting a bunion splint is n't exactly cheap nor fairly available here in my country and buying it here is like a steal !
 This arrived first of two I bought . It was by far the better product having better components a leather big toe guard and sturdier parts . The other for the right foot had cheap foam , cheaper components and not as comfortable .
 but I do n't use this as often as I should . I will start Monday using this for 30 days straight and report back .
 This is easy to put on and comfortable . I think I could have gotten by with a small . I wear women 's size 7 1/2 and I need to pull the velcro almost all the way around . Wish the size could have been related to shoe size instead of just small , medium , large .
 I got the small size and it fit great , and it definitely pulls your big toe the other direction , but it hurts like you-know-what ! Not because it fits wrong or anything , just because it 's pulling it so much . I can only wear it for like 30 minutes at a time ... at the very most .
 I purchased this item after having much foot pain , especially by end day . Some of the reviews stated it did n't have much padding , but I feel it 's adequate and the design does the job . I feel it 's sturdy and well made . I do agree with other reviews stating the velcro strap is not long enough , and it would n't be for a wide foot . Fortunately , mine is narrow and it fits fine . Others could replace it with a velcro strip found at a sewing store . The first night I could only wear it for 4 hrs , but after that , all night . It 's not made to walk around in , but a quick trip to the restroom is do-able . I 've been wearing it every night for over a month now and have felt a difference . Even after a few days , my foot pain had decreased dramatically . I do n't expect miracles because my bunion has been there for years , but I do feel pain relief , and that 's what I was hoping for . I 'm hoping that after continued use , my toe may tend to straighten a bit . I only wish I had found this item sooner and would recommend anyone with a bunion to use this early on . After talking with people , surgery is the last resort .
 This version was not as expensive as the version shown in the Skymall . I have found it to be effective in helping to straighten out my big toe , of course the bunion bone material is not affected , but it is staightening out my toe .
 I would recommend this product to any/every one ! It does n't take the bunion away , but , does help with the pain associated .
 This does not completely correct the problem , but after each night 's use , my toes are straighter and my bunion does not hurt so much in the morning ... very worth the money and time to put on .
 This bunion regular works well . It is a little uncomfortable but I do n't think that that is because of any deficiency of the product .
 These regulators do more than just ease bunion pain . I have the left and the right foot ons . If you have n't let them get out of hand yet , get these IMMEDIATELY !!!!! My feet are aligned again , and without surgery - which is what I had been told I would need ! I 'm wearing shoes that used to hurt , but without complaint now . and I walk straighter because of it . The first two times or so that you wear it , it does make the joint a bit sore , but that 's to be expected . After all it is stretching cramped muscle and tissue and realigning bones . But after a while you can pull it a bit tighter as the bunion responds to treatment . . I can wiggle my big toe which would n't move much before . All around excellent invention !!
 I have tried other bunion products / toe alignment products and this is the first one that has worked so far . What you get is one brace as pictured . I first tried one and because of the results I order one for my left foot.The brace is for nighttime use or while siting/lounging . You can not wear the brace with shoe and the directions on the box recommends not walking with the brace on.Here is the size chart per manufacture : WomenSmall :7 Medium :8 -10 Large :11 + MenSmall : Medium :6 -8 Large :9 + The first time I put the splint on I could fell the tendons in my big toe stretch.Like lifting weights and feeling the muscle burn . I did not read the direction so I wore the brace for 7 hours . when I took it off my big toe was hurting like hell . However , after the tendons relaxed I was able to walk flat on my foot without pain for the first time in a long time.So I would recommend doing as the direction state `` Limit initial usage periods to 30 minutes each . Gradually wear splint for longer durations and increase band tension as comfort level improves . '' . After using it for a week I am almost to the point where I can wear it all night and not remove it . For a person with a not so severe bunion you may not experience the same discomfort I did.In the short time I have been using this product I have notice an improvement with my bunion.I can now walk without walking on the side of my feet to avoid bunion pain . So for now it gets 5 stars.Also as noted by other reviewers , if you adjust the brace very tight the plastic does irritate/dig into the skin and becomes very uncomfortable . I use myinjinji Performance Mini Crew Toesocksto keep the plastic off of my skin.To clean the manufacture recommends : `` Hand wash in warm water and mild soap . Rinse thoroughly . Press flat in a clean towel to remove excess moisture then air dry completely , away from direct heat and sunlight , before reuse . `` Update
 Unlike its biggest competitor , the FootSmart bunion regulator that looks similar , but is white and blue , this only adjusts in one place . Other than that this is a far superior item . The plastic is thicker and more study . The other dug into my foot with the edge . I can only wear these for a few hours , I put it on fairly tight , but it makes a huge difference in my foot pain the next day and for a couple of days after if I forget to put it on the next night or two .
 I purchased this item after reading a couple of reviews on Amazon and agree that it is an excellent tool for post-bunion surgery . After 25 years of the muscles and ligaments shortening on the one side of the big toe , it helps to achieve some stretch when I am not walking on it . I use it in at night and it does not interfere with my sleeping . It is made of good quality materials and I appreciate the ability to stretch it further by tightening the velcro . Components
 I have had this brace for a month now , and have been wearing it most nights . I noticed that after I wear it , my foot often hurts more but in a different way than it did before I wore the brace . I guess that is just the tendons stretching . I also noticed a little swelling one day . My feet are pretty flexible , so in order to feel like it is stretching my big toe I have to put it on pretty tight . The rigid plastic piece that goes along the bottom sometimes presses uncomfortably on the bone in the ball of my foot -LRB- the big toe joint -RRB- . I realize that this could be because I have very boney feet -LRB- there is very little padding in the palms of my hands as well -RRB- . This sometimes makes my foot hurt the next day , and I can only wear sneakers or foam flip flops at the moment :-LRB- I prevent this by wearing a gel bunion pad underneath the brace , but I try not to do that too much because that makes it fit even tighter and I worry about blood circulation . I hope this review is helpful ; I think I really should have just gone to the doctor to begin with.On the product itself , it came very quickly and seems to be made well . Considering what it is intended to do , I think it is pretty comfortable . I have no complaints about the product itself , other than the fact that it sometimes puts too much pressure on the ball of my foot , I am just not sure it was the answer for my specific issue . It does actually make sleeping more comfortable , since when I 'm not wearing it , unless I am sleeping flat on my back which I do n't do much , I feel like any time my big toe touches the mattress it 's being forced more out of place . This brace prevents that very nicely . I just do n't feel like it 's reversing the condition at all , which some reviews have claimed .
 Excellent product for post-bunion surgery . I wear at night to prevent scar tissue tightening and works lika a charm . Was uncomfortable the first couple nights but now the toe is back in proper alignment and do n't even notice it .
 I use these regulators every night . It has kept my bunion from advancing like it had been . I am much more comfortable with it on . Of course - you should not walk in it and because it is made of plastic , it is very easy for my pupply to destroy - The only reason I did n't give it a 5 star , is I ca n't find replacement parts .
 I have used mine off and on for years . It has kept me from having surgery for the pain . It did take me awhile to get use to . I now use it every night , as I am getting older and find that i have pain in my toe joint if I do not wear it .
 I am very happy with this product . For such a simple design , it is amazing . It provides much relief from the bunion pain .
 This is very comfortable . Good fit , I 'm a womens size 9 and the Medium is perfect . The best thing about it is that is working . Pain relief after the first night .
 We use this to sweeten our coffee in the mornings . It quickly dissolves and is the perfect amount of sweetness .
 After surgery on my hip , I needed a cane that provided me with better support than the generic ones sold at CVS . This cane provides additional support as I go upstairs and downstairs , or off and on pavements . The case was very easy to adjust to fit my height , and has become a permanent part of the equipment I use to get around . Though the cane is little pricey , it is worth it . Please note that if you buy a right hand cane , you can only use it in your right hands . you wo n't be able to use it with your left hand comfortably . So think before you buy . Which hand will you be using your cane in ? IF you are having surgery on your left hip , then a right hand cane will work better and prevents you from limping around , and vice versa for surgery on your right hip -- according to my physical therapist .
 This is a good button hook . the zipper pull is handy , as well . Sturdy and the handle is a god design . The shipping was outrageous , however . No fault of the product , though .
 I love this cane - it is strong and goes together very easily and I ordered the left hand grip in error but am now glad I did as I already have a cane with the right hand grip - It looks nice and works well .
 These bibs are great while on the go . They are disposable which is even better . No need to carry around extra bags to keep dirty bibs in anymore ! They are lightweight and take up almost no space at all ! They are even good in the house when all the bibs are in the wash . We 've ended up doing that quite a few times and we have over 30 washable bibs . Too bad no one thought of these earlier .
 These are nice . I did n't realize there were different sizes available so I got these for my then 8 mo. old . They fit fine . The only problem is that she rips them off . However , she rips her cloth bibs off too .
 I love having bibsters - they 're great for going out , and going to the grandparents house ... just make sure you get the right size . I usually buy them in the store , but this time I bought them online . I did n't realize that there were two sizes , and I bought the small size -LRB- I thought the `` small '' meant a smaller box -RRB- . Not a huge deal - they still fit , but the larger bibsters would have been better for my 20-month old ... they are awesome , though !
 Not much to say other than it works as advertised . One thing worth nothing is that the circumfrance for the neck is kind of snug and is at capacity for our 11 mth old -LRB- granted , he isnt a small baby -RRB- .
 Pampers Small Bibsters with Leakproof Liner , Sesame Street characters , 20-Count , INCREADIBLE , not just for kids , I bought these for my wife at christmas . They were a massive hit at our latest house party . Fun for ALL the family , especially GIBBONS!BUY THEM NOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 Very comfortable , had carpal tunnel surgery and this makes a huge difference , especially on a longer walk . Love the gold accent too .
 This is a great cane - very light weight , colorful and the palm grip is great . My PT person recommended this grip because I have minor issues with my hand but it would work no matter the issue . Hope you enjoy !
 It is comfortable to my hand . I would recomend it to any one who needed to put a lot of pressure on their cane .
 I ordered this product because I wanted a lower dosage than what is available at my local store . I received the product in a timely manner and it was well-packaged and fresh .
 this pouch is basic , but fulfills its function just fine , especially on a smaller size wheelchair , with limited space on arms and from arms to wheel . Other styles either did not fit or got snagged in the wheel . The only difficulty is it tends to creep backwards , would benefit from some sort of stop - not sure how to design that . I bought this for my 91 year old mother with alzheimers , and she manages to use it as well as can be expected . The price is great , much better than other , unnecessarily complicated bags .
 Having an elderly mom who is wheelchair bound , this product is very handy , for she likes to carry tissue , reading glasses and other things with her as she `` travels '' . This keeps her necessities at an easy access and keeps her hands and lap free ! I highly recommend this for anyone in a wheelchair , and the price is very affordable , too .
 Bought these for my Dad & also his friend who are in wheelchairs in Assisted Living . Would HIGHLY recommend for use on a wheelchair . Just put the pockets on the inside of the chair , not the outside as shown in the picture because they get in the way of the wheels . When used on the inside of the chair , there is still plenty of room to sit in the chair and they are not in the way . They can put their mail in the pockets , they carry hand sanitizer in them and they can even bring leftover food from their meals back to their rooms in a small container .
 My mother spends a lot of time in a wheelchair and these two pockets carry more than it appears they can .
 VERY NICE PRODUCT FOR THE MONEY . HOWEVER , IT GETS IN THE WAY OF THE WHEEL WHEN YOU TRY TO ROLL AROUND . I JUST FLIP IT AROUND TEMPORARILY AND PUT IT BETWEEN ME AND THE SEAT . THEN YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THINGS FALING OUT . BE MUCH NICER IF POUCH CLOSED WITH VELCRO STRAP OR ZIPPER.I would buy it again as it is a bargin at $ 15 for 2 pouches .
 Hi , I am writing this review because I recently started taking Dexatrim Natural to suppress my appetite -LRB- mainly at night -RRB- and it is working wonders for me . I 'm a good 65 lbs overweight and I 've tried EVERYTHING -LRB- including willpower -RRB- to diet . The fact is , if I crave the food , and it 's there , I 'll eat it . If it 's not there , I 'll go buy it . Once I came to terms with the fact that I was powerless against my cravings I decided to look for a natural herbal appetite suppressant/metabolic booster . I found Dexatrim Natural , did some research , decided it was safe -LRB- no Ephedra -RRB- and tried it.I 've always known that 95 % of my problem is the fact that I consume about 1000-1500 or more calories almsot every night before I go to bed -LRB- AFTER SUPPER -RRB- . I could n't stop no matter what I did . It just seemed impossible and I kept putting on the weight . So I decided to target my appetite suppression to night time . I take 2 pills an hour or so before supper , and when I eat supper I only have enough appetite for a light meal . Then I have ABSOLUTELY NO INTEREST in food after supper . I go to bed without a thought of food or guilt about overeating.This stuff works WITHOUT the Ephedra . You hear many people saying `` If it does n't have Ephedra it does n't work as well '' . Good luck convincing me . I 've already lost 6 lbs in 2.5 weeks . When I start exercising the weight will probably drop even faster . I also have more energy.So go natural if you want to suppress your appetite safely and effectively . That Ephedra has been shown to be dangerous for some people , and it 's not worth the risk.Just be aware that it has caffeine in it so if you are sensitive to that do n't do it . And you might want to cut back your coffee intake to compensate for the extra caffeine .
 I take one of these ephedrine-free Dexatrims around 10:00 a , after a very small breakfast , and again around 2:30 p , an hour or so after a smallish lunch . I rarely need to snack , nor do I feel hungry _ at all _ during the day . In fact , my only ` hunger ' is true calorie-need -LRB- which has to be satisfied pretty soon , granted : -RRB- I do notice actual fat-burning , which is a bonus . Combined conscientiously with a fun diet , I can lose a pound a day . And the appetite-suppressant has helped me stay always within 6-8 pounds of my target size , even during long vacations or bountiful holidays : -RRB- I 've used this product for about a year and a half . Twice-daily . It is a caffeine-based supplement , so those with caffeine-sensitivities need to deal with that before beginning a program that includes this form of Dexatrim.I 'm a Midwest-born , 5 ' 10 '' male , whose meat-and-potatoes-and-dessert appetite grew him to an average 180lb weight -LRB- 10 pounds over what my BMI would consider healthy -RRB- . With Dexatrim , a small tasty meal approach -LRB- which would n't work without the dexatrim -RRB- , and a couple fun exercise routines -LRB- 2 days on , 1 day off -RRB- , my new natural average weight is 158 lbs . Near underwear-model skinny :-RRB- With good muscle-development , I have an enormous well of self-confidence now . It 's a strange , wonderful new feeling to gain much attention from my opposite sex . My options in life are more wide-open , my self-worth is soaring , and this is an even more enjoyable course of life than one of just satisfying my cravings.This Dexatrim supplement was probably 30 % of the success equation , maybe the single largest factor , along with my willingness to find fun exercise and trust in it.I have no side-effects to report , although I hold the philosophy that one should n't use any kind supplement , or really any form of one product or another , for long periods of time ... I simply have n't found a natural replacement yet ... when I wane-off the product , my natural appetite comes back strongly ... I 'm hoping that just a few more years ' use , along with discipline in food purchasing -LRB- which not being hungry really helps with -RRB- , will allow a permanent adjustment in appetite , which will be wonderful . -LRB- and do n't ever let your children get big appetites , or at least do n't encourage them ... it 's such a hard thing to reverse ... -RRB- Be willing to experiment until you find the right appetite-suppressant ... that 's the most important part of dieting . Yes , selection of foods and exercise are very very close 2nd 's , but you need to be able to get food out of 23 hours of your day first . Try several diet products , one-at-a-time of course -LRB- even the experimentation is a fun game :-RRB- and over three or four months , you should find the product that gives you the highest likelihood of success.Don ' t doubt yourself . Just be willing ... and creative . This is a worthy challenge , one that you - can - win !
 I have just started using Dexatrim Natural . I was concerned at first to use this product , as I a very low tolerance to drugs . I am also caffeine-free . This product has been great . I have minimial side effects , I have been able to concentrate , no shaking , and have been able to control my eating . YEAH
 Well , I went ahead and ordered this product b/c I thought it would be my last resort . I thought I could shed these 10 pounds I 've been struggling w / in the past few months , but I have n't had much luck . I was jogging , swimming , eating right ... nothing was working so my motivation started to sink into the hole.I finally received my long awaited package in the mail yesterday and went ahead and popped one . I could n't believe it ! I was n't thinking about food , my cravings for sweets were put on the back burner , and I 've already lost 1.5 pounds in 1 day , although it may be water weight , but who cares . It 's now keeping me motivated to lose those last 8.5 pounds.I tried Dexatrim a long time ago when they came in those red boxes , but I did n't think they worked and I did n't get my hopes for this product . But , I must say , I have to give these 5 stars . How exciting !! : -RRB-
 It is really great ! I have used this product for years and was really disappointed that no matter where I went I could not find it in stores ! So happy to see that it 's still on the market , 'cause it 's the only item that truly cleans my coffee pot !
 Its a wonderful product . I had been using it for some time but the market here stopped stocking it . I went to amazon and am I glad . Thanks so much
 I 'm glad this product is still available for the few of us who still believe that old-fashioned percolators make the best coffee .
 For some reason Dip-it has become hard to find lately . At least in my rural area . NOTHING works better toremove those hard to get at/nasty coffee stains in the bottom of a metal thermos . I have a coffee carafewith a metal lining and this stuff works fast and clears out everything . You simply can not beat it for removingstains .
 I have a small Cuisinart 4 cup coffee maker with the metal carafe . After having 2 Cuisinart 12 cups , bite the dust in less than 6 months . I had to rely on what I considered my little back up . I refuse to buy another Cuisinart 10-12 cup again , unless they bring the manufacturing back to the USA.But , I digress . My little metal carafe was black from coffee stain , and no amount of Dawn and scrubbing would get it clean looking . I purchased the Dip it , filled my little carafe with boiling hot water and added the Dip It . 20 Minutes later the water was pitch black when I poured it out , but my little carafe was clean , all the stain was gone.Made a pot of coffee right after it was cleaned , I 'd forgotten how good coffee can taste .
 I 've used this product for years . Im completely satisfied with the results . Dip-it removes tea stains from cups , flasks , spoons , even old stains . As a tea drinker I use Dip-it often so I was happy to see they now sell it in a pack of eight .
 Absolutely the best product to clean corningwear tea pot and baking dishes.Makes them look brand new . It works great in perculator coffee pot .
 I used this product for years and was so disappointed that my local supermarket did n't carry it any more . I did a little searching and found it available from Amazon -- that made me very happy ! I use an electric percolator for making my coffee and Dip-it does a great job of removing stains from the pot . This is the second time I 've ordered the 5-pak and hope that it will be available for many more years to come . Thank you Amazon !
 I have been using the powder form of Dip It coffee pot cleaner for years . Lately , the powder has been turning into one large rock very soon after opening the package . I presume the box has been in some damp warehouse for a long time.The boxes I ordered and received from Amazon.com were well sealed-individually . I should not have the problem with any of these boxes.Incidently , the coffee pot cleaner works very well on my Corming perculator pot . I intend to use it soon on my Mr. Coffee iced tea pot.Jim C.
 I 've used this product for many years and found that the coffee pot comes out spanking clean like new . Unfortunately , I ca n't find it in the stores anymore butit is extremely reliable for doing the job . I use it on my Farberware and enjoythe feeling of a sparkling clean coffee pot for a good cup of joe .
 Dip-it is the best stuff for cleaning a thermos . Just put a table spoon in the thermos and fill it with boiling water . All the scum and stains that I could n't get out with a brush and soap comes floating to the surface . This stuff appears to have disappeared from the grocery store shelves . I guess it is too caustic for most modern coffee makers . I think the stuff was created for the old percolator coffee makers , which have pretty much disappeared . The only place I 've been able to buy this product is on the Internet .
 I searched all of the stores for this product , and thankfully I was able to find it at Amazon . It works great for cleaning the inside of my stainless thermos and works great on stuborn stains . Great product , I just do not understand why they took it off the store shelves .
 I have used DipIt for many yearss - I am 60 yrs . old . My mother used it too . It cleans like a wonder . JUST FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS and you 'll be surprised at what this little box of powder can do . My local stores no longer carry it and I ca n't travel too well -LRB- w/c bound -RRB- , so I am ordering it from Amazon in a few days . As for it getting `` hard '' after a while -- once the box is opened , put the box in a small plastic bag , seal it tight and put it into a plastic container . It will stay powery for a much longer period of time -LRB- I do the same with brown sugar -RRB- . It will make the stains in your teapots , coffee makers and even plastic containers go away ! Make a paste of it for the outside of your pots and pans and watch them come back to life -LRB- NOT to be used on NON stick pans plz -RRB- .
 I have used this product for years . It is the best for removing the stains from coffee percolators or tea pots . It is somewhat hard to find these days so I was delighted that Amazon now carries it .
 I used dip-it to clean the awful stains from my white porcelain sink.I sprinkled the stuff on the bottom of the sink and filled it with about an inch and a half of boiling water.After 10 minutes I sloshed the water around which turned brown.When I let the water down the drain , I found the original white sink shining like new.Amazing stuff . I was sure that I needed to get a new sink . NOTHING got out the stainsuntil I rinsed with this miracle compound .
 This product does exactly what it says it will do ! My husband takes a stainless steal thermos to work every day and I have tried many methods to get the stains off , to no avail ... . I used this product with the boiling water and I could not believe the stuff that was floating to the top while I let it sit for about a half hour ... I also used in my electric percolator and once again it worked like a charm , I love it and have found a new ? -LRB- not so new , but new to me -RRB- product that I will be using on a regular basis .
 This is a great product . We have a coffee carafe that had been in use for 7-8 years in an office coffee club situation . It had never been really cleaned ... just rinsed out . The bottom of the carafe was stained with built up coffee sediment . When you looked inside , it was black all around.I filled it with boiling water , added 2 teaspoons of Dip-It , waited 20 minutes and when I poured it out , it looked like coffee . When I looked inside , I could see the shiny stainless steel interior of the pot . It was about 95 % clean , so I repeated the process with only 1 tsp and the pot looks like brand new . Have n't found another product that does as good a job .
 I looked all over for this locally and could not find it . I used to buy it in the grocery stores but they no longer seem to carry it . It is the only thing that will clean out my stainless steel thermoses and coffee pot . Also works great on the tea stains in my plastic ice tea maker .
 Dip-It crystals is the best product I have used for getting coffee and tea stains from my coffee mug and thermos . I drink about a pot of coffee per day . After a month , both my mug and my thermos have a nasty brown film covering the inside . I have tried the Mr. Coffee cleaning products , as well as some other knock-off brands , and they all work `` so-so '' . My technique with Dip-It is to use about a teaspoon of the crystals per 16oz of beverage volume . Boil some water on the stove . Add the Dip-it directly to the stained container . Pour in enough boiling water to completely fill the container . Let stand for about 20-30 minutes . Rinse thoroughly and dry .
 You wo n't find a better cleaner for your coffee pot . I worked many years with different types of coffee pots and NEVER found a better pot cleaner than Dip-it ! I would recommend this above all other home remedies . The best way I found to use this cleaner professionally was to put this in the basket of the percolator as directed on the box , then run the coffee pot according to regulations on making pot of coffee -LRB- except you are using the dip it in its place -RRB- . When brewing is complete , turn pot off and wait 15 minutes . Using a bottle brush was the inside of the pot and the inside of the spout . Dump the pot out until empty then fill with cold water until fullest line of amount of coffee that could be made in your pot size . Brew that water until perk light comes on . Then unplug and wait until cool enough to safely dump water and finish washing pot as usual . It is time to shine the outside of your pot with window cleaner . Enjoy your next cup of fresh coffee from your beautiful sparkling pot . This cup of coffee will taste as good as your very first cup did when you purchased this pot . ENJOY !
 I have been using Dip-it for 30 yrs . to clean our coffeepot and could not find it anywhere -LRB- grocery stores , Wal-Mart , KMart , Target , etc. -RRB- I was happy to finally order it through Amazon and received it rather quickly . Thanks .
 I have used Dip-it before and it is the best for cleaning my Farberware perculator coffee pot but if you do n't want to go to the expense of buying it and the trouble of finding it then you can use Cascade Automatic Dishwashing powder . I put 2 scoops in the pot and run it thru 1 perking cycle and that 's it . The pot comes out gleaming . Put the powder in the basket -LRB- as you would put the coffee in the basket -RRB- and your cost drops like a rock . I find that Windex does a great job of taking care or the outside of the pot without scratching the shiney finish .
 Excellent product . Over the last few years I have been unable to find this product at any of my local outlets , markets , hardware stores etc. . They all agree that they carry the item , but it never seems to be available on the shelf . It was suggested to me by one of the store clerks that the product does n't move fast enough and there is high competition for shelf space . My last resort was Amazon.com . The product was delivered in a few days and it is exactly as advertised .
 I bought this at a local grocery store , and used on my percolator which was dark with coffee stains all the way up to 12 cups . Regular soap and water , or even cleanser could not remove the dark coffee stains . I knew that stain was sucking the life out of my percolator , much less the way the brewed coffee was tasting . I used Dip It once per the directions , and after one brewing cycle , that percolator and its parts came out shiny and brand new looking . Wow!Too bad about the vendor problems reported below by J.A. Wallace . I was hoping to find an alternate supplier .
 I love this stuff ... it cleans percolators and makes them look like the day they came out of the box . The only problem is that the stuff is clumped and hard when I receive it , and I have to take a knife to it to separate the powder crystals , which can get really messy ...
 Dip-it stain remover is the best stain remover I have found for getting rid of stains caused by boiling tea . It is only one that gets rid of the staincaused by the tea bags . I highly recommend this product.Harold C. Prichard
 Dip-It Food & Beverage Stain Remover
 This is a review of the powder version of Dip-It . This product is designed to remove the stains from all parts of the coffee maker which are in contact with the coffee . It is highly alkaline and will completely remove the brown stains from the filter basket and the carafe . I ran this cleaner through a neglected coffee maker at work . The results were simply amazing . The wash solution looked like coffee and the thermos carafe came out looking like new . For those of you wondering , the liquid version of Dip-It is not a replacement for this product . It is an acid liquid and is designed to remove mineral scale from parts of a coffee maker which are in contact with water . Most coffee makers used in the home have water reservoirs which are subject to water scale buildup . This is what the liquid is designed to remove . It will do nothing to remove brown coffee stains .
 Knew about it , before found it on amazon . Works the best to clean coffee mugs and pots .
 Dip-it is an amazing product . Nothing else is like it when it comes to a thermos or carafe .
 If you 've noticed that your coffee does n't taste like it did when the coffeemaker was new , you need Dip-it . Forget vinegar and water or trying to clean those hard-to-get-at places by hand ! The reason I use Dip-it ? Simple
 I have been unable to buy Dip-It at the grocery store for over a year and found it on Amazon . It is a wonderful product and does a great job cleaning my stainless electric coffee percolator.I will keep it on my Amazon list .
 I 've tried other coffee pot cleaning products . They do n't compare . Dip-it cleans coffee pots .
 Dip it in powder form is the absolute best for removing coffee and tea stains from the inside of your thermos bottle . I highly recommed that the manufacturer promote this concept because it works . I am certain that for other stains it will work as well and it is safe to use your thermos after use . What more can one ask for .
 We bought a new coffee maker that came with a stainless steel carafe . After six months or so , the insides started getting dark no matter how many times we washed it . My wife tried vinegar and a bottle brush which helped a little . I remembered a product called &#34; Dip-it &#34; my mother used to use . I looked in grocery stores , department stores and specialty stores . No one had heard of it . I should have gone to Amazon.Com first.Following the directions on the box and letting the carafe soak for about 1/2 hour , it was spotless , like a brand new pot . I 'm glad I opted to buy a box of 8 . This is the only cleaner I 'll ever use on my coffee pots .
 Have been looking all over for DIP-IT for several years , made my wife very happy . Glad I found this product .
 I looked at all the online stores as well as locally for this . It is fantastic for removing stains . I had several badly stained coffee cups which now look like new . I 've seen several posts about using other things to remove stains but Dip-it works faster and requires no effort on my part other than boiling some water to dissolve it . I was even able to make several frying pans shine again . What sold me though was an old coffee carafe that I was ready to toss out as the stains inside of it had been there for a long while and nothing would remove them . I found an old box of dip-it under my sink and decided to give it one last effort . WOW -- All stains gone in minutes and the carafe looks like the day I bought it .
 I ordered this for my Mom who still uses an electric percolater and swears this is the only thing that will clean her pot . While her local store claimed they carried it , we were never able to find any . So I ordered the 8 pack online . Good price , great service and a happy Mom !
 Outstanding performance . Does what it promises ! I have used it for years on coffee and tea staining and works when nothing else will . Amazon makes purchasing it convenient .
 Dip-It Food & Beverage Stain Remover
 I 've been looking for this product for a long time and finally found it on Amazon.com . I am very happy with my purchase because my ' 94 ' year old mother says it works beautifully . Mom being happy makes me happy !
 Works great ! I had a coffee pot turned murky inside and after letting it soak with the powder , the pot was sparling clean ! I was impressed ! Very Happy customer .
 We 've used this product for many years . It cleans stainless steel coffee pots perfectly . They shine better than they did when new .
 After trying several products to clean coffee pot with several months of stains , finally found Dip-it at Amazon.com . For some reason it is no longer carried in retail stores . It works even better than I remembered from previous use . Super stuff . The minimun purchase amount will last a looong time .
 Used to work in a restaurant where they used Dip-It to clean the large coffee pot . It seemed to work well then , but I was not really into coffee much then . Now , I drink it almost all day and had trouble with buildup in the coffee maker . After about a year and a half of using vinegar monthly and other products several times , the inside was brownish black . I decided to try Dip-It . Wow , talk about surprise ! One use and the water came out looking like coffee and it even cleaned the little outlet filter on my Hamilton Beach Brew Station . I just used it a second time after a month and it was not nearly so dramatic , but the coffee maker works like new and the coffee tastes good.Very highly recommended . The highest praise I can give to anything is to say , `` It works . '' This one works .
 I have used this product for years . It 's the only thing I can find to really clean my percolator . Just wish I could find it in the local supermarkets .
 I received this in about 3 days . Was very pleased to find , since it is n't in stores any more . I bought some of the liquid , but it does n't work . Thanks B Mason
 I used to be able to find Dip-it at the grocery store . I have been using it for years because I love the old-fashioned coffee percolators . The last few times that I looked for it in the stores , they had Dip-it , but all they had was the liquid . I needed the powdered version in the box and I was really excited when I discovered that Amazon.com carried it . I ordered a box , received it very promptly and used it to remove all of the built-up stains in my coffee pot . I just ca n't get over the difference in my coffee pot before and after Dip-it . This product is so easy to use ... I just filled the coffee pot with water , put a couple of spoons full of the product into the basket where the coffee would go , plugged the pot in and let it go through 1 brew cycle . The next time I took the lid off of the pot , took everything out and rinsed it thoroughly , the pot looked brand new . It was just as clean and shiny as it was the day I first bought it ! I 'm very impressed with Dip-it ... it does a great job!Thank you , Amazon.com , for carrying this product .
 I had used Dip-It Food & Beverage Stain Remover for many many years until I could no longer find it on supermarket shelves . Used other products and they DO NOT work . I recently saw it on Amazon.com and was thrilled . This product is amazing . It is the only product that truly cleans my electric Farberware coffeepots . I also purchased Dip-It for Automatic Drip Coffee Maker for another family member . She was so pleased to finally have a product to clean her drip coffee maker . This product is an essential item in your kitchen . Believe me it WORKS !!!!
 This product did all it claimed to . I used it on a percolator coffee pot that was over 8 years old . This pot made consistantly 1 to 2 pots of coffee per day over that time period . Dip-it cleaned the metal to a like-new shine . The coffee made from it now tastes fresher as well . This is a good product .
 Excellent product , removed all deposits from a thermal coffee carafe easily ! I have recommended this product to family and friends .
 This is a fantastic product !! It works - gives immediatecomfort to sore , callused feet * Hightest Rating over anyproduct out there for feet !
 Great product , I have small feet so it 's hard to find shoes that fit well . These pads help me fill in my shoes and are extremely soft , keeping aches away . I practically have one in every pair of heals I have . Plus . It 's a great deal . : -RRB-
 A great product , but you need to put it on the proper shoe . If you use it on shoes with a closed toed , your toes can no longer fit comfortably inside as this product is considerably thick . It works best with shoes that have lots of toe wiggle room , such as heeled sandals . I put it on my sandals that have a very well-worn toe bed , and it 's extended the lifetime of my well used shoes . Make sure to clean your shoe and let it dry before apply the product -LRB- such as with a bacteria killing surface cleansing wipe -RRB- , and it should help it stick better . I have n't had any problems with it peeling off .
 If you are like me and hate your foot slipping to the front of the shoe , this product is for you . It also provides extra cushioning and works with pumps , peep toe , sandals , boots and sneakers mary jane style . I 've used it for years and so far no complaints !!!! This product is available at drug stores but a much higher price -LRB- between $ 6.99 and $ 10.99 -RRB- . For me the affordability offered through Amazon is the cherry on top !! I recommend this product !!
 They 're not perfect , but I have tried many other insoles and they are the best I have been able to find for my tender ball-of-foot .
 I use this product in my daughter 's hair . She is two and a half , but has natural pincurls that are tighter than Shirley Temple 's . When you pull the hair down straight , it -LRB- literally -RRB- goes down to the middle of her back . Having a shampoo with a smoothing , detangling quality is a MUST.PROS :1 . It 's super cheap . This is always a good thing , as the bottle occasionally gets squeezed into the tub to make bubbles when I am not looking . -LRB- As a plus for kids , it causes super bubbles , and works just as well as a bubble bath would -RRB- .2 . It 's by Suave , so you know it 's a decent product . I like Suave a lot , and have found that this works better than any other children 's brand of shampoo we have tried .3 . It works VERY well with the Suave for Kids Detangler spray . I use it right after my toddler gets out of the bath , and we immediately brush her hair . We started using the detangler spray first , but have definitely noticed a difference since we started using this product .4 . It smells great ! We tend to buy the combo packs -LRB- which have different smells -RRB- , and the strawberry remains one of my favorite . I have a hard time finding kids strawberry-smelling products that do n't smell overly fake and sugary , and this product does a good job of it .5 . It rinses out super quick . My daughter freaks out when you spray water on her head -LRB- even if it 's from a cup -RRB- , so it 's ability to rinse out quickly is a plus .6 . It is tear free . My daughter does n't freak out , scream , or cry when she gets it in her eyes . MAJOR BONUS ! 7 . It lasts a long time . We only need a squirt half the size of a dime , and it washes my daughter 's hair thoroughly . I would say on average , one bottle lasts us about a month and a half to two months . This is not bad , especially when you consider that one bottle costs under $ 2 ; it equates to $ 1 a month , and we also use the detangler , but that is relatively inexpensive too!At this time , I have no cons for the product . We use it in my household daily , and I could n't ask for anything better . My daughter and I both love it , and I do n't plan to replace this product any time soon .
 My kids love this stuff . And it does n't cost that much . I just wet my kids hair apply and wash out . Then BAM ! its over . plus thier hair is so soft plus it smells great
 Arrived on time . No spillage . There was a piece of tape on the top to ensure it would not leak . Great purchase .
 I bought this for my mother who uses a walker , has balance problems , trouble getting in and out of bed , and has fallen out of bed . I ordered it standard shipping on a Sunday and it arrived early Tuesday morning ... less than 48 hours later . It is very well made from sturdy tubing and is easy to use . Having something that functions as a bed rail but doubles as a handle to assist getting in and out of bed is a fantastic combination . It only took about 5 minutes to install and to set the correct height of the latch mechanism that secures it when being used in the bed rail position . It 's very light and easy to lift to swing it out from the bed . My mother loves this and her mind is at ease knowing she wo n't fall out of bed in the middle of the night . I highly recommend this product . However , I do n't understand why the price went up from $ 98.75 to almost $ 150 in the last 30 days . I probably still would have bought it at that price but might have looked to see if it is available for less at some other site . At the time I bought it I got it at the best price I could find . If I had paid $ 150 I would have rated it 4 stars .
 I use these in the high voltage power trade and they can not be beat for cleaning oxidation from equipment
 works great when cut to smaller squares and used on a rotorary tool to clean up diamonds on diamond willow sticks
 I ca n't say enough good things about this item . My daughter-in-law has one and I 've wanted one ever since I saw -LRB- and heard -RRB- hers . So I bought myself one and when my mother-in-law saw it , she had to have one for herself and one to send to her sister . So she had me order these two on my Amazon account . You would n't think a little box could pack so much atmosphere into your room , but it really does . The loons are my favorite sound , they drive my husband crazy but he loves the thunder . My mother-in-law loves the birdsounds and leaves it on day and night for its soothing effect . The first night we had this thing we put it on thunder and fell asleep on the couches where we slept like babies all night long . Get one of these , turn off the lights and enjoy the lights as well -- you 'd think the lighted colored rain effect would be kind of cheesy but it 's just so cool . The summer night setting reminds me of being in the Blue Bayou Restaurant adjacent to the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland . Can you tell I like my Rainforest Fountain ? Get one . You must experience this .
 I personally have been using this fountain for three years now and PLEASE read the instruction manual PEOPLE ! -LRB- im only saying this because I know for a fact ppl did not do it correctly and made a bad review for their ignorance -RRB- You have to put the pump in the water for it to cycle the water back into the machine , once the pump is placed CORRECTLY you will hear no sounds of the pump . You also can control how fast you want the water to flow , which is wonderful . You may have slow flow which sounds like a slow moving creek or turn the water up and you can enjoy sounds of rain , from sprinkles to raining hard ! Hope this helps , and everyone please read manuals when you buy something , haha : -RRB-
 I have seen this in stores before for 50.00 I am pretty sure I got for someone about a year ago . I have been searching for it for a while , a friend got me one of those clocks that makes rain sounds but its not the same as real water.other reviewers have said its to loud I do n't think so just make sure you place the pump all the way on the bottom and put the right amount of water to cover the pump . you can play the sounds at the same time as the rain if you wanted to.and yes its plastic as i read in another review , what did you expect it holds water.I personally love it and would buy it again and again .
 I was n't excited about this when I recieved it as a gift a few years back , but once I turned it on I was hooked . Nothing has compared to it . With the different sounds to choose from while watching the water flow over the rock wall , it just relaxing . Try for yourself . If you do n't like it , return it . You ca n't please everyone .
 Hi - I sent this as a gift for Fathers day , so I have n't physically seen the product - BUT - MY MOTHER SAYS - its elegant , especially enjoying the illumination behind the waterfall and ` track 4 - the Loons ' . She states ` calming , soothing ' . She had a dinner party that evening and many were in awe and asked where it was purchased from . - so - indirectily ' I recommend '' .
 Item is excellent however the rain drops as it were act as if they are clogging , which they are not . The water does evaporate rather quickly , but all in all if I were going to buy a fountain again , it would be this one.HoMedics Envirascape Gentle Rains Fountain
 This machine is far more than we expected . It is very soothing and there are many variables . This has been a wonderful purchase for us .
 I have this in my bedroom and I drift off to sleep every night to it . Its GREAT !
 Very comfortable , had carpal tunnel surgery and this makes a huge difference , especially on a longer walk . Love the gold accent too .
 This is a great cane - very light weight , colorful and the palm grip is great . My PT person recommended this grip because I have minor issues with my hand but it would work no matter the issue . Hope you enjoy !
 It is comfortable to my hand . I would recomend it to any one who needed to put a lot of pressure on their cane .
 I purchased one of these last year for a relative who lives abroad and she is very happy with it and uses it a lot . Her daughter who also has neck problems tried it and loved it too so this year I am sending one to her as well . Good stuff .
 this is perfect for both cold and hot applications . when I have a sinus headache , I actually secure the collar around my face and neck and it works really well . it 's helpful in dealing with the pain of cervical erosion -LRB- not THAT kind , Ladies ! -RRB- and feels good .
 My wife and I use the collar nearly every day , our second one owned , using it for arthritis of the neck and spine and shoulder rotor cuff replacement surgery for myself , I recommend it highly ! Our first one has lasted four years and is still useable . Just wanted a back up .
 This item is super fantastic . It is easy to use , and WOW ! WOW ! WOW!just heat in the microwave and it gives off warm moist heat to make your sore muscles feel better . Loved this so much , I bought a second one and talked about it so much to a friend that I gave the second one to her . This item is GREAT !!!!!!!!!!!!
 This is a fantastic ice pack . I have a severe neck injury and I get immediate relief from this . I was looking for something similar to what is used at PT places and this is perfect .
 Once we finally rec 'd the correct item -LRB- orig order not from this company , so no reflection on them -RRB- ... my husband loves it . He uses it for cold therapy only
 I love this Elasto-Gel Cervical Collar !! I keep it in it 's original bag in the freezer , and it helps immensely with my neck , and I can lay down in it if I need to !! It does n't ` choke ' me , I do n't feel like I 'm stuffed into a tube , it 's comfy , flexible and I 've never heated it because heat is not good for my nerve damage , but from what I 've read , it 's great heated too ! I 'm getting another one for back up when my stenosis flares up . I 'm getting the ones for the feet and the lumbar area as well ... I can not wait to get them !!!!
 This gel collar holds heat much longer than other collars . It fits well and I can even sleep with it .
 I have a disease which inflects a lot of pain . This helpful for both pain and support ! I highly recommend this product !
 This product is exactly as described . I needed cold therapy that comfortably wrapped around my neck and this did the trick !
 I definitely liked the taste of this toothpaste . It 's not too sweet like many toothpastes . After using this , my mouth tastes fresher than usual . I 'd previously used Rembrandt 's Whitening kit , so my teeth were already pretty white , but I noticed that they seemed even whiter after using this toothpaste for about a week .
 This is one of the better whitening toothpastes I 've used . It whitens teeth better than other brands , and it does n't leave a heavy feeling of fluoride afterwards . My mouth feels clean and fresh .
 I noticed a significant change in the whiteness of my teeth . It took some getting used to , as the toothpaste does n't foam as others do . I do n't think I 'd buy this as my primary toothpaste , but I 'll buy it to supplement my regular brand . It does a great job of whitening .
 I 'm very impressed with the Rembrandt Natural Whitening Toothpaste . I 've been using it for about one week now and I can see a measurable improvement . In the past , I 've tried other whitening toothpastes and was NOT impressed . By the way , I 'm a smoker and a coffee drinker so I have a problem with discoloration that Rembrandt improved noticeably . A number of my friends commented on my whiter teeth and asked if I had them '' `` professionally '' '' whitened . They were very surprised when I told them it was due to Rembrandt . I was also pleasantly surprised by the taste . Some of the other whitening products were nasty , whereas , Rembrandt had a pleasant flavor with no aftertaste . All in all , I 'm very happy with Rembrandt and have and will continue to recommend it to my family and friends .
 Overall , I liked Rembrandt toothpaste . The only thing I did n't like about it is that there 's no fluoride in the toothpaste . I also did n't get a fresh taste in my mouth after using it , although my teeth seemed whiter . I 'd recommend it for whitening purposes .
 The gloves I was using previously would tear while putting them on about 30 % of the time.These gloves have not torn once and are more comfortable .
 I often get leg cramps when I eat sugar , and these digest so quickly that very soon after taking two the leg cramps are gone -LRB- works for my mother too -RRB- . Just make sure you take them after eating -LRB- never before -RRB- or the fast acting calcium will upset your stomach .
 I 'm very happy with this product because it has all the right vitamins in the right ratios to increase the bioavailability of the calcium . It 's also a great price . Thanks !
 I used this calcium all throughout my pregnancy and in my daily life as well . This is the only vegetarian calcium that i have found that does not constipate me , give me nausea , and is easy to swallow . Be sure to get the vegi caps if you do n't want a big pill .
 works great to keep calcium levels just right for me . I highly recommend this item . Great size , works great too .
 these tablets are more chaulky than I likeI will try capsules/caplets next time
 I purchased this for my husband who was told by our doctor that he needs to supplement his calcium intake . These are exactly what he needs and at a really good price !
 I have used this product from Now Foods for quite a while with good results . When ordering supplements I only buy supplements from Now Foods .
 I generally avoid the cheapo brands like now foods but in the case of simple calcium , I must say that this is a good buy . you get 250 tablets for a good price . I will continue to use them
 this is probably the only product by now foods that I have been happy with.This is a good buy for calcium and has helped me with my calcium deficiency .
 I have owned this product for a month now and I love it . I was tired of shaving my legs every other day it seemed . Waxing was too expensive to have done professionally . And I found it too messy when I tried to do it at home . So I went searching for another way to solve the problem . I stumbled upon the Philips Norelco HP6409 Satinelle Soft Epilator . I did some research online and decided to give it a try . I totally love it . It works really well . At first it hurts a little but I did n't think it was as bad as waxing . After a few times though you really hardly feel it anymore . I like the fact that you do n't have any sticky wax and you do n't have to have water and soap or shaving cream . You can just whip it out turn it on and away goes the hair . I have only used it on my legs so I ca n't comment on using it for any other hair removal . If you are tired of the mess and hassle of shaving and/or waxing I recommend you give this a try .
 This is my first epilator and I think it works pretty well . It 's pretty basic but I like the results . Though it is n't the most comfortable sensation , I find it much less painful than waxing or using Nair . I have very sensitive skin and have tried numerous ways to get rid of the hair on my legs . The epilator does n't leave much of a mark on my skin -LRB- what it does leave goes away in about an hour -RRB- unlike the redness and pain I get after waxing or using Nair-like products . I do plan on upgrading once this one has worn out , but overall I think it 's a good product for the price . * On a side note
 I used to own a Braun epilator -LRB- an old model from the 90 's -RRB- in Europe and when I moved to US , I started looking for another one because of the voltage difference . I wanted to give Philips a try and I am very satisfied with it . I use epilator for my legs and my armpit . Epilating lasts longer and feels more comfortable than shaving . 5 stars !
 Does exactly what it needs to . Plucks out the hairs fast and easy . The shaver head is also nice for touching up areas too sensitive for pulling out hair.This product is worth the good reviews . It 's simple , without any unnecessary gadgets that will make it cost more than it 's actually worth . The massager does n't do much for me but it really wo n't be needed once you get used to the pain . One fair warning though , do n't let hair grow out too much , or it WILL be painful .
 I was amazed by how much different element were added to the epilator . I was just expecting the head with the massage head . but the razor is just as useful . unlike older version of epilators , this one is really nice and a lot softer on your skin .
 This is the first time ive used a equilator . Got to tell you it hurt the first few times and it irritated my skin a little to . Ive realized the more I use it the less it hurts . Just like plucking your eyebrows where it hurt the first few times but after that it doesnt really . And now my skin doesnt get irritated . I use it to shave about everything and its very effective . I dont have to shave very often and each time the hair grows back there is less of it and its thinner . I highly recommend it and want to remind everyone it is a process each time you use it .
 I got this as a present from my husband . My life has become so much more convinient with this epilator . Of course , like all others who think so , epilators are suited only to those who are accustomed to plucking of hair from roots.The specialised detachable shaving heads work very well n are very easy to clean . I have now been using this for about an year n its perfect .
 its my second one of same philips company , nd i found it good , ya u may have problem of ingrowth hair , but its ok , u can handel it , overall this system is good for everytime use , better than vaxing , threading and creaming ...
 My hair grows back finer , lighter , and I only have to use it once every 2 weeks or so . Although , I do n't recommend using it on your bikini area or underarms until you 're used to waxing .
 This product is simply awesome , I gifted it to my wife & she just loves it , for someone who is used to epilators & knows how to operate them , its a great product , certainly `` soft '' as the name suggests , all the attachments work just perfect . . !!! The twin speeds are another addition .
 This product does exactly what it is supposed to do . There will be some pain at first when using this product , but its gets easier after the first time . The key to using a epilator is to exfoliate , exfoliate , exfoliate . If not , you will have some serious ingrown hairs . Do n't expect your legs to be in anyway as smooth as shaving with a razor though . The epilator works really well for your underarms as well as legs .
 This product is GREAT ! I 've waxed for 12 years . It 's messy but effective . I have two small children and NO time whatsoever to wax anymore . With this epilator , I can stop and start at any time removing hair . It 's very effective and barely hurt on my legs . I do admit to using the massaging head for the underarm and bikini line . The massager was very helpful . It took me about 15 - 20 minutes to do my entireleg -LRB- s -RRB- , underarm and bikini line . That includes using the razor head to touch up . I 'll never go back to waxing .
 My wife loves Philips epilator products . THis is the second one I purchased and she tells me the epilator does a great job . She recommends it .
 Excellant , Excellant , It leaves my skin smooth.Regrowth is softer eachtime.Love it Love it.Jenni
 I purchased the scrub brush to clean my tile floors . Along with the sponge mop , it cleans the floors well .
 Overall good products , cut pretty well and they are sharp and protect you from hurting your skin . The price is very reasonable and that is the reason I got them for . The durability is not that great though and after a couple of shaves I have to replace my blade pretty quickly .
 I ordered the Gillete Mach3 blade replacements . The arrived very fast and in perfect condition . Thanks - I will order more soon
 These are the best razors for the money . I have tried all the new razor fad and still come back to `` old reliable '' Mach 3 . Thanks Gillette for making my skin smooth .
 Mais uma facilidade que a America proporciona aos brasileiros . Se eu comprasse esse produto no Brasil , pagaria em torno de 70.00 dolares . Viva o consumismo ! Recomendo , excelente produto , original . Use em um angulo proximo a 90 graus em relacao ao seu rosto . Aplique pouca pressao e use uma boa espuma . Para espumas Homemade , use de 3 a 5 gotas de glicerina para facilitar o barbear .
 This item was well packaged as well as exactly as described . I think its a good deal for the price these days .
 It came quickly in a small enough package to fit in our apartment mailbox . Cheap price , good product . They are n't packaged for the US , I think they 're from another country . But they fit just fine and my picky husband likes them well enough . PLus they were much much cheaper than buying from the grocery store . Good buy for sure .
 For years and years I used some variation of the Gillette Trac 2 . These blades gave me a decent shave , and I had no real reason to complain.I do n't remember when I first started using Gillette Mach 3 , but I could definitely tell the difference from the first shave . My first impression was that this blade is amazing ! I remember how the first time I dragged it across my face I could barely feel it . It was much smoother than any other razor I 'd ever used before . Not only was it a smooth shave , but it cleanly took off all my whiskers and did so more perfectly than the Trac 2 . I 've noticed , however , that it does n't take that long before the shave is n't quite as smooth and close as it was at first . And then the blades seem to go into a mode where they give a decent shave for a long time . And then , at some point , I realize it 's just not doing the job anymore , and I put in a new blade.I 've never had any problems with the handle , and I 've been using the first one I got for years now with no complaints . I solve the price problem of the replacement blades by buying them in bulk on either Ebay or Amazon . I try to get them for under $ 2 per cartridge if I can.There may be better razors or blades out there , but I 'm content enough with the Mach 3 that I 've stocked up on enough to last me for years !
 I decided to look online for Gillette Mach3 Cartridges to see if I could get a better price than what I was paying here locally . I did and saved myself a lot of bucks . :-RRB- I got 12 for $ 14.95 I would have gotten 5 at my local store for that price . Amazon.com is a great place to find bargains and so far I have been happy with all my purchases from the people that sell merchandise through Amazon .
 I 'm glad that I found somewhere to get these replaceable blades at a good price . Thanks again
 Third time I 've purchased from this source . Refill blades are always fresh and sharp . Will always buy here as long as this product is offered .
 No one ever `` taught '' me to shave , so I do n't really know how long to use each one . But shaving my head -LRB- full head of hair -RRB- and my face with these is awesome . I think I over use them a little bit , but one cartridge lasts me for like two , three months . -LRB- Shaving my entire head once a week -RRB- I 've used them for about three years and have gotten an extremely close shave every time . Not once have I cut myself using them .
 The razor blades arrived only two days after I ordered them . The box and blades seemed a little bit cheaper than what I would buy in the store , but they work just fine . The cartridge fits onto my existing handle and provides a smooth shave . Seems like a good deal to me considering what they cost at the grocery store .
 Once in a while i have strayed to other products but in end always have returned back to mach3 .
 Mach3 does a fine shaving job , and it 's better than the cheap razors you find at the supermarket . They 're durable -LRB- although not as much as I 'd like -RRB- . I believe that Mach3 cartridges are more widely available than Schick Quatro cartridges , and that the 4 blades were overkill -LRB- let 's wait for the 7-blade razor to see how that works -RRB- Also with Amazon 's Subscribe & Save feature , they arrive at my door with discount and I never run out of them . Nice !
 My husband and I both use these . I know they are for men but I have n't found a lady 's razor yet that could touch the Mach 3 . I had been buying the blades from that super-center store -LRB- you know the one -RRB- and it is more expensive to buy from there than it is to order here online from Amazon . Especially if you get the free shipping with your order you ca n't go wrong . One blade will usually last me one week shaving my legs every day .
 I 've tried all manner of shaving systems in the 40 or so years I 've been shaving and I 've never come across anything that can better or even match the Gillette Mach3 system . I have a very tough barbed-wire beard , but the shaves I get are consistently smotth and close . Recommended without reservation !
 Clearly the mach 3 is better than the rest , more is not always better dude , the mach 3 is like ... well , it 's like one of those sleeper razers . You know , your like getting ready to shave and in your mind your thinking , `` Three blades ? this ca n't possibly ... WHOA ! , what the heck was that ? '' Well Mr. , that there was a quality mach 3 shave .
 I 've been up and down -LRB- literally ! -RRB- with many a blade -LRB- Schick Extreme 3 , Gillette Sensor 3 , a regular bic -RRB- you get the idea . And so far nothing has worked for me as well as the good ol' Gillette Mach 3 . It 's been a mainstay in my medicine cabinet for more than 3 years now!It does the job it 's intended to do quite well , and the regular 4 pk pretty much does me a week and half . Unfortunately , I only get 2 shaves per blade , and the 2nd is NEVER as good as the first , obviously . But this is more a matter of an individual 's facial hair , not so much the blade , and is too open to debate which detracts from the message I am trying to give . To me , the MACH 3 is the best non-battery powered -LRB- see MACH 3 TURBO , which I have not tried at this time -RRB- disposable razor that you can buy today , that I have triedThe one drawback may be in the price . In recent years the price of the original 4 pack has shot up quite noticeably . I can remember buying one for maybe $ 6.98 CDN and now I ca n't find one under $ 8.98 CDN , and this is at WAL-MART , no less ! But that really has nothing to do with the quality of the razor , which is awesome.The absolute very best shave may be found in one of those expensive Philips or Braun electric shavers with the fancy bells and whistles , and if you want to shell out extra cash for one , go for it . But for those on a budget and want a great shave , you need n't go any further than the original MACH 3 blade . These days , there are a few spin-offs , such as the TURBO as well as a new FUSION brand -LRB- with 5 blades ! Pretty soon they 'll make one that just takes off a whole layer of your skin ! -RRB- , and I am interested in checking those out , only thing is they are TERRIBLY expensive . For tried and true , grab a MACH 3 , and start shaving !
 I am bald by choice and the best way to remain so is with the Mach3 . Ask any person who shaves their head regularly and I am sure they will agree with this choice for the best and most nick-free shave .
 These blades sell for way too much in a store . This is a great value and it stocks me up for a long time .
 Got this product before I even got the notification that it was sent out ! Customer service representatives are friendly & helpful .
 For some reason , I still find this the best razor out there . Better than the 4-bladers . Maybe I 'm crazy .
 Original product , work great , last a long time . a fair price , convenient shopping for me
 Switched from fusion blades to these , very impressed . I 'll be sticking with the mach 3 's .
 Packaging indicates they are from Brazil , but these cartridges work as well as any other Mach3 I 've used . As always , Mach3 provides a great shave .
 they do the trick . i cant believe razor blades in general are so expensive but this package is not a bad deal . i use each blade about 15 times before i replace them although they do dull out after about 8 . but i am a very frugal and poor person so i can not afford to replace them like a prince . overall though a good value .
 These still work great-no need for 5 blades that I see . I use these with the newer vibrating handle , they give a nice close shave and cost much less that the newer ones ...
 I get 4-5 shaves with each razor , after that it causes pimples . I find it too expensive , but there is no better alternative .
 I tried these before using sensor Cartridges but found to be making many cuts on my face.I would not say they are good or bad but it depends on skin condition of every person . I would rather prefer Gillite Sensor Cartridges .
 Amazon , by far had the lowest price on this 12 pack of Mach 3 cartridges .
 His shave comes out much smoother with this cartridge as opposed to the one with fewer blades .
 First purchase by subscription and it 's a quick , no-brainer money and time saver . Thank you Amazon
 The product was as described , and arrived quickly . Thank you for a smooth transaction . Will use seller again .
 Excellent price . Even if you pay shipping , it beats the Walmart price by a lot .
 Although these blades are marketed for men , I am a woman and love them more than the Venus `` women 's version '' . If you like the Venus handle though these blades will clip right on , I love it . And talk about long lasting - I kid you not
 These Gillette Mach 3 's shave closer , with less iritation that any other on-skin razor including Schick 's quattro . Additionally , the blades last for at least 10 shaves before needing to be replaced . The Schick blades were noticeably duller after on 4 or 5 shaves .
 I shave ... I needed razors ... best to buy in bulk ... these are a good deal
 This is a nice price for 12 cartridges / $ 20 in case if one needs a replacement . Being lazy shopping in Brick-and-Mortar stores , I figured out that Amazon is a great source of everything I need including my shaving supplies . Buy something else to qulify for free shipping . Additionally , if you shop with Amazon CC you will be earning 3 points for every dollar spent . Out of $ 20 , this is like $ 0.60 discount.As for the Mach3 cartridges , I use them for years now . Compared to many other brands this is the winner . Expensive
 I bought the new 5 blader from Gillette , but went back to this one . More is not nessesarily better
 I used Sensor or Fusion for years and never tried the Mach3 . They were good but expensive and I could only get 3 shaves per cartridge . I thought I would try this deal since I had nothing to lose but $ 30 . I actually prefer the feel of the Mach3 over the Fusion . I always felt the Fusion would slip off my face and cut my eye open . Something about the grip and motion makes it feel unsafe . Has anyone else experienced this?Anyway , I have thick , fast growing facial hair and I get a weeks worth of shaves off the Mach3 for half the Fusion price . By day 5 it is rawer than the first day , but that is to be expected.I am pleased with the Mach3 and will buy again when this massive supply runs out .
 I have been using Mach3 for over 5 years now . I got hooked on it since the first time I tried it ; I have a thick beard and it is very hard to get a smooth shave . I usually shave every three days when my facial hair has grown enough to get the `` ounf '' effect . The blades slide over my beard and erases it
 Yes , they are pricey and Lord knows why - but I 've never gotten a closer or bloodless shave in my life . I received this product as a sample and I 'm the last one to be a slave to advertising . Worthwhile if your skin is sensitive . This product plus Noxema Shave cream are a perfect combo . Never bleed again !
 I bought these heel lifts because I have scoliosis and therefore one leg is shorter than the other . I wear one of these lifts in my left shoe and find I can walk a little more gracefully . The heel lift has fit in every one of my shoes without needing to be cut or changed in any way -- so it fits in athletic shoes and dress shoes -LRB- flats -RRB- . It does not slide around or change position at all . Of course it would not work in sandals unless you somehow glue it in . The heel lift can be easily transfered from one shoe to another so you do n't have to buy a pair of these for every shoe you own . I am very pleased with this product . It is much cheaper than a custom orthodic .
 I had to use one of these in one of my shoes because I was wearing a walking boot on the other foot due to an injury . It was hard to find a shoe that was even with the boot so I would n't be lop-sided , so they gave me this heel lift to make me even . Well what I noticed right away is that the pain I normally have after walking or standing on my feet too long was not present !! I was so shocked and relieved that I bought another one for the other shoe . : -RRB-
 This fits well inside of the shoe and does n't move around . It has different heights for different needs . Unfortunately , I have to have a build up and the outside of my shoe and ca n't use those anymore . Also , I got a better price here than at the Drs. office .

 If you think vitamins are a waste of time and or money , think again . When I am taking these vitamins regularly , I definitely have more energy and get sick less . Sure enough when I had run out of my VM-75s , I did get the makings of a sinus infection and fought it the way I usually do - with a neti pot and apple cider vinegar routine . Although I was able to keep things at bay , I was n't really healing . Low and behold , I ordered my vitamins from Amazon , starting taking them and back to normal I was . This is a great vitamin at a very reasonable price . It helps having the reliability and timely delivery of my order from an Amazon merchant standing behind my purchase too . Would definitely go this route again !
 I have used this brand of vitamins , and this specific vitamin for the past 30 years . It came highly recommended to me and I highly recommend . My wife finally started taking this vitamin and believes she has much more energy with the vitamin . I strongly recommend this daily vitamin .
 Great Product purchased from A Great Seller.Will use agaimJudy in PA
 This is a great product and has excellent quality control . I recommend this to anyone looking fo a great multi-vitamin . Check out the vitamins and minerals listed on the product . It is all first rate . One quick way to tell if a vitamin company is passing inferior stuff is to see what kind of Vitamin E they include in the product . If is says &#34; dl - &#34; in the leading edge of the type , it spins left-handed and wo n't react in your body ... so it is just for looks ... . These people use the best in all their products as far is I have tired them .
 I 've been taking Solgar VM75 tablets for over 30 years . I was anemic after college and since taking these rarely get sick . Very satisfied !
 Honestly , , I have been taking all sort of vitamins for a long time for overall health & wellness . This is one of the best multi vitamins i have been taking . . I havent gotten sick , so it must also be helping my immunity system . .
 Solgar generally has fine products , I have used them in the past.I feel that it helps for general health.Again , a fine product .
 This vitamins are jam packed with nutrients . That said , if you have difficulty swallowing huge , yucky tasting vitamins , these are n't the ones for you . Great price -LRB- the best we 've found -RRB- and quick delivery .
 I take this multi-vitamin because I do n't have to think about supplying more of any of the suplements in it . If anyone add calcium and vitamin C -LRB- Ester_C I recommend -RRB- they would be greatly protected . Obviously there are other things everyone individually need if they have other conditions or are over 40 or 45 years old when ourbodies need more daily suplements . When I stop taking this , I feel heavy and do n't want to get up , once I take it , the very next mornig I feel like a feather . Try it ! Once a day too ... in tablets .
 used the vitamins for many years . good mixture of needed vitamins and minerals and good quality . It is great to get these vitamins to a reasonable price .
 For Years i been taking it yes your urine may turn yellow i have orange label and sometimes if you eat it with food your stomach might hurt but its life its a good vitamins A C E D The best ! I Rec People To Try This Vitamin
 Been taking this for 20 + years . I periodically check out other ` new ' multi-vitamins and no other multi comes close in MG strength of each component and overall quality . Huge difference in energy levels without it .
 5.0 out of 5 stars do n't think I can live without ! , October 5 , 2010By Samantha Addonizio - See all my reviewsThis review is from
 I had gotten some of these as a sample at a local fair.The end results were great as they improved my energy and overall.Unfortunately I can not say I am a fan of the taste -LRB- chalky -RRB- , and slug down the large sized pills as quickly as I could.After getting them down they are a great product , and I am getting many more .
 This brand was recommended to me by my Holistic doc . I especially like this multi because it has at least 75 mg . of the B vitamins -LRB- which I need -RRB- plus other minerals , bio flavinoids , & green food stuff . The capsules are easy to digest and I do n't get nauseated or experience vitamin back lash when I take it . In order words , it goes down easy.I 've been using supplements for the past 34 years and Solgar is by far the best .
 i love this product . i use it on my daughters bottom since she has extreme sensitive skin . i have used Triple Paste , A&D , Balmex , Desitin , ... u name it , and nothing worked until i got this . its a miracle cream . i use some on every diaper change and since i started using it she has n't had a rash yet . not only does it work great its easy to clean off and u do n't have no residue left over . its amazing .
 Bought for my husband for Christmas ... he wishes we bought him one of these sooner ! User friendly , holds a charge , smoooooth shave . Great product at a great price . Highly recommend !
 I 've had dry eye for a few years , not realizing what it was . Itchy watery eyes every day , I assumed it was allergies . Then in casual conversation I described my symptoms and someone said `` Oh , that 's dry eye '' which did n't make sense to me since my eyes were watering , tears dripping down my face , for most of the day every day . But they insisted that it was dry eye ... I began with the thera tears lubricating drops which felt AMAZING so I decided to try these supplements . Less than a week in and the difference is remarkable . No more `` crying '' all day , no more blurred vision , itching , sandy feeling . It 's wonderful . I hope it will last . As for `` fish burps '' I take it before bed . It 's digested by morning .
 I 'm a receptionist so I work in front of the computer most of the day . I also study online so I 'm exposing my eyes to a screen 90 % of my time . I started to notice red lines in my eyes and how I constantly felt like I had to rub them . I looked for ways to alleviate the situation with eye drops but my condition persisted . I also drink most nights , some table wine or just while socializing , so I thought maybe it was the drinking . I did not drink for six weeks straight and the red lines remained !!! I became self conscious and started to look for a remedy . I found these capsules and I thought , why not ? So I got these babies , popped them , and WOW ! Within two days my eyes were visibly whiter ! The red lines were diminishing and then ... . I LOST THE PILLS ! -LRB- hahahaha ! -RRB- I have no idea where they went ? But after looking for them for more than three days , I decided the results were worth a second purchase . I 've gone without them for about a week and the dryness is coming back =-LRB- Far as I can tell these pills DO WORK ! So if you suffer from dry , itchy , red eyes , these pills are your fix !
 This product has helped me to deal with chronic dry eye . As long as I take it every day , my eyes are more lubricated and less dry . I would recommend this product to anyone for healthier eyes .
 I have used this product for years . I 'm a 70-year-old woman so dry eyes can be a problem . With this product , I seldom even need to used eye drops . Through the years from time to time I 've tired of taking the three pills a day -LRB- along with all my other meds -RRB- and wanted to save money so I 'd stop taking it . Every time I regretted it -- my eyes began bothering me again . I highly recommend the product .
 I too had multiple surgeries for crossed eyes - three times in my life . As a result I developed extreme dry eyes around 55 years old.There is nothing more uncomfortable ... painful than severe dry eyes and no prescription eye drops worked ... on my Doctor 's recommendation , I searched and searched for Omega Capsules that would relieve my pain ... and found nothing ... until I discivered Thera Tears.These pills have saved my life and I will never be without them . -LRB- BTW , I do take 3 in the morning , every day . -RRB-
 I 'm glad to see they 're available on Amazon . I did n't give it a 5 as I still having tearing issues . My optometrist recommended . It has helped better than anything else . I 'm really amazed that in all the years I 've suffered from this problem , there really is n't much out there . But a little something is better than nothing .
 Thera Tears Nutrtn Soft Gel Cap , Nutrition 90 CapsulesThis product was recommended by my eye doctor for an extremely dry eye condition . It has worked very well for me and I have been taking three a day for 3 years now . I sure do see a difference when I do n't take them .
 I have trouble digesting oils and this formulation of Thera Tears was recommended by a doctor . I do n't have dry eyes , but need essential oils and this does the trick for me . At most , I burp once and that 's it - so much better than other oil caps out there .
 My opthamologist recommended this product for dry eyes but he said that Omega-3 oils are good for your heart . This product contains flaxseed oil which is very good for your health .
 As I often do , I read the users reviews prior to purchasing a product and was convinced this was a wonderful product . I 've suffered for years from chronic dry eyes due to Sjogren 's Syndrome and even though I take prescription Restassis , nothing much seemed to help me . I stopped wearing eye make-up and even some concealers I applied near my eyes bothered them and yet they STILL were very dry!Then along came news of THERA TEARS and I decided to give them a try . At first I was skeptical . Even my Opthamologist was but I decided not to give up and give them a try anyway . I WAS VERY GLAD I DID !!! I even wrote my doctor and told him to suggest them to his chronic dry eye patients.Recommended dosage is 3 capsules a day but I take 2 and they really help to make my eyes less bothersome . I noticed a difference after only 2 weeks and even notice my eyes being drier when I have n't taken them . They have n't cured my dry eyes but they sure have made my daily life more bearable , especially while driving when my eyes seem to be the driest.I highly recommend them ! .
 This product is a life saver . I think it really works . I was n't sure about it until I ran out of it and could n't find it in my local stores . My eyes became really dry and uncomfortable , even with my daily Restasis . I 'm looking forward to the day when I wo n't need anything for my eyes , but until then I 'll make sure I have enough TheraTears on hand.Amazon rocks btw - fast delivery , excellent wrapping , good prices . Thanks !
 It totally worked for me & to all the people being negative worrying about the so insignificant fish smell , It is so small in my eyes that it does not bother me with the help of a cough drop or mint or tea tree oil in water can not cure , but what really bothers me is if I do n't take it & go back to getting surgeries with a scalpel in my eye while being awake -LRB- Not Fun At All . So a little fish smell is nothing up to the alternative being -LRB- surgeries -RRB- because dry eyes does big damage to the cornea especially to me being a Systemic Lupus Patient that keep 's getting Pterygium Growths on my cornea -LRB- From extreme dry eyes -RRB- over & over having to get them removed by a scalpel several times . I love this stuff people try it you will not be sorry , but take it for at least two weeks to a month before you judge it prematurely & miss out on something that at least to me is life changing . Go & try it you will be happy you did ! P.S & I am also taking this brand of eye drops also & they work very well .
 They work , but they got a fish like smell to them . Nothing major though ... A piece of gum will do the trick ...
 Love this product !!! Eye drops never helped , these supplements have saved me as I can still were contacts and not have to worry about very dry eyes and eye pain . Now my eyes are never dry or painful . They even help with pms cramps .
 These supplements work well for me for dry eye and are priced well . I have trouble finding them at the store at all .
 I had dry eye problems that caused filamentary keratitis -LRB- little tunnels from the surface of my eye inwards -RRB- , after having them removed -LRB- painfully -RRB- several times I went to a different doctor that suggested I try Theratears Omega-3 . They are a bit pricey -LRB- check your local Walgreens and keep the coupon for a $ 1 off that comes inside the box -RRB- but they are the only thing that have worked for me.I tried switching a few times to other brands that costs less and I immediately noticed a difference . The Omega-3 's also seem to help with mood and joint pain . If you have stomach problems taking them at first just start with one pill at night and after a week go to two , and after another week 3 . You can also split up the doses though I do n't recommend 3 a day at first unless you are already on Omega-3s . I felt such a difference after a few weeks of taking these that I found a reputable supplier of childrens chewable Omega-3s for my son !
 At times , my vision would get a little blurry . If I blinked a few times , or rubbed my eyes , it helped , but the blur would come back . If I was driving , it was particularly troubling . This seems to have -LRB- ?? -RRB- aided the lubricant in my eyes . Not too sure about what caused the problem , or the way this product worked -- but it did .
 I had Lasik surgery a year ago and unfortunately my eyes did n't respond well . My vision without glasses was definitely improved , although not perfect , but what good came of the better vision has been countered by a terrible dryness that so far I 've not been able to overcome . I wake up every single morning with my eyes so dry that it hurts to open them . After putting drops in I would have instant relief from the pain but for the next several hours my eyes would be blurry due to the dryness along with my eyes not liking my drops very well . I have only been using Thera Tears for 12 days now and although it may seem crazy to some , I 'm already feeling a difference . This is so incredibly exciting to me !! From what I 've read in other reviews it usually takes about a month or so to really feel a difference and you have to continue taking them forever but as long as my eyes keep responding so well I will be happy to take them for the rest of my life . Not to mention they are really good for the rest of my body too !
 Nice product ! I definitely can feel the difference when I wake up , and throughout the day . My eyes feel as if they are much more lubricated , and I can go throughout the day without experiencing dry eye . I do n't wear contact lenses , but I do think that these supplements might assist wearers .
 Is a product well developed and the benefits of omega 3 are now demonstrated in several studies .
 After removal of a carcinoma on my lower eyelid and all the following surgery , my eye did not close completely . This resulted in the drying out of my cornea . My doctor recommended a combination treatment of the Thera Tears Gel capsules and the Thera Tear Eyedrops . Now , I seldom have any dry eye discomfort .
 very fast deliveryexactly what I ordered . . great priceTheraTears Nutrition Omega-3 Supplement with Vitamin E , Capsules 90 ea
 I 've been diagnosed with dry eye caused by LASIK and menopause . I used Restasis for a couple of years , but it was expensive and stung , and had stopped working . I was pretty desperate . A different optometrist suggested these . He said other patients reported that they cured their dry eye . It took a few weeks , but I no longer have dry eyes . I 've missed a day here and there with no ill effects , but if I miss several days in a row my eyes do feel dry again . Very slight fishy taste afterwards , but not nearly as bad as other Omega 3 's I 've taken . This has been pretty much of a miracle cure for me . I have them on auto-reorder here at Amazon so I never run out . They are a little hard to find in retail stores .
 My ophthalmologist prescribed these capsules for dry eye . . I have them sent automatically . Great product , great price . Easy way to help the eyes and get Omega -3 .
 I developed a staph infection in my eyes ! After 2 visits to my opthamologist , he recommended that I use Thera Tears capsules . I could n't find them locally , but on Amazon where I ordered them . My Doc told me that these capsules would help unclog the oil glands in my eyes . I believe they are working . I 've only had one flare up since I started taking them .
 I have chronically dry eyes and after having to put in eyedrops multiple times a day with only temporary relief , my eye doc suggested I try some omega 3 supplements . To my surprise they have actually helped with the dryness throughout the day especially when I have to have my contacts for days when I 'm moving around a lot.I have n't had problems with the fishy smell , but I did note that it did n't work too well initially when I failed to read the directions and was n't taking the recommended number of pills . After consistently taking the recommended 3 in morning I got more relief throughout the day . Overall a good supplement to try if your eyes are constantly dry and you 're tired of having to use eyedrops constantly .
 You wo n't find immediate relief , but keep taking these pills and you will get real relief for you dry eyes . Give them at least one month to work , if not more .
 I have dry eyes to the point that sometimes I need to wear two pairs of dark lenses , and my prescription fluctuates from minute to minute . That stopped after starting with Theratears -LRB- optometrist suggested -RRB- . I still need to wear dark glass -LRB- one pair -RRB- outside often , but the vision has settled down and it 's never so bad that I have to stay indoors in the dark . Phew .
 I ordered this for my mother , who has an autoimmune disorder that affects the eyes . This formula really seems to help her keep the redness from inflammation down . It has also helped her with itchy skin rashes as well .
 I had severe dry eye and found this to be the best product to help restore my eyes to health . I did have to have punctal plugs inserted , but I feel that I would not have been able to go back to wearing contacts without these supplements . I tried other fish oil products , but they did not work nearly as well , leaving my eyes more irritable and itchy . Good for blepharitis as well !
 I started taking these due to dry eyes after Lasik . The label says that it takes 4 weeks to appreciate a difference . I noticed a difference in just a couple days . This works well , especially with TheraLife Eye .
 fast shipping-great product-aaa + takes the sand right out of my eyes and is useful for the bathroom duties too horay
 I had Lasik surgery a few years ago . Ever since then I have severe dry eyes . My eyes would be heavy , dry and that made me feel miserable . I have tried almost all lubricant eye drops and they do not work for me . Finally I found Thera Tears Omega-3 and I decided to give them a try . It has only been a week and I feel a huge difference . My eyes are less dry and tired . I hope this continues and I am really hopeful that this will end my search for the ultimate cure for dry eyes .
 I go to an opthamoligist -LRB- sp ? -RRB- for an eye disease and then developed a film over my eyes that just seemed to occur . He explained that my tear ducts were clogging and not producing enough oils and thus the film . . He told me to buy this product and take it as directed and with this and washing my eyes with baby shampoo the problem has gone away .
 If you need to get Fish Oil into your diet , this is one of your best choices as you wo n't have fish breath after taking it .
 After using these supplements for a month , I do not have dry eyes . Before using Thera supplements I had to use wetting solution atleast 2 times a day .
 Eighteen months ago , I was at a point where I could no longer look at a computer screen without my eyes literally ACHING . My vision was increasingly blurred , and reading was beyond my tolerance , other than for a few moments at a time . This was serious , serious stuff , since I 'm an advanced graduate student and have several hundred pages of text to read each week ! I finally could n't tolerate the pain and went in to see my optometrist -- who discovered I had significant corneal scarring from severe dry eye syndrome . Left untreated , I was destined to lose my eyesight . I was immediately scheduled for two corneal surgeries , and I was prescribed Restasis , oil-based lubricants , and a thicker ointment for nighttime lubrication . Plus , my doctor recommended Theratears.For months , I literally applied drops every half hour throughout the day , and I faithfully used my Restasis and took these Theratears . My reading materials were enlarged to get me through my semester as I awaited surgery . It was a scary time , and I was discouraged , wondering if this would ever improve.A specialist removed the corneal scarring , and he echoed the sentiments of my optometrist about the use of all of these lubricants AND the Theratears . `` It really does make a difference , '' he assured me . Worse case scenario , he added that we could consider tear duct plugs , if these measures did n't help.Eighteen months later , I 've cut back to once-a-day use of the Restasis , and my multiple-times daily drops are a thing of the past . I still use the night ointment , but otherwise , I rely on Theratears.If you have severe dry eye syndrome , try this . My specialist even swears by them !
 i saw these at walmart sometime ago , but i was skeptical about trying them so i passed them up.i went through just about every eye drop on the shelf and none seemed to help me too much . i was suffering fromsevere dry eye . Some days it was so bad i could hardly keep my eyes open and would blink so much that my eyelids and eyeballswould hurt at the end of the day . i went to see an eye doctor and had no luck getting much help with my condition.He wanted to run more tests which i could not afford and send me on my way with a baggy full of more eye drops.I finally read up on thera tears omega 3 capsules and was surprised to see so many people talk highly about them . So i said tomyself , i 've tried everything else , might as well give these a shot.I am about 2 and a half almost 3 weeks into taking these supplements , and i already can feel positive results.I hope im not jinxing myself lol , but i was using artifical tears about once an hour . I havent used them in almost 3 days now!i will keep taking these and write a follow up review in a month and see if they still help me with my dry eyes.I am very greatful for these pills and will most likely continue to take them for years to come.One side note , i read that some people complained about the fishy burps and aftertaste.I stowed mine in the freezer , problem solved ! No fish burps or aftertaste !
 I have a problem with dry eyes bad enough to change my ability to read an eye chart significantly . Taking these supplements seems to keep them more moistened and the ingredients are oils I 've been encouraged to take anyway .
 I 'm not gon na write some long review , because I just finished reading the others and they basically say what I was gon na say . Thera tears works for dry eyes flat out . I 've been using them for about 3 years . Oh by the way , you know how it says on the boat that it take like 4-6 weeks -LRB- or something like that -RRB- till you start experiencing the dry eye relief . That is actually true -LRB- for me at least . -RRB- So do n't start taking them for like 2 weeks and then after seeing no immediate effect and just stop , keep taking them . I take 3 a day in the morning as suggested . It does give you fish breath a bit as people have mentioned . but easy way to solve this issue is take your 3 pills in the morning before you brush or swish listerine , completley gets rid of the smell . oh and by the way , the reason i started using it is because my eye doctor noticed i had dry eyes and had scarring on my eyes balls . So he suggested Thera Tears . Plus theirs the whole Fish oil and flaxseed oil benefit which from all i hear is good , but never actually measured by cholestoral or anything like that to confirm that . Anyways , good product . Ca n't remember the price amazon is charging , but i usually pick it up at walmart for like $ 12.00 a bottle which includes 90 pills -LRB- 1 month worth -RRB- . Oh and yeah when i wake in the morning it really does get rid of the irritation and throughout the day . Seriously got ta say this is an effective product for dry eye . Oh looks like the review was long afterall . : -RRB-
 My eye doctor recommended this supplement of vitamins for dry eyes . Excellent product , it does help alot , no more dry eyes . I looked for this product elsewhere in stores.Only Amazon had the product I was looking for . Price is affordable also . Also those omega 3 's are good at lower cholesterol levels.So I hear . I have n't checked into that yet .
 Although I was skeptical about this product working , I 've been suffering from burning and watering -LRB- literally tears pouring out ! -RRB- eyes , particularly my right eye , for almost a year and was pretty desperate . My eye doctor said that I could try to use eye drops , but after using those for a few months , the problem was n't any better . I actually stumbled across these capsules because my regular doctor had suggested I take a fish oil supplement for general health . When I saw that these were purported to help the eyes , I figured I 'd give it a shot.Having read several reviews that said to give them time to work before dismissing them , I did just that . After about 6 weeks of taking the capsules regularly , I traveled out of state for a week . While there , it occurred to me that my eyes had n't been bothering me , so I thought that perhaps it had been allergies after all . However , after returning home , the problem never returned , so I am certain that it was indeed these supplements that cured it . I 'm actually pretty amazed but ever so thankful!I disagree with those who 've said that the capsules leave a ` fishy ' odor or taste . However , I 'm not particularly ` gassy ' , so if you are a big burper , your experience might be different . I take the three capsules every morning when I wake up , and although fish oil capsules are on the large side and these are no different , it is absolutely worth it in terms of the difference I feel . Two thumbs waaaay up !
 I have researched many Omega 3 suppliments and have found this one to be the best blend on the market . The blend of both flaxseed and fish oil is the secret . This is a well developed product that does exactly what it says it will . I have all of my friends and family on it and we all swear by it . It works for dry eye and so many other health issues . I highly recommend it .
 Three years ago I had Lasik . I also had one of the `` possible side effects '' that you are warned about but never think will happen -- extremely dry eyes -LRB- this occurs because the Lasik procedure slices the nerve in the cornea that controls tearing . If it does n't grow back completely , the result is extremely dry eyes . They do n't tell you that part -RRB- . I was in agony for months . I could n't open my eyes in the morning without severe pain and went through gallons of eye drops . The clinic suggested I try TheraTears . This product has been a godsend . I take six a day and it has cured 90 % of the problem . If I stop taking them , the pain comes back after about four days . AND -- all that fish and flaxseed oil has been great for my cholesterol !
 I have been taking this product for about three weeks . The company recommends three caps daily ; however , I have reduced this to two . Further , I do not swallow the caps but bite into them and suck out all the oil . I find that this method gets the product into my system much faster . The taste of the oil is pleasant . I feel that the product is working . My dry eyes seem to be getting much better since taking Omega-3 . I would greatly recommend it .
 I have suffered from dry eyes for the past two years and i have tried numerous products . I have tried supplements , eye drops , compresses , etc. . The thera tears have been highly recommended by my eye doctor . My meibomian glands are not releasing the oily film effectively so it leaves my aqueous tears unprotected and so my eye dries up faster.Ever since I started taking thera tears I was able to feel and see a difference within 5-7 days . I do n't wake up with my eyes dry shut anymore and my eyes are n't blurry anymore.Pros :1 . Can tell a difference and my eyes are n't as dry as they were before2.It contains fish oil which is also great for your heart and vasculature3 . Price is great and cheaper than store prices4.They do n't SMELL like fish pills5.It 's dosed once a day versus other products that are 2-3 times a dayCons
 I 've been taking this product for 3 months now and can finally conclude that this product does help in relieving dry eye . After about 2 months I was starting to give up hope because my eyes were very dry and I would be using eye drops on a daily basis . I have had no lasik surgery done , I just happen to have been diagnosed with dry eye . The bottle says that for the best results you should take the tablets beyond 4 to 8 weeks and even though I was reluctant to do so , my eyes started to feel better after the 8 week mark . Now all I do to relieve my eye problem is take 3 tablets a day along with using hot compresses to the eyes twice daily and I feel fine.Furthermore , your mouth does smell a bit like fish after you 've taking the tablets but it 's not intolerable at all . I would just pop in a mint right after and I 'm good to go ! Hope this helps .
 I 've always had dry eyes problem in the past . It 's especially unbearable by the end of the day at work and right after I wake up in the morning . So I keep eye drops at the office and humidifier by the bed . But the problem 's been getting worse recently . So I searched online and found this.After taking it for maybe five days I began to feel an improvement . Now I just finished my first bottle , and I ca n't recall any serious eye irritations in the past two weeks . So I 'll continue to buy this every month , until I find a cheaper solution .
 This product is very good if you have dry eyes and have to use eye drops few times a day .
 Thera Tears is a little pricey , but it does help prevent the scratchiness and discomfort of dry eye syndrome , as it promises . I 've tried other Omega-3 products but developed an allergy to codfish oil that this product does n't have .
 My eye doctor recommended I use this nutrition due to my cronic dry eyes . It really helps , I do n't have to use eye drops nearly as often as I used to .
 and popular product now but I am not sure if I am going to use omega -3 for a long time
 The combination of this supplement and punctal plugs in my lower tear ducts has resulted in virtually no dry-eye ! :D Each container contains a one-month supply -LRB- at least from what my doctor recommended -RRB- , so it 's not super-cheap for a supplement , but it has been working for me and I do n't mind the cost too much .
 After trying at least 7 different types of less expensive and more highly advertised intimate lubes , we came back to Eros Pur . So happy and ` satisfied ' we did ! At 62 , this product is well worth the price and thankfully lasts a long long time .
 I really like this as a skin moisturizer . It only requires a couple of drops to moisturize my legs which tend to be very dry at my age . Although a little pricey it should last a long time since you need such a small quantity .
 I love this stuff . I have a lot of issues with water-based lubes . At worst , it immediately burns my skin due to chemical preservatives in it . At best , it dries up too quickly . Wet Naturals makes some good water-based lube , but even that dries too quickly.This stuff feels great , and it lasts . It eventually becomes less slippery and does need reapplication sometimes , but leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth rather than sticky . And it easily lasts two to three times as long as any water-based lube I 've tried .
 When my friend was getting married , I spent hours researching the world 's best condoms and lube etc. -LRB- Best condom
 I have been using this lube for years and I can not use anything else . It feels so natural and pleasent , it lasts forever during intercourse . Best part is a small drop goes along way , this lube is seriously revolutionary ! Do not look at the price or any bad reviews , this stuff is just simply amazing !
 I wo n't get too explicit , but we love this stuff , wish we would have discovered it 10 years earlier!I would highly recommend !
 Goes on smooth lasts and absorbs what more can you ask for ? Gives a superior slide and pleasant glide . Thanks
 Better at helping you ease into what you want to do without being sticky and makes your experience that much more !
 I like this stuff . It gets messy , but I knew that . It slides well . My only complaints are that bottle breaks easily , the cap specifically . You will drop it at some point . If you 're telling yourself you wo n't ; ThenA . You 're doing it wrong . -LRB- Heat of the moment spills -RRB- B. You 're a liar.It 's slippery when wet !!! Wish my girlfriend liked it too . Maximus ai n't too bad though .
 This lube is fantastic !! We have tried a number of lubes over the years but this one is exceptional . It 's is super slick . You do n't need very much . It does n't get sticky or tacky and it does n't dry out . It 's great for anal sex and is a must when masterbating ! The price on here is also great . Previously I was paying upward of 60 dollars ! Then I found it online for 45 . Now I 've found it on Amazon and it 's under 30 ! You ca n't beat this stuff ! Try it , you 'll LOVE it .
 I have been on a quest to find the best lube I 've tried Wet , Wet light , Wet platnium , Gun oil , swiss navy , Liquid silk , Astroglide , ID Millenium , to name a few . None of them hold a candle to Pjur bodyglide . It works better , last longer and gives superior lubrication for a consideraly longer period without reapplication . very little goes a very long way . Cleans up with soap and water . I highly recommend this product .
 Pjur is always the go-to lube for me and my partner . It 's never sticky , lasts a long time but is easily absorbed . It has no aroma and actually moisturizes , so it does n't even need to be washed off . The only downside is that the bottle does n't have a flip top -- tough to put the cap back on when one hand is holding liquid lube . Pjur beats anything available in a brick-and-mortar store . Well worth the price and easy to order from Amazon , of course . Ca n't recommend this stuff highly enough .
 This lube is really top quality . I saw a recommendation for it in a men 's magazine , so we decided to give it a try . It lasts a very long time . There is a slight flavor to it even though it touts itself as being no flavor and no smell . It never gets sticky or goopy . Holds up to the job .
 This stuff is amazing . It takes forever to dry up , and it does n't feel oily or sticky or anything like that . The price is very resonable for the quality . I highly recommend this .
 The best part about silicon based lubrication is that they do n't get sticky and wo n't wash off even underwater . Try it in the hot tub and you 'll see why I gave it 5 stars .
 The price may seem expensive , but this is a high quality product and is worth the money . The bottle is about 7 and 1/4 inches tall . It has a screw-on cap . The bottle is soft and one just has to lightly squeeze the bottle to pour the lubricant . One only needs to use a small amount , but I found that I did need to use more after a short while . The lubricant has high-quality feel . It feels closer to natural vaginal lubrication . It is very smooth and silky . It does not have a smell or taste . I highly recommend this product . You and your partner wo n't regret how much it will help you in the bedroom . It makes everything better .
 I 've been hesitant to write a review for this product as my reviews are published under my real name . While reviewing my purchases , however , I realized this is one of my regular ones and it 's a product I really , really love ! I 'm an adult woman , so why should I feel shy to admit I have sex and use products to make it better?Hallelujah for turning 40 and beginning to realize there is no reason to be embarrassed.I 've tried a lot of lube . This is , by far , the best . It does n't get sticky or dry up too quickly and it actually makes your skin uber soft after use -LRB- I 'll leave what skin up to your imagination -RRB- . The only caveat is that because it is silicone based you can not use it with any items made of silicone . Settle for KY on silicone toys , but go for Pjur Eros for everything else .
 I 've tried every lubricant on the market , and depending on your length of session or what your sexual proclivities are , if you are concerned about the lubricant getting tacky and ineffective , requiring more and more application , then this is the product for you.Its longevity is such that your female partner will feel it until a thorough wipe-down / shower is performed.As mentioned below , it will stain your sheets , but as also mentioned below , if you wash your sheets on a regular basis and use some Oxy , it comes right out -LRB- no pun intended -RRB- . *****
 I have used this product for years . I personally enjoy having a few quality lubricants available to me at any given time . Eros Original is always the ONE that I never rotate in my search for the best lubes . Enjoy
 The last bottle of lubricant you will ever need . Only a few drops and let the fun begin . It seems like it never dries out . I will never bother with sticky clean ups after the fun is over . Makes you want to go back for seconds ! And thirds !
 This stuff is nothing short of amazing . It is slick when you put it on and it stays slick for a long time .
 it 's the best lube i 've used so far , just a bit expensive and that 's the only thing wrong with it
 Stays very slick . Never gets sticky , easy to clean with soap and water . Retains and transfers body heat very well . Recommended !
 I love this lube oil . I have been using it for about 5 years and I will never use anything else . My wife also loves it !
 It 's great stuff for the intended purpose . Never dries out , very little needed . Because you use so little , it 's actually very inexpensive if you buy it in large containers like this one .
 Pjur Original Bodyglide is probably the smoothest and most comfortable personal lubricant ever in my experience and I am on my second bottle . Pjurfect
 if you need lube , this is the best to use - hands down . lasts forever , does n't get sticky . could n't be happier .
 Simply the best stuff I have ever used ... puts the regular products found at drugstores , etc. , to shame . You wo n't be disappointed with any Pjur product , but this is the original , and for most folks , exactly what they need/want .
 This is the best lube ever , although it 's a bit expensive compared to Gun Oil and other products , the quality is superior . The only thing I do n't like is the screw off cap , why could n't they have done a pop top or a pump to make it easier to avoid messes . ; -RRB-
 This lube is absolutely amazing ! It is silicone based , silky smooth does n't get sticky and lasts forever . I have tried lube after lube , trying to find the one that would be it for the rest of time ... and this is the one .
 Just try to get this to break down . You ca n't . It stays slick forever with the tiniest amount . Highly recommended , much better than the junk from the drug store .
 We tried a great many other brands and formulas , and no other brand compares to Pujr Eros . The Origunal Body Glide , a little thicker , and Woman 's Bodyglide , a little thinner , are without a doubt the class of this slippery business . These two feel wonderful from both sides , and while you might say they are oily , they neither has a tacky feel . The Original formula , which as I mentioned is the heavier of the two , but feels light and very smooth . Very long lasting . Very satisfying for not being the real thing!I really can not say enough good things about these lubes . They work great in all environments , and even wet , as long as used before the water.Yes , this stuff is generally considered expensive , but I can only say I wish that we had not wasted our time on all the many other offerings out there . We found none to come close to the lastng comfort and excellent feel of this the black bottle and white bottle Bodyglide formulas .
 This lube is wonderful . It does exactly what it needs to do . The best quality lube I have ever used . Your skin even feels smooth after using it , instead of slimy and gross like other brands.This lube makes everything feel better.Great !
 It costs more but it 's worth it . Ultra slippery but none of that nasty feeling `` during '' or `` after '' . Areas its used on seem to be in better condition as well . For those that are curious , the taste is rather neutral too so you do n't have to worry about being grossed out by getting it in your mouth . Get the big bottles , they 're worth it . Have fun .
 Best one out there ! love this stuff ! non greasy or sticky , just super slippery ! Once you try it you wo n't use any other product !
 Works great , and is easy to clean up . The smaller bottles unfortunately come with a screw-on top instead of a pump , making them a bit annoying to use .
 My boyfriend and I have been using this product for several years . We do n't even consider any others . It lasts longer and feels better than ID or Wet brands when using for `` back door '' use .
 Ha , I should have made a video review for this ! -LRB- Barf -RRB- Without being too graphic , this stuff works really well . It lasts a long time , feels great , and does n't get messy . Easy clean up too and I swear my skin is healthier then ever now!Also , this bottle is downright novelty sized . This would make a practicle yet borderline gag gift for a bridal shower .
 This is the best lube out their . Do not hesitate to buy this . Last a long time and you only need a little . Worth the price !!
 You just ca n't beat Pjur &#34; Original &#34; Bodyglide . I have tried other formulas from Pjur , and many other brands , but I always go back to this one . I 'm done . I will stick with this . It is the best . Both my partner and & I agree .
 i 've tried all kinds of lubes and wo n't be trying anything new . this is honestly the best . never sticky . a little hard to wash off but worth it for the slickness it provides .
 I AM A RETURNING CUSTOMER . THE LUBRICANT IS EXCELLENT FOR MASSAGES AND YOU ONLY NEED A SMALL AMOUNT . GREAT VALUE FOR YOUR MONEY !
 Works really well from female standpoint . Have tried a number of other products , and this one is the best . Worth the price .
 In my opinion , this is the best silicone lubricant available . A little goes a long way and lasts and lasts .
 I was tipped off about this product on a site ranking `` best lubes for anal sex . '' I can attest , it works great for all types of sex , and for `` conventional '' -LRB- i.e. vaginal -RRB- sex , I have n't found a lubricant that even comes close . Use with toys , condoms , and especially on skin . Does n't feel sticky , oily , and outlasts all other lubes . Lube stains on material will wash out with pretty much any detergent I 've tried ; but as one other reviewer noted , OxyClean always succeeds when other detergents fail . In summary , truly a great product .
 I suggest that this product be the one and only supplement that should be in EVERY Man 's drawer bag what ever JUST BUY IT !!
 Tried many others . This is more expensive but worth it . A little goes a long way . Slippery without being sticky or oily . Lasts . Cleanup requires a little more soap in the shower .
 I 've tried a number of lubricants , in my lifetime , and nothing 's ever come close to this . My husband and I stumbled across it at one of those adult party demonstrations . It felt amazing to the touch , so we knew we had to try it . We bought the smallest container available , because it was a bit pricey and we were n't sure how it would perform.In short , we 'll never buy anything BUT this . It was worth every penny and it seemed to last forever . A few drops goes a very long way . It has an incredibly smooth and slick texture , that does n't dry up on you . We 've had nine years of experience with this product and we are both completely SATISFIED !
 I also found this to be a good product and also originally found it to stain any fabric it came in contact with . However , when I contacted Pjur Customer Service , they suggested I try OxiClean or a similar formulation . That did in fact get out the stains .
 We are a couple that like to play daily , we have used this product now for several months and will not ever go back to any water based products . The water based product are good for toys but person to person there is nothing like it . No mess and last and last Great for massages the back and all other parts . We found that is has elimated the Yeast outbreaks to zero . We did not know the water based product actually permote yeast . Try it once and you will never go back .
 My husband and I have been using this product for a couple years now and would n't consider going back to anything else . The reason I only give it four stars is because the bottle needs a better cap . The bottle inevitably gets lubricant on the outside .
 Of all the various massage and other use oils my wife and I have tried , this one is amazing . It never seems to dry out , get sticky , feel oily or lose any of its ability to feel slippery . And , unlike us , it does n't stain the sheets .
 This is the best lube on the market . It 's better than every other lube in many ways : No clean upDoes not leave any residue or get `` sticky `` Tasteless and Odorless , allowing you to concentrate on what 's importantVery concentrated - a small amount goes a long wayBest `` feeling '' out of all the lubesExcellent moisturizer , hair moisturizer -LRB- for wet looks -RRB- , and great for massages alsoFeels the most natural out of all the lubes , excellent for all areasOther things : - Very expensive - but WORTH IT - Will stain if left untreated - if you get it on your clothes , drown the area with water , or it will stain later and it 's very hard to get out after that point
 My wife and I stumbled across this gem when we were seeking to spice things up . We 're both pretty sure this resulted in our first child . We 've loved and enjoyed this product so thoroughly that it has become a staple in our bedroom . We have also purchased it as a gift for others . I hope you take the chance to discover the wonders of this lubricant . A little goes a long way , and a 250ml bottle should last at least a few months -LRB- depending on usage -RRB- . We 're turning to Pjur to help us with child # 2 . ; -RRB-
 This is the best lube on the market -- long lasting and does n't get sticky like the glycerin-based lubes . Well worth the price !
 My wife is highly allergic and it has been quite difficult to find something that is ok for us to use . This is the only product that is n't sticky and fits that profile . Worth the higher price ...
 This product is amazing ! My girlfriend an me love it and use it any chance we get . If you ever need a little extra luberication , this is definitely the product for you ! I promise you will not be disappointed .
 There 's not a lot to say , other than `` worth every penny '' . It 's great for everything . You can even use it around the house !
 a slippery silicone based lube . Applies easily , does its job well . Not too messy , use sparingly if you need to . No fragrance , which is a plus.I found the package itself to be way to small , I dont deal in ml mind you . But as far as a lube , its a good one , applies easily and never loses its momentum . the tube is about 2 inches , and not even an inch in diam . I like the size of say Astroglide for a package , and at 9-11 bucks , I think you could probably find something better for your money , but as a lube it gets a 8 .
 This is the best personal lubricant on the market.We go through lots of it : -RRB- Both my wife and I enjoy the way it feels .
 I have used this product for many years and find it is the best on the market . It is the most concentrated with the greatest lubricating quality.A great value .
 My girl and I liked it thus far . You do have to be careful not to use too much at one time because of the lasting effects of the product . A little goes along way.if your going to forbidden areas then I suggest using the product -LRB- Silk -RRB- , you can get it at Walgreens it offers a much smoother and slippery effect than this product but clean up is always a must afterwards . We would buy this again it 's nice , but I 'm always on the look out for something better like anyone else does .
 The product arrive when stated , just the way I would expect it to . Good show .
 this is not quite as slippery as astroglide but it does n't get dry and it stays alot more where you put it , and works just as good or better . the one thing w / this is it says you can use a few drops but i find most girls need more than that , theres only i girl i used this w / that was ok w / a few drops . i mean maybe for frontdoor sex you can use a few drops but i never use lube for that , but for backdoor , deff . use some more . and my girl says this is much less messy after we 're done than some of the other big name lubes .
 THE PRODUCT IS VERY GOOD FOR ITS PURPOSE BUT IT WILL STAIN AND IT WILL RUIN YOUR SHEETS . ALSO , IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN . YOUR SKIN WILL BREAK OUT .
 This is the best lube I have ever seen . It work great for a long time . You wo n't be sorry if you buy this lube
 This is by far the best lube ever invented . . it is super concentrated , much , much better than any water soluble lube and can be used for massage without leaving a sticky mess . Dont leave home without it ! Truly one of those rare products that really improve your life . . your significant other will thank you .
 ive tried many lubes and would have to say that this lube is the best . the other lubes i tried get sticky after a while and make it uncomfortable to use . this lube stays soft and smooth no matter how long it stays out . the only thing i dont like about it is when you get lube on the outside its pretty slippery to hold , but i guess thats a positive note .
 -LSB- -LSB- ASIN : B0031ESU4A Eros Love Silicone BBodyglide , Latex Condom Safe , 500 ml -RSB- -RSB- This is an excellent product . I originally tried it in a smaller quantity and was impressed with its multiple uses . It is non-staining , tasteless and can be used both for massage oil and as a personal lubricant . Highly recommend !!!
 This was my second Pjur purchase after receiving a free sample early last year . Excellent product , stays slick and does n't `` gum up '' very moisturizing and does n't take a lot . I highly recommend it for use with condoms or without .
 I love this stuff and have been buying it for years . Works like a charm , no sticky feeling , does n't dry out , has a really smooth feel to it .
 Pjur Eros silicone lubricant is the standard by which I judge all others . There is a good reason why it is more expensive than the rest
 This is the best lube we have ever found . And Amazon has the best price on it
 I originally purchased this lubricant for sex but prefer Astroglide or saliva . But I found it is an EXCELLENT massage oil as it does not absorb into the skin and therefore does not require reapplication . I can give an hour massage with one initial application of less than 1/4 ounce . It also mixes well with essential oils such as tea tree or lavender for an instant aromatherapy massage .
 Excellent product ! Very silky smooth . No taste issues , great for all kinds of play . Condom safe .
 It 's the best lubrication I 've ever come across . It does what it says in the name ; it glides across the body . One drop goes a long way .
 This lube has been my favorite for years . It 's pricey , but it lasts a LONG time ! I was able to find it cheaper on Amazon for the biggest size . I normally purchase it from a local store . With these two bottle I purchased , I should be set for easily two years !
 I 've tried lots of lubricants over the years but this stuff is the bomb . It is worth the $ .
 I love this lube have used it for years , and I am so happy they have this bigger 34oz container , that needs I need to purchase it less often .
 love love love this stuff - no odor , no taste , just super-smooth . Never sticky , never grainy . Well worth the cost . I 've used for over a year and a half .
 If you 've only tried water-based lubricants until now , Pjur Eros will make you a convert to silicone-based products . Goodbye stickiness . Goodbye five-second moisture . Pjur Eros lasts and lasts , with a wonderful , velvety feel . My boyfriend and I originally tried this as part of a sampler pack , along with ID Millenium and Wet Platinum . This is better than the other two BY FAR . We love it !
 this is by far the best thing i have used that you can buy in the store i bought something similar from a naughty party loved it but the price was awful then ran across this and it is the best thing ever never gets sticky never goes dry and this stuff is just magic in a bottle great toys also easy to clean off of anything i would reccomend this stuff to anyone and everyone i wont go back to anything else
 The price per ounce Amazon.com lists for this product appears to be incorrect . Amazon lists the the price of an 8.45 ounce bottle as $ 25.95 -LRB- $ 1.62 per ounce -RRB- . In fact $ 1.62 x 8.45 oz . would equal $ 13.69 . The price per ounce SHOULD be listed as $ 3.07 per ounce .
 DO NOT over apply , trust me . Only a small drop is necessary , like a dime size amount !
 I am not one to rave and gush over anything but my wife but I will say this stuff is amazing . Too bad you ca n't mix it with silicone toys because it is silky smooth . Even my wife commented one night on the amazing ease at which I slid into her . Rarely does she go for the oils but she asks for this bottle on a regular basis . If you want silk than get this product .
 this product is also great for massage too , good for use on older women whoseorfice , s are dried up , comes off the bed sheets in landry . overall a long lasting product for a night of slamming the ham !!
 Great product for women that creates the real deal feel . Not for men in the bathroom .
 Hate this lube it 's pricey and a nightmare if it gets on any wooden surface or tile or sheet I 'll . B going back to good ole ky jelly `` do n't waste your time or money on this oily watery crap
 Men -- do not let `` HER '' pick the lube , nor make natures monkey grease -- this elixir was made and used in Germany . GERMANY -- cmon , any sexual or seriously lude act you have seen contains germanic tones . Trust the Gerries and buy their silicone lube -- the will be fairy and winding clocks with every drop .
 I purchased this product for my Mom , so that she could continue to participate in her ladies group at church , when they have their penny bingo night :--RRB- -RRB- I bought a few extra , so she can share them with her friends .
 God knows I tried dozens of products with no success , until one day I was searching on YouTube and found a woman video telling this was the best product ever ... You Know what she was telling the true . My feet look great ! and the cream that came in the package is very good true , though I bought also Sole Food great cream too .
 I have diabetes and diabetes equals calluses !!! I tried everything to get rid of my ugly calluses and this is te only thing that has worked for me . I am so pleased with this product , now I 'm not embarrassed when it comes time for sandal season ! I have experienced the pure horror of my manicurist having to scrub the heck of my feet trying to get them to look half way decent , but now with Sof feet no more horror :-RRB- how it works well for you !
 I used this product while visiting my sister-in-law and thought it was awesome - beats other recent pedicure callus removers recently advertised . I have received mine , with some Sof ` feet Softening Gel and still think it is awesome . Great Christmas present for both men and women !!
 I am very happy with this product . My feet are VERY soft now . I highly recommend it . Very easy to use as well !
 The drywall screen like callous rasp will smooth hard edges but not sand off deep callouses easily . If you need smoothing this is the ticket . But if you typically shave callouses this may not be enough , or may be step 2 in your routine . The cream is fine , but Cerave lotion -LRB- the kind in the tub -RRB- or Eucerin works better .
 I use it to maintain the callus buildup on my feet . It works real good . This is a good product to use .
 Works well . Also have a Dr. Scholl 's cheese grater on a handle that works good too . This Screen gets down to business . Men will like this product more so than I originally thought .
 This is a great lighter if you live out doors it will light anything flammable in any condition . I use it often in the shop as well as in the woods . I bought it for a motorcycle trip from Key west to Deadhorse Alaska and it was always ready for what ever we through at it .
 I like the engravable face , and the armor on the outside . This is a simple , basic lighter , with a dual torch , and it works well .
 I was just looking for a lighter to go with the hand warmer I purchased recently from Sundance Catalog and came across this lighter that seemed to fit the bill . It 's actually a pretty nice lighter -LRB- for the cost -RRB- . It lights reliably and has a nice double flame . Nice feature that I was n't aware of
 my husband is going to love it ... great presentation - fast shippment - just nice ... , , , , , , , , , ,
 the flower essence practitioner 's bible . comprehensive discussion of all English and North American essences . feel good about buying this book .
 This book is used in homeopathic studies in colleges . It is an excellent resource on identifying , recognizing and knowing exactly what flower you are working with and what it 's purposes are . Everything from how to ease a belly ache to how to sooth a scar or tend to anxiety is in this book . It 's a wonderful ` teacher ' in it 's very pages .
 Estroven has been a `` Godsend '' for me . I had been taking it for about 3 years and stopped taking it while I was traveling for about a month . I started feeling the same menapausal problems I had before I started taking it . After I began using it again and it lessened my hot flashes , I began sleeping better again . My husband was glad I was not so irritable and it brought me back to my old self . Having a digestive problem for about 30 years I was reluctant to take anything like this ; however , it has been terrific for me and I highly recommend it in place of estrogen to help my menapausal issues . Just give it about 60 days . I have recommended it to several friends and they are astounded at their own personal results . In addition to Estroven , a friend recommended a product called PROGEST Body Cream with all natural Progesterine . It completely eliminates the hot flashes and you take it when you feel one coming on ! You owe it to yourself to try them both !
 I bought this product for side effects I was experiencing when given the DepoDeprovera Shot for birth control . I had begun experiencing hot flashes and hormonal imbalances while on the Depo shot . I began one of the Estroven tabs nightly and slept through the night . Estroven handled all my side effects efficiently and I took it until I was able to be switched off the Depo . I highly recommend it .
 I was really pleased after using my new epilator , it definitely exceeded my expectations and I do n't need to epilate again for at least a month easily . I had a Braun epilator earlier I had used for years which was much more expensive but I must say the Philips epilator is as good , if not better .
 After many years of use , my old Satinelle died . I was elated to discover that Amazon sold these as my old one came from Canada . This is so much better than waxing !!! I read about the pain complaints but I found after several uses the pain is minimal , if at all . I love relaxing with a glass of wine and using my Satinelle . I can not live without this item and it was sorely missed until I got my new one .
 I used to use the `` silk epil '' braun epilator -LRB- similar item -RRB- for years , and I was looking for somthing new alike , when I found this satinelle epilator I was thrilled in a good way , not only about the very good price but also the quality , soft skin in the most delicate areas for weeks , is worth the pain -LRB- which decreases everytime , and you will get less hair everytime as well -RRB- . GREAT DEAL , FORGET SHAVING !!!
 Before I bought it , I did a lot of research and saw a lot of good reviews . I bought it and I really like it now . I do n't shave anymore and I love that !
 I bought this item after testing other methods -LRB- home waxing , depilatory cremes , razor shaving and electric shaving -RRB- for over a year . I found the results of epilating to be very comparable to those of waxing - the most marked difference is the cost ! Waxing , even with at-home kits , quickly becomes a pricey -LRB- and messy -RRB- venture and in salons , forgetaboutit ! This epilator costs less than one trip to the salon , provides equally fine results . Also , that it does a superior job on those `` more sensitive '' areas with coarser hair than on the legs . If you are prone to ingrown hairs I highly recommend making use of the loofah and `` bump patrol after shave intensive treatment '' , a gentleman 's shaving product designed to treat and prevent facial razor bumps and ingrown hairs -LRB- it 's cheaper than `` tend skin '' and works better than `` bikini zone '' . The combination has worked very well for me and freed me from the razor forever ! Yay ! All hail the epilator !
 For anyone sick of shaving and who want 's to save some money on waxing I recommend this product . I bought my first Satinelle back in the ' 90 's and have n't shaved my legs since . The cord wore out so I just got this replacement . To minimize pain from hair removal , get a wax , then use the dry loufa that comes with the epilator afterwards , and a week to 10 days later when you start to get sparse growth use the epilator . Stay on it after that . I used to wait 30 days to epilate now I do it about every 10 days - that way it just `` tingles '' vs. hurting and there is a lot less hair to deal with .
 I bought this item specifically because the voltage is listed as 120-240 on the norelco website indicating that if you had the right adapter you could use it in Ireland . I travel alot and wanted it for that purpose however , the transformer to plug it in is only 120 . I assume I would likely ruin it if I tried to use it in Europe even though i have the proper adapters .
 I have used Epilady products for 18 years , but have always winced at the expense of the products -LRB- in all fairness , my first Epilady , which cost over $ 100 , lasted 10 years -RRB- . The Norelco product works just as well and was less than half the cost of the equivalent Epilady . I 'm glad to see there 's some competition in this marketplace !
 This product has met our needs and is very good.I like it and would recommend it too others too.My delivery from Amazon came 3 days in advance and I was not surprised but Shocked!Keep it up !
 Duele un monton ! Hay que pasarlo varias veces , varias veces a la semana , porque si no no funciona . Pero el precio esta bien , y es mejor que estarse rasurando . Vellos salen mas debiles y mas claros
 This is my first epilator.I love this product.For many years I was shaving my legs to get rid of hairs.First it was ok but eventually I started getting razor burns and I lost the smoothness of my legs.I was totally upset.I was trying for something different and finally I found out a good product which is completely worth of the amount that I spent.It is not so costly . It is simply awesome.I love it.There is no much pain.The pain during epilating is really very less.Anybody can bear it.I highly recommend this product .
 It 's the best epilator I 've ever tried.The result really lasts about 3 weeks
 Works very well . Got out all hairs from legs , underarms , and even the bikini area at the same time , because the pain was tolerable .
 This is fabulous for removing unwanted hair . This makes Nad 's hair remover strips and waxing absolete . It works so well and is easier than shaving . The first time on the legs might take a little time but after that 5-10 minutes every two weeks and my legs remain nice and smooth with no stubble .
 My first epilator was a Norelco Satinelle , and I adored it . After I 'd been using it for just a few weeks , my legs , underarms , and binkini area became baby soft and touchable . Re-growth came in much finer and scarcer , and that trend continued over time . No more razor nicks ! No more balancing on one leg in the shower ! No more dropping the razor because my hands were slippery with hair conditioner -LRB- works much better than shaving cream , for those of you still stuck with shaving -RRB- . I was very distressed when my trusty Norelco disappeared during a household move . To make matters worse , I could n't find another Norelco . I bought another famous brand of epilator but was very unhappy with its performance
 This product is excellent and has so far proven quite effective at getting those coarse dark hairs that have an unfortunate tendency to crop up with more frequency the older we get ! Cleanup 's a breeze , it comes with an electric razor head , a round loofah sponge for facial use , and two small brushes for help in cleaning up . Since the time I have had it I have not had to resort to weekly shaving . I would highly recommend this product !!
 this products works wonders . There is some pain in the beginning but once you get use to it , you wo n't feel a thing . it does take most of your hairs out but not all . i use it for my underarms and i am happy with the results . i would buy it again !!
 This is much better than I expected , especially at this price . Left my legs smooth for a couple of weeks . -LRB- although it missed some areas so I had to follow up with a razor -RRB- . Yes , it is a little painful -- but I think it 's less painful than waxing.Start with the lower legs , which are the least sensitive , and afterwards usebaby oil or an unscented moisturizer . And , as others here have said , the second time is easier than the first .
 Well ... I expected miracles from the product , which I guess is unreasonable . I did end up liking it once I got through my first session with it . I will give some advice though . The first use hurts INCREDIBLY !!! That being said , subsequent uses are far less painful . I was prepared from the reviews of others that the Epilator does not remove every hair the way shaving does . I can not stress this enough . You need to go over the surface multiple times . Also , this skin irritation is n't so bad as long as you keep up with the exfoliating . I would like to say I have retired my razor all together , but I still use it probably once a week or so for a clean up . All in all , the epilator is a good product , once you get the hang of using it . You do need to allow extra time , but I feel you gain that time back with less shaving in the shower . I 've only been using it for a month or so . So far , I feel it was a worthwhile investment .
 I love this product it 's awsome . I have to admit it is painful a little the first time , but after that the pain goes away . you 'll love the feeling of your skin after you use it , very smooth and clean . I totally recommend it .
 This is the first epilator I ever tried and it 's great . I ` ts a bit painful but I think is less painful than using wax . I think that this is a great product . It does a pretty nice work , I have a very sensitive skin but I have no trouble whatsovever with this product .
 The epilator is easy to use and extremely cool.Its hassel free.I love it .
 I have been using it for 4 years nowstill perfectI definitely recommend it
 This is the third epilator product that I 've used and it works even better than some other units that cost twice as much . It is lightweight , easy to operate , and travels well . The shaver head is an added bonus . You wo n't go wrong with this item for the price !
 Vine desde Chile a USA ... deje mi depiladora en Chile . . y encontre esta en Amazon ! Es realmente excelente . . pequena . . la puedo llevar a todos lados !! y lo mejor de todo a buen precio !! . . No me arrepiento !!!! Llego en menos de 5 dias !!!! ... Todo bien !! Gracias ! Amazon !
 This is a good product and I am happy with the service from Amazon , though it got delayed to reach me , but was informed by Amazon .
 The first time using this is PAINFUL , but the results last a long time . It is nice to not have to shave every day anymore . The first time I used it , -LRB- I let the hair grow for 5 days or so -RRB- I could still feel little hairs , but I have found that if I shave the little leftovers , my legs stay smooth for a week or so . There must be slower growing hairs that do n't quite get long enough for the epilator to `` grab , '' but still stay away for awhile after shaving . Subsiquent uses are less painful . Watch TV or something to keep you mind occupied . I have never been one to shave my arms , but I used this on them , and am so pleased with the results . Smooth for days . Even when the hairs start to grow back , the are soft . No more hairy arms for me !
 I have been using the same epilator -LRB- older model -RRB- since 1999 , and it fell down and broke so I decide to replace it for this one . I have to say I am very happy with this kind of epilator , it works as good as the one I had before so I hope it last me as much as the other one last . It does n't hurt and it cut down my shaving -LRB- under arms , legs , and bikini -RRB- for every three days that i used to do it before to twice a month . I recommended because I am a satisfied owner .
 I 'm am really happy that I decided to give the epilator a try . I was a little hesitant after reading some of the reviews . I went from shaving twice a week to once every week and a half . Each time you use the epilator the time between usage will increase . I recommend you give it a try .
 I owned an Epilady before , which worked well for 10 years . I thought I should replace it with a more recent product . After a lot of research , I bought this one . It works very well , especially on very small hair . It hurts much less than my old Epilady and cleaning is much easier . I recommend it over the Epilady , especially since it is much cheaper . I have n't used the shaver option , since you do n't need to shave anymore after using the epilator -LRB- Your hair gets more and more finer and you will use it less often -RRB- . I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 , since it took Amazon 1 month to send it to me : -LRB-
 Just as expected , this product works well and was shipped to me fast
 This product is awesome . It is definitely more painful than shaving at first , however , after a week of using this product , I can go several days without epilating , and I used to have to shave my legs everyday to keep the stubble at bay . It is a little time consuming until you 've completely transitioned , but it 's worth it . And I 'm going to save a ton of $ $ on shaving cream and I feel really good about not having to discard the metal cans they come in !
 Ive been using this for nearly 7 years now , never an issue and easy to operate . the parts can be removed and i 've even washed them in water , no corrosion whatsoever .
 I 'm not sure how this compares to other epilators , but I think it does a pretty good job for the price . It does n't get all my hair out , but it gets 95 % of it after a few passes . I think with any epilator , it 's gon na hurt , but since the hair does n't grow back as fast , and comes back finer it is sooo worth it . The more you use it , the less it hurts , so do n't give up , it gets better ! Also , I 've noticed that even with occasional use -LRB- about 6 times a year -RRB- , about 25 % of my hair has stopped growing back , and what has come back is much finer . Unfortunately , I have such fair skin that I need to remove the hair either by epilating or waxing since you can still see the folicle after shaving ! The epilator is much more financially and environmentally better than having to wax for me .
 I bought this epilator three years ago because I was tired of plucking my underarm hairs with a pair of tweezers . I prefer plucking over shaving because the results last longer and I did not get ingrown hairs like I did when shaving . I still have this epilator and it still works fantastically . For first time epilators it does hurt and this is coming from someone who has been manually plucking her underarm hairs since she was 17 . It takes a few uses to get used to many hairs being plucked simultaneously-roughly 4 times . It has two settings , but I only use it on the first one and it works marvelously . It plucks nearly every hair out . I say nearly because I 'll have one or two the tweezer heads do n't catch . Still , you have to admit that is fantastic . I only epilate once a week and over time the hairs have gotten thinner and reduced in number . I tried it on my legs once , and yes it was painful . I have n't used this on my legs since that last time only because most of the hair does n't grow back anymore.If you are looking to buy an epilator , I would get this one . Sadly Amazon does n't carry it at the moment . If you find it elsewhere though , do get it . I love this little machine .
 It wo n't do fine hairs and does not pull out all hairs at the root , some hairs may clip off and not be unrooted , and when you try to go over the area again it wo n't get those hairs . Basically , it works about as well as waxing , but without the mess . It is about as quick as shaving -LRB- though I just dry shave -RRB- . Now , let 's talk a bit about the pain . It does hurt , but not the kind of pain a woman ca n't handle . I use it for armpits and bikini area . It hurts but it 's quick and with longer lasting results than shaving . If you do legs you should get into the habit of using the exfoliating pad because it does seem to cause much ingrowing of hairs . I do n't have that problem in other areas though.There is a learning curve in determining how close to the skin you go , if varies the type of hair and skin . You have to experiment to determine what is most effective maximizing uprooting more hairs and minizing the pain.Definitely worth the price and pain . When is this thing going to be stocked again ? I want to get at least 2 more for girlfriends as gifts !
 I bought an epilator because I was tired of shaving my legs and waxing was just too expensive for me . I 've had my epilator for several weeks now and I am already seeing amazing results!I used it for the first time on my legs . I 'm not going to lie ... It was painful . I just made sure to go slowly , pausing every few inches , and making sure my skin was pulled as tightly as I could get it . Eventually , I was able to get most of the thick , dark hairs off of my legs . ** Please know that the Epilator is not an immediate `` cure-all '' . Hair grows in stages , so as soon as you get rid of some hairs , several more grow in behind them . -LRB- Eventually you can probably get rid of most to all of them , but it will take some time . -RRB- Because of this , it is good to try epilating a couple of times a week . Since it 's winter , I just let it all grow out so that the Epilator can get more hairs . However , when new hair grows in , I am finding that they are thinner and blonde instead of dark brown . It does n't hurt nearly as much to pull those out ! I also know that I 'll be able to do this in the spring and summer because the hair is lighter . My legs are smoother and I do n't get razor burn ! Right after epilating , sometimes I do experience a little irritation but , unlike razor burn , it goes away after just a short time.Another neat thing is that , unlike waxing , the Epilator can grab the teeny tiny almost invisible hairs . This gives your skin a smoother feel and it gets hairs at the beginning stages of growth ! I used to have to wait two weeks or so for my hair to grow long enough to be waxed . Now , I get smoother skin just about whenever I want to!I was a little nervous at first about spending money on a product I had not heard much about . With the exception of the few reviews I read online , I was pretty much in the dark . I went ahead and went for it , then realized that this thing paid for itself in about two weeks ! Not only have I epilated my legs , I have also used it under my arms , on my upper lip , and on my bikini line . The results have been better than I could have imagined !! Again , I 'm not going to lie ... OUCH !!!!! Epilating under my arms hurt initially and they were sore for a few days -LRB- I have very thick hairs -RRB- . However , I got the majority of the hairs and after the first time , I realized that I 'm never going to have to shave again ! Yes , some little blonde hairs grow back , but they are ALL thinner and much less painful . In fact , sometimes it tickles a little . :o-RRB- I epilate there once to twice a week -LRB- about a five minute job if you 're being careful , two if you 're in a hurry -RRB- and I have smoother underarms!I used to get my upper lip waxed about once a month . Now I just epilate . It hurts , but just for a second . Plus , I keep up with it so instead of 50 hairs being pulled at once with hot wax , I only need to pull 5-10 each time . ** A word of caution
 I personally have problems with chemicals and waxing.My skin is far too sensitive and the results from those methods are nightmarish o_OThis was a last ditch effort and I 'm so glad I did ^_^ it 's the best!The first use may be a bit of a shock but repeated use proves to be easy with little irritation.I 've even used it on my neck and face area with excellent results.Do not however think this is a cure all ... hair is very stubborn and will not disappear over night.The time I 've saved is worth it , I only have to go over my problem areas once a week up to once a month.Now only the hair is gone and my skin is saved =D -LRB- no more embarrassing blotches or chemical burns -RRB- Thank You So Much !
 I have been using Philips epilator which I bought in Europe for 10 years . It just died then I was looking for replacement . I did not know Norelco is a part of Philips , so it took time to find this one.This is almost same with the one I had . Does not need any more fancy technology , this is just enough for the purpose . From the experience of more than 10 years , this is the best method to keep smooth legs if you can not afford laser hair removal all over your body.However , Using this machine is NOT painless procedure for first couple of rounds . If you have just kept shaving your legs , the more expensive models have some feature to reduce pain . If you do waxing , you must have used to pain . This model is good enough .
 It really takes very short hair . It is not very good for underarms though.I had a Braun epilady before and this is better because I have less red spots on my legs after using this . Braun Silkepil series are better than the regular one in terms of red spots . But since this is much cheaper , why would you pay more ?
 The epilator did what I bought it for . It removed hair , and is painless -LRB- I am a long time epilator user , though -RRB- . It is so painless , I used to do only below knees but ventured to do thighs and arms , and it worked fine . Even the tough ones came off after a few passes . My first epilator was Epilady , which was fine . It died after 3-4 years , and I bought Emjoi 's ForeverFree spending over $ 100 , but it did n't work at all . I was so discouraged and did n't want to waste any more money , so fixed my old Epilady myself and used it for another 10 years or so . It finally got to the point that it is not effective in removing hair , so I bought this one . This is worth the money spent . The only thing , which is very minor , is that the motor seems to be a bit too loud , and the head comes off too easily . I ca n't remember what I did to make the head come off when I did n't mean it to , but it did n't come off while removing hair , so I think it 's ok .
 Not to be gross , but I have thick , dark black underarm hair , and this epilator really helps ! I thought it hurt like hell when I used it the first time , but I 've since learned that if you do it right after you get out of the shower , it hurts a LOT less . It has really thinned out my hair , and some of it has n't even grown back at all in over a week . It 's pretty amazing . I have n't used it on my legs yet , but that 's next ! Definitely worth the money .
 This little machine is one my favorite new appliances . I have n't bothered with a razor in months and I 'm completely happy with the results . I 've used it on my legs , arms , underarms , bikini area , and my face . Although it hurts like crazy on my face , I still like that I do n't have to mess with wax or strips . I 've even discovered that I do n't have to worry about getting every little hair on my legs , the hair that 's grown back is less noticable . The amount of money I 've saved not buying new cartridges for my razors has more than made up for the initial expense , which really is n't much.I love this little guy & highly recommend it !
 Not as good as wax in pulling hair , but does its work pretty well and it 's always there when I need it . Worth the money !
 The epilator works fine and the price says it all . I recommend it for people with not a lot of hair , because it does n't get all of the hair the first time so you need to repeat again ... That 's why I gave it four stars not five ... Other than that it works okay , I do n't have to shave every three days anymore .
 I bought the an older model and was very happy with it and by mistake ordered a panasonic one . That was a bad move ! . I recently decided to purchase this one and WHAT A DIFFERENCE !! . I highly recommend it !
 Pros
 I have used epilators for years . Its not painful as some expressed , but the usual pinch when you start off . Its very efficient and easy to clean . I hope it lasts me a long time . The last one I got was also a phillips one from UK.I am not giving it 5 stars as I dont know its longevity and havent tried the shaver part of it .
 This is a good item when compared with its price . Generally I am satisfied with its performance but I want to mention a con . It does not clean small ones . Overall it is worthy to buy .
 After reading some of these reviews , I was expected it to hurt a lot , but I was pleasantly surprised . I 've used it on my legs and it did n't hurt that much at all -- much less than waxing , and a lot easier and cheaper too ! I 'm so glad I do n't have to deal with razors anymore , and it only took 20 min out of my Saturday . A great buy !
 With my German `` hairitage '' , blade shaving just was n't cutting it . ; - -RRB- Epilating was the answer for me back in the 90s . I went from the `` whirling coil of death '' aka Epilady original that felt like sticking your leg in a wasp nest to a then-Norelco Satinelle fixed-head epilator , which I affectionally dubbed `` spinning disks of doom '' because it hurt a * lot * less but I used it nearly everywhere - legs , arms , underarms , bikini , and there are some places that it does still smart to use . When the motor on that one tanked , I bought a Satinelle Sensitive with interchangeable head and little rubber nubbly things that were supposed to make epilating not hurt ... I think by then for me it did n't matter , and eventually one by one the rubber nubblies fell off anyway so they 're a waste of money for anyone who can tolerate epilating already . I dropped the Satinelle Sensitive once too often and a plastic cog inside broke in half , so the discs would n't spin . I tried my daughter 's Philips epilator but for some reason it did n't catch the shorter finer hairs as well as mine had - the discs on mine seemed to be tighter or something . However , the heads were interchangeable -LRB- !!! YAY !!! -RRB- so I used my old SS head on her base and it worked . I saw the price on this unit and figured I 'd give it a try , and lo and behold my trusty SS epilator head fit this base unit as well and works like new at less than half the original Satinelle Sensitive price -LRB- if it * were * available , which it is n't -RRB- , so I 'm a happy camper . :D At this price , I 'll be buying another as a back-up , and Amazon.com got it to me very quickly . I also figure I have enough parts to put together another one should these fail and Philips epilators go out of production . : D
 THIS WORKS!The only prep you need is to plug it in and brush the hair out from under the wheel occasionally . -LRB- No running water , shaving cream , razors , warming wax , or any of those other time consuming bothers -RRB- Yes , it stings . It 's no more painful then waxing . In fact , it 's LESS . If the pain gets to much just stop for a moment , wait for the irritation to die down , then go at it again . As long as you take it slow you wo n't have irritated skin for more than a minute after you stop using the epilator . -LRB- unless you have really sensitive skin . But still , the shock is a lot less than waxing -RRB- It does n't pinch , just takes the hair . Missed some ? No problem ! Run over the area again and catch what was missed ! Ca n't do that with waxing.Not only that , but for the price of one upper lip wax you can buy an epilator that will pay for itself after one use ! No more trips to the salon , no more razors , no more shaving cream , no more wax , no more hassle !
 I have used a Braun silk epil since I was 15 , an old one that after 10 years was still working . Last march I moved to the States leaving my epilator in Italy so I was looking for another Braun . But the price of the Philips was so cheap that I decided to give it a shot and I 'm very glad I did it . The epilator is perfectly functional and if you do n't mind not having a bag or a cap for it it 's fine . I dind ' t use the razor attachment yet but I 'm sure it will be a good choice to have two toys at the price of one!Fantastic !
 It 's a great accessory to have . It 's quick and not messy at all , plus I do n't cut myself the way I do while shaving . I have an exceptionally quick growth of hair -LRB- or , so I feel !! -RRB- . But when I used Satinelle the results lasted much longer . I simply love it ... it 's one of my more useful purchases in the recent past .
 I hate shaving my legsMy hair turns to stubble an hour after I shave and it 's so uncomfortable.Now that I have an epilator , I really do n't have to worry about my legs anymore!No more shaving every day , I just epilate every few days and it looks like I 'm born without hair!Sure , the first time was really , really , really painfulBut if you stick it out , it 's so much easier after that.I personally would not get it anywhere near my pubic area without novocain.Although , I use it on my underarms and I do n't have to worry about shaving under there either ! Just use some lotion after you epilate and your skin stays so smooth!I know some people who can go for weeks without epilating again , but I feel most comfortable touching up quickly every three days or so.The reason why I gave it 4 stars is that it has more trouble gripping the hair after you 've been using it for a few months . Other than that , it 's great!All - in-all , if you hate shaving like me and are willing to take a little pain -LRB- not nearly as much pain as razor burn -RRB- , get this product .
 I use this item to hold multiple scissors , needle drivers and reflex hammer in the pocket of my white clinical lab jacket -- works great ! No more holes torn out in the pocket and all items transfer out of my coat into book bag or locker quickly and easily . Highly recommend , very sturdy build quality !
 This is the perfect light weight skin creme that provides just the right amount of moisture with the wonderful fragrance of fresh strawberries !!!!
 I am a hair stylist and travel a lot to clients homes . I found that this is the perfect alternative to the big pot of hot wax on the go . The one thing i did find was that the facial strips while great for lip and chin were too thick for brows . But i was able to cut them to size and that did the trick just fine . All in all i have really liked this product . No allergic reactions , or break outs .
 We had heard about this item -LRB- and the many similar items -RRB- and decideded that we 'd give it a try . Wow ! We had no idea how fantastic it would be ... or would continue to be ... and continue to be ... The design is great . The controls work . It 's a fantastic piece of equipment . The only complaint is that it 's not silent , but we do n't think that would matter under the circumstances - we were n't either .
 I decided to give myself something better than the usual chocolate bunny this year . This bunny is way better than chocolate ! Very pretty and glittery color , fun to use , and no icky phthalates ! The bunny vibrates at an extremely high level , and those wonderful ears are ticklish in all of the right places . The shaft is the perfect length and girth for my taste - not uncomfortably large , but solid . The rotation function is interesting - I think this is something I will have to play with , to get the most out of this toy . You really need to hold the base firmly to get the feel of the rotation . The beads were fun , but sometimes distracting . I found myself using the rotation and vibration together as a warm up , but when I was ready to orgasm , I needed to shut off the rotation and focus on the vibration . The vibration definitely is reduced when the rotation is turned on . The toy is also quite noisy , so not the best to use if you have roommates . However , this toy is still so much fun , and will provide so much opportunity for experimenting with sensation . I 'd recommend it to any woman who is looking for a powerful toy that stimulates multiple parts at once . It seems like a very good quality toy that should last for quite some time . Definitely a great value !
 Let 's get the negative out of the way first . The battery cover is very loose and I expect it to fall off at any time . Also , turning on the pearls really cuts back on the vibrating rabbit , which pretty much leaves you a choice of using one or the other . The pearls are also pretty loud.Now , for the positive . The rabbit is awesome ! The ears are perfectly positioned and are firm enough to provide just the right amount of friction . The control for the rabbit provides a good range of vibration , which is easily adjustable.The insertable portion is smoother and firmer than toys I 've had previously , which is a definate plus . I am well pleased with the product overall .
 My wife saw one of these products on Sex in the City . After several conversations where it was casually brought up as part of a discussion we made the choice to purchase and try out the product to see what all the fuss was about.If you are use to small simple design vibrators that are a singular non-moving shaft then this vibrator may catch you off guard at first . There are two sections to the vibrator . The main shaft both rotates and vibrates . It consists of small balls and so it has an uneven texture . The smaller shaft on top consists of two pieces of silicone that vibrate rapidly together.Honestly , the first time we flipped on the vibrator we both laughed because we felt it was a little ridiculous . She also felt a little intimidated since it was something very new and , as she mentioned , there seemed to be so much with switches and moving parts going on.We slipped a condom over the main shaft as well as astroglide lubricant . Let me tell you my life LOVES it!She enjoys the vibration as well as the rotation being preformed internally . As if that is not enough , the smaller shaft vibrates rapidly across her clitorious . I have rarely seen her experience a full body orgasm where she ripped the bedsheets off while arching her body high in the air . This vibrator has helped us achieve that on several occasions now.The vibrator does make noise but it is not to the point it is loud and overbearing distracting from the situation . Also , it is great it runs on 3 AA batteries which makes replacement very easy but , with small batteries , the device does not last that long before you have to change them over.Overall , a much welcomed edition to the bedroom let it be for solo play or for partner use . A good step in the exploration of dual simulators .
 read all the reviews , decided to test it out myself . definitely not disappointed . this is my first vibrator and i really enjoy it . i do n't use it very often , but when i do it gets the job done ! the rotating option could be a little stronger -LRB- if you squeeze to hard it stops rotating , the only time my kegel exercises have worked against me , lol -RRB- . otherwise i love it !
 I was a little intimidated about buying a toy like this because I have never used anything in the bedroom before , but I went for it . I am so glad I did . I recommend it to all my friends and it is my Favorite thing ever !!! The best $ 50 ever spent . My husband thinks so too !
 It hits the spot , does the job - in record time , every time . Lovely . But it does tend to give me a minor rash .
 Purchased this product but it does n't have 220 volts capability so useless while i travelled to india , it works fine , but had to purchase an additional adatoper and made it useless till the time had it . otherwise overall it is good
 This lube is fantastic !! We have tried a number of lubes over the years but this one is exceptional . It 's is super slick . You do n't need very much . It does n't get sticky or tacky and it does n't dry out . It 's great for anal sex and is a must when masterbating ! The price on here is also great . Previously I was paying upward of 60 dollars ! Then I found it online for 45 . Now I 've found it on Amazon and it 's under 30 ! You ca n't beat this stuff ! Try it , you 'll LOVE it .
 I have been on a quest to find the best lube I 've tried Wet , Wet light , Wet platnium , Gun oil , swiss navy , Liquid silk , Astroglide , ID Millenium , to name a few . None of them hold a candle to Pjur bodyglide . It works better , last longer and gives superior lubrication for a consideraly longer period without reapplication . very little goes a very long way . Cleans up with soap and water . I highly recommend this product .
 Pjur is always the go-to lube for me and my partner . It 's never sticky , lasts a long time but is easily absorbed . It has no aroma and actually moisturizes , so it does n't even need to be washed off . The only downside is that the bottle does n't have a flip top -- tough to put the cap back on when one hand is holding liquid lube . Pjur beats anything available in a brick-and-mortar store . Well worth the price and easy to order from Amazon , of course . Ca n't recommend this stuff highly enough .
 This lube is really top quality . I saw a recommendation for it in a men 's magazine , so we decided to give it a try . It lasts a very long time . There is a slight flavor to it even though it touts itself as being no flavor and no smell . It never gets sticky or goopy . Holds up to the job .
 This stuff is amazing . It takes forever to dry up , and it does n't feel oily or sticky or anything like that . The price is very resonable for the quality . I highly recommend this .
 The best part about silicon based lubrication is that they do n't get sticky and wo n't wash off even underwater . Try it in the hot tub and you 'll see why I gave it 5 stars .
 The price may seem expensive , but this is a high quality product and is worth the money . The bottle is about 7 and 1/4 inches tall . It has a screw-on cap . The bottle is soft and one just has to lightly squeeze the bottle to pour the lubricant . One only needs to use a small amount , but I found that I did need to use more after a short while . The lubricant has high-quality feel . It feels closer to natural vaginal lubrication . It is very smooth and silky . It does not have a smell or taste . I highly recommend this product . You and your partner wo n't regret how much it will help you in the bedroom . It makes everything better .
 I 've been hesitant to write a review for this product as my reviews are published under my real name . While reviewing my purchases , however , I realized this is one of my regular ones and it 's a product I really , really love ! I 'm an adult woman , so why should I feel shy to admit I have sex and use products to make it better?Hallelujah for turning 40 and beginning to realize there is no reason to be embarrassed.I 've tried a lot of lube . This is , by far , the best . It does n't get sticky or dry up too quickly and it actually makes your skin uber soft after use -LRB- I 'll leave what skin up to your imagination -RRB- . The only caveat is that because it is silicone based you can not use it with any items made of silicone . Settle for KY on silicone toys , but go for Pjur Eros for everything else .
 I 've tried every lubricant on the market , and depending on your length of session or what your sexual proclivities are , if you are concerned about the lubricant getting tacky and ineffective , requiring more and more application , then this is the product for you.Its longevity is such that your female partner will feel it until a thorough wipe-down / shower is performed.As mentioned below , it will stain your sheets , but as also mentioned below , if you wash your sheets on a regular basis and use some Oxy , it comes right out -LRB- no pun intended -RRB- . *****
 I have used this product for years . I personally enjoy having a few quality lubricants available to me at any given time . Eros Original is always the ONE that I never rotate in my search for the best lubes . Enjoy
 After trying at least 7 different types of less expensive and more highly advertised intimate lubes , we came back to Eros Pur . So happy and ` satisfied ' we did ! At 62 , this product is well worth the price and thankfully lasts a long long time .
 I really like this as a skin moisturizer . It only requires a couple of drops to moisturize my legs which tend to be very dry at my age . Although a little pricey it should last a long time since you need such a small quantity .
 I love this stuff . I have a lot of issues with water-based lubes . At worst , it immediately burns my skin due to chemical preservatives in it . At best , it dries up too quickly . Wet Naturals makes some good water-based lube , but even that dries too quickly.This stuff feels great , and it lasts . It eventually becomes less slippery and does need reapplication sometimes , but leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth rather than sticky . And it easily lasts two to three times as long as any water-based lube I 've tried .
 When my friend was getting married , I spent hours researching the world 's best condoms and lube etc. -LRB- Best condom
 I have been using this lube for years and I can not use anything else . It feels so natural and pleasent , it lasts forever during intercourse . Best part is a small drop goes along way , this lube is seriously revolutionary ! Do not look at the price or any bad reviews , this stuff is just simply amazing !
 I wo n't get too explicit , but we love this stuff , wish we would have discovered it 10 years earlier!I would highly recommend !
 Goes on smooth lasts and absorbs what more can you ask for ? Gives a superior slide and pleasant glide . Thanks
 Better at helping you ease into what you want to do without being sticky and makes your experience that much more !
 I like this stuff . It gets messy , but I knew that . It slides well . My only complaints are that bottle breaks easily , the cap specifically . You will drop it at some point . If you 're telling yourself you wo n't ; ThenA . You 're doing it wrong . -LRB- Heat of the moment spills -RRB- B. You 're a liar.It 's slippery when wet !!! Wish my girlfriend liked it too . Maximus ai n't too bad though .
 This is the best lube ever , although it 's a bit expensive compared to Gun Oil and other products , the quality is superior . The only thing I do n't like is the screw off cap , why could n't they have done a pop top or a pump to make it easier to avoid messes . ; -RRB-
 This lube is absolutely amazing ! It is silicone based , silky smooth does n't get sticky and lasts forever . I have tried lube after lube , trying to find the one that would be it for the rest of time ... and this is the one .
 Just try to get this to break down . You ca n't . It stays slick forever with the tiniest amount . Highly recommended , much better than the junk from the drug store .
 We tried a great many other brands and formulas , and no other brand compares to Pujr Eros . The Origunal Body Glide , a little thicker , and Woman 's Bodyglide , a little thinner , are without a doubt the class of this slippery business . These two feel wonderful from both sides , and while you might say they are oily , they neither has a tacky feel . The Original formula , which as I mentioned is the heavier of the two , but feels light and very smooth . Very long lasting . Very satisfying for not being the real thing!I really can not say enough good things about these lubes . They work great in all environments , and even wet , as long as used before the water.Yes , this stuff is generally considered expensive , but I can only say I wish that we had not wasted our time on all the many other offerings out there . We found none to come close to the lastng comfort and excellent feel of this the black bottle and white bottle Bodyglide formulas .
 This lube is wonderful . It does exactly what it needs to do . The best quality lube I have ever used . Your skin even feels smooth after using it , instead of slimy and gross like other brands.This lube makes everything feel better.Great !
 It costs more but it 's worth it . Ultra slippery but none of that nasty feeling `` during '' or `` after '' . Areas its used on seem to be in better condition as well . For those that are curious , the taste is rather neutral too so you do n't have to worry about being grossed out by getting it in your mouth . Get the big bottles , they 're worth it . Have fun .
 Best one out there ! love this stuff ! non greasy or sticky , just super slippery ! Once you try it you wo n't use any other product !
 Works great , and is easy to clean up . The smaller bottles unfortunately come with a screw-on top instead of a pump , making them a bit annoying to use .
 My boyfriend and I have been using this product for several years . We do n't even consider any others . It lasts longer and feels better than ID or Wet brands when using for `` back door '' use .
 Ha , I should have made a video review for this ! -LRB- Barf -RRB- Without being too graphic , this stuff works really well . It lasts a long time , feels great , and does n't get messy . Easy clean up too and I swear my skin is healthier then ever now!Also , this bottle is downright novelty sized . This would make a practicle yet borderline gag gift for a bridal shower .
 The last bottle of lubricant you will ever need . Only a few drops and let the fun begin . It seems like it never dries out . I will never bother with sticky clean ups after the fun is over . Makes you want to go back for seconds ! And thirds !
 This stuff is nothing short of amazing . It is slick when you put it on and it stays slick for a long time .
 it 's the best lube i 've used so far , just a bit expensive and that 's the only thing wrong with it
 Stays very slick . Never gets sticky , easy to clean with soap and water . Retains and transfers body heat very well . Recommended !
 I love this lube oil . I have been using it for about 5 years and I will never use anything else . My wife also loves it !
 It 's great stuff for the intended purpose . Never dries out , very little needed . Because you use so little , it 's actually very inexpensive if you buy it in large containers like this one .
 Pjur Original Bodyglide is probably the smoothest and most comfortable personal lubricant ever in my experience and I am on my second bottle . Pjurfect
 if you need lube , this is the best to use - hands down . lasts forever , does n't get sticky . could n't be happier .
 Simply the best stuff I have ever used ... puts the regular products found at drugstores , etc. , to shame . You wo n't be disappointed with any Pjur product , but this is the original , and for most folks , exactly what they need/want .
 I 've tried a number of lubricants , in my lifetime , and nothing 's ever come close to this . My husband and I stumbled across it at one of those adult party demonstrations . It felt amazing to the touch , so we knew we had to try it . We bought the smallest container available , because it was a bit pricey and we were n't sure how it would perform.In short , we 'll never buy anything BUT this . It was worth every penny and it seemed to last forever . A few drops goes a very long way . It has an incredibly smooth and slick texture , that does n't dry up on you . We 've had nine years of experience with this product and we are both completely SATISFIED !
 I also found this to be a good product and also originally found it to stain any fabric it came in contact with . However , when I contacted Pjur Customer Service , they suggested I try OxiClean or a similar formulation . That did in fact get out the stains .
 We are a couple that like to play daily , we have used this product now for several months and will not ever go back to any water based products . The water based product are good for toys but person to person there is nothing like it . No mess and last and last Great for massages the back and all other parts . We found that is has elimated the Yeast outbreaks to zero . We did not know the water based product actually permote yeast . Try it once and you will never go back .
 My husband and I have been using this product for a couple years now and would n't consider going back to anything else . The reason I only give it four stars is because the bottle needs a better cap . The bottle inevitably gets lubricant on the outside .
 Of all the various massage and other use oils my wife and I have tried , this one is amazing . It never seems to dry out , get sticky , feel oily or lose any of its ability to feel slippery . And , unlike us , it does n't stain the sheets .
 This is the best lube on the market . It 's better than every other lube in many ways : No clean upDoes not leave any residue or get `` sticky `` Tasteless and Odorless , allowing you to concentrate on what 's importantVery concentrated - a small amount goes a long wayBest `` feeling '' out of all the lubesExcellent moisturizer , hair moisturizer -LRB- for wet looks -RRB- , and great for massages alsoFeels the most natural out of all the lubes , excellent for all areasOther things : - Very expensive - but WORTH IT - Will stain if left untreated - if you get it on your clothes , drown the area with water , or it will stain later and it 's very hard to get out after that point
 My wife and I stumbled across this gem when we were seeking to spice things up . We 're both pretty sure this resulted in our first child . We 've loved and enjoyed this product so thoroughly that it has become a staple in our bedroom . We have also purchased it as a gift for others . I hope you take the chance to discover the wonders of this lubricant . A little goes a long way , and a 250ml bottle should last at least a few months -LRB- depending on usage -RRB- . We 're turning to Pjur to help us with child # 2 . ; -RRB-
 This is the best lube on the market -- long lasting and does n't get sticky like the glycerin-based lubes . Well worth the price !
 My wife is highly allergic and it has been quite difficult to find something that is ok for us to use . This is the only product that is n't sticky and fits that profile . Worth the higher price ...
 This product is amazing ! My girlfriend an me love it and use it any chance we get . If you ever need a little extra luberication , this is definitely the product for you ! I promise you will not be disappointed .
 This is the best lube out their . Do not hesitate to buy this . Last a long time and you only need a little . Worth the price !!
 You just ca n't beat Pjur &#34; Original &#34; Bodyglide . I have tried other formulas from Pjur , and many other brands , but I always go back to this one . I 'm done . I will stick with this . It is the best . Both my partner and & I agree .
 i 've tried all kinds of lubes and wo n't be trying anything new . this is honestly the best . never sticky . a little hard to wash off but worth it for the slickness it provides .
 I AM A RETURNING CUSTOMER . THE LUBRICANT IS EXCELLENT FOR MASSAGES AND YOU ONLY NEED A SMALL AMOUNT . GREAT VALUE FOR YOUR MONEY !
 Works really well from female standpoint . Have tried a number of other products , and this one is the best . Worth the price .
 In my opinion , this is the best silicone lubricant available . A little goes a long way and lasts and lasts .
 I was tipped off about this product on a site ranking `` best lubes for anal sex . '' I can attest , it works great for all types of sex , and for `` conventional '' -LRB- i.e. vaginal -RRB- sex , I have n't found a lubricant that even comes close . Use with toys , condoms , and especially on skin . Does n't feel sticky , oily , and outlasts all other lubes . Lube stains on material will wash out with pretty much any detergent I 've tried ; but as one other reviewer noted , OxyClean always succeeds when other detergents fail . In summary , truly a great product .
 I suggest that this product be the one and only supplement that should be in EVERY Man 's drawer bag what ever JUST BUY IT !!
 Tried many others . This is more expensive but worth it . A little goes a long way . Slippery without being sticky or oily . Lasts . Cleanup requires a little more soap in the shower .
 There 's not a lot to say , other than `` worth every penny '' . It 's great for everything . You can even use it around the house !
 a slippery silicone based lube . Applies easily , does its job well . Not too messy , use sparingly if you need to . No fragrance , which is a plus.I found the package itself to be way to small , I dont deal in ml mind you . But as far as a lube , its a good one , applies easily and never loses its momentum . the tube is about 2 inches , and not even an inch in diam . I like the size of say Astroglide for a package , and at 9-11 bucks , I think you could probably find something better for your money , but as a lube it gets a 8 .
 This is the best personal lubricant on the market.We go through lots of it : -RRB- Both my wife and I enjoy the way it feels .
 I have used this product for many years and find it is the best on the market . It is the most concentrated with the greatest lubricating quality.A great value .
 My girl and I liked it thus far . You do have to be careful not to use too much at one time because of the lasting effects of the product . A little goes along way.if your going to forbidden areas then I suggest using the product -LRB- Silk -RRB- , you can get it at Walgreens it offers a much smoother and slippery effect than this product but clean up is always a must afterwards . We would buy this again it 's nice , but I 'm always on the look out for something better like anyone else does .
 The product arrive when stated , just the way I would expect it to . Good show .
 this is not quite as slippery as astroglide but it does n't get dry and it stays alot more where you put it , and works just as good or better . the one thing w / this is it says you can use a few drops but i find most girls need more than that , theres only i girl i used this w / that was ok w / a few drops . i mean maybe for frontdoor sex you can use a few drops but i never use lube for that , but for backdoor , deff . use some more . and my girl says this is much less messy after we 're done than some of the other big name lubes .
 THE PRODUCT IS VERY GOOD FOR ITS PURPOSE BUT IT WILL STAIN AND IT WILL RUIN YOUR SHEETS . ALSO , IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN . YOUR SKIN WILL BREAK OUT .
 this product is also great for massage too , good for use on older women whoseorfice , s are dried up , comes off the bed sheets in landry . overall a long lasting product for a night of slamming the ham !!
 Great product for women that creates the real deal feel . Not for men in the bathroom .
 Hate this lube it 's pricey and a nightmare if it gets on any wooden surface or tile or sheet I 'll . B going back to good ole ky jelly `` do n't waste your time or money on this oily watery crap
 Men -- do not let `` HER '' pick the lube , nor make natures monkey grease -- this elixir was made and used in Germany . GERMANY -- cmon , any sexual or seriously lude act you have seen contains germanic tones . Trust the Gerries and buy their silicone lube -- the will be fairy and winding clocks with every drop .
 This is the best lube I have ever seen . It work great for a long time . You wo n't be sorry if you buy this lube
 This is by far the best lube ever invented . . it is super concentrated , much , much better than any water soluble lube and can be used for massage without leaving a sticky mess . Dont leave home without it ! Truly one of those rare products that really improve your life . . your significant other will thank you .
 ive tried many lubes and would have to say that this lube is the best . the other lubes i tried get sticky after a while and make it uncomfortable to use . this lube stays soft and smooth no matter how long it stays out . the only thing i dont like about it is when you get lube on the outside its pretty slippery to hold , but i guess thats a positive note .
 -LSB- -LSB- ASIN : B0031ESU4A Eros Love Silicone BBodyglide , Latex Condom Safe , 500 ml -RSB- -RSB- This is an excellent product . I originally tried it in a smaller quantity and was impressed with its multiple uses . It is non-staining , tasteless and can be used both for massage oil and as a personal lubricant . Highly recommend !!!
 This was my second Pjur purchase after receiving a free sample early last year . Excellent product , stays slick and does n't `` gum up '' very moisturizing and does n't take a lot . I highly recommend it for use with condoms or without .
 I love this stuff and have been buying it for years . Works like a charm , no sticky feeling , does n't dry out , has a really smooth feel to it .
 Pjur Eros silicone lubricant is the standard by which I judge all others . There is a good reason why it is more expensive than the rest
 This is the best lube we have ever found . And Amazon has the best price on it
 I originally purchased this lubricant for sex but prefer Astroglide or saliva . But I found it is an EXCELLENT massage oil as it does not absorb into the skin and therefore does not require reapplication . I can give an hour massage with one initial application of less than 1/4 ounce . It also mixes well with essential oils such as tea tree or lavender for an instant aromatherapy massage .
 Excellent product ! Very silky smooth . No taste issues , great for all kinds of play . Condom safe .
 It 's the best lubrication I 've ever come across . It does what it says in the name ; it glides across the body . One drop goes a long way .
 This lube has been my favorite for years . It 's pricey , but it lasts a LONG time ! I was able to find it cheaper on Amazon for the biggest size . I normally purchase it from a local store . With these two bottle I purchased , I should be set for easily two years !
 I 've tried lots of lubricants over the years but this stuff is the bomb . It is worth the $ .
 I love this lube have used it for years , and I am so happy they have this bigger 34oz container , that needs I need to purchase it less often .
 love love love this stuff - no odor , no taste , just super-smooth . Never sticky , never grainy . Well worth the cost . I 've used for over a year and a half .
 If you 've only tried water-based lubricants until now , Pjur Eros will make you a convert to silicone-based products . Goodbye stickiness . Goodbye five-second moisture . Pjur Eros lasts and lasts , with a wonderful , velvety feel . My boyfriend and I originally tried this as part of a sampler pack , along with ID Millenium and Wet Platinum . This is better than the other two BY FAR . We love it !
 this is by far the best thing i have used that you can buy in the store i bought something similar from a naughty party loved it but the price was awful then ran across this and it is the best thing ever never gets sticky never goes dry and this stuff is just magic in a bottle great toys also easy to clean off of anything i would reccomend this stuff to anyone and everyone i wont go back to anything else
 The price per ounce Amazon.com lists for this product appears to be incorrect . Amazon lists the the price of an 8.45 ounce bottle as $ 25.95 -LRB- $ 1.62 per ounce -RRB- . In fact $ 1.62 x 8.45 oz . would equal $ 13.69 . The price per ounce SHOULD be listed as $ 3.07 per ounce .
 DO NOT over apply , trust me . Only a small drop is necessary , like a dime size amount !
 I am not one to rave and gush over anything but my wife but I will say this stuff is amazing . Too bad you ca n't mix it with silicone toys because it is silky smooth . Even my wife commented one night on the amazing ease at which I slid into her . Rarely does she go for the oils but she asks for this bottle on a regular basis . If you want silk than get this product .
 I got this to replace my older -LRB- but newer model -RRB- MS2-390 . The 200 is just as good a shave , but the battery lasts about 3-5 days , where the 390 would go a whole week before needing recharged . I got the factory-refurbished , and the pop-up trimmer does n't go half-way , like one adjustment should , which is not a big deal , just a slight miss of quality control . Overall , I like the Remington Titanium MicroScreen shavers more than any other that I 've had , including a Braun , and a Panasonic . I just do n't think the best ones need to be as expensive as they are , and that 's why I compromised for a lesser model . They do the same job with a quick , close , daily shave , but maybe without all the bells and whistles .
 This is the second Remington shaver I have owned , the first rechargeable . It gives me a great , close shave , which is difficult for other makes I 've tried , due to a heavy beard.I would reccomend this model to anyone who needs a good , reliable , inexpensive shaver.It 's well worth the price!j.r . flores
 ok so i brought the magna rx topical lotion it work you get 4 bottle for 39.99 it a great deal and buy . it better the the other topical lotion so callrd gel i try just read my other review . so like i said you get 4 bottle for 39.99 that will last about 1 to 2 months if you used right . so you rub it on like lotion on face like 5 to 10 mins than it go to work you feel it work under 90 to 60 secord you get hard stay hard for a long time plus it smell great and they got good ingredients . i got say this stuff is good you get a good deal and price like those other that cost for one bottle it 49.99 for 2 it 79 to 89 . rip off . you get 4 for the price for 2 . i been used it for like 3 month i got to say my ertion is alot better than before i grow about 1/2 half i last alot longer in bed with my girlfriend . so my last thought it a good topical lotion for that price it work im happy so i will be buyingb this stuff again really like friday becaue im amost out for it . so if guys if want something that work fast make hard this is the stuff you cant beat tha deal .
 I use this almost exclusively.You need very little , a little goes a very very long way.I 've been using exclusively eros pjur woman for maybe 3 years , and I 've had to buy 2 bottles , through long distance relationships , and actively living with beaus ... a couple drops will do ya hehe.plus its very mild and me , I 'm allergic to most things , but this I have no adverse reaction to .
 This product is a little thinner and more natural feeling than the original formulation -LRB- in the black bottle -RRB- . Great for sex but we prefer the original for hand jobs . We have not used this for anal but I 'm thinking the original would be better for that . Really perfect for the lady who is looking to pleasure herself or the very vanilla .
 oh the gauntlet of lubes can be overwhelming but in my searches i have found what i consider to be the best . pjur woman.this is not a thick , goopy , heavy feeling lube . this is light and sweet jesus , it is so smooth and sexy . -LRB- concentrate on the review karrie ... -RRB- there is no odd heating or cooling , nor is there any irritating fragrance added . just gorgeous slip and slide . i have also found that it leaves the skin of my lady bits soft and smooth.the only improvement i would suggest is a more convienent cap . the one on the bottle is a screw-off cap . a pop-top would be better , IMO . hands get slippery ...
 Since I discovered it I do n't use anything else . Silky smooth and rich . Good for massages too , so very versatile all around . Try it , you 'll like it !
 We go through quite a bit of lube in our house , and this is by far the best . It does n't get sticky or leave residue , it literally just lets your hands glide over anything smoothly . No mess , its super easy to clean up and the slickness lasts for a long time , so you dont have to use as much . I also really like it because it does n't taste bad , I actually dont notice it at all if I happen to be licking something that has been previously covered in lube . Just use the lube until you stop feeling that smooth glide and either reapply or try something else . Its more of a moisturizer than anything , and when it dries , you ca n't tell that you used anything in the first place - no cleanup ! Its great . And this bottle lasts forever . We go through quite a bit of it and this bottle has lasted us 6 months . Really great value for the price and really high quality stuff . I would n't consider using anything else .
 This is the best lube i have ever used . I love it . My wife loves it . Its so silky smooth , does n't burn , does n't give you any type of reaction after using it . Me and my wife cant stop having sex because of it . Were like jack rabbits . I would recommend this product to anyone who likes having sex , it will change your experience for the better .
 This is the best lube you 'll ever buy . It 's expensive , but it 's sure worth it ! I would never use another ever again !
 Found this lubricant about 6 years ago , and it 's the only product we use . It 's not at all sticky , and a just a few drops go a long way . Highly recommended .
 The bottom line is this is just silicon lubricant liquid.Similar to spray silicon used in industry to lubricate with.My wife says this stuff irritates her the same amount as Astroglide or K-Y . This stuff FEELS really , really , really good to me.It also LASTS longer than Astroglide , or probably anything else out there.Worth trying if you are looking for something different .
 Great product , even when you use a lot it does n't get extra slippery like other products I have used . The best lubrication I 've used ever . It has by far exceeded my expectations and am grateful I have chosen this product and would recommend it to my friends and others .
 It is as advertised . It is a good lubricant and very soft to the touch . Helps with post menopausal dryness problems .
 Have awlays used Pjur or Eros ... and they have n't disappointed . Can not comment on how it is beneficial to women as the name indicates .
 This water based solution is amazing for giving a massage . No greasy feeling after , and a little bit goes a long way .
 My wife likes the black one better . I believe this is water based and the other 's not . Still works well for good ole slippery slidy fun time .
 This is by far the best lubricant I have ever tried and great for those with sensitive skin . It has no smell and no taste which is a huge plus in my book ! It feels like silk on your skin and never gets sticky feeling . I will never use anything else after trying this !
 I came across this product by mistake and thought i try it . In my thinking , you p -LSB- ay a little extra if you want a better quality product . Let me tell you , this product is best to none . I do n't use anything else . Try it once and see if what i am saying is true .
 This is by far the best lube ever . Never gets sticky and is very light , a little goes a long way . Love it !
 The best lube ever invented . It 's not sticky which makes it great for massages . It practically rubs off and you do n't need to reapply much at all . The only minor downside is that it 's not quite as slippery as other lubes .
 This is a wonderful product . I have tried many over the years and this is water soluble and does not leave you feeling yuky . Even perfered by my husband .
 this is by far the best lubricant i have ever used , and i have n't even thought about using another one since i found pjur 2 years ago . it never gets sticky and feels super silky .
 While the package is marked ` Factory Serviced Unit ' , I ca n't tell it from a new shaver . It 's a little noisy and the trimmer control is easy to accidentally engage , but it shaves great . I 've just been using an electric shaver for a few months and this one is shaves much faster and closer than others I 've tried .
 I am still trying it out . Depends on the shoe I wear whether it works wells . Much better of course with tennis shoes . Lets your toes lie flat rather than curl up .
 This toe cushion works as advertised . It was recommended by my podiatrist . The only complaint is it requires careful handling to extend its life . The toe loop breaks fairly easily if you are not careful .
 Podiatrists dispense these to patients with hammer toes to take pressure off toe tips , support rigid toes and help take pressure off the ball of foot . The soft Gel is neat stuff . Pedifix also offers a foam/fabric version that some find more supportive , along with toe caps , protectors and cushions . Pedifix offers a 100 % money back ` relief guarantee ' . No Sore Feet ! FS
 I bought this for my dad who has some problems with his toes . This product keeps them straighter and seems to help him . Good price and fast shipment .
 wonderful and this definitely helps my toe-with this I deceided not to have surgery because it relieves the pain in my foot
 I really love this candle . I found a small one in a gift shop and it lasted forever - I went online and found the company that makes them and bought this biggest one I could find . It has lasted so long and the scent does not over power a room like some candles do.I HIGHLY recommend this candle and the company !
 Lavendar is my scent . Not the sickly sweet candy type , but the earthy natural lavendar scent . This one fits the bill and is noce with the addition of the eucalyptus .
 I absolutely LOVE these soy candles . My absolute favorite scent is Lilac . It smells EXACTLY like my lilac bushes when they are blooming in the spring . Anytime someone walks in my room they comment on how great it smells . The candle lasts forever and I love that it is made from soy . Something about that just makes me feel calm . The other Bean Pod item I love are the Beads for plug in/heat up devices . I love Lilac and McIntosh Apple . They are both true to smell , the apple literally smells like a bunch of freshly sliced apples . I have not used any other scents , and I do not know that I will as these 2 are perfect.I was really surprised that there were some negative reviews , as I have been using this brand for over a year now and I am always satisfied . I hope this review helps .
 This candle has a great scent , just exactly what I had hoped it would be ! It has a light , clean scent which I just love ! I will definitely buy it again .
 This is a great candle ... burns long and makes the whole room smell delicious !! It brings back holiday times and makes the home smell like fresh cookies
 Beanpod candles are nice . Try them and you will see they have a smooth burn and nice aroma . I tried the automatic shipment program with Amazon.com thinking I could get a different candle fragrance each month , but I could find no way to do this at this time I am writing this . Pricing on Amazon.com is good . I would have paid more in a physical store paying the sales tax than I would buying the candle and paying the shipping charge . I know , I tried and it would have cost over $ 25 in a store for the 25oz size . Yankee Candles I used for about a year , but the Beanpod candle is just better in all aspects and on Amazon.com is much cheaper than buying in a physical store .
 Ordered my candle and had it quicker than I thought ! Love these candles and I will most certainly buy them again !
 this is the BEST candle i 've ever had , my mom and i love it and have bought this scent for several years now . we have a large , open kitchen/family room and when we burn this candle it fills the entire space ! i love it and will continue to purchase this scent . the shipping was fast too !
 After purchasing various types of candles for almost twenty years , I discovered Beanpod candles at a local gift store . Now they are the only candles I will buy . The fragrance is wonderful and they burn better than any other candle I 've ever had . They do n't leave the ugly wax ledges along the inside of the jar . The fragrance I prefer is lavender .
 I first smelled a beanpod candle at my mother 's house a few years ago . It was the cranberry clove scent , and I finally purchased one for myself recently . It is n't a scent I would have chosen based on its name alone because I would have feared that the clove smell would dominate . It does n't at all . I do n't really know how to describe the smell , but it 's a perfect scent for chilly weather . A couple of my favorite Yankee Candle scents are McIntosh and Harvest -LRB- just to give you an idea of my tastes -RRB- . I know some reviewers have had quality issues , but I have n't had any problems
 I usually get my Beanpod Eucalyptus Lavender at a local flower/gift shop , but they do n't carry this scent lately , so I ordered through Amazon via Soy Basics . It turned out to be great . It was the newer style jars and the scent was the same as ever . I 'm back to buy one or two more . I like to burn this scent after dinner , to get the food smells out of the house for bedtime . Burns clean . I 've seen other types of candles leave a film on cabinets or counter tops , these do n't . It is smokey when I blow it out , I just set on the stove top and turn on the vent if I feel like messing with getting the smoke out . So glad I found my brand and fragrance .
 really like this fragrance have used other ones wanted to get aquanity but read one review hadnt burned properly was a different fragrance so ordered 2 am on first one burned ok a slight wax left on side of jar . went tpo order more and had to get preships for same price we paid first time . so we are awaiting our next shipment . we are happy at prices . glad to find your web sight .
 I fell in love with these candles . They are fragrant and long-lasting . I light one in my bedroom and the aroma fills the entire level of my home !!!! Will never burn another candle again .
 It 's the best lubrication I 've ever come across . It does what it says in the name ; it glides across the body . One drop goes a long way .
 This lube has been my favorite for years . It 's pricey , but it lasts a LONG time ! I was able to find it cheaper on Amazon for the biggest size . I normally purchase it from a local store . With these two bottle I purchased , I should be set for easily two years !
 I 've tried lots of lubricants over the years but this stuff is the bomb . It is worth the $ .

 You just ca n't beat Pjur &#34; Original &#34; Bodyglide . I have tried other formulas from Pjur , and many other brands , but I always go back to this one . I 'm done . I will stick with this . It is the best . Both my partner and & I agree .
 ive tried many lubes and would have to say that this lube is the best . the other lubes i tried get sticky after a while and make it uncomfortable to use . this lube stays soft and smooth no matter how long it stays out . the only thing i dont like about it is when you get lube on the outside its pretty slippery to hold , but i guess thats a positive note .
 -LSB- -LSB- ASIN : B0031ESU4A Eros Love Silicone BBodyglide , Latex Condom Safe , 500 ml -RSB- -RSB- This is an excellent product . I originally tried it in a smaller quantity and was impressed with its multiple uses . It is non-staining , tasteless and can be used both for massage oil and as a personal lubricant . Highly recommend !!!
 This was my second Pjur purchase after receiving a free sample early last year . Excellent product , stays slick and does n't `` gum up '' very moisturizing and does n't take a lot . I highly recommend it for use with condoms or without .
 I love this stuff and have been buying it for years . Works like a charm , no sticky feeling , does n't dry out , has a really smooth feel to it .
 Pjur Eros silicone lubricant is the standard by which I judge all others . There is a good reason why it is more expensive than the rest
 This is the best lube we have ever found . And Amazon has the best price on it
 I originally purchased this lubricant for sex but prefer Astroglide or saliva . But I found it is an EXCELLENT massage oil as it does not absorb into the skin and therefore does not require reapplication . I can give an hour massage with one initial application of less than 1/4 ounce . It also mixes well with essential oils such as tea tree or lavender for an instant aromatherapy massage .
 Excellent product ! Very silky smooth . No taste issues , great for all kinds of play . Condom safe .
 There 's not a lot to say , other than `` worth every penny '' . It 's great for everything . You can even use it around the house !
 a slippery silicone based lube . Applies easily , does its job well . Not too messy , use sparingly if you need to . No fragrance , which is a plus.I found the package itself to be way to small , I dont deal in ml mind you . But as far as a lube , its a good one , applies easily and never loses its momentum . the tube is about 2 inches , and not even an inch in diam . I like the size of say Astroglide for a package , and at 9-11 bucks , I think you could probably find something better for your money , but as a lube it gets a 8 .
 Great product for women that creates the real deal feel . Not for men in the bathroom .
 Hate this lube it 's pricey and a nightmare if it gets on any wooden surface or tile or sheet I 'll . B going back to good ole ky jelly `` do n't waste your time or money on this oily watery crap
 Men -- do not let `` HER '' pick the lube , nor make natures monkey grease -- this elixir was made and used in Germany . GERMANY -- cmon , any sexual or seriously lude act you have seen contains germanic tones . Trust the Gerries and buy their silicone lube -- the will be fairy and winding clocks with every drop .
 This is the best personal lubricant on the market.We go through lots of it : -RRB- Both my wife and I enjoy the way it feels .
 I have used this product for many years and find it is the best on the market . It is the most concentrated with the greatest lubricating quality.A great value .
 My girl and I liked it thus far . You do have to be careful not to use too much at one time because of the lasting effects of the product . A little goes along way.if your going to forbidden areas then I suggest using the product -LRB- Silk -RRB- , you can get it at Walgreens it offers a much smoother and slippery effect than this product but clean up is always a must afterwards . We would buy this again it 's nice , but I 'm always on the look out for something better like anyone else does .
 The product arrive when stated , just the way I would expect it to . Good show .
 this is not quite as slippery as astroglide but it does n't get dry and it stays alot more where you put it , and works just as good or better . the one thing w / this is it says you can use a few drops but i find most girls need more than that , theres only i girl i used this w / that was ok w / a few drops . i mean maybe for frontdoor sex you can use a few drops but i never use lube for that , but for backdoor , deff . use some more . and my girl says this is much less messy after we 're done than some of the other big name lubes .
 THE PRODUCT IS VERY GOOD FOR ITS PURPOSE BUT IT WILL STAIN AND IT WILL RUIN YOUR SHEETS . ALSO , IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN . YOUR SKIN WILL BREAK OUT .
 this product is also great for massage too , good for use on older women whoseorfice , s are dried up , comes off the bed sheets in landry . overall a long lasting product for a night of slamming the ham !!
 i 've tried all kinds of lubes and wo n't be trying anything new . this is honestly the best . never sticky . a little hard to wash off but worth it for the slickness it provides .
 I AM A RETURNING CUSTOMER . THE LUBRICANT IS EXCELLENT FOR MASSAGES AND YOU ONLY NEED A SMALL AMOUNT . GREAT VALUE FOR YOUR MONEY !
 Works really well from female standpoint . Have tried a number of other products , and this one is the best . Worth the price .
 In my opinion , this is the best silicone lubricant available . A little goes a long way and lasts and lasts .
 I was tipped off about this product on a site ranking `` best lubes for anal sex . '' I can attest , it works great for all types of sex , and for `` conventional '' -LRB- i.e. vaginal -RRB- sex , I have n't found a lubricant that even comes close . Use with toys , condoms , and especially on skin . Does n't feel sticky , oily , and outlasts all other lubes . Lube stains on material will wash out with pretty much any detergent I 've tried ; but as one other reviewer noted , OxyClean always succeeds when other detergents fail . In summary , truly a great product .
 I suggest that this product be the one and only supplement that should be in EVERY Man 's drawer bag what ever JUST BUY IT !!
 Tried many others . This is more expensive but worth it . A little goes a long way . Slippery without being sticky or oily . Lasts . Cleanup requires a little more soap in the shower .
 After trying at least 7 different types of less expensive and more highly advertised intimate lubes , we came back to Eros Pur . So happy and ` satisfied ' we did ! At 62 , this product is well worth the price and thankfully lasts a long long time .
 I really like this as a skin moisturizer . It only requires a couple of drops to moisturize my legs which tend to be very dry at my age . Although a little pricey it should last a long time since you need such a small quantity .
 I 've tried a number of lubricants , in my lifetime , and nothing 's ever come close to this . My husband and I stumbled across it at one of those adult party demonstrations . It felt amazing to the touch , so we knew we had to try it . We bought the smallest container available , because it was a bit pricey and we were n't sure how it would perform.In short , we 'll never buy anything BUT this . It was worth every penny and it seemed to last forever . A few drops goes a very long way . It has an incredibly smooth and slick texture , that does n't dry up on you . We 've had nine years of experience with this product and we are both completely SATISFIED !
 I also found this to be a good product and also originally found it to stain any fabric it came in contact with . However , when I contacted Pjur Customer Service , they suggested I try OxiClean or a similar formulation . That did in fact get out the stains .
 We are a couple that like to play daily , we have used this product now for several months and will not ever go back to any water based products . The water based product are good for toys but person to person there is nothing like it . No mess and last and last Great for massages the back and all other parts . We found that is has elimated the Yeast outbreaks to zero . We did not know the water based product actually permote yeast . Try it once and you will never go back .
 My husband and I have been using this product for a couple years now and would n't consider going back to anything else . The reason I only give it four stars is because the bottle needs a better cap . The bottle inevitably gets lubricant on the outside .
 Of all the various massage and other use oils my wife and I have tried , this one is amazing . It never seems to dry out , get sticky , feel oily or lose any of its ability to feel slippery . And , unlike us , it does n't stain the sheets .
 This is the best lube on the market . It 's better than every other lube in many ways : No clean upDoes not leave any residue or get `` sticky `` Tasteless and Odorless , allowing you to concentrate on what 's importantVery concentrated - a small amount goes a long wayBest `` feeling '' out of all the lubesExcellent moisturizer , hair moisturizer -LRB- for wet looks -RRB- , and great for massages alsoFeels the most natural out of all the lubes , excellent for all areasOther things : - Very expensive - but WORTH IT - Will stain if left untreated - if you get it on your clothes , drown the area with water , or it will stain later and it 's very hard to get out after that point
 My wife and I stumbled across this gem when we were seeking to spice things up . We 're both pretty sure this resulted in our first child . We 've loved and enjoyed this product so thoroughly that it has become a staple in our bedroom . We have also purchased it as a gift for others . I hope you take the chance to discover the wonders of this lubricant . A little goes a long way , and a 250ml bottle should last at least a few months -LRB- depending on usage -RRB- . We 're turning to Pjur to help us with child # 2 . ; -RRB-
 This is the best lube on the market -- long lasting and does n't get sticky like the glycerin-based lubes . Well worth the price !
 My wife is highly allergic and it has been quite difficult to find something that is ok for us to use . This is the only product that is n't sticky and fits that profile . Worth the higher price ...
 This product is amazing ! My girlfriend an me love it and use it any chance we get . If you ever need a little extra luberication , this is definitely the product for you ! I promise you will not be disappointed .
 it 's the best lube i 've used so far , just a bit expensive and that 's the only thing wrong with it
 Stays very slick . Never gets sticky , easy to clean with soap and water . Retains and transfers body heat very well . Recommended !
 I love this lube oil . I have been using it for about 5 years and I will never use anything else . My wife also loves it !
 It 's great stuff for the intended purpose . Never dries out , very little needed . Because you use so little , it 's actually very inexpensive if you buy it in large containers like this one .
 Pjur Original Bodyglide is probably the smoothest and most comfortable personal lubricant ever in my experience and I am on my second bottle . Pjurfect
 if you need lube , this is the best to use - hands down . lasts forever , does n't get sticky . could n't be happier .
 Simply the best stuff I have ever used ... puts the regular products found at drugstores , etc. , to shame . You wo n't be disappointed with any Pjur product , but this is the original , and for most folks , exactly what they need/want .
 This is the best lube I have ever seen . It work great for a long time . You wo n't be sorry if you buy this lube
 This is by far the best lube ever invented . . it is super concentrated , much , much better than any water soluble lube and can be used for massage without leaving a sticky mess . Dont leave home without it ! Truly one of those rare products that really improve your life . . your significant other will thank you .
 This is the best lube ever , although it 's a bit expensive compared to Gun Oil and other products , the quality is superior . The only thing I do n't like is the screw off cap , why could n't they have done a pop top or a pump to make it easier to avoid messes . ; -RRB-
 This lube is absolutely amazing ! It is silicone based , silky smooth does n't get sticky and lasts forever . I have tried lube after lube , trying to find the one that would be it for the rest of time ... and this is the one .
 Just try to get this to break down . You ca n't . It stays slick forever with the tiniest amount . Highly recommended , much better than the junk from the drug store .
 We tried a great many other brands and formulas , and no other brand compares to Pujr Eros . The Origunal Body Glide , a little thicker , and Woman 's Bodyglide , a little thinner , are without a doubt the class of this slippery business . These two feel wonderful from both sides , and while you might say they are oily , they neither has a tacky feel . The Original formula , which as I mentioned is the heavier of the two , but feels light and very smooth . Very long lasting . Very satisfying for not being the real thing!I really can not say enough good things about these lubes . They work great in all environments , and even wet , as long as used before the water.Yes , this stuff is generally considered expensive , but I can only say I wish that we had not wasted our time on all the many other offerings out there . We found none to come close to the lastng comfort and excellent feel of this the black bottle and white bottle Bodyglide formulas .
 This lube is wonderful . It does exactly what it needs to do . The best quality lube I have ever used . Your skin even feels smooth after using it , instead of slimy and gross like other brands.This lube makes everything feel better.Great !
 It costs more but it 's worth it . Ultra slippery but none of that nasty feeling `` during '' or `` after '' . Areas its used on seem to be in better condition as well . For those that are curious , the taste is rather neutral too so you do n't have to worry about being grossed out by getting it in your mouth . Get the big bottles , they 're worth it . Have fun .
 Best one out there ! love this stuff ! non greasy or sticky , just super slippery ! Once you try it you wo n't use any other product !
 Works great , and is easy to clean up . The smaller bottles unfortunately come with a screw-on top instead of a pump , making them a bit annoying to use .
 My boyfriend and I have been using this product for several years . We do n't even consider any others . It lasts longer and feels better than ID or Wet brands when using for `` back door '' use .
 Ha , I should have made a video review for this ! -LRB- Barf -RRB- Without being too graphic , this stuff works really well . It lasts a long time , feels great , and does n't get messy . Easy clean up too and I swear my skin is healthier then ever now!Also , this bottle is downright novelty sized . This would make a practicle yet borderline gag gift for a bridal shower .
 I love this stuff . I have a lot of issues with water-based lubes . At worst , it immediately burns my skin due to chemical preservatives in it . At best , it dries up too quickly . Wet Naturals makes some good water-based lube , but even that dries too quickly.This stuff feels great , and it lasts . It eventually becomes less slippery and does need reapplication sometimes , but leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth rather than sticky . And it easily lasts two to three times as long as any water-based lube I 've tried .
 When my friend was getting married , I spent hours researching the world 's best condoms and lube etc. -LRB- Best condom
 I have been using this lube for years and I can not use anything else . It feels so natural and pleasent , it lasts forever during intercourse . Best part is a small drop goes along way , this lube is seriously revolutionary ! Do not look at the price or any bad reviews , this stuff is just simply amazing !
 I wo n't get too explicit , but we love this stuff , wish we would have discovered it 10 years earlier!I would highly recommend !
 Goes on smooth lasts and absorbs what more can you ask for ? Gives a superior slide and pleasant glide . Thanks
 Better at helping you ease into what you want to do without being sticky and makes your experience that much more !
 I like this stuff . It gets messy , but I knew that . It slides well . My only complaints are that bottle breaks easily , the cap specifically . You will drop it at some point . If you 're telling yourself you wo n't ; ThenA . You 're doing it wrong . -LRB- Heat of the moment spills -RRB- B. You 're a liar.It 's slippery when wet !!! Wish my girlfriend liked it too . Maximus ai n't too bad though .
 The last bottle of lubricant you will ever need . Only a few drops and let the fun begin . It seems like it never dries out . I will never bother with sticky clean ups after the fun is over . Makes you want to go back for seconds ! And thirds !
 This stuff is nothing short of amazing . It is slick when you put it on and it stays slick for a long time .
 This lube is fantastic !! We have tried a number of lubes over the years but this one is exceptional . It 's is super slick . You do n't need very much . It does n't get sticky or tacky and it does n't dry out . It 's great for anal sex and is a must when masterbating ! The price on here is also great . Previously I was paying upward of 60 dollars ! Then I found it online for 45 . Now I 've found it on Amazon and it 's under 30 ! You ca n't beat this stuff ! Try it , you 'll LOVE it .
 I have been on a quest to find the best lube I 've tried Wet , Wet light , Wet platnium , Gun oil , swiss navy , Liquid silk , Astroglide , ID Millenium , to name a few . None of them hold a candle to Pjur bodyglide . It works better , last longer and gives superior lubrication for a consideraly longer period without reapplication . very little goes a very long way . Cleans up with soap and water . I highly recommend this product .
 Pjur is always the go-to lube for me and my partner . It 's never sticky , lasts a long time but is easily absorbed . It has no aroma and actually moisturizes , so it does n't even need to be washed off . The only downside is that the bottle does n't have a flip top -- tough to put the cap back on when one hand is holding liquid lube . Pjur beats anything available in a brick-and-mortar store . Well worth the price and easy to order from Amazon , of course . Ca n't recommend this stuff highly enough .
 This lube is really top quality . I saw a recommendation for it in a men 's magazine , so we decided to give it a try . It lasts a very long time . There is a slight flavor to it even though it touts itself as being no flavor and no smell . It never gets sticky or goopy . Holds up to the job .
 This stuff is amazing . It takes forever to dry up , and it does n't feel oily or sticky or anything like that . The price is very resonable for the quality . I highly recommend this .
 The best part about silicon based lubrication is that they do n't get sticky and wo n't wash off even underwater . Try it in the hot tub and you 'll see why I gave it 5 stars .
 The price may seem expensive , but this is a high quality product and is worth the money . The bottle is about 7 and 1/4 inches tall . It has a screw-on cap . The bottle is soft and one just has to lightly squeeze the bottle to pour the lubricant . One only needs to use a small amount , but I found that I did need to use more after a short while . The lubricant has high-quality feel . It feels closer to natural vaginal lubrication . It is very smooth and silky . It does not have a smell or taste . I highly recommend this product . You and your partner wo n't regret how much it will help you in the bedroom . It makes everything better .
 I 've been hesitant to write a review for this product as my reviews are published under my real name . While reviewing my purchases , however , I realized this is one of my regular ones and it 's a product I really , really love ! I 'm an adult woman , so why should I feel shy to admit I have sex and use products to make it better?Hallelujah for turning 40 and beginning to realize there is no reason to be embarrassed.I 've tried a lot of lube . This is , by far , the best . It does n't get sticky or dry up too quickly and it actually makes your skin uber soft after use -LRB- I 'll leave what skin up to your imagination -RRB- . The only caveat is that because it is silicone based you can not use it with any items made of silicone . Settle for KY on silicone toys , but go for Pjur Eros for everything else .
 I 've tried every lubricant on the market , and depending on your length of session or what your sexual proclivities are , if you are concerned about the lubricant getting tacky and ineffective , requiring more and more application , then this is the product for you.Its longevity is such that your female partner will feel it until a thorough wipe-down / shower is performed.As mentioned below , it will stain your sheets , but as also mentioned below , if you wash your sheets on a regular basis and use some Oxy , it comes right out -LRB- no pun intended -RRB- . *****
 I have used this product for years . I personally enjoy having a few quality lubricants available to me at any given time . Eros Original is always the ONE that I never rotate in my search for the best lubes . Enjoy
 Remember the song lyric `` Down on your heels , up on your toes ... ? '' That 's not only part of a dance step but it 's a great way to apply this ultra soothing , smoothing foot cream . It does n't take much at all and feels wonderful to rub this rich cream around and under heels then up through the soles and toes.Lanolin . Vitamin E , Sunflower Oil , Paraffin , and Glycerin are all part of the mix that changes rough underpinnings to soft , silky , prettier feet . I 've tried everything from baby oil to a variety of body butters , and nothing does the trick like this cream .
 Life saver ! Wonderful for keeping Left leg straight ! No need to bend your knee , keeps leg straight and pain free !
 As a diabetic , I need sugar-free products . All other cough drops seem to contain Isomalt . Isomalt -LRB- and sometimes Malitol -RRB- can create huge , very painful -LRB- and embarassing -RRB- amounts of intestinal gas in people sensitive to Isomalt or Malitol . GoLightly does not use either Isomalt or Malitol . I have used these cough drops for years . A case might sound like a lot , but they are in 30 individual bags . And they go quick - especially when co-workers stop by , to `` borrow '' a cough drop or two .
 Visit to the dentist . Dentist say , `` You have several thousand dollars of tooth repair ! '' I know why . Mama loves sugar in all forms ! She can consume sugars each and every hour she is awake ! Been doing it for years . I use to buy her candy in bulk-20 ,30 Pounds of her favorite morsels-and she would distribute the candy in different bowls everywhere in the house
 I really like these drops . It 's like hard candy but without the sugar . A great product for getting you through the work day .
 I find these drops very soothing . However , case price no longer available , being sold by each .
 I received one of these to use during my hospital stay after a cesarean section . Previously I used store bought bottle of a similar type for washing , but they were n't designed to be lavettes and are not nearly as nice to use as Medlines.I was thrilled to find that I could order a box of 50 online since hard water causes mineral deposits to build up in the bottles.What a deal !
 Quality is good . Cap is good and tight . I have had no issues leaking even when traveling with them in suitcases . I really only wanted about 10 of these bottles . Hospital gave me one after the birth of my boys and I found it very useful for the solution for cloth wipes/cloth diapering among other things . At the cost of each bottle it seem to make more sense to buy the bulk package and I 'm glad I did . They were smaller than the one I got from the hospital but they have a million and one uses and since there were so many in the package I could give them out to everyone too . lol
 Thanks for your fast service . . I will let people know how fast and great service you have . I have been looking for this size for a long time ... Thanks again . .
 My mother -LRB- in her 80 's -RRB- had been looking for a replacement for the one she had used for years . The price was so good I got enough for her and several others ! ; -RRB-
 I like this buffered vitamin C crystans very much , easy on the stomach , easy to take with liquids . I found the order and delivery went well .
 The product arrived ahead to the expected date , packaging was adequate for this type of product . The installation was straight forward and worked well for my wife by keeping the leg less than 90 degrees . Expensive but useful and necessary .
 I purchased this at Kmart for a really low price . Best buy ever . It gives a close shave , lasted a 5 years without needing to replace the blades and I still am using it today .
 Terrific little machine . For me this older razor works much better than the newer rotary jobs and the cost of this whole refurbished model was less than just the screen/blades alone . My only problem is that I 'm afraid I wo n't be able to find this kind of deal in the future if I should need another .
 Come on , folks ... the instructions regarding battery charging/recharging are just as bad as their predecessor , in my case , Braun . In both cases , we 're talking about a rechargeable Ni-Cad battery , a type which as a bad memory effect . Both tell me to recharge frequently , before they go down . So in either case , the memory effect will take the battery down QUICK . On my Brauns , I kept two and ran them until they were completely down , the recharged while shaving with the other one . Was getting about five days out of each . Now this Remington says to leave it charging all the time , only running it down every six months . But ... I need to know how many days it will shave before running it down . Then they want me to recharge it for 24 hours.However , it costs so much less that I could replace it every six months and come out ahead . I guess time will tell , and I 'll update this when I know how it shaves , and for how long , on a charge.Update 1/13
 This Shaver is the most recent of several various types that i have purchased over the years . I could not be more pleased with it . The cost is quite cheap while the functionality is good .
 I used to have a shaver like this one but I was never able to find another until I located some on the internet . The shaver has always been excellant with the exception of it being a little louder and heavier , but I think its because of the larger battery and motor . The price is excellant for a first time shaver and they always last a long time . Being a popular shaver the replacement blades and screen are very reasonable compared to other shavers . I 've tried many other shavers while looking for this one and 90 % of them couldnt match up unless they were $ 100.00 and up . I give Remengton an A + + + + for quality and performance for the price.Great procuct Remington >> >>
 My Remington Microscreen DA 307 ran out of juice after working perfectly for about 15 years . I looked at buying a new electric razor , and they all looked foreign , possibly cheaply made , and expensive . I bought the reconditioned shaver advertised here and I love it . It came yesterday , and man , I took it out for a run and it was excellent . HOWEVER , after purchasing it , I found out that at ShaversOutlet.com you can buy the lower part of the shaver for $ 9.99 . I bought one , attached my old head , and now I have two excellent shavers . Yay me . BTW
 I have had this electric shaver for 4 years now and bought this one for the blades but intended to keep the body for a spare in case it does play out . This is the best electric shaver I have ever owned .
 This is an excellent shaver by Remington ! It does an excellent job - smooth , close and does not irritate my skin . This is one of the best shavers I have ever had .
 However , since my old razor is the same the cap fits . The razor is like new . Charges and holds a charge well . The blades are sharp and shave close . great deal for the price if your face prefers a foil shaver
 I bought this razor a a replacement for my old reliable Remington DA-407 , which lasted about 15 years . Unfortunately the DA-407 is no longer available , but the DA-307 is almost as good , it just is n't recommended to be used as a corded model -LRB- the DA-407 could be used either corded or cordless -RRB- . The DA-307 is inexpensive and shaves close . I was so satisfied that I bought a second one as a spare .
 BAM BAM 's review was trashing Amazon , but it was supposed to be a review of the ITEM -LRB- the batteries -RRB- , not Amazon.The batteries are great . Buying them online saves half the cost of in-store purchasing . I 'm not sure if they actually last 2x as long ... it would be hard to ever tell that , but I took them on a 4 day fishing trip , and shot about 188 pictures and 4 different videos totaling about 15 min together , and the batteries never showed any signs of running low - my ` low bat . ' light never came on . Granted , 99 % of those pictures were in daylight , with flash not being used , but my LCD screen is always on . That 's a lot of pictures from a $ 2 set of batteries.Oxyride is the new standard I believe . Excellent .
 After countless bouts with the dentist -LRB- not myself but an important member of my tribe -RRB- I have come to fear the effects of sugar in the human body , specially in the mouth . Teeth decay at an alarming rate when proper hygiene is not maintained and for those type of people that like a candy more than toothpaste , well , the results end up being disastrous . Enter GoLightly Sugar-Free Cough Suppressant , Honey Lemon , 30-Count -LRB- Pack of 24 -RRB- . Maybe a bit expensive but for what they do and the fact that they are sugar free I wholeheartedly endorse this product . This one person in my flock has an addiction to candy to the point of no return , would even go to bed with a couple of pieces already in the mouth and consequently wake up coughing something fierce . Claimed that she needed cough suppressants to be able to exist . I concluded this statement was not necessarily accurate because I seen her get along , happy as a clam in a choppy sea , with a bag of regular candy and no signs of the famous cough . Anywhoo , since It was up to me I decided to cut drastically her consumption of real sugar . A very good dentist once said to me
 The reason I purchase this was the `` SPLENDA '' , which I have been looking for . We enjoy them and will certainly purchase them again .
 A great value for the price -LRB- I buy by the case -RRB- . In winter and cold season , when I 'm around people with coughs and colds , I constantly keep one of these cough suppressants in my mouth to coat my throat and by doing so do n't allow the germs to take hold . They taste good and they 're sugar-free . They work !
 I have the privilege of being a senior citizen , I earned that right one day at a time over a period of many years ; contrary to what some young people believe , I have zero interest in being young again ; I 've already been there , done that , and got the T-shirt ! Being a senior citizen offers both advantages and disadvantages ; one of the disadvantages is the reduced production of gastric hydrochloric acid , which compromises the breakdown of complex carbohydrates , fats , and proteins . In addition there is the problem of reduced function in other digestive organs resulting in less effective absorption of vital nutrients.We need not despair as there is a wide array of supplements available that can help alleviate this problem ; one of these is the Solaray HCL with Pepsin being reviewed here . The way I use the Solaray is in conjunction with Twinlab Super Enzyme Caps ; what I 've discovered works best for me is a combination of the two products taking one of each with every meal . This combination does the job for me and also saves money!We all have different requirements and you may need to experiment with combinations to see what works best for you ; the good news is you have many options that can help you deal with digestive challenges . A little experimentation should provide a workable solution .
 I really like this digestive aid . I take three capsules before a meal and man does it make the difference . I do n't know if this product is right for you but for me it 's a blessing . Now , after using this product , my stomach does n't hurt after I eat . I know that this review is subjective but , again , this product works for me .
 I 've been taking these supplements for the past five years at the recommendation of a naturopath after I was losing weight and not being able to digest any amount of fat , and not much carbs , proteins or dairy either . After five days on this , essential enzymes , and cutting out gluten , I gained 5 much needed pounds in a week . I take these supplements with every meal , and if I run out or forget , my stomach pays the price with severe indigestion . My mom tried the supplements too , for similar issues , but they do n't work for her . Definitely worth trying out to see if they work for you like they have for me .
 I was having problems absorbing B12 and my red blood cells were too large as a result . Weekly B12 shots did not help . I started taking this product because my doctor thought I may have low stomach acid . Two weeks later my blood work already showed improvement in my red blood cells ! The hardest part is remembering to take it with every meal .
 this is great no more ogeda , no more heartburn , no more reflux . i started with just 2 pills and depending on what i eat i take more .
 I Love it , work great , everyone should be this product . I will continue to buy until I have no more stomach problems .
 This product arrived quickly in perfect packaging . I believe it is a great product for digestive support . I certainly recommend it to anyone who cares about his/her haelth , and I recommend this company !
 Summer sandal season is hard on my feet and they seem to get callused so easily . I have been using pumice stones to keep them looking nice . When I saw this screen with a handle and read the great reviews I wanted to give it a try . Now I am hooked , it works really well . The handle is nice and thick and sturdy so you can apply pressure to your feet without it bending and the screen works the calluses down easily . This set comes with replacement screens and cream . The cream is fairly greasy so you will want to put on socks after applying but by morning it leaves your skin nice and soft .
 I just bought this product this morning at my local beauty supply store , based on the recommendation of the store clerk . I have horrible calluses on my feet that crack and have n't found anything that works really well -LRB- unless I soak my feet for awhile first to soften them up -RRB- . I just used this tool and it works amazingly well . I also paid $ 18.00 for it -LRB- it has a few replacement screens -RRB- , so I was surprised to find it here for much less .
 Easy to use , easy to clean , not rough like other callus removers . Very Effective ! I do road runs and my feet always get rough/hard points on certain areas . This product leaves the bottom of my feet smooth and soft .
 seems to do the job . My feet are n't in bad shape , but something comes up , tis will quickly smooth it out without discomfort . Have n't tried the foot cream it comes with .
 I love this product ! I wish I found this before I purchase a battery operated one . Its simple and easy to use and I also like the small jar of foot cream that it came with . I will be buying the bigger size of that .
 something about a `` refurbished '' shaver kinda spooks me ... i mean ... what if someone used it in private areas ... but it does seem like a good shaver from reviews elsewhere .
 I have been using Sof ` feet on my feet for over 5 years . They are always crack and callus free and smooth to the touch . With cream each morning and night , they are always sandle ready and touchable .
 Being relocated to Georgia from the Midwest I am surprised to find there are certain products that I can not find here . This is one of them and I will NOT settle for any other brand . THANK YOU AMAZON ! I can still get my Sparkle . Glass and mirrors always streak free first time .
 I f you are not from the Chicago area , you might pass this off as ` just another brand . &#34; I 've been using this product since the 1960 's , and can attest to it 's greatness.It will leave absolutely ZERO streaks , as long as you finish very LIGHTLY with a paper towel , or if you prefer not to use paper towels , a window squeegee . it is ammonia free . It will not take off the lettering , or turn any of your black audio / video equipment a permanently ruined whitish hue . Super safe on TV 's . It is very strong when attacking really hard , set in stains , or the gummy gunky residue left from the factory tags on new windows.Once you try this product , you will laugh at all the times you thought Windex was the best.Windex is not even in the same class as Sparkle . Nor is anything else .
 My friends likes these wash cloths for their twins but they are tiny and I imagine will need frequent washing .
 Female condomsThis is an item that does not get the attention it deserves . While most adults are familiar with male condoms , female condoms are virtually unknown . That is sad , because they are a really good idea . The female condom is a larger verson of the male condom , designed to be inserted into the vagina , and have the male penetrate in the usual fashion . There is a semi-solid but flexible ring at the closed -LRB- internal -RRB- end that helps keep the female condom in place during sex.As a male , I do n't particularly like male condoms . I realize they are good for safe sex , okay but not great for birth control , inexpensive , and widely available . However , they do have some serious limitations . First and foremost , they are not very comfortable . It has been pointed out , accurately IMHO , that male condoms can even be troublesome for men built larger than average , and that includes the larger condoms . They can be quite uncomfortable , interfere with an erection , and be difficult to put on.Second , they do interfere with sexual pleasure . The male organ , unlike its female counterpart , is far more sensitive to stimulation by friction than by warmth , pressure , or vibration . Male condoms seriously decrease stimulation by friction -LRB- which can be great if you need that -RRB- . The old saw about `` showering in a raincoat '' is not far wrong.The female condom solves both these problems . They are far more comfortable , especially for the `` bigger '' man , and they allow the male to experience the frictional stimulation that works best for him . They also allow the female to have control over the use of the condom , preserve the primary mechanics of stimulation for her as well , and can be far more fun to insert than a male condom is to put on.This particular brand is also latex-free , which is no small matter to many people . It is far less likely to cause irritation and can be used with a wider variety of lubricants . They might also be easier for a woman to use since she wears it herself , and does n't have to convince a man to use a condom.It is noisier than a male latex condom -LRB- cheap sandwich bags will give you a good approximation -RRB- , but who said sex is supposed to be quiet ? Quiet is for libraries and funerals
 After taking this for about a year , I have not had one symptom of stomach pain or nausea . It is wonderful , and I would recommend to anyone who has troubles taking the more common brand vitamins . Give it a try !
 If you are looking for an affordable whole food multivitamin that is gluten free , look no more . They have everything I need and are reasonably priced .
 I 'm a fan of MegaFood because I only take vegan vitamins that are food based -LRB- if they are n't food based I will feel sick -RRB- . I 've taken them every morning for the last 6 months or so and they 've got me feeling pretty good .
 I feel overall healthier , stronger and have more energy when I take these . Other vitamins have caused me to burp up pill tastes all day , I have never had any form of burp-up or stomach upset from these !
 I gave this a try and bought the 30-day capsules . Needless to say , I purchased again the next month ! In addition to getting my daily nutrients , I know that this also supplements my meals if I do n't get enough fruits and veggies throughout the day . I also like know what exactly is in my tablets . A permanent addition to my vitamins & supplements rack .
 I 've been taking the Megafood Women 's supplement for several months now and have been pleased . I never took a vitamin until I was an adult and had a very unpleasant experience with a mega-store brand -LRB- I had no idea that nausea was a side effect of vitamins at that point -RRB- . After doing a great deal of research , I decided on these . Their claims are perfectly true . I have never had a single bad side effect from these , and I 've taken them at different times during the day . Although it 's hard to judge whether vitamins are &#34; working , &#34; I do feel that they 're having a good result.My one major complaint is that these vitamins taste bad . If you do n't get them down very quickly , they 'll leave a pretty rough flavor behind , and , even if you do swallow them instantly , they still put a bad taste on your tongue . I will say , however , that the flavor is not long-lasting . With some bad-tasting supplements , you hear about people &#34; burping them &#34; for hours . That 's not the case here .
 These vitamins are very good.MOST important thing I wanted to mention is there is NO !!! vitamin aftertaste after taking them . Along with being very complete vitamins that are cost effective . I have taken them two days in a row , on an empty stomache with NO stomach ache , or aftertaste ... WONDERFUL ! : - -RRB-
 These have definitely been helping to balance my hormones
 I was at my healthiest while taking these vitamins some time ago before I stopped , so I started taking them again after having neglected my health a bit and they have helped my energy a lot . They are easy to swallow .
 these vitamins are so great ! I got them mainly becuase you can take them on an empty stomach and still feel great !
 Excellent multivitamin and I have definitely felt some improvement in myenergy and mood levels since taking these supplements.Only issue I have with them is that they smell like a bouillon cube andtaste about the same , so it makes them a little difficult to get down .
 I 've been taking these for a few months now and I 'll tell you I feel so good . My nails and hair are really growing fast . I have more energy through out the day and feel less sluggish . I really feel like my bodies absorbing these vitamins because I can feel a difference from when I was taking the Vitamin Shoppe brand before . Excellent product !
 I was taking these vitamins for 6 weeks and felt so great -- got off my caffeine `` addiction '' with no headaches , just by starting these vitamins ! I wish I had taken them back in the Fall before the rough winter -- they gave me so much energy ! Why I say `` was '' is because now I have to take Prenatal vitamins -- which I 'm really happy that MegaFood also has a Prenatal vitamin to take ! I never get constipated or stomach problems with these -- and I definitely have more energy since taking these .
 These vitamins made me feel like a new person . After struggling with the ill-effects of taking `` normal '' multivitamins on an empty stomach -LRB- almost instant nausea and vomiting -RRB- and questioning how much good they were really doing , it was recommended that I try a whole food vitamin . I balked at the price , but decided that if they helped with my fatigue , poor skin and hair , it would be worth it . I noticed a difference after a week . My energy level picked up , I could take them on an empty stomach with no nausea , and I stopped getting cravings that previously resulted in poor eating choices . Within a month , I noticed a difference in my skin , nails and hair . I recommended these to my mother-in-law , who had a similar experience , and now also uses the Un-Stress formula when she feels the need . We both swear by Megafood vitamins !
 I have been taking these vitamins for almost 5 years now and love them . Like other reviewers have mentioned , I have a hard time finding a multivitamin that does n't make me sick to my stomach and I never have that problem with this one . I try to eat healthy , but this provides extra insurance . Highly recommended .
 I have tried many brands , with and without iron , and they all made me nauseous ! This is the only multivitamin with iron that does not upset my stomach . Great product ! Great value for the excellent quality !
 I 've done a lot of searching for a multivitamin that does n't make me nauseous and almost throw up soon after I take it . This one is AMAZING . No nausea/upset stomach , even when taken on an empty stomach . Plus all the vitamins and minerals from whole foods ? Yes , please ! I ca n't say enough good things about this brand and product .
 I am so glad I came across these Vitamins ! The only downside to them is the high price . If the jar were larger id have no problem paying that much.I highly recommend whole food vitamins and I like that these contain chaste berry and some other herbs for womans health . I can take these on an empty stomach and its just fine .
 I always had problems with multivitamins affecting my stomach and making me sick . I started this formula about 6 years ago and still love them . They give me energy and make me feel awesome and I when I do n't take them i really notice a difference . Everything in them is organic and they actually go through a cold fusion process as opposed to other methods of traditional vitamin making . ALl of the ingredients are frozen while the vitamin is made to ensure we receive as much of the nutritional value as possible . Other brands will typically heat the ingredients during the process and some nutrients are lost . I 'm a fan and believe me I am super picky so enjoy !!
 I really like these whole-food vitamins . They are easy to swallow . They come in a clear amber , glass jar . They are not stinky when you open the jar . They do n't give me stinky breath or leave a weird taste in my mouth . I have taken one on an empty stomach -LRB- before breakfast -RRB- with no bad effects . The recommended dosage is one per day which is great because I would probably forget if I had to stagger these throughout the day . I like these vitamins and they have everything I want in a vitamin - especially that they are made from whole foods and not from lab created synthetics . I recommend these vitamins .
 The price on Amazon is way cheaper than at the local health food store . It is also apparently made from whole foods , and alot of the ingredients -LRB- if they are what they say they are -RRB- are higher quality than a typical woman 's daily . It does not upset the stomach , and you do n't need to take it with food . Regular vitamins have made me queasy , but I take these on an empty stomach .
 I have used the Natural Factors-Celedrin Joint Health Softgels before and the give a great relief from arthritis . I 'd recommend them to anyone who has arthritis . The work great for me ... Karen of Minneosta
 We have used this Celadrin product for quite some time and do notice a difference when we run out . We use it to ease disc , knee and arthritis problems . We find many Natural Factors products to be effective and since it 's made in Canada , with their much higher nutritional manufacturing standards , we feel safer using it . We like the softgel form and find it easy to swallow . We will continue to use this Celadrin product .
 The celadrin combined with borage oil keeps the pain and swelling of my arthritis at bay . If I miss a couple days it starts back so I know the stuff works . So glad not to be in pain any more .
 Ben-Gay , Icy Hot , blah blah ... These products are mild dilutions compared to Tiger Balm . I tiny smear goes a long way . I have used it in the past for all types of muscle aches . Most recently I have been recovering from a ruptured patellar tendon repair and fractured ankle . Walking was horrendous and the physical therapy was making this 6 ' 1 '' 40 year old man cry like a baby . I started rubbing a little Tiger around the kneecap and ankle before any strenuous activity and the pain has gone down from a 6 + to a 1 . A 1.7 oz tin will last in my house of 4 for close to a year . I even put a dab under my nose when I 'm congested .
 This stuff is a little smelly but it works . I use it pretty often on my shoulders and back . I would recommend it with no doubt .
 Extremely difficult to open tin.Bought 2 - friend could not open either . Had to get a man to work on them with tools -LRB- hammer and screwdriver -RRB- Prince Of Peace - Tiger Balm Ultra , 1.7 oz creamand finally got them open .
 I like the smell of Tiger Balm . It makes my aches and pains feel less painful . its really good stuff to use .
 Slightly louder than some , intense clit stimulator -LRB- had to snip the inner feeler with snips -RRB- so much so beads are almost unfelt after started . Having spent 100 's in past on variable electronic speeds . This simple slide adjustment is great after all it always on high anyway . For a battery powered it 's a must buy and a recommend to all the people we know ! Not water proof but easy to clean with wipes .
 This vibrator lasted me about five years ; I have n't had many , so I do n't know if this is on the long end of life-expectancy for these things , but I considered it to be a steadfast product . And it drove me crazy . In a good way . The rotating shaft broke after a couple of years , but the clitoral stimulator , which lasted till the end , hit me in that amazing , specific way that I simply can not communicate to a partner and not because I do n't know how to express myself . It cut my orgasm time by 75 % , hence great for quickies or when I 'm having trouble with a partner .
 and I have used many . The fish tail is much effective for me than the rabbit ears . It is worth a try .
 I never really thought much one way or the other about tweezers , but after hearing good things about Tweezerman , I thought I 'd splurge . They work so well ! They effortlessly pick up hairs you can barely see , and since it grasps the hairs well , it does n't hurt as much as cheaper tweezers .
 These are the best tweezers I have ever owned . They grasp the tiniest of hairs . Just make sure that you position the slant head correctly over the hair and you will never miss . If the angle of the head is slightly off , the hair might slip out of the tweezers ' grasp or cut the hair . I am very happy with this product .
 I was a little hesitant in taking this herb because of the black cohosh but I took it at the dose on the bottle starting 5 weeks before my due date . I also started using EPO on the cervix at 37 weeks and switched to borage oil at 38 weeks . I also drank RRL tea starting at 36 weeks . I had my son at 38 weeks and 5 days . I had been feeling `` pre-labor '' contractions for about two days prior to actually going into labor . I woke up at 130am with regular , somewhat painful contractions about 5 min apart . We got to the hospital at 3am and I was 5cm . -LRB- I was 2-3 cm at 38 week appt . -RRB- I had a spinal at 5am when I was 7cm . I had another spinal at 730am at 8cm . My son was born at 9am after only 1/2 hour pushing , 7lbs 2oz . The baby was 100 % healthy and I felt really great almost immediately . I had almost no swelling or pain in the peri area although I did need 2 stitches . I left the hospital 25 hours later . -LRB- I would have felt good to leave the same day but needed to stay for the circumcision and some other baby tests . -RRB- Just as a comparison with my first delivery I did not use 5-w but I used EPO on the cervix at 37 weeks . I was 2 cm at my 37 week appt . My water broke at 37 weeks 4 days at 2am . By 5pm I had to be induced with pitocin because contractions had not started on their own . By 3cm I needed pain relief . I got a spinal/epidural combo . At 8am the next morning I was 10 cm . I pushed for 1 hour 45min and it was extremely painful and difficult . I did need some supplementary oxygen while pushing . Baby was born healthy with a very cone shaped head , 6lbs 15oz . I do n't know exactly how much the 5w affected the birth or if it would have gone that well otherwise , but I was so pleased with the whole experience I will definately be using it next time .
 I took this with my first pregnancy and by the time I was in labor , my cervix was already 4cm dilated . I had a relatively short labor , but two of my other friends who also used this product , starting at 34 weeks , also had advanced thinning and dilation , so I think this product is a must have . If nothing else , it helps keep healthy circulation and it certainly does n't hurt !
 I have taken this herbal supplement for my past two pregnancies and have had both of my children on their due dates ! I am trying it again for my third pregnancy in a few weeks , hope to get the same results . Overall , the herbs can only help you during the last few weeks of pregnancy , not hinder .
 I started taking these at 36 weeks and went into labor pretty quickly . My midwife recommended them . Will use them for next pregnancy .
 My wife has taken this for two pregnancies now . She has noticed a measurable improvement in her labours . It seems to do an excellent job preparing her body for labour and also made her labour more productive allwoing it to progress at a quicker rate .
 I have taken this herbal supplement for all four of my pregnancies . I continued to exercise during all four and never put on more than 35-40 pounds by delivery . My first delivery was 3 and 1/2 hours labor with 3 pushes and he was born . Second delivery was 2 hours labor with 5 minutes pushing . Third delivery was 2 hours , 5 minutes pushing , and 4th was similar . I ca n't say what my deliveries might have been like had I not taken the 5W , I never wanted to find out . My dosage was different than the suggested on the label . I started taking 1 a day during the 5th week out from my due date . 2 a day for the 4th week . 3 a day for the 3rd week , etc , till I was taking 5 a day the week of my due date . I suggest this supplement for all women I talk to for an easier delivery , easier recovery , and your milk ready to go for breastfeeding . -LRB- My two sisters ' labor/deliveries were not this fast or easy by a mile -RRB- .
 The product arrived very quick and in great packaging . Thank you ! Just started using the product and I 'm loving it so far . I was very happy to find it on amazon !
 This thing does what it says it does , has three cutting attachments to hit any angle you need , and nearly zero instructions to confuse the heck out of you . Very , very straightforward and easy to use product . If you are looking to spend very little money for very good value , this is a product worth your time and cash .
 I used a Sharper Image Trimmer prior to the Remington HPNE-3000 and find the latter to be far superior . It is very ergonomic in size and shape and does a better job and the various heads add to its versatility .
 The HPNE-3000 is a good value . It runs on one AA battery and is very versatile with its three different heads . Feels solid and looks classy . I am glad that I purchased this product .
 this is a nice little trimmer with a good amount of power , does the neck and ear and nose area really easily so if you need one this would be the one to get !
 I have had this for a couple of months so far and no real problems . Just wish the head had a latch , or attached more securely . Luckily has n't come off while I am taking out those nose hairs . But I am satisfied with it . Comes with two other head extensions , one for sideburns and the other I think for ear ? Butt hair ? Have n't used it . For nose works great . Nose hairs -LRB- along with nails -RRB- , drives me crazy when not trimmed and this works great , Easy and fast .
 Works well and does what it says it will do -LRB- so far , so good -- I have not had this product for very long -RRB- .
 This thing does what it 's intended to do . It 's Reliable , and effective for all your grooming needs . I Highly recommend !
 This is the best choice for a gamer . Good price , great performance , huge overclocking potential .
 Just like the previous review , the foot bath salt worked but have not purchased any more of these products . It does relax you feet .
 The name MASADA is known for All Natural Original Real Life High Quality Products that work very well . This is one of their very BEST . It is a Foot Bath Treatment that will renew , re-energize , relax your feet like nothing else . It is nothing short of Amazing . It works on corns and will smooth out all the rough places , and works so well on muscles you will feel Heavenly ! Use a cloth to work it into your calves and knees for a super leg treatment . I believe it is perfectly safe for a tub soak . This product delivers on every count - it is just Fantastic !
 Natural Peppermint Foot BathThis product was great . It really sooths your feet . Plus it smells great .
 bought as part of Xmas gift for wife . She likes it . Seller shipped quickly too .
 I have problems with severe anemia . While I took this product , I got my iron levels up and got fairly healthy . Unfortunately , it is not always easy to find Desi-Cates . When I stopped taking it my iron levels slipped significantly . Presently , I am working to get them back within a normal range . To help this process , I just located Desi-Cates at another source online . Given my past experience I know that works very well when taken regularly . I highly recommend it !
 Flexiport is great technology . I 'm thinking of buying more cuffs in different sizes . The cuff is very different from the traditional nylon cuff with bladder . Better , in my opinion .
 I used the very excelent Sea Foam motor treatment to clean the carbs on a very rough sounding motorcycle after being stored for the winter . Biased on my success with that product I decided to give this penetrating fluid product a try . In the past I have used many types of fluids that claim to help break up rust and grime that keep bolts from coming lose . Most are junk for a number of reasons but Deep Creep seems to work.Deep Creed claims to be paint safe , working around cars this can be very important . I tested this and those claims seem to be true -LRB- be sure to test for yourself before going crazy -RRB- . Next up is that the product foams and seems to stay mostly where you spray it . Light fluid sprays like WD40 just seem to run but Deep Creep clings much better for a few seconds until the foam slowly turns to liquid . I would say the foaming is much like the old Break Free products . So for a large area Deep Creep would not be my first choice but for stubborn bolts and such it works perfectly.My first test of this product was some stubborn bolt/screw combo heads used to hold a license plate on the back of my wife 's car , your standard SUV that has been covered in salt and grime for years without ever removing the plates . The bolts were of course cheep and started to strip as soon as they saw a screwdriver . More then that , getting behind the bolts would be hard because they had a wide head and the way the plate rested inset into a decorative bracket directly against the SUV . Basically the rusted bolts were half striped , hard to reach , and right next to surfaces I did n't want to damage . A quick squirt of this product with 5 mins of waiting and the bolts came right out , no problem . The foam quality really helped get behind the bolt and license plate to reach the body panel insert where the bolt connected.This is the best thing I have ever used to tackle rusted bolts and worth giving a try .
 I cleaned out the rear end of my truck and needed to really get it clean and the guys told me of the automotive store that this stuff really works and it does but boy does it smell and talk about chemicals WOW but of course use common sense use it outside and do not wallow in it use it and get it done because man this stuff is worse than methylene chloride .
 Product is great for boat , regular seafoam to pour in tank to keep gas fresh . Deep creep is great for fogging motors for storage . Pull plugs spray some through holes , advance the throttle to open butterflys spray some through . Now pull landyard switch to deactivate electrical in motor and turn fly wheel clockwise either by hand or hit starter . Failing to do this can ruin rectifier + cdi and other parts so if in doubt ground out each plug to block . Put plugs back in and should be ready for next season . Also you can drain carbs of gas , spray product through needles you remove and or floats . Now your rings and pistons are protected and might even loosen up any carbon buildup .
 My vehicle was running very badly due to water in the gas , I think . I went to the parts store and asked for the best fuel treatment . He recommended SEA FOAM . It is NOT cheap , but it sure made my vehicle run better -- so I ordered a case through an Amazon partner . I do not plan to run out any time soon .
 This is what I was looking for . It cuts close and gives smooth shave . Very satisfied with the Remington . Surely , buy again in future .
 had a norelco before , but it died . this one worx just fine . close shave no nicks . good tool.den
 i like this shaver because of the price , if it breaks i just throw it away . nice savings and got to love free shipping
 I am very please with this Heavy Duty Commode . I brought it for a friend and he is a very large man and he likes it alot .
 I have tried every ice pack on the market ! The ace ones are great , but every single one leak ! No matter how careful I am with them ... they leak at the seams . These are less expensive and with proper care last forever ! When using them cold , you do need a cover of some sort ... an old pillow case works well folded over several times . Plus the size works well . Big enough to sit on your head for those migraines without falling off easily . Sometimes holding your head still to keep the ice pack on ends up hurting your neck , which makes your head worse . Defeats the purpose . For the money , this one is a good choice !
 Received this clipper blade quickly and just installed it the other day to groom my dog . It works just fine and will order again .
 I ordered the blades for my boyfriend because we are living in Bonaire , The Dutch Netherlands Antilles and you can not get this blades on the island . So he was very happy when he got them . Thank you amazon for making our lives so much easy .
 These are great condoms
 These are by far the best condoms I have tried . The used ones may be a little cheaper , but trust me , spend the extra $ $ for the new ones .
 Fitzwell . Unbelievably low price . I will definitely order more in a couple of months . The Thai ones works just as well as the Japanese .
 We 've tried many , many different thin -LRB- some dangerously so ! -RRB- condoms and I have to say that this was by far the BEST condom . Very thin - almost feels like nothing is there - but also very reliable . No slips , leaks or other surprises . Package says made in Thailand . Ca n't imagine a better feel than these !
 These are the best out there . Started with the 48 pack and we 're almost finished with a 100 pack -LRB- ordered elsewhere -RRB- . These are very thin , tight fitting , great feeling , and I have yet to have a single break.With that said , they are tight fitting and they are not particularly well lubricated . Make sure she is well lubricated , either by putting in some effort or by buying a lubricant . If not , the form-fit ends up being a discomfort and you may possibly encounter some ripping . I have n't , because I take care of business and make sure she 's good to go . So should you . Get these .
 These are the best I 've every used ... and I 've used all the usual suspects . They 're great with lubricants as well . I think we have a winner .
 Excellent product . Bought two more packs after fist use . Had to keep checking to make sure it was on . The only thing holding it back from a five star is the fact that I need to use them .
 These things are the best out there , they are a family tradition !
 My boyfriend and I ordered these condoms because we had run out , and thought the price would be worth it even if it sucked ... What we found out the first time we used it was that it feels like there is barely anything there . My boyfriend describes it as plastic wrap , being super thin , and i have to say that i have found my favorite condom now . Even the light pink color , and very low smell is pleasing . I totally recommend these , and hope everyone will at least give these a try : DUPDATE : When my boyfriend and I had some friends over , we decided to see just how much one of these condoms can hold . I went into the bathroom , and filled the whole thing with water . The only part that broke was the area near the band , all the way at the top . The amount of water in the condom was enough to fill the sink . It stretches so much ! ^ . ^ Extreme update , like almost a year later ... We ordered more of these condoms , as I had given away a bunch before , and everyone i know loves these . My boyfriend and I say that these are the best we 've tried . They 're comfy , durable but sometimes you need to add in a little extra lubrication .
 These are the best fitting , least expensive , best feeling condoms you can buy . They do n't break and they feel pretty damn good . I 'm average sized and these are nice and snug without being too tight .
 Awesome product , always feel great and are very sturdy.However 50 bucks to deliver just a little box stuffed with condoms is pretty ridiculous . In the future I will find another source to order this product from .
 Very thin for maximum pleasure ! Durable and lightly lubricated , one of the best in the business ! Used by professionals in the industry for years .
 As other reviews have stated , these are a bit low on lube but that has not been a problem for me . Very nice natural feel . Pink color is a little different but no biggy .
 good condom . very thin , but a little bit dry . Sure I will recommend it to my friends without any reservation .
 This item is nice and excellent . It allows full pleasure during the special act . It is safe to use and a great quality condom .
 In comparison to Trojan , Durex , and other major condom brands , these win hands down . They 're the thinnest I 've had , and the most dependable .
 Compared to every other condom this is the best . Their more expensive line of condoms really does n't offer any advantage in my opinion other than packaging . This one wins hands down .
 These are thin and work . They are comparable to Trojan 's sensations and I would probably buy them again in the future .
 Hi . Thank you very much for such products . I am very pleased with this purchase :-RRB- It is very practical and very efficient . Thank you very much .
 yes it the best and economic piece you can find in the market . good buy and it is super thin
 I like this crown thin condom , it is very thin , the size is perfect for asian , I will buy this again .
 price is pretty cheap , compare to those i bought before , $ 1 per 1 condom.comfortability is medium , as i mentioned above , those expensive are much thinner than this one . how ever , this one is still acceptable.smell is fine , i do n't feel anything smell annoying me .
 Best condom I 've ever used . I was very pleased with them . And a great value . Will never buy another brand again . Highly recommend .
 Very surprised how quickly order arrived , I was able to get them before my college student left , I waited til the last minute ... great deal for the money . FYI this product does not come in a box but shipping package was discreet . I almost forgot what I had ordered product was in a bubble envelope mailer . Definately will use seller again !
 I 've bought more of these blue-packaged Crown condoms from other suppliers since this particular purchase , and all of them have been fantastic . Every one has `` made in Thailand '' on the package even though I 've read reviews saying the ones made there -LRB- instead of Japan -RRB- were really bad . I 've never had the Japanese-made type , so maybe I 'm naive , but these are much thinner than anything I 've tried before , only lightly lubed -LRB- tip
 These condoms do run a bit small but they stretch very comfortably . They seem to have more room at the end of the condom for the head of the penis . I have read by many that they feel exactly or very close to wearing nothing at all . My first Crown Beyond 7 test I was disappointed for the first 3 or 4 minutes . Then the feeling became very natural , warm and wet . I was thinking wow , they are exactly like not wearing a condom ! Just to be sure I quickly pulled out , removed the condom and began at it . Truth be known the feeling is very good for a condom -LRB- the best of any condom I 've tried -RRB- but not even close to the same feeling as wearing no condom . She said the same thing . Try it the way I did and see for yourself . These condoms are strong , comfortable and allow you to feel what other condoms do n't . So if you are in a position that you must use a condom I 'd say these are the one 's . They actually make me think now that some of the girls I never had sex with because I would have to use a condom , may now be worth having sex with wearing one of these . Side note if you are very thick -LRB- waaay above average -RRB- I 'd say pass on these and stick with the Magnum XL 's .
 The product is good and fit to my size . However , if you are a big guy it will be a bit tight .
 I 've gone through quite a few different brands and none compared to this . Its is hands down the best feeling condom i have ever had and my girlfriend agrees as well , and unlike other thin condoms it does not rip easily . One issue I do have is in the circumference of the condom , as i am a little larger it is hard to get on and is a bit snug , so that 's something to watch out if you are 7 + inches -LRB- as i have used it more its become easier to put on -RRB- . You wo n't find a better price at any drugstore either .
 100ct for the price i paid is well worth it , these are perfect for a quick one , or just when you arnt worried about style of extra pleasure features . Its perfect for everything i do ^_^
 Incredible feeling . Still ca n't beat without , but when you want to be safe and still maintain sensitivity , this is what you buy !
 I was very happy with price , quality & performance of this product . I read somewhere about throwing a ring of condom-safe lubricant around tip before crowning-up . That works well for me ! I am an average-Joe , but have in the past , broken through so many Durex products that I am utterly disappointed with their performance and was shopping for alternatives . I read about & sampled Crown , what a good choice . I can not break a Crown during normal use , even if I try . They far exceed my expectations , though they truly perform just about as well as is frequently described in so many public reviews . Please , leave some for me , I will likely need to buy more 100 's after visiting LOS . Happy to be Crowing up these days ! Thanks for supplying high-quality products to protect the community .
 All I have to say is These are the only condoms I plan on buying again . I remember reading about these and how they were .0018 or so inches thick and thought that I could not tell a difference from the Trojan bare skin -LRB- .0020 inches think -RRB- condoms , Boy was I wrong ! I will admit that I have never like Trojan condoms because I found they broke way easier then any other brand for me -LRB- Durex , lifestyle , etc -RRB- . I Like the bare skins frankly because they felt good but I had no idea what was in store when i got the crown condoms . At first I noticed that they were a bit longer then a normal condom , and I am not a huge guy -LRB- 6 1/2 -7 inches on a good day -RRB- but these went the farthest by a long shot . Of course they feel amazing for me and my girlfriend says I can perform better so she its better for her as well . On top of it all , the crown condoms are so strong and durable ! I did not feel like I needed to be afraid of it breaking some time during intercourse ! All in all I do not think I will be using any other condom for a vary long time . I LOVE THESE THINGS
 Both of us were really happy with the thinner condom . I wo n't go into detail but you really can see and feel the difference . I purchased a 36 pack and they were all the `` made in Japan '' variety . However I ca n't imagine that the Thailand version is exceptionally different . I highly recommend these if you 're tired of not feeling anything .
 these are probably my favorite condoms -LRB- i have n't tried that many though , i think i got like 60 for 5 or 6 bucks ... that 's too good of a deal for anybody to pass . If you like super thin condoms and saving money , get these from this vendor ... i think it 's the manufacturer actually
 This is one of the best condoms I have used so far , super thin but strong . As some other reviewer said , this product soon becomes dry and need some lubricant .
 After trying these , I will not use another type of condom . Good fit , color and doesnt have that awful smell . Its almost like wearing nothing at all .
 Sent in my nicely wrapped package nicely , and came really quick ! And they work great as party balloons as well !
 So I was with Charlie Sheen . Huge party tons of naked women and I asked him hey Chuck you bang lots of women , so naturally you must be an authority on condoms . With that said what would you suggest I use on these ladies . He replied Crown all the way . Thin well lubricated and they feel great ! Good enough for Charlie good enough for anyone.Side note if your about to get busted with drugs put them in the crown condoms and `` hide them '' they are strong and wo n't break so you do n't have to worry about overdosing while `` hiding them . ''
 I odered standard shipping on sunday and they got here on wednessday great deal all together it was like 4.05 for 24 of the condoms they come in the blue color i thought they were going to be in a silver package but it doesnt mate . They look great cant wait to try them
 I recently bought 250 of the crown skinless skin condoms . These are the best condems I have ever used ! they are super thin and it feels like I am not even wearing one . I have a 9 '' cock and 5 '' round and these fit perfectly . Also they were made in Thailand . I heard reports of some of them smelling . Well mine have virtually no smell at all.In fact , I am ordering 500 more today . So pleased . Thank you !!!
 I live in a Hollywood apartment and sometimes have females who enter my dwelling . I try to look hip and smooth so that they 'd dig my style and offer me some of their sugar . So aside from always wearing yoga pants and having a sweet 3D TV smack dab in the middle of my living room , I places boxes of Okamoto Crown throughout my house so that it really looks like I am a big timer . You know the ladies like it when you made it big time , right?Well , one day I was watching Transformers Revenge of The Fallen on my sweet 3D TV , and I was like `` hey , maybe I should put on one of these condoms and see what it is like '' . So I did . And baby , let me tell you it felt good . It felt like my penis was reinforced . You know what I said ? I said , `` why not test this baby out , and see how she performs '' . So I went outside in my yoga pants , with my condom on underneath and went for a jog . I 'd figure this is the best way to simulate intercourse . So I worked up a sweat , and checked the condom . No rips ... good . When I finished the jog , I went back to my sweet apartment in Hollywood . I checked to see how the condom was doing . Pretty good , it was dangling off the tip of my knob , but thats probably b/c I lost my erection half way through the jog . What can I say , huh ? Maybe I should work in some viagra into my jogs.So now I know what these things feel like . Before they were just strangers to me , laying around my apartment as bait for impressing chicks . Now , they are a part of me . Its like we have been together . Anyway , if you ever walk into an apartment with a sweet 3D TV , a couple of boxes of Okamoto scattered on the floor , and a cool dude wearing yoga pants smiling at you , you 'll know whats up -LRB- in my yoga pants -RRB- .
 They work , They dont break often , not really all that thin though , and the real downside is that they are pink . but you wont get a disease or have a baby before your ready . A potentially life saving purchase . Gon na try some foreign ones next time and see what the rest of the world uses .
 I 'd read that these condoms run wider than normal , so I thought I 'd give them a try , figuring if it worked for the average porn star , my little guy would do fine ... Not quite the case , unfortunately ... the fit was too snug , to the point where I could n't climax until I 'd removed the condom ... I guess I can enjoy the idea that I 'm thicker than most porn stars , but that does n't help prevent STD 's . The size not working out for me is n't the condoms fault , though ... All other aspects of this condom were just fine ... I liked the lack of condom odor and the lack of the typical greasy/oily feeling most condoms have was nice . -LRB- this was precisely what I 'm looking for -RRB- Structural integrity seemed sound . Even though the condom was extremely tight , it still did not rip.My search for a non-lubricated , odor free condom for larger than average guys continues ! but if you 're not packing a soda can , these could be great for you .
 I 'll buy again because they are only $ 9 but the color sucks cause they have a pink tint to them .
 I LoveD bare , I LoveD skyns , MY GIRL LOVES CROWNS and I do too ! I was not sure about this product when I purchased it , some users complained about the smell , but it was not really bad . Skyns and Bare had more heat sensation that 's why one would feel more sensation , but since HEAT in that area was never a problem for us -LRB- let 's just say our thermostat down there is on high always -RRB- this just rocked our world ! This works for me and my girl , so I highly encourage you guys to try it !!!
 these were my favorite condoms til i moved up to magnums ... . these are great . . didnt have any latex allergies concerning the girls . . they were nice . . i really enjoyed it . . if your 10 inches long this aint for you . . if your 4 inches long this aint for you either .
 Its comfortable and easy to wear ... For the price it is worth to get ... I would recommend them to any ...
 We have gone through several hundred of these now and never had one break . . I highly recommend them !! The &#34; funny &#34; pink color is kinda cute as well !
 I ordered these looking for something that was truly thin and gave a more natural feel . Obviously nothing feels the exact same as not using any condom but these are a definite second best and everyone should be trying to have safe sex if you 're not married or ready for a baby or worse so if you want a truly thin condom try these you will love them .
 Protection without compromising the enjoyment . Best condom I used so far . A definte buy . I would recommned it and give it 5 stars .
 These are great - my husband says they definitely feel the closest to nothing at all , and we are both happy with them .
 Product as described , shipped fast . Pink in color , not a big deal . Fit snug but it just means it stays on.Would buy again .
 Crazy thin ! I see why they are so highly recommended . Feels like nothing was there at all . I will recommend these to all of my friends
 in total 24ct cost me $ 3 , plus $ 7 shippin ... . putting my grand total at $ 10 ----- which basically means i paid about 40cents each . not bad
 My boyfriend 's tried just about every brand , and can never finish because of the lack of sensation through a condom . He 's tried Trojan 's Bare Skin but says even those are too thick for him . We tried these the other day and he says it really is like wearing nothing at all !
 These condoms are the thinnest on the market . Let me first say , these condoms are definitely NOT too small . These are the condoms that are used by most adult film stars , so anyone who says these condoms are `` too small '' must be in the 90 % percentile of men who are much bigger than 8 '' , or they just have a complex . I 'm above average in girth and length , and these condoms are great . They almost feel like you 're wearing nothing at all . Compared to other brands like Trojan , which I feel are a little on the thick side , these are equally as durable and are made of latex , and although they are latex , they lack the rubber smell that most condoms possess . Give them a try , they 're surprisingly different , and they make a HUGE difference in the experience of both partners . I enjoy them highly . Cheers .
 Billed as ` The Closest Thing To Nothing At All ' , I must say these are some thin condoms . Okamoto delivers ! I was tired of all the thick condoms and was ready to reject condoms altogether ... even started using the ` pull and pray ' technique , then I discovered Okamoto Crowns . Okamoto made me appreciate condoms once again . These are great for achieving that ` extra sensation ' .
 total for me was $ 7 . great valuethese are amazing ! so much better than any other condom I 've tried before . but they dry quicker and then it 's worse than other condoms . have lube handy
 I 've tried many different brands of condoms through the years , ranging from Trojan , Durex and Lifestyles . Trojans , by far , were the worst because they never felt right and smelled absolutely terrible . I 'm convinced they use the cheapest latex they can find . Durex and Lifestyles condoms were good brands and felt much better , but I wanted to try out some of the Japanese brands I saw floating around the market . A couple of years ago , I decided to try out one of Okamoto 's Beyond Seven condoms -LRB- the studded version -RRB- . While I found them to be on the snug side , they were thin and transferred body heat well . The best part was , they had almost no latex smell whatsoever ! I decided later to try out the main line of Crown condoms . I found out that these are the pink condoms used in JAV -LRB- Japanese Adult Video -RRB- . I wanted to see what all the fuss was about . Needless to say , my woman and I were handsomely rewarded by this particular purchase . These were the thinnest and most sensitive condoms I 've ever used . They also had virtually no latex scent . With just enough lubrication , it really does feel like you have nothing on . These also can be on the snug side , but I do n't really have any problems with them -LRB- again , good lube goes a long way -RRB- . Bottom line , you owe it to yourself and your partner to give these condoms a try .
 From a woman 's point of view FOR WOMEN who may experience similar ... hope it helpsThis is coming from someone that was accustomed to using no condoms at all and orgasmed almost everytime and going to having to use condoms and rarely reaching orgasm.These condoms are by far the best I 've tried ! It 's the next best thing to wearing nothing . Prior to these I 've used Durex Seni Thins and I hated that I could feel the cold laxtex rather than the warmth of my partner . It was having an effect on me remaining arroused . I can count the times I 've orgasmed using condoms , which were few . With these I could definitely feel my partner 's warmth instead of cold latex so I could focus on the moment and not on the cold . Whether you produce ALOT of natural lubrication or not , I would say to STILL have a bottle of lube nearby because these condoms are NOT very lubricated at all -LRB- that 's the only reason it got a 4 star instead of a 5 star -RRB- . I can now say that when I used these condoms , I have orgasmed because of their thinness !! I WILL DEFINITELY KEEP USING THESE !!! Also if you have damagingly rough sex then yes it may tear or start to come off -LRB- it 's a condom - not a magic condom , the rules of physics still apply -RRB- . In my experience it has not broken so far . I had a partner that was rough and we ran out of lube so the friction started to pull it off but that was the only time that happened.PROS
 Bought these before and enjoyed them a lot . This time bought two hundred . Feels like not wearing anything . Very natural feeling and snug . I LOVE this product . Will continue buying . Tried many different kinds , but enjot this brand the most .
 I hate condoms . They never fit and I feel like I could slam my wang in a car door and not feel anything . I can say that the Crown Skinless condom is the # 1 selling condom on various condom websites for a reason . The superthin condom has fantastic heat transfer and almost feels like wearing nothing.Note that men with above average girth may find them difficult to put on , but they are remarkably stretchy and feel like nothing once they are on.The condoms also came well packaged and shipping was super fast . Great seller .
 I have never been a fan of condoms , but what man is ? I read about `` Crown Condoms '' in a mens health mag and decided to try them out . The feeling was if I didnt have one on at all . Two different `` after the club '' experiences and a fling with an ex have sold me with no doubt . I havent had one break even after getting a little rough either . The only issue is that their a little short if your longer then six inches . * UPDATE * Im still not a fan of condoms but I continue to use them ... you have too right ? Well ive been using Crown Condoms for about a year and even though I may have been a lil over excited in the beginning about them , there still more then decent for the price . There small . Im not huge by any means but they roll on pretty tight and only roll to about five inches . Maybe this is why the sensation is increased , its like wearing an O.J. glove . There cheap and for this reason I bought like 1000 at one time so I refused to not try and use them all . Well a few packs into them , ive given up and started using lambskin . Thats a whole nother story in itself , but ive written a review for them too .
 I love these condoms , they let you feel much more then other condoms which claim to be `` super thin '' and not a single issue with any of them thus far .
 I 've ordered the 12 pack and the 100 , both from chubby dick emporium with no problems . The 12 pack came in a bubble mailer with them Beaty laid out inside and the 100 pack came in a small box with four plastic sleeves full of condoms . I have n't noticed any holes or rips in the individual condom wrappers yet.The condom itself is for average-thin sized guys . Would probably fit any length but it wo n't fit a thicker guy . They 're light pink and we have n't noticed a latex-y smell yet . I would definitely but these again .
 The condom itself seems fine , but runs a bit small . If you have a larger penis , you will probably feel like this is squeezing you a bit much , if you can get it on at all . Also , they are not lubricated , which is n't a problem for us , but something you should know . Otherwise , I 've been informed that they feel less like wearing a plastic bag than other condoms .
 Comdoms I received were made in Japan , and as every Japanese product quality control is top priority . Already used and love it .
 This condom is very high quality . The packages that I received were made in japan . Best one that I have tried . It was very difficult to break with my hands even though they are soo thin.I bought this and 2 other types from the same company . They all came lose in the shipping bag .
 nicely priced and works greatbut you can definitely smell the rubber.i would recommend italso , it 's pink lol
 I have n't tried every condom made in the world but I 've tried most of the big name brands . Crown-Okamoto Super Thin Condoms are by far the thinnest I 've ever tried and that 's a great thing -LRB- except for the times when she does n't want you to go just yet lol , but who does n't have those times regardless -RRB- . I highly recommend you try these out and so far I ca n't find a better price for condoms for the amount given . Got ta try these out !
 I read up on line about condoms . The crown was rated number one . It is by far the most natural feeling and sensitive condom I have ever used . Thumbs up all the way around .
 These shipped to me in strips of 6 and they expire in 4 or 5 years , very good and can handle a beating lol
 These are awesome ! Thin , great fit , lightly lubricated . Everything you need in a condom . I feel weird reviewing a condom , HA ! But I think everyone should really try these . I think the only turn off is the pink color of them . But these are the only ones I will use .
 These condoms have some renown for being made in Japan and therefore high-quality . The package of 100 I ordered from GreenWeb are in fine condition , and smell normal - only a little like latex compared to my old standby , Trojan . The shipped package consists entirely of a large plastic bag full of the condoms and one deflated packing pillow , so do n't expect another cardboard box to open . I do n't care , since like most mass manufactured products you 'll generally get a run of either good or bad products , regardless of the frilly exterior packaging you 're about to throw away.All condoms are packaged in dark blue as pictured on the main product page , with `` Made in Thailand '' clearly printed on the reverse side -LRB- not currently pictured -RRB- . I 'm adding this picture to the product page.Based on the highly varying reports I 've read in reviews here and on the vendor pages , I postulate the Okamoto company has recently changed to Thailand production and the inventory is in flux . The silver packaging that still appears on some of this product 's pages seems to be of higher quality than the dark blue packaging , and the manufacturer claims in the product details specifically that the product is in new packaging but is still the same high quality product.I got these for around 12 cents each buying 100 , and I 've seen other vendors charge twice as much for these and show the older , simpler product details
 For starters they are way cheaper then buying condoms at walmart or something so that was reason enough to get them . Aside from that , they never break , though i agree with other people saying you will need additional lube . As far as condoms go i would say they are very nice , im not really a condom expert so ... ya . they work .
 My boyfriend loves these , and we have n't had problems with them . We have to use quite a bit of lube when we use them due to their dryness , but that may be why we have n't had any break on us . He likes the tightness and the feel of the condom , and they are the only condom we 've tried that do n't slip off . We love these and have had no issues with breakage so we plan to keep the bowl next to the bed full of these.Edit
 For a latex condom , these are very thin and match or exceed the quality and pleasure of any latex condom I have tried -LRB- Durex , Trojan , Lifestyle , etc. -RRB- . Though , I do n't like the pink tinting . Unlike some other condoms I 've tried , these condoms stretch well at the base where I have found some condoms to be too constricting . The tipping point , however , is the price . These are extremely cheap and yet well made , comfortable , condoms . You ca n't go wrong with that!That said , personally I still prefer Lifestyle SKYN condoms because they are just as thin , do not contain latex , and do n't have that nasty smell common to all latex condoms . Unfortunately , they 're also a lot more expensive ! Maybe I am allergic to latex , I do n't know , but I have found latex condoms to be numbing and I have never been able to climax with one on . Crown condoms have proven to be no exception . The only condom I can climax with are the SKYN condoms because they do n't numb sensitivity.Nevertheless , I gave the Crown condoms a 5 star rating because they are great latex condoms . If you do n't mind wearing latex , these are your best bet .
 This is one of the best condoms me and my boyfriend have ever tried . It really does feel like there is nothing there and it streches a lot . Me and my boy friend usualy use magnums because thats all that fits him and these were way better because they not only fit but they were thinner than the trojan thin magnums . They also did n't tare .
 I saw these condoms posted as a deal on Slickdeals and decided to give it a shot . The reviews seemed mostly positive and the price was hard to beat . Unfortunately , I have only had the opportunity to use a few of these so far . Maybe if I get lucky enough I will have more experience with them and can update this review !!
 Well never left feedback on something so personal , but this is something my wife and I really enjoy using so this should be easy . These condoms have great sensitivity . I give these condoms a 5 for quality and a 10 for price . The sensitivity is fairly good to others that I have had , and on a scale of 10 I would say and easy 8 . I have had condoms that were better as far as sensitivity , but for the price it was just right . The one positive thing about decreases sensitivity , is that you can definitely last longer which my wife appreciates .
 These condoms are , not only better than Trojans , they are absurdly cheap -LRB- cost not quality -RRB- . None of them have come close to breaking . They 're super thin . Highly recommend .
 These are the best condoms ever . Paired with the right lube , these are amazing . -LRB- You wo n't feel like you 've got a plastic bag between you and your partner !! -RRB-
 I have never had a good experience with condoms as they were all so thick and smelly but these condoms are so thin you ca n't even feel them and they have no smell . I highly recommend them for couples who do not like the hormones in birth control pills and who want to use safe sex . I am so happy that I found these because now we can have sex with it feeling great and not have to worry about possible side effects like babies !
 My gawd condoms are overpriced , however these are definitely not . I find these condoms help delay me from climaxing sooner than I want . It enables me to enjoy the pleasurable sensations of a lady 's love tunnel substantially longer than expected . Will buy again .
 These are the best condoms my husband and I have found thus far . Trojans do n't even hold a torch to these . I would n't say its like is is n't there but it is definitively better then all of the other condoms that we have tried . I also like the ONE condoms .
 Best condoms out there . They are super thin and feel great . They also do n't have that gross condom smell , and have little smell at all . The value on these is also great . I would definitely recommend these to anyone .
 I bought it and it was received . It does what it does and has a long expiration date . No complaints here .
 These are the best condoms ever in terms of sensitivity . However , they are not lubricated very well and are probably a little bit shorter than most condoms . I still highly highly recommend them .
 Fantastic condoms . Their motto really is true
 The product came in time but was little dry then other brands have to use more liquids . Will try that again .
 Excellent product , adjust very well and feels like there is nothing . Safe , comfortable , no breaks or failures so far . Undoubted , the best choice if you want to be safe and almost have the feeling of wearing nothing at all .
 These condoms fit great and are very durable . The sensitivity is unparalleled compared to other brands I have tried . Currently , I have experience no breakages or any packaging defects .
 Seriously the best condoms I 've ever used . As Ned Flanders once put so eloquently , `` feels like i 'm wearing nothin at all ! ''
 Thin , durable and great fitting . I tried a small pack of these condoms and I decided to go order more ! These are probably the best we have used and are a joy to wear . The feeling you get with these is fantastic . If you want to try something new and exciting than these are for you ! The only recommendation I have is you may want to have a water based lubricant handy as these condoms do not have a lot of lubricant on them .
 Ordered Crown Condoms . It took no time for them to arrive like literally , 3 days wait an it was a 48ct order . When I run out I will be back to order another !
 I got the 36 pack of Okamoto Crown condoms so that I could hide them in my roommate 's bag -LRB- and maybe prevent pregnancy -RRB- . In the meantime , I decided to try them out.These are better than any Durex condoms I 've tried , and at least on par with Trojan . They have fantastic lubricant , and they do n't smell strongly of latex.I 'd recommend these to anyone of average size . While they may accommodate a larger size , these are probably not comfortable for the extremely well-endowed .
 This is the best condom I 've tried . Also tried Trojan and Durex Loves , this one lets you feel the most and you ca n't beat the price . Will be buying these for a while .
 Cant complain they are nice to wear . Very form fitting and not too much lube so they dont come of once your done .
 Came loosely packed in a yellow envelope bubble warpped . Got all 36 . Expires in 3 years.Also recieved a ten percent off coupon .
 Cheap and work well . They could be slightly larger and come with a touch more lube , but on the upside they do n't smell funky -LRB- or at all , really -RRB- and hold up just fine .
 So far these have been my favorite and it sucks that it took me so long to discover this brand / style . They have been the best feeling so far and seem to give a bit more friction/sensitivity as well compared to other brands . A definite keeper and I 'll probably reorder these over all brands unless the gf wants to keep trying other brands .
 Needed condoms for larger sized penises , these are good for anything from average to slightly above , I do n't think I 'd use these for anything too huge though . I 've asked guys how they like these since I started using them , and men seem to love these . Men usually say condoms suck in general so for them to be excited about this condom is definitely a sign that these are a good brand!Have had a couple break due to near lack of lubrication , though I hesitated on whether to give these four or five stars because some lubrications give me discomfort anyway , so better to introduce non-agitating lubricants . Very cute color , they do n't smell bad or taste bad . Overall I 'd give these 4.5 / 5 , once again not for too small but not huge , average to a little bigger is perfect for these condoms .
 best price for the most amount of condoms , this is for people who need this many for the cheapest price and best quality available , they are even better then trojan condoms .
 Only condom I can ever use . I have been unable to deal with how much any other one killed the sensations . I have tried all `` super-thin '' condoms by pretty much all brands , this brand is by far the best with no equal .
 Thinnest condom I have ever used , added about 30-40 % more sensation that other `` thin '' condoms I 've tried . Never feared breakage at all . Could have used a little more width but nowhere near a deal breaker . Highly recommend .
 These were a tight fit for me , they also do n't slide all the way down . They get the job done and for the price they are awesome . I never had any breaking issues with these at all , even with the tight fit . They are pink -LRB- which is fine with me -RRB- and not very lubricated.Overall
 My product was shipped very quickly and was just as described . Thank you for a great transaction !
 there 's not much more to say about them . they 're thin enough but they 're not amazing or anything . they 're pink , a little bit ribbed , and a little bit lubricated . I 'd say they 're slightly better than the trojans I had been using , but they 're not some miracle condom -- at the end of the day , it 's still a horrible piece of latex that takes 30 % of the enjoyment out of sex .
 I first saw these being used in the reality kings videos and wondered what kind of condom it was . I did some research and found it was the skinless skin now called crown condoms . I used to use Trojans and Durex but now I only use these . These are the most comfortable condom I 've ever used ! They go on easy and stay on , they are snug but not too tight or too loose , they 're just right . I can feel so much with these it 's very close to bareback and they have a very nice natural feel to them . Do n't let the pink color fool you , the pink actually makes it blend in better with your skin . I usually buy these in the 100 pack , I 'm a single guy so I do go through a lot of these . And you get the most bang for your buck if you buy in bulk . Yes it 's true they did move production to Thailand but these still blow anything out of the water for the price . I 've never never had one break on me yet ! At least try the 12 pack for 2 . xx seeming as though they 're so cheap .
 I love these condoms . They are very strong , but still allow for great sensitivity . I 've never had one break , and actually do n't hate wearing them!These will likely be my brand for life .
 I bought these condoms because I have problems with most condoms drying out , not fitting well , or not being sensitive enough . These were less aggravating than a lot of the usual brands . The feel is better , and it 's not as constricting ; however , the amount of lubrication is definitely not enough . With a separate bottle of it , these are a lot more functional . I 'd tell anybody that has the same experience as me with other condoms to give these a try .
 These condoms are every bit as advertised . I was not impressed initially though - they did n't fit me all the way and were a little smaller . But turns out you should not leave any room at the top near the tip , which I used to do with other condoms to not risk them breaking . But once I started wearing them flush at the top , they fit me just right and the closest to not feeling a thick condom as I have ever gotten . Great value for the money but I recommend initially buying just a dozen to test them out .
 Good product . Feels like you wearing nuthing at all . Only problem is the condom seems to get dry after about 7 to 10mins of use . Get lots of lube when you buy the condoms .
 Recommended from the boys at SA . These things are top notch . Best condoms I 've ever used .
 I think this is an absolute great deal on an absolutely great condom . Previously , my partner bought Durex down at the Pharmacy and spent way too much on way too little , and the condoms were rather thick.These ones are indeed pleasantly thin , and lasted perfectly well . Although I 'm not worried about impregnating my partner -LRB- these are purely for cleanliness and safety -RRB- , I would trust them for vaginal intercourse if I was into that sort of thing.I 've recommended them to all my friends -LRB- and with 100 of them for -LSB- ... -RSB- bucks I 've given out free samples -RRB- and they 're all pleased with them as well!Go Crown !
 This is the 2nd choice out of what we 've tried so far . My absolute favorite now is the Durex Ultra Sensitive . If that 's what you 're looking for its the way to go .
 These condoms are very good they will fit almost anything close to 9 '' I like them they feel like you do n't have anything on , It makes it feel as you are naked , and they come out easy with no mess . I would recomend it for the novice or the pros .
 My husband seems to like these . He said he can feel a difference between these and other brands .
 Overall , I really like this product . Should be noted that the 100ct does NOT come in a box , but in a large bag . I suppose it 's fine considering that the container really does n't matter all that much . They are slightly tighter than other condoms , but not to the point where it feels like a problem . But for the particularly girthy guy , you might want to look elsewhere . My one major problem is that if I have one in my wallet for any more than a day or so , the wrapper somehow becomes unsealed . For those of us who prefer to have one for those `` just in case '' moments , this can be a problem . Otherwise , I was pleased .
 Package arrived discreetly and quickly . Very sensitive and strong condom . No `` condom smell . '' My new favroite .
 These are the best by far that I have ever bought . You wo n't go wrong with these . High quality , never breaks and are very thin . Been buying these for years and will never go back .
 pretty good condom , and is a very good price . if you dont like condoms you still wont like this one . it also has very little lubercation , so have some handy .
 I have tried tons of different brands and styles out , but these are by far the best I have used . It 's nice to not have to look around anymore , I just buy these and I know I 'll be happy with them .
 My wife and I have been in search for the best feeling condoms on the market . After some research , I 've tried the Trojan Ultra Thin , Trojan Bare Skin , and these Okamoto Crown Super Thin . These are great , but I was n't thrilled with 2 things -LRB- see Pro 's and Con 's below -RRB- . Pro : - They are thin . Much better than the Trojan Ultra Thin condoms.-Durable and we have not experienced any breakage.Cons : - Strong rubber smell from these.-The Trojan Bare Skin felt much better than these.-These appeared to dry up faster having us re-lube every so often .
 These are by far the best condoms I have ever used -LRB- previous brands/products trojan , lifestyle , durex , magnum , and iron grip . After things get a little warmed up these condoms feel unbelievably natural . It took me a few times to get comfortable with them because you begin to feel like they are coming off because things feel so natural but these condoms are n't going anywhere until you rip them off . We ALL know that feeling where we are into it but we know the condom is one and then things feel a little TOO good and we pull out and look down to see if the condom came off . Not the case with these . If you put them on correctly and unroll them all the way down , they stay on and suck and stick to your skin . I pulled out on more than one occasion and saw that the condom was still on , tried to pull it off because I thought it leaked or broke and the condom was like a suction cup and was not coming off , period . Did n't do much for the mood but it gave me confidence that these puppies are not coming off in the heat of the a moment . We all know the infamous position that makes most condoms traditionally slide off . This one stayed on no matter how hard , fast , deep or slow the action got . Again , the key is to put it on CORRECTLY . If you do that it 's not going anywhere . I 'm buying a larger pack and will stick with this brand going forward .
 Product works just as the manufactures states ! The only thing is they are somewhat pink in color but I guess it really does not matter .
 With this low price , you ca n't ask more.Quality is good . Save money for other stuff like holiday gift etc. .
 Other than that , not really a complain about it.Comes in a regular plastic/paper bag with the tape like thing on top to close it . So u better be the one to receive it , because easy to open and close with really noticing it someone did.Product was good . No complains
 I honestly could n't use another condom . After using these for a bit my girlfriend suggested we use Trojan Fire and Ice . The Trojans felt like wearing a burlap sack . These are amazingly thin and durable.Highly recommended .
 I 've bought 400 of these in the last year or so . They 're a good quality condom at a far better price than most others of similar quality - it would be crazy expensive to go though that many at retail prices . I like the texture -LRB- it 's less rubber feeling -RRB- and they 're on the thinner side . They 're certainly not the thinnest out there , but the thinner ones sometimes have issues while unrolling that they 'll get rolled under themselves ... I 've never had that problem with these . I ca n't say I get excited about these condoms per se , but they 're always there as my go-to barrier , which does its job and does n't get in the way .
 i get them all the time . They 're great and my girlfriend loves them ;-RRB- . Also safe . I 'm on my 2nd 100-pack and she has n't gotten pregnant or anything ! GREAT !
 These are not the best condoms I ever had but they do the job . Good enough for a fair price .
 Received the package quickly and with no complaints . It should state that condoms just come in wrappers and not a box .
 I prefer thin condoms and these definitely are the best I have tried . My girlfriend also liked them because it did n't have that latex taste so much ... I switched from trojan ultra thin/thintensity and could n't ever go back to that now .
 Product is very good , and retailers description and shipping was excellent . While I still prefer wearing nothing , these are about the next best option for me !
 Very happy with the product and especially the deal I got them at . So far the best condom I have tried . Highly recommended !!!
 I was bit surprised when it came in USPS loose package . Though , I 've been using it since then and greatly satisfied with this product .
 I like the NaturaLamb condoms better . You just have to think past what it exactly your putting on your manhood ... but this is a close 2 or 3 -LRB- IMO -RRB- when I have to use it . Recommened over Trojan and Durex and whatever major brands there are .
 These condoms are the thinnest I 've ever used . My girlfriend and I both love them . For the most part they are scentless which is always nice , no one enjoys the smell of latex ! Highly recommended .
 The best I 've ever used . These are definitely the thinnest amongst any of the earlier ones I have used from Durex , to Trojan , to Lifestyles.Well packaged and super fast shipping . Great seller .
 the condoms look really small , but , once you put on are really confortable . Maybe if you 're a horse -LRB- more than 8 '' or 9 '' -RRB- it 's not going to work for you but if you 're in the range 6 '' -8 '' it 's ok . The feeling improove in about a 15 % and you can feel it ! . I totally recomended . 4 stars beacause any condom it 's perfect .
 Having tried many variations from all the major condom brands -LRB- Trojan , Durex , Lifestyles -RRB- I can say with absolute confidence that this is the best condom I 've ever used . Thin but very durable , they beat all the competition on feeling , safety , and especially price . 7 or 8 dollars for a 12 pack -LRB- more if it 's a convienience store or pharmacy -RRB- ? Try 15 dollars for a 100 pack ! Really , make the purchase and try them out .
 I received this item in about five days and it was exactly as pictured . Some of the reviews I read were saying that the quality was low in regards to where it was manufactured , I have no complaints ... many people also mentioned that there was not enough lubrication ... again I did not find this to be a problem . Maybe they should learn to produce more readily available `` natural '' lubricant within their partners ...
 Best condoms ever . They came in a plain old post office box , just a few days after I ordered .
 After trying several kinds of Trojan -LRB- smelled bad -RRB- I tried using these and Durex , around the same time . These are extremely thin , very smooth , and oh so good , you know . Out of 20-ish different types , these rank in my favorite 3 , along with Durex Extra sensitive and Beyond Seven studded . An excellent product .
 I do a lot of traveling in out of the way places in foreign countries where the water conditions are not all that sanitary . I carry these condoms in my pack and in my pocket where ever I travel . When I need them , I need them fast and I am certainly not going to miss out on a lot of good refreshment and fine parties simply because I was too stupid to go trekking about without protection . Being a woman ... I have to provide these for myself so often . A girl simply has to watch out for herself these days!I like these because they are thin , they hold a surprisingly large amount , they are lightly lubricated and they do not leave an after taste in your mouth . You need not empty the things when finished , nor do you have to wash them out ... just tie off the top and pitch them.To prevent all sorts of diseases , in particularly of the gastrointestinal tract , I never drink water , or mixed drinks for that matter , with out using them . I like my water and other drinks cold ! So often you can get water or a drink but it is warm and the only way to cool it down is add ice ! NOT a good idea as the ice is often contaminated . Rather than ruin the taste of the drink , I simply order it without ice and then order the ice separate , either in another glass or bowl . I then remove the ice -LRB- crushed works best , although cubes work fine if small -RRB- and fill a condom with the ice . I then dangle the ice filled condom in my drink and dip it in and out , in and out , in and out , in and out and Walla ! Cold drink ! It even works on a warm glass of beer ! Unless the thing breaks , you have absolutely no chance of contamination.Because of the light lubrication you do not get an oil slick on the top of your drink . I have never had one break . Of course if I am extemely hot and need a lot , I double up and use two of them.Once finished with our refreshing pause , you can discretely wrap them in a napkin -LRB- or if you are the crude sort ... toss them on the floor -RRB- and leave.I suppose these things could be used for male protection during the sexual act , or acts , as the case may be ... but what a waste that would be of a great health product !
 Very thin , decently priced . No breaks or failures yet either . Downright excellent sensitivity .
 My girlfriend -LRB- wife-to-be -RRB- and I have been having unprotected sex for about 5 years now . She has been on the pill since day 1 , never missing a pill . It has been a very functional sexual relationship -- We have sex about once a week . That 's all I can seemingly get with our 2 terriers that she loves seemingly more than me I swear ! It has always been very good sex , occasionally making her near orgasm . . but never quite getting there . I 'm about 5 or 6 condoms into Okamoto , and I have made her scream for minutes on end with these condoms . They fit just perfect -- I am about 7 '' completely erect and feel like they 're almost not there once they get warmed up . Unprotected is of course the best , but it is seemingly unrealistic if you are trying to proper plan a family . We had a close call about 3-4 months ago , and after that , I began buying condoms . I found that most Trojans were ridiculously thick and reduced the sensation for me . A 100-pack of Okamoto ran me a whopping $ 10 shipped to my door . This is an amazing price for a quality product . I have tested these condoms in my own private endeavors -LRB- ha ! -RRB- to see how much they could sustain before breaking . I have not been able to successfully break one yet.Only one caveat -- But this is to condoms in general -- Buy yourself some good silicone lube and pour it over the condom once you initially put it on . You will thank me later . These will dry out very quickly.I believe , the key to a good condom , is to remove the fear that the male has in accidentally impregnating her . Once you remove that fear , a male has no fear and gives it to her like she has never been given it before!Good luck and godspeed , fellow condom users!UPDATE 8/14/2012 - So , never thought I 'd come back to update a condom review . . But hey , people got ta know . We have finally moved on to trying to conceive , so my stash of Okamotos is currently not going down . I still give them 5 stars . We did have one break , but I think it was too dry and too much friction . I would recommend always using either water-based or silicone lubricant . Supposedly the silicone lubricant can degrade the condom , but we never saw it . POINT TO BE TAKEN -- We used these for a year and did not have more than 1 break in about 50-60 uses . I will take that any day of the week .
 OK so I have bought these three times . Each time I bought a 100 count of Okamoto Crown 's . The first seller Green Web sent ones that were made in thailand . These were excellent and smooth and thin.The second batch was bought from Healthtime and they said made in Japan . These were horrible and super dry and actually took the feeling away.My third batch was again from Green Web Inc and they were thailand , and again these were super awesome . So just a heads up to you folks .
 Good quality product . Ordered 24 and they came in a yellow bubble wrap envelope , no box or anything , not that Iind but perhaps others may . Used a few and they perform as expected . Design of the wrapper has changed from before . It is blue now and just says ` crown ' with no mention of ` skinless skin ' so it made be a bit surprised . No big deal though I later saw on another website that the wrapper design had changed . On further inspection I saw that these are manufactured in Thailand . I thought the old ones were made in japan but I forget ... . As ling as it works as expected I do n't mind where it 's made . So , overall happy with the purchase .
 The title says it all . The price is right , Prime shipping , The wife likes them . Nothing negative yet . Only thing that may turn some off is that they come in a zip lock bag rather than actual boxes . Looks like they were just counted out of a bulk order though .
 These condoms are the ultimate . I have tried many others but none can comparewith Crown-Okamoto Super Thin Condoms . They truly are like wearing nothing at all .
 These are very thin but you can tell they are durable and wo n't fall apart the minute you put it in . It is hardly lubed and has no smell . But , since it is n't lubed very well , make sure to put some lube on the inside . I was rubbed raw a little bit from it . Other than that , very good condom .
 Holy Sh -- ! That 's all I got ta say . It 's as if I had nothing on . I usually put a condom on just before I about to `` finish '' , but since I have tried these , I use them from beginning to end . You do n't have to get a 100 count , you can get the least amount to try for yourself . It was n't until I read a few reviews of this condom and the fact that it 's been considered # 1 for quite some time now that I ordered so many . But I am grateful I did , and the were WAY cheaper then buying the $ 9.99 12 pack of Lifestyle SKYN that I formerly used . Try a few and see for yourself , you 'll swear it 's not there.Oh and by the way , this is my wife 's account that I use to order from as well . So , do n't think this review is coming from a female . That would be really weird !
 Definitely the best that we have used . Has better lubrication and better than every other brand at male and female experiencing all the sensations . I would definitely buy again .
 I was using Kimono and Durex extra thins before they raised the prices for condoms at my college and after researching online at Amazon , came upon these . They are great ! Really thin but well made and we have not had any problems with the fit .
 I enjoy these condoms . I have to rank it # 2 though , reason for the 4 stars . There 's a lot of good quality from this condom , being that its the most thin condom on the markety makes it great for pleasure . I mean , if there was stubs or ribs ... it may be better for her pleasure , but as a personal pleasure it ranks at the top . `` LIKE nothing is there at all.However , this condom is a little too snug . Granted being a snug on me which I 'm no Mr ED , but with a girth 5 '' . . it was a snug fit . With a snug fit comes advantages though such as , you know it 'll never slip off . Also a tighter fit prolong the endurance.I still say Durex X-Sensitive is better . Just my opinion .
 Product is great . The feeling is better than any other condom I have ever used .
 Dont waste u r money in the retail shops to buy this sort of items . Crown one fits nice , lubrication is good and it is very thin . . dont know how far it can protect from diseases ...
 keep buying for this ventor for sure ... . Thanks for fast shipment and other . I do n't have negative opinion . Good good good . thanks
 what more can I ask for ? besides the low price point , the condom is so thin that it does n't feel like you 're wearing one.i 've used the brands you can see in the retail store and i tell you , nothing can even compare .
 Best condoms I have ever used . Better than skyn condoms I have used . After I use these 100 I will buy more.I do n't think you can get much better than these .
 this products is excellent , good material , grate price , shipping was faster than i expected , what i have a question in mind . is this product original or pirate ? according to some reviews and some info on different web sites this condoms are not made in japan anymore since a couple of years ago and the ones i received say `` made in japan '' so i do n't know if wear them or not . does anyone know if they might be pirate ?
 I 've been using this brand for about four years with purchase from a couple of different sellers on Amazon . Among the brands I 've used -LRB- Durex , TROJAN etc. -RRB- , this is definitely the thinnest and best I 've had . And my wife really enjoy them .
 This was my second time ordering these condoms and the results are just as the first time . The best condoms I have ever used and I do n't think I can ever go back to the Trojans . Oh and a great value too !
 No Condom will ever be as good as NOT wearing a condom , but these are good . The Crown condoms are very thin . If you have to wear one , I can recommended these .
 These are thin enough to make you forget that you are wearing a condom , but they are a little tight . I am very happy with this purchase . Definitely worth the low low price .
 The title says it all , these condoms are the strongest I have ever had , and the fact they are so thin is whats amazing . They are much better than trojans , and very comfortable .
 Love the idea of a better condom , these are praised by multiple sources on the internet.Thoughts ... Latex smell
 I am not one to toot my own horn , but I have a lot of sex . As a result I go through a lot of condoms and have tried all sorts of brands , flavors , shapes and sizes . All those fancy vibrating ring , glow in the dark condoms can be interesting to try , but they are far too expensive for every day use and most sacrifice feeling for some gimmick.You need a work horse condom , something thin with good feeling , yet strong enough to withstand the rough sex women want . Cost is also a huge issue as any drug store is going to RIP YOU OFF if you have a lot of sex.These condoms are thin , cheap , and a good size . You really ca n't beat them , so I buy them 100 at a time.bow chikka bow bow
 These are one of the best I 've tried . A little bit snug , but not uncomfortably so , these are essentially odorless and the latex Crown uses must be some kind of secret recipe , because it just allows more feeling . The lubrication is very light , which we prefer to the goopy mess that some varieties of condoms exhibit . The pink color is fun , too . The price here on Amazon is almost too low to believe -- the drugstores and big box stores and convenience marts must be making a killing on rubbers since they are sometims over a dollar each ! Great product , cheap enough to try and toss is your opinion is different than mine . Sex is fun -- play with it !!
 I have to say I glad I bought this only its less embarrassing and the product arrived on time . I love using it . Thank for putting this product out .
 I have tried so many different brands of condoms from Trojan to Durex , and I must say that these are the best experience I 've ever had ! I randomly googled best condom brands and this came up as the # 1 award winner for the past 4 years . With the other 7 + different brand of condoms I would probably only climax 50 % of the time due to the constricting nature . However , with the Crowns I 've been able to each and every time.Pros : + Very thin , the closes to nothing ! + DurableCons : - Could use more lubrication - Latex scent
 I absolutely love these things . Condoms have always let me know they were there during the begining , the middle , and the end . Crowns are the only exception to that rule . Once in place , I have to constantly check to make sure that I 'm still wearing a Crown . My Princess loves them as much as I do because I dont loose sensation and therefore my performances are that much better for it .
 These are great . I have never had one break in the three hundred I have used so far . The price is right , for the price of 6 trojans at the local drug store you can have 100 of these . It 's a no brainer ... try these and you wont switch back to your old condoms .
 These are the best condoms I have ever used . Feels like you are not even wearing one . Mine were made in Thailand . I was a bit nervous from some of the reviews I read about them smelling bad . I am ordering another 500 . These are amazing !
 I vehemently dislike using condoms but need to use them ... . I was ready to give up on intercourse but I gave this a try and it made intercourse a worthwhile experience . I 'd prefer not to use a condom but if one had to use one , this would be the one . My partner is almost too large for this but it fits him , very fortunately . Durex extra sensitive , the other competing condom , did not come close to this .
 Awesome condoms , It felt like my husband was n't wearing a condom and he was definitely satisfied with the product too . We will definitely use these condoms from now on : -RRB-
 These condoms are far and away the best I 've ever used . They snuggly to the point that you do n't even feel like you 're wearing it . Highly recommended .
 Like most men , I loathe condoms for their unique ability to kill the moment and suffocate junior to the point where ... well , you know what I 'm talking about ! But this condom is amazingly sensitive , and you can barely tell that it 's there . Goes on fast , and gives you a darn close to bareback feeling . Highly recommend this condom !!!
 Quite simply , these are the best you 'll find . Save yourself the trouble of shopping around . They 're amazing quality , and they 're very cheap.I recommend these very much .
 Product is fine . Nothing wrong with them . I ordered 100 and they came not in a box or anything like you 'd buy at the store , but a manila envelope with 100 condoms packaged together in about rows of 6 or so . Nothing wrong with it , just not what I expected .
 probably the best condom i have ever used . be careful using them as they are extraordinarily THIN ... !! however , the sensation is remarkable.i will buy again .
 These are pretty good for most people I 'm sure . For me they didnt seem that much thinner than Durex Extra Sensatives and they were much tighter but thinner than my normal brand , which for me can lead to some decreased performance . All in all though I think a great choice for average sized guys looking for a good mix of thin and strong -- and a really unbeatable price . They are latex , just fyi . I gave them to some colleagues to evaluate and will let you know . I also got some .002 Okamoto non latex that I will compare too shortly .
 I recently was diagnosed with Facets desease and the pain was excutiating . I was given a Cryopack icepack similar to this one and it did the trick in helping with the pain . I have since purchased 2 of these on for my mother and one for myself .
 One sheet on top and one on the bottom of my lunch bucket and I have a cool lunch . They hold up well and can be cut down to fit . Have used these daily for over three years .
 This is perfect if you plan on using this for lower back pain . I use this one for my lower back , and a gel type that is more flexible for my upper back.If I ever heal it will be perfect for bringing my lunches to work !
 It took me awhile to `` play '' with this to figure out the best way ... Thankfully , it is a very `` flexible '' product , so a movement of the hand transforms its position easily to adjust for individual `` needs '' ... I have always had a great sex life and wonderful orgasms ... However , I now have multiple orgasms of such intensity , it is unimaginable ! Seriously , every time I use this thing , I cum 10-20 times ! I go 30-60 minutes ! Then , the ultimate climax occurs and it is explosive ! I never thought this level of pleasure was possible . I now use this on a daily basis and have incorporated it into my `` partner '' play with my husband , as well . He LOVES it !
 Sturdy , durable product . Shipped discretely . The handle on this model is longer than most like it , which allows for holding it easier . I purchased this a long time ago and it is still working like a charm . It can take a little careful positioning at first to figure out how to use it best , but once you figure it out , you will be quite satisfied!Thanks
 Quality made , durable , easy to clean and quiet . The battery life is better than expected . The cord is very thin , and tangles easily .
 How can anyone tell you what you will like ? I can just tell this is the second one my wife has bought . The first lasted for about 7 years . The motor still worked , the wires going into the battery case finally broke . If you like the idea of a rotating shaft and a very powerful vibrator , this may be the one . My wife has had/has other rabbits and they do n't get used .
 This product changed my life . It 's good quality an very powerful . I highly recommend this toy to anyone that might have a problem going over the edge with just penetration alone . My boyfriend of all people told me I should look into getting this . I 'm glad he was right !
 OMG !! This was my first vibrator ... years ago ... turn it on ... put it on the bed , floor , counter ... watch it walk , roll etc. . . ALL BY ITSELF !!!! Years of pleasure !!!!!
 I sent these fabulous gloves to my best friend , having a hard time resisting sending them at all ... because I wanted them for myself . They are fabulous , and I am looking forward to ordering some for myself . I own the bright pink gloves from Williams Sonoma , which are great , but the fashion award goes out to these Gloveables ... Love em , , , , order now ... these make a great gift for anyone . Thanks for making a fashion statement in the kitchen dear Gloveables ... Fondly , Laura
 these are perfect for the price ... . . great product ... they grip well and are thin at the end and perfect for the job
 I 've tried other tweezers but the quality control is not always there the way it is with Tweezerman . They always line up correctly ! This is a cute and handy thing to carry in a purse or keep in a first aid kit . I got the green tea color , very nice . I like that it comes in a little carry vial .
 These tweezers are great ! I have a pair for my purse and one for my bathroom ! I given them away for gifts too !
 These tweezers are the BOMB ! They are sharp and precise and grip even the shortest , most stubborn hairs and pluck them cleanly out . I threw all my other tweezers away and will only use Tweezerman . They are the BEST !
 I thought the price was going to dictate how this product was since it was so inexpensive but OMG I love it ! It is sharp and the exact size I need . I thought it was going to be a tiny tweezer ... NOPE ! it 's awesome ! I highly recommend !
 Tweezerman makes the best tweezers . It is defiantly well worth the money and you ca n't beat the free lifetime sharpening either .
 By far the best tweezer I have ever used . It 's not hard to grip any hair at all . Had mine for about a year now , and the only problem I ever have is trying to get my boyfriend to not steal it from me . Also , the `` Green Tea '' color is really cute !
 Durable tweezers that work ! At last ! I 've had them for several months now and they are indispensable . I got sick of wasting my money on cheap-o tweezers that are inevitably useless . These are a great pair of tweezers , well worth the money .
 The tweezerman tweezer is perfect . The only issue I had with it was the packaging . It was in a plastic tube that looked homemade . However , the tweezerman did do it 's job and no complaints about the craftmanship for the first time use . I will see how long the craftmanship will last .
 I 've owned Tweezerman slant edge tweezers in the past , and chose to buy them again because they are sharp and keep the edge for a long time . They are guaranteed for life , but the hassle and shipping and handling costs for return just make it easier to buy new ones . I have a pair of small ones for travel and a regular size for regular home use . There are better tweezers out there , but at a much greater price .
 Go Green Mini Slant have been my favorite tweezers since I found them a few years ago . I 've tried the drugstore tweezers , revlon etc , but none lived up to these.Tweezerman has a great reputation and a high price . The Mini Slant makes Tweezerman tweezers affordable , and they work extremely well . No misaligned or dull edges here . And the price is reasonable for a high quality pair of tweezers + they donate to the environment with every purchase of these `` go green '' tweezers . I am on my third pair now - lost one , and I 'm buying a second to have one for home and one for travel . At this price I do n't have to worry so much about losing them -LRB- face it , tweezers are tiny and easy to misplace -RRB- and I can still have the precision , quality , and guarantee of the larger tweezerman while helping the environment . Plus , I like the color and it pops out in my bag or on my counter .
 Coming from bargain tweezers at walmart and target these tweezers are really a step up . Their holding power is great and they do n't flex or slip once they have a hold like lesser brands have in the past . Also , regarding the size I have seen some reviews that state they are too small . I disagree and it is worth noting that the tweezers also come with a protective tube case for storage which is a welcomed extra . I would highly recommend this product and stop wasting money on lesser items .
 These tweezers are definitely worth the price . They 're the best tweezer 's I 've tried . They 're the perfect size . Not too small at all .
 I love Tweezerman tweezers . They truly are the best . I bought these for my purse and diaper bag , for emergency tweezing situations ! ;-RRB- They are as good as the normal sized ones , just in a smaller package . Someone else mentioned the container , that since it is smaller , it is stronger to keep them in than the larger container , and I agree . My larger container broke right away , the smaller one is much more solid . You can not go wrong with these , they will last forever , and Tweezerman offers lifetime sharpening if need be . Even better !
 These are really great . I thought my old pairs were high end -LRB- Revlon -RRB- but I lost one so I did some quick reading on Amazon and decided on these to put in my purse . I picked this color since they would be easy to find . They are so easy to use -LRB- not that you need special skill or anything :0 -RRB- -RRB- . You can get to any single hair very easily and pull once ... my other pair was n't so easy . I surely recommend !
 This is honestly the best tweezer I 've every purchased . The end is sharp and it 's better quality than anything I 've ever bought at a cvs . I own at least 4 other pairs of tweezers , including name brands such as Revlon . This blows them out of the water . It 's great for hair removal and has helped me out with one splinter already . It removed the piece of wood from my foot no problem . The only thing I would not use it for is removing a tick . I go camping whenever I get a chance , but if I get a tick , I wo n't use these as it would kill the tick instantly since it 's very sharp and not be helpful in that scenario . For everyday hair removal , this is a must!Pros : SharpGood qualitySmall/compact sizeSmall carrying tubeCons : Would not be good for removing ticks.Bottom Line : Perfect for everyday hair or splint removal
 Great item as expected from Tweezerman . My only complaint is that they are smaller than normal size and I have large hands .
 These tweezers cost more than the ones at the drug store but they are so worth it . In an effort to save money , I have not been waxing my eyebrows as often . These tweezers may it easy to keep up with my eyebrows in between waxings . If I leave this tweezers out on the bathroom sink , they are known to disappear - My husband loves them and he normally does not comment on mundane things such as tweezers . Great purchase .
 These are great , but they are a little small for my hands . If the length were just a little bit longer , they would be more comfortable to fit in my average-sized adult hands .
 This tweezer is the epitome of what a tweezer should be . It even comes with a little storage case . Ca n't wait for my next splinter ...
 I love tiny gadgets , especially when they prove to be this useful ! I also love my Tweezerman tweezers , so when I saw these , I had to buy them . I just got back from a two week vacation , and these travel well in my purse . They work great , as do my regular tweezers . They are not just cute . They are functional !
 These little tweezers are great . I have struggled with getting tweezers to grab eyebrow hairs , but these are so effective . I will buy Tweezerman again !
 Tweezing is never fun but this tweezer makes the process efficient . It grabs even the finest strand and removes it in one try . I 'm so glad that I purchased the Tweezeman Mini Slant Tweezer .
 These are the best tweezers I 've ever used for eyebrow plucking . Also , I love the little clear plastic storage container they include with the purchase -- makes them easy to store and locate in my over-stuffed medicine cabinet .
 These tweezers will tweeze anything that needs tweezing.What more can you ask for . I smile every time I use them , whether removing a splinter from my hand or mangrooming my eyebrows.Excellent product that I fully expect to have for years and years .
 I bought this to pull cactus needles out of my body in case I should take a digger while riding my mountain bike . Fortunately , no need for that yet , but I did ride through a cactus patch and had to extract tons of small needles from my tire . These worked great for doing that small detailed grabbing . Really happy so far . Hopefully I 'll never need them to remove cactus needles from my person ...
 These are the best tweezers I have ever used . I had heard good things about Tweezerman tweezers and wanted to try them , but was daunted by the high price tag . After finding this pair of mini-tweezers for half the price I had seen them in stores , I took the opportunity to buy a pair and have been very satisfied with the results . The sharp edges allow for precision hair removal and have not appeared to dull in the weeks I have owned and used the product . Also , the `` mini '' tweezers are sufficient for everything I need . I do n't see a reason to pay more for a larger pair . These tweezers are superior to anything you will find in stores in this price range . I highly recommend them .
 The tips on these tweezers are very precise / sharp . They come in a nice little storage tube with tip protectors . These a way better than drugstore tweezers such as Revlon brand , which have relatively blunt tips.I think these may be hard to use if you have large hands , since they are very small .
 Got these in a bright color so I could find them in my purse easier . They work great .
 Sorry in advance for the boring everyday review
 This product is really good - love how it has a good grip - mini tweezer is perfect to keep in my purse . Would recommend this product .
 I 've loved every Tweezerman product I 've owned , and these are no exception . Comfortable to use , nice finish , and sturdy construction . Also , pink !
 Tweezers that tweeze should be an easy find , but it is n't . These work just like they should and they 're easy to hold on to , too .
 Best ever tweezers with lots of grab for very little grip . Bought several of these for gifts after trying to use my wife 's .
 High quality tweezer , blades well aligned and precision made . Use in travel kit in place of original tweezers . Would recommend .
 A FEW YEARS BACK I HAD A PAIR OF ALL SILVER REVLON TWEEZERS THAT WERE MY FAVORITE , BUT I LOST THEM . EVER SINCE I 'VE BEEN TRYING DIFFERENT REVLON TWEEZERS SINCE I HAVE N'T SEEN THE SAME ONES EVER SINCE . I BOUGHT A PAIR THAT LOOKED GOOD JUST A COUPLE MONTHS AGO , BUT THEY WERE N'T VERY SHARP AND ARE ALREADY WORN OUT . THIS PAIR OF TWEEZERS ARE RIGHT UP THERE WITH THE REVLON ONES , BUT ONLY BETTER BECAUSE THEY ARE MADE OF STAINLESS STEEL . THEY ARE REALLY STARP AND GET EVEN HAIRS THAT LOOK LIKE THEY 'D BE HARD TO GRAB . I LOVE THESE AND I 'M PLANNING ON GETTING THE LARGER SIZED ONES IN THE NEAR FUTURE JUST TO HAVE AN EXTRA PAIR . TOTALLY WORTH PAYING ALMOST TWICE AS MUCH AS OTHERS SINCE LAST FEW PAIRS I 'VE BOUGHT DO N'T WORK NEARLY AS WELL AND GET SO WORN THAT THEY HAVE TO BE REPLACED WITHIN A FEW MONTHS .
 I only ever buy Tweezerman Tweezers . They are the best tweezers and worth the extra money . This product is the same quality that I have come to expect , and were such a good deal . They are smaller but the tips and the feel of it are exactly the same as the $ 20 + full size . What a deal , I 'm going to come back and pick up some more .
 OK I admit it is a wee bit smaller than I thought it would be but either my old tweezers really sucked or else this one is a high performance one . I love how precisely it grabs hair and pulls it out , and leaves nothing behind . I used it for eyebrows and above lips and love the performance . I am so glad I decided to throw away the old tweezers . Great performance , thank you Tweezerman ! So far , you got a customer for life !!
 I ordered this on a whim and I am using to remove splinters and such . It `` s a Good Item and a lot of help .
 I ordered these via Amazon prime to deal with a splinter that I had gotten and they worked.These simple stainless steel tweezers are the best that I 've used and have a great name . TWEEZERMAN .
 i have searched high and low for tweezers that work . as a woman , there are always those hairs that are unreachable . these tweezers , although small , are sharp and do the job . they have made it so that i no longer have to get my eyebrows done once a month .
 I have owned this tweezer in the pink color for about two years now . Imagine my surprise when I caught my husband sneaking into my makeup bag a few nights ago to borrow my pink tweezerman tweezers . The nerve ! So this week I purchased him his own set in silver.I LOVE that they come in their own protective tube . They stay super sharp , even after a few years of regular use . They are small so if your hands are large or you have problems manipulating small things , you may want the standard size model . That said , my husband seems to like them just fine . Amazon 's price is better than that at the beauty store . Prime shipping makes them a deal .
 used these alot already . they have a great tip and good grab.serious tweesin . and they fit into any go bag
 As per always Amazon Prime delivered on time . I am a great believer in Tweezerman tweezers they really work . I used to buy the cheap drug store ones which never worked really well . I just could n't overcome my aversion to the price , however my niece lent me hers and I was sold . These particular tweezers are a great size for purse or travel . I ordered two one for my bedside and one for my purse . They have all the grabbing power of the full size tweezers but are compact . The colors are cute too . They also make terrific stocking stuffers as well . I highly recommend them .
 I am very happy with my purchase . the delivery was timely and the package was completely undamaged . the tweezers work GREAT and i dont think they 're to small . I am able to handle and grip them very well . Also the tweezers come with a plastic tube to store them in . I guess it 's just in case you drop them ? they wont misalign ? Anyways im very happy . No cons : D
 Lightweight , compact and functional . There are many tweezers on the market but few show the quality and edge of these . They are well worth their price and you wonl ' t be dissapointed .
 Tweezerman is the leader in the field for a reason . These bad boys are super sharp and extremely efficient , and make eyebrow upkeep a breeze . Do n't waste your time looking at anything else , these are the perfect purchase , and the mini size is great for travel and carrying around in my to-go makeup bag !
 good emergency/travel option , def would n't recommend as your main tweezer though . Not as sharp as it used to be , it 's been 2 yrs now i think ?
 I bought this tweezer two years ago and it works great . It 's the best tweezer out of all the other tweezers that I 've bought and tried . The way you hold them and the way the tweezer grabs is just perfect . I 'm thinking of buying another just to have a spare even though it 's a little pricey for a tweezer but It 's awesome .
 These are the perfect size . Perfect little `` travel tube '' to store them in . These tweezers will grip ANYTHING and it either gets removed from where your plucking or what you 're plucking breaks in half.Absolutely perfect and I hope I have them forever . * Size is perfect for me and probably 85 % of all users , if you have LARGE hands , i.e. Large or XL size gloves you would want the NON-Mini version *
 Same sharpness and function as the regular Tweezerman in a smaller size . Not at all harder to hold or use.Much more convenient in my opinion . I use these as my everyday tweezers . Gets all the fine hairs . . very sharp.What else to say ? If you have trouble pulling hair or are always pulling the same spots over and over , get these . Gets most hairs on the first pull.Also , the price is right here on amazon . Around 30 % less as these sell for around fifteen bux in the drug store .
 these tweezers have are very keen-edged and offer all the functionality of the standard tweezer , only they are tiny . in some ways this makes them easier to handle and use , and i love the color .
 These are great ! I had n't held out hope before I got them . I had ordered the larger pair of Tweezerman Tweezers and they literally would n't connect at the tip to even pull a single hair , so I figured these would n't be any better . However , when these arrived , they are GREAT . I must have gotten a bad pair with the other ones .
 These are great for keeping in your bag or taking on trips . They 're just like the full-size slant tweezers , only shorter . I 've very happy with them . The fact they plant a tree for each of these purchased is an added bonus .
 Not much to say here , except this is a high-quality , well made tool , and is about ideal as a tweezer .
 Very easy to use , great tweezer for a great price ! Is only a bit smaller than a standard sized tweezer but it works EXACTLY the same . what 's even better is it helps anyone who is going ` green '
 Where can I start . I love this brand . I love bright color which help me find it in my cosmetic bag easier . I like the quality.msome people may find the edge sharp , but for me is perfect . It never cut the hair . I bought several different model during the years . All have been awesome .
 Purchased these for a friend as I have a pair myself and they are the BEST tweezers in the world , bar none . I think if you have longer fingers you might wan na spring for the regular sized slant tweezers but since my hands are small these are the perfect size/grip . I have used nothing but tweezerman mini slant tweezers for the past five years . I swear by them .
 Love them . Bought another pair so I could have them when I sent my first ones to be sharpened . Unless I loose them I will never have to buy another pair . Worth the extra bucks . Going to get the ones for splinters for the first aid kit .
 Perfect set of tweezers and excellent price . They actually grab fine thin hairs easily the first time . They are easy to handle .
 Tweezerman is the only brand of tweezers I will ever use . I have tried many others and they just do n't work ! These tweezers are very precise for even the smallest hair . I have always used the mini version to save money-I do n't feel the need to get the full size . Buy these and do n't waste your money on another brand !
 I have used tweezers for years for my eyebrows but these are by far the best I have used . They are small but just right and they can pluck the smallest , finest hairs . Excellent and worth a few extra dollars .
 Did it really need to do anything else ? Plus , it 's made in India!Affordable and serves its purpose . Will purchase again .
 They are definitely a bit on the small side , but work much better than previous pair of tweezers ... and feel much sturdier , even though they are about half the size . If I do get tired of using the &#34; mini &#34; tweezer , I will be tempted to give the normal-sized &#34; tweezerman &#34; tweezers a try . Worth the extra dollar vs the cheap tweezers.NOTE
 My mother asked if I could pick up a new pair of tweezers for her - the pair she has had for over 40 years went missing . I had these delivered to her and she called to tell me they had arrived and that they were awesome . She said she had never seen a pair of tweezers so precise like these and was no longer mourning the loss of her old tweezers . She was used to the older style with scissor type loop/handles and was n't sure how she would do with these with her arthritis , but she said they do a great job and they 're easy for her to hold .
 I have been using the mini slant tweezers exclusively for a few years now . They work best of any I have tried . I use them for eyebrow and chin plucking . Yes , I said chin . I am one of those unlucky girls who gets chin hairs and these tweezers help me keep that info to myself . The only reason I 've bought a new pair is because I inevitably drop the tweezers on the floor and they land on the tip , bending and rendering them useless . If you 're less clumsy than me , they 'll probably last you many years . If you 're just as clumsy , I recommend storing them in the little plastic tube they arrive in , as I am now doing , or keeping them above carpeted areas only .
 Note that the colored coating is n't merely some plasticized dip
 I bought these somewhat on a whim . I have some cheap drugstore tweezers at home that are n't anything special , and I 'd heard good things about this brand . I needed another item to get to my free shipping , so I decided to give these a try . I was so surprised at how much better they are than the cheap ones . I honestly did n't think it mattered what you used - tweezers are tweezers , right ? Wrong ! These really do grab hairs so much better , and are definitely much more precise . I 'm so glad I bought these !
 These are my favorite tweezers , it is the second pair I 've purchased . They stay sharp for ages and pluck with precision .
 definetely a great pair of tweezers ! totally lives up to all expectations and claims ! the size does not affect performance & is very comfortable to use .
 A lot better than what I had . Did not live up to other reviews though . Does rip and miss hairs . Its not magical , but its good .
 My mom needed a really good pair of tweezers so I got her the best , she loves them more than any pair she has ever had .
 It grabs hair better than any tweezer I have ever used . The mini is fine for me but it is small so you may want to get the regular size .
 That 's fine , cause it works great , but be prepared to receive a tweezer about the size of your pinky . Best for small handed women !
 I just recently lost my pair of Tweezerman Slant tweezers this past week after having them for about 15 years . These things are the best . I would dare somebody to try and take them from me ! Haha I was upset to learn that I no longer had them as I looked everywhere for days . It 's possible somebody took them as I had them with me at work -LRB- do n't ask -RRB- . Either way , I am ordering another pair in hopes that I will have them for many years to come . Definitely a great purchase and worth the money ! Generic tweezers just do n't stand up to these !!! Take it from a woman who plucks her eyebrows on a regular basis .
 Love these tweezers . Would order nothing but Tweezerman products , because they stand behind their product . Gets the tiniest hairs ! Shipped promptly and I am very satisfied .
 These tweezers are perfect for pulling any an all hairs in and around the face . . nose . . and ears . . they are very good at grabbing the hairs allowing them to be pulled effectively . .
 Very sharp , nice and compact for travel , and easy to grab those &#34; hard-to-get &#34; whiskers that we all hate so much !
 Tweezerman tweezers are excellent products . I have a couple of different ones they make . All are top quality and work as expected for the price .
 I bought this tweezers because I 've tried several tweezers from the department stores and could never get exact precision . I highly recommend this product , works better than any tweezers I 've owned !!
 This item works as it should , well made and worth the money . No slipping , firm grip nice color , easy to use
 I just needed a small pair of tweezers to use for the random stray eyebrow hair that grows once in a while , or the splinters I get from time to time . These come in a small plastic case and they work great .
 I love this product ! I have always had trouble with tweezers , because my hands shake and hair tend to slip out of the grip of the cheap tweezers I would get at the drug store . With these , I get a hair in one try ! It cuts down my grooming time quite a bit , and is also a really convenient size for carrying in a purse or bag .
 I 've been wanting a Tweezerman for awhile now . I finally decided for the mini in case I did n't like it . I instantly fell in love with it after using it . It grabs my hairs precisely and I love the mint green/green tea color ! :-RRB- I ca n't wait until I get a full size later on ! Very happy and satisfied with my purchase !
 These tweezers allow for a good grip , are a nice color , and do the job well ! No complaints and I 'm glad I chose these tweezers !
 This product is sometimes hard to find so we try to stock up on it . Best taste of all the protein powers we have tried .
 I ordered this with some trepidation , having used electric razors before and found them pretty useless ... ineffectual.I used disposable razors for years but ultimately got tired of carving myself up & stopped shaving altogether . Then I read a review of the newer electrics elsewhere , which referred to this model as the `` BMW of shavers '' . They also noted many people were equally satified with the lower end model-so I came to Amazon looking for that one , and found this , reconditioned for about the same price.I have to admit that I bought it fully expecting not to be satified but got a pleasant suprise . It is almost as close as a razor ! All that said , if you 've been unsatified with other electrics , this one is worth a try .
 DHA Neuromins are good for your brain ... and are a veggie substitute for fish oils ... great for people with fish or iodine allergies.Easy to swallow without additives .
 From all literature that I have read DHA really does many beneficial things for us . As I am retirement age anything that helps with retaining brain cognition is interesting to me .
 I ordered DHA neuromins -LRB- I 've tried both 100 mg and 200 mg -RRB- to see if they would reduce my vasomotor rhinitis symptoms -LRB- uncontrollable sneezing when I get up in the morning , followed by runny nose for ~ 45 min . -RRB- , and sometimes several more episodes of this throughout the day . They seem to reduce the symptoms , particularly at higher doses -LRB- I got as high as 800 mg/day -RRB- , but not get rid of them completely . On the other hand , unlike fish-based DHA , this has no unpleasant smell or aftertaste at all . They are completely benign gel capsules , easy-to-swallow and inoffensive . An unexpected plus seems to be that I have less of an urge to take a nap in the afternoon while using these , I feel as though I make it through the day without needing to take a cup of tea so I can keep going . So , I 'll keep taking these for a few more months to see if the trend continues .
 UPDATE
 Scott 's . Flushable wipes make you secure in knowing you are clean and fresh and is the fastest biodegradeale wipe . Everyone should use them .
 I 've been using triple ginseng formulas for a few years now -LRB- this boomer needs some extra &#34; oomph &#34; ! -RRB- , and this one works well and is at a good price .
 The effect with this stuff is mild for me . I feel slightly in better spirits . Have less social anxiety . I am so happy to have something that improves my life like this . I would not ever take RX drugs , I do n't have such major issues as to need them and I think they are unhealthy . Its great to have a natural AND organic -LRB- that 's a big one for me with supplements -RRB- that makes me slightly calmer .
 This came to me in a single unit , blister pack-plastic card . Works great in my fan wall switch.No problem installing or having the fan start right up when the electronic switch was pushed on.This is a good thing .
 I have been taking garlic for several years , but it got so the typeI was taking bothered my digestive tract . Switched to this and havehad no problems .
 I have been using this throughout the years & my cholesterol was fine , but I had stopped for a while . Then not too long ago my cholesterol was extremely high & the Dr. wanted to put me on some prescription meds . So I started an excersize program , changed my eating habits & added this to my diet again for maintenance . So far so good , no meds .
 This is a good product at a reasonable price .
 I 've been taking this for 2 months now . Lowered my cholesterol by 30 pts last Dr 's visit . Hope to lower it further for next Dr 's appt in one month . This is a miracle product for me .
 This is excellent product that really improves overall cholesterol levels . My overall went from 205 to 135 in 12 months . I also changed my eating habits . I got rid of the red meats , diary , and other high fat foods . Now I eat a low fat high protein diet that consist of vegetables , turkey , chicken , soy products , and fruit .
 When one is mobility compromised , it is difficult to lift legs into a car , bathtub , etc. . The leg lifter works and it does n't matter if it gets a bit wet !
 If you ordinarily take showers , your feet do n't get the automatic exfoliation they would in a tub . This item fills the void very nicely . Regular use -- several times a week will do it -- can make a positive difference in how your feet look . It 's also a nice start to your weekly pedicure . If you spend a lot of time on your feet , you 'll probably find the bubble feature to be especially nice . -LRB- If you add a few drops of liquid soap , give it a quick rinse before putting it away to avoid build up . -RRB- I 've had mine for over a year , and I like it . But if space is an issue in your home , you may want to consider these questions before you buy :1 . Where will you use it ? I would not recommend this be used on most carpeted surfaces . There is a tiny fan on the bottom . Also , the vibration feature makes the water splash somewhat . -LRB- The hood helps somewhat . -RRB- Over time , this may be a problem -- especially if you live where the humidity is high .2 . Where will it live when not in use ? This is fairly large in size . Check out the product dimensions so that you can identify its future home before you buy it .3 . Where will you put it to drain ? This needs to drain and dry completely before being put away . Deciding how to do this in advance will put you ahead of the game.Since I start with warm water and do n't soak for more than five minutes , I ca n't speak for the quality of the heat feature . But the cord is a decent length , and overall this footbath is worth at least four stars . The only negative thing
 The orthopaedic surgeon that replaced both my knees said that I have the `` uglest feet '' he has ever seen . I was n't offended because I have the same opinion . The WaterPik Sport Foot Spa does n't make them any less ugly but it certainly makes them feel better .
 We bought 2 of these for Christmas gifts . I would n't have paid $ 40 for them but they were an excellent bargain at $ 10 each . I should have bought one for myself .
 Unable to use this item . Requested return . Have worked out a workable agreement with seller . Could n't be happier with solution
 Excellent nautral product for blood pressure , have been using it for several years , we reccommend to anyone , my husband and I both use it .
 It a good product for people with high cholesrerol . I have been using it for 10 years . It is formulated to bind fat and eliminate from the system .
 I must say I first saw this on the Dr. Oz Show & ordered this along with other supplements from Amazon due to the price and quality of their products . I use this product in conjunction with Raspberry Ketones , & Green Coffee Bean Extract , & exercise . I have noticed that I have lost more inches since adding this into my supplementation regimen . Just be mindful to drink at least 8 ounces of water/fluid with this because it is a dietary fiber & can cause constipation if you do not consume enough liquids . I can actually see the fat in the stool -LRB- not to be so graphic -RRB- , but I can . It also keeps me regular . I will continue to take this supplementation as along as I keep seeing the results . I am a Nurse Practitioner & I have suggested this to many of my patients who desire to lose weight . Just try it and see for yourself . I 'm sure you will be pleased .
 I started taking Chitosan around the 13th of Nov. . I wore a size 16-18 in pants . I am a 46 year old truck driver so losing weight was very difficult . I was taking two pills ,20 minutes before each meal . By Christmas I was down to a 13 pants . 30 days I lost 4 pants sizes ! I did n't change what I ate and I did n't exercise any more than usual . I did how ever have to go buy new pants ... lol . Now I only take it once a day every other day to maintain my size . I hope it does the same for you .
 Not what I expected , made my stomach a little more upset their normal chealated magnesium , which is why I only gave it four stars instead of 5 . I had the longer pills and they were actually preferred because like i stated I did not have issues with my stomach .
 Arm & Hammer is the only antiperspirant I have ever used that is totally ` irritation free ' . All other antiperspirants I have used irritated my underarms . I have gotten rashes , prickly heat , redness and itching from the use of all other products . I began using Arm & Hammer Powder Fresh Antiperspirant about 9 years ago . Since then , my underarms feel , and smell like a newborn baby 's . Soft , clean , and fresh ! Outstanding product !! I would recommend it to anyone .
 I have taken several different prescription meds for my blood pressure and they all made me feel worse , i found this one time when i didnt have the money to go back to the dr. to switch meds again , on the advice of one of the reps who was at the store stocking it , and i have to say it has worked for me very well . it makes me tired sometimes but not too bad , anyway its worth a try .
 Molicare Super-Plus Briefs , purchased thru amazon , has excellent absorbency and is suitable for all night use.However , it is difficult to put on.Wish we had a comparable briefs , but with elastic bands .
 This diaper is very comfortable and discreet . It paper back but still quiet . Plus i have not had one leak on me yet !
 This is a great product for teens and smaller adults that need protection . There are fewer options when it comes to products in this size and thank goodness this is a good one . The diaper itself is very absorbent and protects well against leaks . As a bonus the plastic outer cover is very soft and quiet making them discrete as well . Most `` cloth like '' covers are uncomfortable and rub on your inner thighs but this one is soft and smooth .
 So my boobs were bigish -LRB- 34 big b -RRB- in high school and slowly began to shrink till I was a small a. I 'm 27 . I hated it and went on the search for how to correct my problem . Researched it and found fenugreek is really good for you and mothers use it to help with milk production . Since its your glands that make your boobs big not just fat , that 's what it wanted.I 've been taking it for about 1.5-2months now . I have already increased at least one cup size ! And NO I am not lactating . Phew ! Of course when your breasts are growing they can be quite tender and mine def are but it is worth it ! I 'm filling out so I 'm becoming perky and firm again.I did n't get this from Amazon , picked it up at whole foods but its cheaper here .
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 I 'm sure you 've all been in the same position . You really want to wash your feet , but only a fully run bath will do . Well that 's where this little beauty comes in . You can sit back comfortably , supported securely above water-level , safe in the knowledge that your feet alone are being cleansed.Rumour has it that an accompanying foot stool is in development , allowing consumers to enjoy the pleasure of a long soak without the inconvenience of actually getting wet .
 This pill crusher works easily and quickly . The design includes storage for a number of pills -LRB- 3 compartments , 1 small , 2 smaller -RRB- which is a neat extra . One good feature about the crusher is that the crusher and its bowl are half-sphere shaped , so there are n't any crevices in which the resulting powder can get stuck . -LRB- I tried another model whose crusher is cone shaped and the powder gets stuck in the tip . -RRB- The down-side of this product is that the splitter opens readily . This is probably useful for people who have limited hand-strength , but I do n't like it . I would like to be able to toss the crusher in my handbag and take it with me , but because the splitter opens so easily I need to be careful where I put it , so I do n't accidentally cut myself on the splitter 's razor . Also , I 've seen better splitters on the market . I would prefer if the product were designed so I could take off the splitter entirely.We use this for crushing only . For that it is excellent .
 HAVE USED SIMILIAR DEVICE FOR OVER 30 YEARS - SENISIBLE , PRACTICLE ITEM FOR USE WITH PEOPLE WITH SWALLOWING WHOLE PILLS , ETC. . . TRUST MANUFACTURER WILL CONTINUE TO PRODUCE SUCH ITEMS .
 I was looking for a lube that was not sticky or smelly and this product is great!For the price and the amount of lube you get , this product will provide enjoyment for you and your significant other for some time .
 This is ok , water clean up is easy . but I like the flesh lube you get with the flesh light better . So I ordered a a different tube after trying this one for a bit .
 this is a great lube me a my girl frend love it the only issue is its hard to get out of some `` areas ''
 i usually use ky jelly but i heard this kind was better and it sure is . its slicker and more pleasant than ky. .
 This stuff is slick . Just a pea sized drop does the trick and it does n't chafe . Will deffinatly buy from these guys again
 I have n't much to say about this product other than it gets the job done and I have no complaints ! Do n't go for the jelly - go for this instead ! It 's much better .
 It works well . . it 's not greasy and it does n't get `` gummy '' . It 's fairly cheap and gets the job done!Good product
 it does n't dry quick ... but i guess since its water based it does n't feel that much of ... slippery but i like it ! n ill buy more . however i wan na try that KY one before i buy this product again
 Okay look , this is lubricant ... and it lubricates . Whatever you need to lubricate , this will work . Got a squeaky wheel ? This will take care of it . Need to slide out of a sticky situation ? This will do the job . Need to put a square peg in a round hole ? You need to go see a doctor if you got a square peg .
 This product has a nice scent to it . It also last for a very long time . Was very please with it 's performance . Would recommend this product to others .
 not much to say on this but its lube theres no smell which was good other wise it did its job and would def order again
 It 's a pretty good basic lube and it 's cheap . Shipping was fast . If all you need is some lube I would recommend it , but if you 're looking for a better experience there is probably better out there
 My Gf loves it and she said for anal play that its the best thing ever to use in place of her OWN `` lube ''
 i bought this to use with my fleshlight . it works well and is very easy to clean up . feels great very smooth without decreasing texture and feeling .
 I got this a while ago and have been using it . Love it , it does n't take much at all and it washes away easily from unwanted places . If I need more lubricant there is a very good possibility I 'll be getting another bottle of this stuff .
 This is the best stuff ever . It stays wet for an hour and is great if you 're jacking off or having hand sex with a friend
 This was a gift to a friend , and therefore I can not rate . If I get any feedback , I will update this rating at a later time .
 I bought ID glide from a store and paid way more than I will pay for my next bottle from Amazon . Many of the lubricants dry on the skin quickly , this does not . It 's not a massage lotion . But it does let your stuff slide and glide for long enough . I use it with a vacuum device and ID stays slippery and does n't `` chill '' . The other lubes dried out and made my penis cold . ID has no taste in case one was concerned about that .
 Hands down this the best stuff around . Do n't waste your time with the other stuff laying around . This lube is easily cleaned up and has the slipperiness that is best for tight holes .
 I suppose that like most women I had always assumed that I produced enough lubricant naturally , and that bottled lubricants were for older women or those with some sort of a physical problem . Well , I have learned differently ! During extended foreplay a woman 's natural lubricants are n't always enough to keep her experiencing the optimum of pleasure . A lubricant such as this one reduces or eliminates unpleasant friction , and it makes everything slide smoothly and pleasantly along.ID Glide is a water-based lubricant , which means that it is unlikely to promote a yeast infection , and it is quick and easy to clean up . Unlike silicone and oil-based lubricants it is friendly both to your body and to your toys.Also , beyond all that , I have learned that ID Glide makes an excellent massage fluid . Its thick formula means that it wo n't simply run off , but can placed where you wanted and then spread out and into the skin . ID Glide is both flavor and scent free , which means that it leaves no trace behind and gives it a natural feel to it that I love . Buy one of the larger size bottles , such as this one , so that you can give a great massage , and not feel like you have to scrimp with the lubricant!Overall , I love the feeling I get when I use ID Glide , and know that you will too . I highly recommend this product to all adults!FYI
 Great product . Good price . Arrived quickly and discretely . Easily washes off . And now I have to go back and play some more . Good times .
 This is a great personal lubricant that does n't dry up TOO quickly . When it dries it is n't AS sticky as other lubes , however it is still sticky . I suppose it 's average really . Be forewarned that it DOES smell like bubble soap . It is n't noticeable unless it 's near your face so it should n't be that big of an issue . It 's not too watery , but not too thick . A little goes a long way when mixed with saliva or a few drops of water as recommended .
 very good product . . The name fits it PERFECTLY lol . It just kind of has like this slight glue smell , very minor hardly can smell it . It was about time I got it to . first time I order it & never got it . The second time I finally got it & fast to .

 this is a very good lubricant you dont need to use much . i would recommend it to eveyone weather you need it or not .
 It 's not too expensive , it tastes okay , it 's smooth and effective , it seems pretty safe to use a lot of . Good experiences using it inside and outside condoms and for manual play for both parties in my heterosexual relationship . A good bet ! Get the next size up : -RRB-
 this stuff is super slick , but dries out a little too quick for me . but it works as advertised . definitely get the big size though
 it feels sticky and dry if it last too long , it 's better to add some water on it to keep it wet .
 Excellent thing , my wife loved . Like a travel size . Ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok
 It may be small but it feels good to use . You do n't need to too much unless it leaks out .
 Yup , it 's lubricant . And no matter what you 're using it for , where the hole is . It works and does its thing , quite well . It lasts with my SHH and with my Aneros , and has n't irritated anything . Enjoy !
 What a quick shipper . Had a basket of items for a bachelor party and the icing was this little bottle .
 ID glide personal lubricant works as intended , but gets sticky after short period of use , then becomes a distraction . we actually use this product when we cant find the KY brand lube .
 Most lubes irritate me . But this works very well ! :-RRB- Very fast shipping . I know people were complaining about it smelling like bubbles . But i did n't think i did . I would recommend .
 This is a great product for intimacy and reduction of friction . I am very glad that I found this product so I can readily have it available .
 This lubricant worked extremely well for me and my husband . I was allergic to a previous lubricant so this has put the enjoyment back into our sex life !
 It works just great ! Thanks to this magic potion my girlfriend is willing to go places no man has gone before ! Super slippery goop that we 're both enjoying a ton .
 Works as described . Does n't dry out and gets the job done . 5 stars . This stuff is a lot better then any other stuff in my opinion .
 A B F F F F F F F FF FFFF F F F F F F F F F BBBKDKF DD
 Well worth the money , this is good stuff and it lasts a long time . It doesnt just wear off right away .
 I really was n't expecting much from this - bought it to get my cart over $ 25 - but I 'm really impressed . Feels much nicer than any of the &#34; big brands &#34; you can get in stores and has a good consistency -LRB- not runny but not too thick -RRB- . This is all we use now and we really like it .
 Ca n't complain anything about it , really . It helps you get the job done . It 's pretty cold at first , though so good luck with that .
 The product overall is about 5/5 stars . The only problem I have is when you run out , getting the tiny least bit out could be an issue . It 's my second favorite lubricant for maximum pleasure . It does smell a bit like bubbles a bit , but not too noticeable . Great size bottle to keep in your purse , or put somewhere discreetly .
 I personally like this , but it dries too fast . I constantly need to reapply this after a few minutes . The feel of this is pretty nice , and the consistency is a little thick but overall I thought this was pretty good .
 Works like a charm . I use it on my GF when we do Anel . She loves it even more then I do , KY jelly does n't have a thing on this . just a saiyen yo !!!
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update

I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !

 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all .

 A few years ago I suffered a shoulder injury , 9 months later I was still in pain , with limited range of motion . A friend recommended these packets by Enzymatic Therapy . After using them daily for about 6 weeks there was marked improvement , in another 6 weeks I had no pain and full range of motion . I highly recommend this product ! Just ordered a supply , for my knee ... am expecting great results .
 It works just great ! Thanks to this magic potion my girlfriend is willing to go places no man has gone before ! Super slippery goop that we 're both enjoying a ton .
 I really was n't expecting much from this - bought it to get my cart over $ 25 - but I 'm really impressed . Feels much nicer than any of the &#34; big brands &#34; you can get in stores and has a good consistency -LRB- not runny but not too thick -RRB- . This is all we use now and we really like it .
 Ca n't complain anything about it , really . It helps you get the job done . It 's pretty cold at first , though so good luck with that .
 The product overall is about 5/5 stars . The only problem I have is when you run out , getting the tiny least bit out could be an issue . It 's my second favorite lubricant for maximum pleasure . It does smell a bit like bubbles a bit , but not too noticeable . Great size bottle to keep in your purse , or put somewhere discreetly .
 I personally like this , but it dries too fast . I constantly need to reapply this after a few minutes . The feel of this is pretty nice , and the consistency is a little thick but overall I thought this was pretty good .
 Works like a charm . I use it on my GF when we do Anel . She loves it even more then I do , KY jelly does n't have a thing on this . just a saiyen yo !!!
 this stuff is super slick , but dries out a little too quick for me . but it works as advertised . definitely get the big size though
 it feels sticky and dry if it last too long , it 's better to add some water on it to keep it wet .
 Excellent thing , my wife loved . Like a travel size . Ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok
 It may be small but it feels good to use . You do n't need to too much unless it leaks out .
 Yup , it 's lubricant . And no matter what you 're using it for , where the hole is . It works and does its thing , quite well . It lasts with my SHH and with my Aneros , and has n't irritated anything . Enjoy !
 What a quick shipper . Had a basket of items for a bachelor party and the icing was this little bottle .
 ID glide personal lubricant works as intended , but gets sticky after short period of use , then becomes a distraction . we actually use this product when we cant find the KY brand lube .
 Most lubes irritate me . But this works very well ! :-RRB- Very fast shipping . I know people were complaining about it smelling like bubbles . But i did n't think i did . I would recommend .
 This is a great product for intimacy and reduction of friction . I am very glad that I found this product so I can readily have it available .
 This lubricant worked extremely well for me and my husband . I was allergic to a previous lubricant so this has put the enjoyment back into our sex life !
 I was looking for a lube that was not sticky or smelly and this product is great!For the price and the amount of lube you get , this product will provide enjoyment for you and your significant other for some time .
 This is ok , water clean up is easy . but I like the flesh lube you get with the flesh light better . So I ordered a a different tube after trying this one for a bit .
 this is a great lube me a my girl frend love it the only issue is its hard to get out of some `` areas ''
 I bought ID glide from a store and paid way more than I will pay for my next bottle from Amazon . Many of the lubricants dry on the skin quickly , this does not . It 's not a massage lotion . But it does let your stuff slide and glide for long enough . I use it with a vacuum device and ID stays slippery and does n't `` chill '' . The other lubes dried out and made my penis cold . ID has no taste in case one was concerned about that .
 Hands down this the best stuff around . Do n't waste your time with the other stuff laying around . This lube is easily cleaned up and has the slipperiness that is best for tight holes .
 I suppose that like most women I had always assumed that I produced enough lubricant naturally , and that bottled lubricants were for older women or those with some sort of a physical problem . Well , I have learned differently ! During extended foreplay a woman 's natural lubricants are n't always enough to keep her experiencing the optimum of pleasure . A lubricant such as this one reduces or eliminates unpleasant friction , and it makes everything slide smoothly and pleasantly along.ID Glide is a water-based lubricant , which means that it is unlikely to promote a yeast infection , and it is quick and easy to clean up . Unlike silicone and oil-based lubricants it is friendly both to your body and to your toys.Also , beyond all that , I have learned that ID Glide makes an excellent massage fluid . Its thick formula means that it wo n't simply run off , but can placed where you wanted and then spread out and into the skin . ID Glide is both flavor and scent free , which means that it leaves no trace behind and gives it a natural feel to it that I love . Buy one of the larger size bottles , such as this one , so that you can give a great massage , and not feel like you have to scrimp with the lubricant!Overall , I love the feeling I get when I use ID Glide , and know that you will too . I highly recommend this product to all adults!FYI
 Great product . Good price . Arrived quickly and discretely . Easily washes off . And now I have to go back and play some more . Good times .
 This is a great personal lubricant that does n't dry up TOO quickly . When it dries it is n't AS sticky as other lubes , however it is still sticky . I suppose it 's average really . Be forewarned that it DOES smell like bubble soap . It is n't noticeable unless it 's near your face so it should n't be that big of an issue . It 's not too watery , but not too thick . A little goes a long way when mixed with saliva or a few drops of water as recommended .
 very good product . . The name fits it PERFECTLY lol . It just kind of has like this slight glue smell , very minor hardly can smell it . It was about time I got it to . first time I order it & never got it . The second time I finally got it & fast to .

 this is a very good lubricant you dont need to use much . i would recommend it to eveyone weather you need it or not .
 It 's not too expensive , it tastes okay , it 's smooth and effective , it seems pretty safe to use a lot of . Good experiences using it inside and outside condoms and for manual play for both parties in my heterosexual relationship . A good bet ! Get the next size up : -RRB-
 My Gf loves it and she said for anal play that its the best thing ever to use in place of her OWN `` lube ''
 i bought this to use with my fleshlight . it works well and is very easy to clean up . feels great very smooth without decreasing texture and feeling .
 I got this a while ago and have been using it . Love it , it does n't take much at all and it washes away easily from unwanted places . If I need more lubricant there is a very good possibility I 'll be getting another bottle of this stuff .
 This is the best stuff ever . It stays wet for an hour and is great if you 're jacking off or having hand sex with a friend
 This was a gift to a friend , and therefore I can not rate . If I get any feedback , I will update this rating at a later time .
 i usually use ky jelly but i heard this kind was better and it sure is . its slicker and more pleasant than ky. .
 This stuff is slick . Just a pea sized drop does the trick and it does n't chafe . Will deffinatly buy from these guys again
 I have n't much to say about this product other than it gets the job done and I have no complaints ! Do n't go for the jelly - go for this instead ! It 's much better .
 It works well . . it 's not greasy and it does n't get `` gummy '' . It 's fairly cheap and gets the job done!Good product
 it does n't dry quick ... but i guess since its water based it does n't feel that much of ... slippery but i like it ! n ill buy more . however i wan na try that KY one before i buy this product again
 Okay look , this is lubricant ... and it lubricates . Whatever you need to lubricate , this will work . Got a squeaky wheel ? This will take care of it . Need to slide out of a sticky situation ? This will do the job . Need to put a square peg in a round hole ? You need to go see a doctor if you got a square peg .
 This product has a nice scent to it . It also last for a very long time . Was very please with it 's performance . Would recommend this product to others .
 not much to say on this but its lube theres no smell which was good other wise it did its job and would def order again
 It 's a pretty good basic lube and it 's cheap . Shipping was fast . If all you need is some lube I would recommend it , but if you 're looking for a better experience there is probably better out there
 No AmmoniaStreak Free ShineNo FumesVinegar PowerThe first time you use this glass cleaner it will remove all the buildup from other cleaners , which will make everything super shiny . The Kosher vinegar in this product has a very mild scent , hardly noticeable.Other fun uses : Can be diluted with equal parts water and used with professional glass cleaning equipment . Can be poured into your car 's auto washer reserve unit.If you take this around the house and shine up mirrors , the front of the stove , the toaster , chrome in the bathrooms , the windows , mirrors and the glass on pictures ... etc , you will notice your entire house is sparkling . Spring Cleaning has rarely been this much fun . This cleaner and the soy cleanser are delicious products . The soy cleaner has a lime scent and this product has a fresh vinegar scent that reminds me of a mixture my grandma would make up at home to clean the windows.The vinegar is definitely the secret . What you might enjoy most is the mild scent and how you can breathe and clean at the same time ! Unlike other overwhelming window cleaners , this is definitely ammonia free . I cleaned houses for years and this window/glass cleaner tops them all . For superior shine , this is one classy glass cleaner . ~ The Rebecca Review
 Awesome product . With other glass cleaners I feel as if I should quarantine myself from my neighbors for hours after using , but with this cleaner everything was powerfully clean .
 Biokleen glass cleaner is fantastic ! I was not sure what to expect since I typically just use vinegar water . However , I needed something to clean my stainless steel refrigerator . There is minimal to no smell -LRB- which is really important to me -RRB- and does not affect my daughter 's asthma . I am so incredibly pleased and will continue to purchase this for my glass windows and stainless appliances . Please give it a shot .
 I LOVE my Brest Friend pillow ! Get this pillow for two reasons
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names .

 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .

 I really like Oregon 's Wild Harvests vitamins and etc. . It seems to help me and I feel like I can trust the product .
 Since I use this product I do n`t have flu . I live in Ecuador and the climate here is with a lot of humidity . I use this product for like 2 or more years with great results .

 I love this product ... it is the BEST chapstick I have ever used ! Unfortunately , AVEDA has discontinued it . It is/was only $ 8.00 in their stores . To see it for sale for $ 36 is absurd ! Take your chances and try finding it still in stock in an actual AVEDA store if you really need this . Otherwise , they now sell the the Lip Replenishment for $ 14 which supposedly replaced it ... Good Luck !
 Thank you for the quick delivery and the package was small enough to fit in my mail box so I did n't have to visit the post office .
 I 've bought ID Millennium for many years and realized this was a great price for the size being sold . Verified price before I ordered and received exactly the right item and size .
 I 've been using ID products for a over a year now , but I have never used their 100 % silicone lubricant before . I can say that everything they claim is true ! This is an extremely slippery lubricant that takes at least an hour before you have to grab the bottle for more , totally worth every cent ! 5/5 product !
 Love how silky smooth this lube feels ! A bit difficult to handle since it could stain some clothing , but really easy to clean up .
 Great price , and great silicone lube product . It is not sticky and one of the best lubes I have tried . I will buy again ! My husband loves it !
 ca n't say enough about this product . Great for shower fun ... even good for using as a Pre-Shave for those private areas . Just a little bit goes a long way ...
 Love this stuff , it is the best lubricant I have ever used . It is great for all areas that need a little lubricant . Lasts a long long time and only a few drops will do the job -LRB- unless its a marathon session -RRB- . Slick and slippery without the sticky mess you get from water soluble lubes . This is silicone and its the best . A little more money up front , but will last much longer than anything else so the value is outstanding . Pay the money and you 'll see that its worth its weight in gold .
 This lube is very slippery which is awesome in most cases , however it does make it a little unweildy at times . Just a wash with soap water cleans it right up.Also , this lube is better than others because it 's not sticky . When it dries up it just goes away . I actually heard that some people use it as a moisturizer because it helps to trap water in your skin .
 This lube is outstanding . The large bottle will last a LONG time since you do n't need much . Regular water wo n't wash this stuff off , so it 's great to use in the shower , etc , but a little soap will take it right off . No irritation experienced . Great product !
 Silicone lubes do not turn into glue , so you can wake up the next morning without having to pull your junk apart to use the bathroom . Do not use on latex toys . I always wondered what was with that warning . I found out that silicone lubes break down the latex in toys .
 I will admit , this is my first time using lube . It was good though , and not too greasy or oily . Do n't know if there is a taste or not , but no smell . Good value , I would buy again , but still up for trying other stuff maybe .
 This is the best lube to be found . Slick and stays that way . A little goes a LONG way .
 I have been through several bottles of this stuff and it is by far the best I have ever used . Once it is applied you will not have to reapply -LRB- nothing like killing the mood to stop and add lube -RRB- . I am in a committed relationship and we do not use condoms so I can not comment on how well it works with them . I have used this several times in the shower/bath and the results are all ways the same , silky smooth and never sticky . It can leave marks on the sheets but they come out easily in the wash .
 I know this is an odd item to leave a review with but I have to say how much ID has created a product that rocks ! A little goes a long way . No more ` sticky stuff ' I even use to on my legs after shaving , it leaves them silky smooth . I 'm sure I 'll find other uses for it.Tracy
 I have tried numerous lubricants over the years . This silicone lubricant is thicker and longer lasting than Swiss NavyMD Science Labs Swiss Navy Silicone Personal Lubricant , 8 Ouncesand others in its class . If this product came with a pump I would have given it 5 stars . You wo n't be disappointed
 The best silicone lubricant I 've tried . I use none other.It can also offer a thin skin coating for those who work outside in the winter 's drying air.Overall , I will not be without it.Very slippery in the shower !
 I think reviewer Overrated may have experienced ID Glide -- and I would agree with him on all points . ID Millenium is the slickest stuff I 've ever used and it says slick for hours -LRB- so be careful ! -RRB- .
 There are so many lubricants on the market today not to mention variations of taste , even those that go on warm , but this ID is one of the best . Just a few drops is all it takes to get the pleasure rolling . A crystal clear lubricant that does n't feel as oily as KY. . Very slick and works well with latex . heck you do n't even need to worry about foreplay with this stuff on you . Put it on and go !
 We have used this product in the pool and a spa . It stands up to long exposier to water and can even be used as a massage lotion in the water . Overall a great product .
 We had a problem with other lubes and allergic reactions . . even with other brands of silicone based lubes but this one seems to work well and keeps everyone happy worth it to us ... Lasted about 7 months with frequency at least three times a week for special time . Giddy up .
 This is by far the best green cleaner around . I 'm a fairly sensitive person , even when it comes to natural products , but the light , fresh scent of this cleaner does n't bother me , nor does it linger . It 's perfect for damp cloth dusting , mopping the floor , or getting those tough pet stains out of the carpet . Plus , you do n't have to rinse , just wipe and go . It 's so concentrated the gallon lasts for what seems like forever . GREAT PRODUCT .
 I do n't know how Biokleen does it . This is definitely a grease cutter . For the price they charge they 're giving it away . Excellent for real dirty , grimy jobs . I still love Bac-Out and could n't do with out it , this is for heavier jobs . One bottle should last a lifetime .
 Biokleen is the best cleaner available anywhere . It can be used on most any surface . I 've been using it now for several years in my housecleaning business and best of all it 's non-toxic ! The price is great and I received it quickly . I was pruchasing it at my local PCC but they quit carrying it . So thank God my wonderful Amazon had it !!!
 Its great product , very concentrated u need just a little to get a job done , very good customer service thank u very much
 I have been taking one capsule a day for several months and I believe it has helped some . I seem to have less gray hair and my energy is fairly good . I believe I will increase the dosage to the recommended 2 caps a day and see how that goes .

 I use this product and it is a very good value . I recommend this product as it has many benefits .
 I have used supplements for several years to help balance my hormones as I get super moody and eat too much when I do n't . I sometimes drink the herbal teas for women but no longer want to drink teas as it is the summer time and too hot . So , I found Total Woman at my local health food store and gave it a try . Because I had not been drinking my tea , my hormones were really out control when I bought Total Woman so I decided to take the maximum number of capsules , which is 4 . I felt better right away and happy to buy more . I like the cost on Amazon because I paid almost $ 30 at the health food store and with Amazon Prime , I do n't pay shipping . $ 21 is a great buy!Balancing hormones is very important for women . OH ! I also love that this is a multi-vitamin , too . The herbs in this supplement are PERFECT for women 's health . This is a great supplement for a normal healthy woman looking for something to improve the health of endocrine/womanly system .
 I love my Total Woman vitamins . I got my vitamins for a great price and fast delivery . I would definitely order from them again .
 This all natural laundry liquid is easy on my clothes , easy on my septic system . It is non-scented and does not trigger any of my allergies . Stains usually need pre-treatment with a stain remover , a small inconvenience for a great all-around laundry liquid .
 This product has been very helpful , especially when I 've stayed up too late , gotten my `` second wind '' , and ca n't relax . Even when it may be too late to take a `` P.M. '' product because I 'll wake up groggy , taking this product allows me to fall asleep but still wake easily in the morning .
 I use this spray occasionally when I have bouts of sleeplessness . In my experience it works a little slower than some over the counter pills I 've used in the past , but when I fall asleep I stay asleep . Plus I do n't wake feeling groggy the next day . With it being a liquid I was concerned about the taste , but it does n't have any taste or aftertaste . It is only 2 oz , but two or three sprays on my occasional use seemed to last two or three months . This is my 2nd order of this product and I will order again .
 Great for the elderly or anyone who have issue 's with holding on to silverware . Helps my father to continue to feed himself and maintain his sense of independence .
 covered metal bed supports to protect my toes from getting banged up and worked perfectly . I cut them to fit .
 Hopefully you will not have to use this scraper often . . only on burnt droppings . Does a great and very quick job especially if used withthe product for burnt items . Cut the pads in smaller pieces and wash immediately after use and will last a long time .
 his kit is pretty good . The scraper was okay . It got most everything off , but not quite everything . The sponge is soft and works well .
 The pad is just like every other pad and I kind of hate using them because they get icky very quickly but it 's really fine . The scraper is very useful but sometimes you have to really get in there if something got burned and sat for a little while . I would have given this 3 stars BUT , the scraper works even better on my granite countertops than it does on the stove itself . For that alone , I use it all the time to get those little rough patches that are hard to scrub up without being worried about scratching or eroding the finish of the granite . Works especially well in our coffee area where the little bits of sugar get wet and stick to the counter .
 I received a sample of Cerama Bryte cleaner and pad when I purchased my ceramic cooktop . It 's the only product that I use on my cooktop . Later I purchased the scraper for instances when the pad is inadequate . It has proven to be effective as well .
 The blade works when the scrub does n't . Does anyone know how to change the blade and where to buy just the blades ?
 I feel its kind of expensive for plastic razor scraper . I pushed really hard and it did not break ! I only gave it 4 stars due to price.I had to scraper really really hard on one little spot to get it completely clean for 10 minutes . The burnt on grease cerama bryte remover does not work well . I used the remover liquid with the razor while i was scraping to speed the process . It will take me forever to clean my glass top . 1 rating for the burnt on grease remover cleaning solution.i tested the remover solution for 10 , 20 , and 30 minutes . I was not impressed !
 I used just regular ceramabryte and yellow scrubber for months -LRB- I could n't find a store that carried the scraper -RRB- . It does a great job if you are diligent about cleaning . But to get off the small spatter marks that cook on quickly , I needed the scraper . My stove top looked brand new afterward .
 When I first got my cooktop , I forgot and laid a potholder on the hot surface . The vinyl tag melted onto the top . I called the maker and did some internet search for help but did n't really find a fix . I ordered this kit and was able to get most of the stuff off pretty quickly . There was a fine film left so I put a saucepan of water on the affected burner and boiled the water . Once the pan was hot , I took it off the stove and dumped the water out . Most of the residual film stuck to the bottom of my 25 year old Farberware pan and came off easily with a Brillo pad . The tiny amount STILL on the cooktop came off over time and my stove looks fine now . The manufacturer tried to sell me a new top ! The produce set works great for everyday cleaning , too . : - -RRB-
 This tool is small for nice storage and use . The razor or sharp edge works perfect on my flat top stove for scraping off burnt on stuff before I use the rest of ceramabryte prodects to clean it . The razor appears to be replaceable .
 This little scraper saves a lot of &#34; elbow grease . &#34; Will always keep an extra on hand . Good product . Buy one .
 For Glass top stoves ... . this get every bit of cooked on carbon crud !! Buy more than one since these are always sold out at Home Depot ...
 This is the second time I have bought this product as I needed to replace my old one . This is the easiest and best way I have found to clean my ceramic stove .
 After trying numerous natural cleaners , you begin to realize that many are all-purpose , but some just wo n't do every task . If you run out of one cleaner , you ca n't always use another to do the same task . With one bottle of Bi-O-Kleen , you can literally clean everything in your house . This product will even clean mirrors to a streak-free shine . You can use it in the kitchen , bathroom , on walls , for carpet cleaning , to remove laundry stains , clean stainless steel and chrome , shine up plant leaves and even clean toys , RVs , Cars and Boats.Ingredients
 I have been trying `` greener '' products for a few years , but I have n't been to terribly successful . This All Purpose Spray and Wipe Cleaner delivers ! It cleans everything without leaving a residue and it does n't have a strong scent -LRB- a big complaint I 've had with a lot of the products I 've tried -RRB- . My husband and my kids even noticed what a fantastic job it does . Finally , a product that works as promised and that I can feel good about using !
 this is a great natural cleaner that does n't affect my chemical sensitivities . no fumes and works well !
 I love this detergent ! Our clothes are brighter & stains do n't stain ! On a recent trip to my mother-in-law 's she commented on how clean & bright our clothes were -LRB- we have a toddler & a baby -RRB- we washed our clothes in her -LRB- brand name -RRB- detergent & I was shocked at how dingy they looked after coming out of the dryer . We came home & re-washed them in BioKleen & they were as good as new again . I ca n't recommend this enough ! And at only 2 Tablespoons per wash it is extremely cost effective .
 Fennel is a great herbal supplement , and Herb Pharm is top quality . Unlike many other other liquid herbal extracts , here is one that even tastes good . I used to work for a health food store , and we who worked there generally favored Herb Pharm . We knew the representatives , and they explained how with meticulous care and integrity they produced these extracts . I have used Herb Pharm extract liquids for over a decade , always with superior results . Its also great to have this product in the big 4 oz size . I highly recommend it .
 The mineral magnesium is largely overlooked as a nutrient which is essential for good health . Most doctors and laboratories do n't even include magnesium status in routine blood tests . Thus , most doctors do n't know when their patients are deficient in magnesium , even though the majority of Americans are deficient in magnesium . And magnesium deficiency is very important . In fact , magnesium deficiency is a significant factor -- often the major factor -- in many severe illnesses including heart attacks and other forms of heart disease , high blood pressure , asthma , anxiety and panic attacks , depression , fatigue , diabetes , migraines and other headaches , osteoporosis , insomnia , and most cases of muscular problems . Because magnesium deficiency is largely overlooked , millions of Americans suffer needlessly from the foregoing ailments or are having their symptoms treated with expensive drugs -LRB- which often have unpleasant or dangerous side effects -RRB- when many could be cured with magnesium supplements such as this.Anyone interested in learning more about the importance of magnesium and magnesium supplements for good health should acquire and read the excellent and very readable book The Miracle of Magnesium by Dr. Caroyn Dean which is available from Amazon at a very reasonable price . So should their doctors .
 My chiropractor suggested magnesium to help my muscles recuperate from moderately strenuous activities because I tend to ache a lot whenever I do something slightly out of the ordinary . This seems to help a lot . My muscles do seem to recuperate , usually within a day or so , when it used to take much longer.The best price was through Amazon .
 Magnesium Citrate is rather difficult to find . None of the stores in my area carry it . After the company I used to order it from quit carrying it , I found this . I am glad I did . These tablets have a smoother coating than the brand I previously purchased , making them much easier to swallow . I take one in the morning and one right before bed and I have n't had restless leg syndrome since !
 Now is a good brand . I take their products all the time , including this one in the capsule form , which for me is easy to swallow . I 've ordered from All Star Health several times and have always received excellent service .
 Just to inform , the title is inaccurate for V-caps 120 count . They are not 200mg tabs . Serving size is three tabs and there is not an annotation for amount of Magnesium total per serving , i.e. one can not deduce the per tab amount . The bottles I received are 3 tablets = 500mg , ~ 167mg/tab . The other sizes listed all seem to be 200mg/tab stated in descriptions .
 Caution ! They also help with &#34; elimination &#34; if you catch my drift ... I 'm supposed to write nine more words . Really ? OK , here you go !
 Both the powder and the capsules work great for constipation . I had battled with constipation for most of my adult life -LRB- I 'm currently 57 -RRB- until about 3 years ago when I heard a doctor on the radio recommend Magnesium Citrate to a caller and I have n't had any issues since . I take one 200mg capsule in the morning which usually keeps me regular . If I do have a bout -LRB- usually due to travel -RRB- I will take a teaspoon of the powder mixed with a sugar-free drink mix -LRB- country time lemonade -RRB- and by morning I 'm back on track . Be careful tho and do n't mix more than `` one '' teaspoon as you 'll be running to the bathroom with little warning . In addition to keeping you regular Magnesium Citrate has many other health benefits , which I researched prior to ordering . Make sure to visit with your doctor before taking any supplement .
 on a statin , so i take these as supplements . they cut down on the muscle tremors and body pain . wish they could combine the pills in to one pill form factor . you must take 2 as advised .
 I have been taking this product for several years now for IBS , helps for regularity and my bone density test was excellent . Taking 2 pills/day , one morning , one evening works great for me .
 Most of the drug stores , discount stores , etc did n't carry Magnesium Citrate when I tried to find it . When I did find it at the health food store , the price seemed high to me . Amazon was the answer - found the product I was looking for at a very good price .
 I am not an expert on nutritional supplements but everything seems good . Came well sealed and appears as it should . My doctor has me taking Magnesium Citrate while on HCG weight loss diet . I purchased these to save money from buying directly from his office at around $ 15 for 30 pills . Lost 40 pounds so far and 40 more to go .
 I bought this thinking it would help with sleep and restless leg syndrome which I occasionally get after Gym.Honestly , it did nothing in those two areas.It is however helping me with Acid Reflux which I have been suffering from for the last 5 months . Magnesium is like an anti-acid and this product is reducing my heartburn a lot when I take it an hour after dinner at night . GREAT STUFF .
 This product works well for IBS with constipation . I would highly recommend this product to anyone with IBS issues . It works fast too .
 I was not very regular and a natural doctor recommended that I start taking this product . I did and it has worked wonders for me .
 I 'm perfectly happy with this product . I went by ratings & reviews , plus reserching the best kinds before ordering it . I love that it 's a softgel capsul ! It is still a very large pill , but much easier to swallow . I ran out & needed some right away , so bought a bottle of the hard pills . The hard pills are even bigger . The coating makes them hard to swallow & it makes me nauseated . Since I 'm going to need to take it for awhile , I 'm sticking with the softgel . I have to take them because I am taking the 50,000 IU prescription Vitamin D & have suffered &#34; heart symptoms &#34; from it since I began taking it -LRB- palpitations , rapind heart rate , high bp , etc. . After doing research -LRB- my doctor did n't know what was wrong -RRB- , I discovered some people who take it , get these symptoms , especially if they are already deficient in magnesium . If I take the magnesium twice a day , the symptoms ease considerably .
 Unlike most celiac sufferers , I get chronic constipation instead of diarrhea . This product has helped immensely with that , as well as with relieving muscle pain . Magnesium is great for you and we do n't eat enough : -RRB-
 Magnesium Citrate is one of the best absorbed and cheapest forms of Magnesium . I love NOW and trust anything they put out . This seems to have helped immensely !
 I have been using this item daily for several years . No negative effects . No knowledge of specific benefits other than published benefits of Magnesium Citrate.Amazon delivery sevice excellant . Timely delivery .
 Do n't expect a miracle , but it helped a little bit , which is all I can ask . Give it a try it may help you too .
 I dont like the taste of milk but my doctor gave me a wake up call to start using calcium.I am generally not a fan of now foods products because I think they cheap out on quality however , this is truly a good product and my calcium levels have started to improve my bone density .
 In my experience with this `` NOW '' Magnesium Citrate , I have found that if you have any form of inflamatory bowel disease , a little too much of this stuff -LSB- amount varies for the individual -RSB- will give you a very loose stool . While it is still best absorbed by people with Ulcerative Colitis and Crohns compared to other magnesium forms , small doses are indicated , or else you will be staying very near the restroom . That having been said this is the best magnesium product for most people and you get alot for a reasonable price.On the other hand , people with chronic constipation get nothing but good from this product as it makes them very regular very fast.If you need Magnesium in the Citrate form , this `` NOW '' product is an excellent and reasonably priced choice.While we are still pleased with this product my husband no longer plans to continue using it having Crohns , though I will still be taking it , having enjoyed excellent results for over a year .
 My doctor suggested magnesium citrate for my visual migraines . This product is the best-priced I 've found and it works well .
 I have IBS -LRB- constipation one -RRB- and this has really helped me with this issue . I will order this again .
 I rarely write reviews but I felt very motivated to add my two cents here in recognition of how much this product helped me with insomnia and constipation . I took four caps a day and topped it off with a glass of CALM -LRB- another magnesium product -RRB- and felt somewhat better in three days . After two and one half weeks , I was much , much better . While magnesium is in many foods , there 's probably not enough of it anymore so we are all mag deficient . I 'm positive I was because it also helped with a restless leg syndrome problem , and that , after two weeks . Now I take four caps per day , no Calm anymore and supplement with a big serving of raw vegetables each morning -LRB- I cut them up and take them to work in Tupperware -RRB- and of course , constant water . The pills are big but weighty so they do go down pretty easy . Also , taking four , but two at a time is working good for me . Forget melatonin , drugs , laxatives , fiber cereals ... those are not the right solutions . This is . Thanks to all who posted before me and convinced me to try it . After six months of the mag in this form I am even feeling it in my mood -- very calm !
 I usually purchase liquid forms of vitamins and if I cant find liquid I get the clear capsole because most tablet vitamins take forever to desolve in your body . Then its extracted from the body before it can even be absorbed . if you hold this horse pill in your mouth for longer than 10sec ... its starts to desolve . Also if you cut it in halve you 'll see that just under the thin coating its basically a soft chalk consistency . This is great.All that being said , I still use a crusher to grind it up so I can add it to my protein shake w / liquid calcium but I also take 1 pill whole atleast once a day . I know that my body is absorbing the magnessium because every other day I have 2 bowel movements when I 'm use to just 1 a day . I am taking magnesium because it help with my calcium absorbtion . Beause it does increase bowel movements I started out just taking 1 a day to see how that would affect me ... did n't want to take too much and get dihrea . I by mid week I knew I could increase to 2 pills with no problems and then by week 2 I knew I could go up to 3 pill -LRB- 600mg -RRB- . I also know that if I do 4 pills -LRB- 800mg -RRB- that it produces a 2nd bowel movement every other day . I 'm okay with this so now I alternate between either 3 or 4 pills which are taken in 6 - 8hr apart .
 I ordered this to help with symptoms of my chronic fatigue syndrome , particularly what seems to be a lame vascular system , crazy leg bruising , constipation and slight muscle pain . My order arrived midday and i was so excited i took two and promptly fell into the most blissful 2 hour nap , all my muscles just sighed and released and felt delightful . I was incredibly drowsy for the rest of the day and went to bed about 7pm ! So it is a sedative ! which is fantastic as it has replaced my sleeping pills at night . 2 pills makes me feel drowsy the next day so i just do one at night . Overall a lot more regular , not perfect but much better and my stomach is so flat ! I couldnt believe it ! Bruising is still rampant and i have dark circles under my eyes in the mornings , but they arent puffy and the whites of my eyes are brilliant white . Would recommend for sure , but take it at night !
 I have been taking this product for ~ 6 months now and have really noticed a difference in my overall health . You can do a simple Google search for the benefits of magnesium and find a myriad of articles and studies about its effects . One thing most people do n't realize is it can take up to two months to notice any differences as your magnesium levels begin to normalize.I take 400-600mg -LRB- 2-3 tablets -RRB- a day . One in the morning when I wake up and one at night before I go to bed . If I add an extra tablet I add it sometime during the late afternoon . It 's best not to take the full dose at once as your body will not absorb all of it . It 's also best to take this on an empty stomach . In the morning I take it 15 minutes before I eat breakfast and at night I make sure I have n't eaten for a few hours -LRB- which is probably a healthy decision anyway -RRB- I have noticed a better ability to relax , less muscle cramps after a hard work out , and I sleep much better than I did before . Magnesium has many wonderful benefits and I would encourage anyone to do some research to see if it is right for them ! It has worked very well for me.This product is very affordable and I highly recommend it to those looking to boost their magnesium levels .
 My fitness instructor recommended Magnesium Citrate instead of Magnesium Oxide due to the body 's poor absorption of the latter . Unfortunately , Magnesium Oxide is cheap and plentiful and Magnesium Citrate difficult to find in the city where I live . I found this brand of Magnesium Citrate on amazon.com . I 'm not sure why I chose this brand ; most likely it had good reviews from other amazon.com shoppers . Too , it may have rung a bell as a brand previously recommended to me . I ordered two bottles , they arrived quickly and I started taking the Magnesium Citrate , 400 mg/day . Works as promised -LRB- not by the vendor ; by various health professionals not connected with the vendor -RRB- .
 I have been taking this to help minimize the amount of anxiety medication I need to take . It helps with stress . However , I am disappointed to see that Amazon is one of the highest price sellers of this particular product . I will buy it , but not here .
 I love these pills.Ever since I can remember , I had trouble going to the bathroom . My bf went to the store and said `` Look , I need my gf to have healthy poops , how can you help me ? '' Magnesium Citrate is what he recommended and ever since I 've been using this product , my bowels have been moving non stop like a wild animal stampede in a hot , dry day in Africa.The only con is that , I 've been having to pee more often than a 8 month pregnant lady . I now have the bladder of a 6 year old . But it 's ok , cos I have healthy poops , and not many people can say that . I wear this badge of honor proudly.P.s . I tried another brand that did n't really work for me . NOW is the only one I 've been using constantly .
 If you 're one of those people that the doctor has advised to add this component to your diet , then this is a very good value for your money . Make sure you take it with plenty of liquid as it does n't taste so good when it 's stuck sideways and starts to melt .
 It was much cheaper than what I was buying from my chiropractor . It seems to be working fine . I will purchase again .
 I 've been taking these for about 4 months and have not been aware of any problems . My recent blood work was actually pretty good , so I 'm sure they contributed . We 'll see what next years report brings .
 I used to have to take sleep meds because i cant sleep . I found out that this magnesium Citrate acts as a muscle relaxer . I can sleep 6-7 hours straight . the Magnesium Citrate obsorbs better then the mag . oxide . Its awesome !
 I have only been using this product for a few days , but so far I 'm pleased with the product . It gives me a very calming mood and my bathroom visits have been very regular unlike before . I am going to continue using this product .
 These magnesium citrate tablets are good value at $ 12.87 for 250 tabs , but they just shot up in price to $ 18 ! Time to look elsewhere I think .
 This review is not totally accurate as I have just started using the product about 1 -LRB- one -RRB- week ago!However , it appears to be working for me . I had originally used capsules that was recommended . As I did n't see any capsules , I selected this tablet type.In the short time I have used the product , it appears that if I crush the pill , it works faster which is necessary for me . Would like to find a pill crusher someplace!Maybe after a few months using the product , I can make a better evaluation . As it stands , I am mostly satisfied at the present .
 This was an excellent price for the value , and the product quality did not disappoint . Fast , efficient delivery - overall , very satisfied with the product and service .
 Even though it says senior a young guy might want to consider this and leave the regular one for 30 's and 40 's .
 Excellent product !! Extremely sensitive . Good lubrication . The only thing better is going without - but not by much . I 've tried a number of different name brands - anything available at your local drugstore . Nothing comes close to this .
 Was n't sure if this product would keep my bandages dry while showering the 2 weeks after foot surgery , but it did . It has to be secured properly to prevent any leakage but it was perfect . I was able to shower with little concern . It held up very well , it will be available for use in the future -LRB- if needed -RRB- . Also , it arrived very quickly after I placed my order .
 This is a really great product.Quick and easy to use and very versatile in applying heat to where desired.One caution do NOT overheat these as the seams will degrade quite fast and cause a rupture that could cause you a nasty burn getting the inside gel directly on your skin.Used with appropriate caution -LRB- when taking them out of the microwave and keeping an eye on their seam integrity -RRB- this neckwarmer can really hit the spot .
 This was recommended by my Nutritionalist/Naturo-path to assist with my anxiety . Went home & researched it on the web , and almost all the reviews talk about memory . I learned from him after a Q/A that it reduces Cortisol levels in the brain ... essentially it helps people who are stuck in `` fight or flight '' -LRB- cortisol is one of the brain chemicals that surges in this state -RRB- . In `` normal people '' -LRB- where ever they are -RRB- , after the stressful event is over , brain cortisol levels return to baseline i.e. normal levels.We now live in times of extreme stress & anxiety -LRB- economic uncertainty , East Coast earthquakes?!!@$#*&!!?, job layoffs , generalized fear -RRB- . Many people , including those of us who suffered from anxiety BEFORE any of these additional stressors , live day to day with elevated cortisol levels . If you feel stressed out , burnt out , this is probably you . Excess Cortisol damages almost all of the major organs ... it was n't intended by `` the cosmic muffin '' -LRB- God -RRB- to be elevated for more than a very short period of `` fight or flight '' . BOTTOM LINE # 1
 This seems to help with my Mother 's Alzheimer 's , she is more alert and cognizant yet still calm . I notice a difference if she does n't take it . I 'll continue buying it for her . Super fast free shipping and a great price .
 This was recommended to us by a friend who knew my husband was quite disturbed by memory lapses . We both started on it and I 'm back today for a reorder . This is good stuff . Yes , it helps memory and yes it evens out moods . Whatever it 's doing works , with no side effects and no drugged feeling at all . It just sort of quietly goes to work inside and you gradually start to feel better . I 'm wondering if anyone has tried this for bi-polar problems ...
 This does work if you follow the instructions , but if you can find this without additives and try finding one with 500mgs , you 'll see faster results.Now , is one of the better companies out there , but still shop around -LRB- just like momma said -RRB-
 Research has mixed results regarding the use of this , but I did notice an improvement in memory after 2-3 weeks of use , but maybe it does n't work for everyone.As a side note , on the bottle it suggests that some might want to use along with two other supplements , DMAE and Ginko Biloba . I did n't know this until I received the product , next time I order , I will try it along with those two and update this review .
 I have to admit I was impressed by this product . I tried it to save money compared to the pharmaceutical brand my doctor had me taking & I actually like this one better ! It does exactly what it 's supposed to & I will definitely buy again !
 I have been taking phosphatidyl serine for several years . I recently changed to this brand -LRB- chiefly to avoid shipping charges -RRB- . Also , since I 'm aging -LRB- 69 -RRB- I 'm going to take the maximum dosage -LRB- 3 a day -RRB- rather than one . Until I recently retired I was a piano teacher and church organist . I swear I could tell a difference -LRB- mental fog -RRB- if I ran out and waited a few days for delivery . Now I order before I run out . I always check amazon first for many items . Since I no longer drive and have some difficulty walking , I appreciate amazon 's reliable and quick delivery .
 This was recommended to me by a naturopath a few years ago as something that would help me sleep and it does . I 've had sleep issues for years and this definitely helps .
 Good product , reasonable price , and very quick shipping . I feel a slight but noticeable effect when I take this . I do n't spend as much time searching for words , and it 's a little easier to remember things like appointments and errands . I still have to use lists , but it 's easier to remember to make notes and check my lists .
 Everything that I have read leads me to beleave that this supplement may help stave off dementia . These capsules are easy to swallow , so I ' v added them to my dailey vitamin and supplement regimen .
 this prodduct works very well for me . I have been very happy with the price & the speed in which I receive it .
 My 2 year old has had the worst time going # 2 and this is the only thing other than milk of magnesia that helps her go without pain and crying and holding it in . Thank you heavens for this product ! She goes so easy with just a half a capsule each day in her milk .
 The best product I 've tried so far that has helped with cleansing . I would highly recommend this product to anyone !
 Amazing cleanse ! I have used for several years and it works for me . No cramping or surprises but just normalcy ! Does n't get any better than that .
 I had all the issues that made a colon cleanser necessary . Bloating , gastric pains , skin rashes , and excessive tiredness . After a couple of days my problems started to go away . This is a gentle cleanser yet very effective . Everybody is different so you have to test out what is your ideal dosage . I settled on 5 pills . Also access to a bathroom at all time would be ideal . Of course as with any supplements consulting your doctor would be a good idea .
 I have been waiting for my chance to write this review for many years ! And the time is now . The &#34; oxygen &#34; approach is the one I can stick with . As somebody who had an intense parasitic attack in Mozambique which effectively wiped out my body 's ability to digest food normally , I have suffered from chronic constipation for 4 years . I have run through the list of possible remedies : - Stimulant laxatives -LRB- create dependency and yucky cramping -RRB- - Stool softener pills -LRB- not strong enough -RRB- - Fiber supplement -LRB- can help manage things when one is very careful with diet -- but is rough once I became too impacted -RRB- - Probiotics -LRB- no noticeable assistance -RRB- - High-fiber foods -LRB- always a good idea , but one slice of pizza does me in -RRB- - Magnesium & zinc -LRB- apparently I did n't have a deficiency -RRB- And then one day I was just skimming the net for new ideas for laxatives since I had grown so upset not feeling normal and having a bloated stomach . I saw an ad for a premium priced version of this product and purchased it reluctantly -LRB- $ 40 for 120 pills -RRB- . And just like the product under review , I was happy to find that with 4 pills before bed , I 'd wake up with the feeling of needing to relieve myself . Basically , this product seems to liquify your stool and get it really moving . And , the great thing is that if i take a decent size dose -LRB- 4 pills -RRB- , I 'll be somewhat regular with non-liquid stool for about two days , and then I 'll do another dose . I 've been doing this for about 3 months now and have n't noticed any fading effect -LRB- as the stimulants do -- since they are muscle stimulants -RRB- . I do n't feel pain , no blood , no yucky side effects that I can put my finger on . Just the somewhat bothersome liquid stool problem -- but heck , I 'll take that over the bloating and bulging any day of the week . I finally feel like I can eat my occasional pizza or ice cream sundae -LRB- high dairy , low digestibility -RRB- and not do myself in for a week of yucky constipation . Highly recommend if you need something with a strong kick .
 I have been using this product for a few years now . Great way to clean out your system without the side effects of an upset stomach . I take 5 pills for power cleaning but typically 1-2 every night to stay regular .
 I have suffered from irregularity all my life , sometimes only going once a week . Occasionally I would take a laxative , but only when I was really uncomfortable.After having read about this product in a book I was reading I thought I 'd give it a try , and boy am I glad I did!This product works wonders ! It 's very gentle and non addictive . I take 2-3 capsules/night and I am now regular . I feel sooo much better ! I will definitely be a lifetime user and could n't recommend this highly enough to anyone who suffers from irregularity .
 I really like this product because it really works . I have tried many cleansers and this one has helped me more than any other . Sometimes a cleanser works for the first few times of use but this one has continued to work for me to this point .
 I have been using this product for over 1 year . I would highly recommend for anyone needing a regular maintenance program . I take 1 pill at night during the week , and 2 to 3 on the weekends . Does not cause any discomfort however , if using for a laxative , make sure you are near a restroom .
 I have been taking laxatives regularly and was looking for something a little less harmful . This stuff works great I did take 5 the first day . That was a mistake I was in the bathroom most of the day . I take two a day now and that works great .
 This is the product we use when my elderly mom complains of constipation . It works all the time . We used to use slippery elm but it did not give consistent results . We also used some `` natural '' product that the doctor recommended but it did n't work well either . It is good to start off w / one capsule gradually because using 3 at once can cause an unexpected accident especially for an elderly person .
 Product works great for those who need to flush out your system ! Two pills before going to bed and you wake up and go ! The only negative is , for those who have a hard time swallowing pills , these pills are fairly big !
 This is an excellent product and would recommend it to anyone who just wants to cleanse ! It works naturally and I do n't feel like I have to stay by the bathroom .
 Works really good This product gives a good cleanse , works better than laxatives.I feel like a brand new person ... ... ... ... ... I highly recommend !
 These worked EXACTLY as the directions stated they would ... I have n't found any other product that works like this one does ... I LOVE and will ALWAYS use ...
 Omg , This stuff is great !! This is the best colon cleanser , I would recommend it ... Love itWould purchase again if i need it .
 Usually my husband takes 4 Mag 07 's a day which keeps him from being constipated . He only has to use Benonite onrare occassions .
 This product worked exactly as I had hoped . I did not feel like I had to keep running to the bathroom . It was controlled and effective .
 This product helped to oxygenate my digeative system.What a amazing produxt that works immediately and safe and easy on the intestines.Try it and you wont be disappointed.You will keep using it
 I first heard of this product from Kimberly Synder . These capsules are perfect for keeping my system regular -- even if I do n't eat as properly as I should . They are gentle to my system , and work quickly . I highly recommend !
 The is the first review I have ever written on Amazon but I totally thought it was worth while . This product is fantastic . I heavily endorse it !
 It sure does clear you out . I 'm not sure how much of a detox it is , but it sure does do its job of clearing you out , in a good , healthy way . I felt great on them , just needed the bathroom a little more often . Just beware , you better be ok with your roommates , bf/gf whoever is in ear shot in the morning hearing you , or have sound proof walls , or run the shower/sink , anything , you 'll need it : -RRB-
 This product works miracles . It cleans out your system like magic . Highly recommend this product to everyone !!!!!!!!!
 If you 're using this stuff , you should feel comfortable reading reviews about bowel movements ! ; - -RRB- I 'm a female , 5 ' 4 '' , 119 lbs . and the first night I started these , I thought I 'd kick things off with the maximum recommendation of 5 capsules ... a HUGE mistake ! Within hours -LRB- in the middle of the night , mind you -RRB- , I was running back and forth to the bathroom with diarrhea . Looking back , I should have started off a bit slower to see how my body reacted to this stuff . Once I figured the right dose out for a cleanse -LRB- I just need 3 -RRB- , I was able to sleep through the night and use the bathroom at my own leisure upon waking . My BMs were somewhere between soft and diarrhea but I was going much more regularly , not urgently . Following a night of Mag07 , I would start my day with Pearls IC probiotics and found that this a great combo!Upon completetion of the 10-day cleanse , I have continued to take 1 capsule before bed for maintenance . My insides have never felt better which of course , have reflected on the outside ! My belly feels flat and my digestive system no longer feels stopped up . I swear , I can actually feel my body utilizing vitamins that I used to feel pass right through , never fully absorbing . I 'll also say that taking care of your intestinal tract is the base of a strong immune system . While everyone else has started getting colds and the flu , I remain illness-free and full of energy!I love this product and I tell everyone about it !
 So i have the most difficulty releasing my bowels . From years of bad college eating habits , i literally just stopped pooping . Once i noticed & recognized that that wasnt exactly normal i set out to fix it . Ive tried everythig under the sun , colon cleansers that would be so uncomfortable it feels like its ripping your colon to shreds , ive had a colonic , ive done cleanse diets , & dont get me started on ballerina tea
 Disclaimer
 Have used this product on my 14 yr old son and husband for about five years now . They normally take one capsule twice a day on an empty stomach and it is the only thing that keeps them regular . They both have a slow transit colon which makes it impossible to have normal bowel movements without this product . I hope they never go out of business . What a blessing . Works even better with a cup of tea with lemon for those days that you are really backed up because of traveling or whatever . No , cramping or gas . It takes a couple of days to work . Our Chiropracter told us about it , and said that intially , it is recomended to take a high dosage to flush everything out , and then mantainence of the one capsule twice a day .
 I was referred to this product by a friend who swears by them . I was skeptical but now I am a devoted MagO7 consumer . For someone that really needs the extra help , these pills truly helped without the cramping as mentioned by others . Definitely start with 2 if your a woman and bump it to 3 if that does n't work . I will always keep a bottle handy . It also helps to start on Friday evening -LRB- bottle says to take before bed -RRB- so you can get the majority of the cleanse in progress over the weekend and you will be fine for the work week .
 First , shipping was fast . This was great , because I needed something ! Second , it worked with the first dose.I am 43 and have had bowel issues since I can remember . I remember sitting on the toilet at the bowling alley when I was 3 , not being able to go . It did n't get better as I grew older , only continued to get worse.My diet probably did n't help things , either . I know I had atrocious eating habits , and constant constipation plagued me . I tried increasing fruits , vegetables , and water intake . Still , nothing seemed to help except the harsh chemical laxatives and stool softeners that would make me cramp up and feel like dying . I 'd spend hours doubled over in pain , and still not going.Mag 07 started working with the first dose . I could actually feel it working in my intestines . I have only been using it for a few days , but plan on using it as a maintenance product . No pain , no cramping , no sitting on the toilet for hours .
 My husband has been on some pretty heavy duty prescriptions for a while , and because of them he has really bad constipation . This has been the ONLY product that has given him relief with no adverse side effects . He only takes 2 every night and it works great . Would HIGHLY recommend this product .
 I started using MagO7 about a couple years ago . It has been the best product for my constipation problems !! For YEARS I suffered from constipation and used almost anything I could to get some kind of relief , but I have not had any problems since I started using this product . I only have to use about 2 pills a day . No cramps . I give this product the highest recommendation ! Thank goodness for MagO7 !!!
 I have struggled with regularity for years . Recently got worse . However I was on a mission to eat healthier , be healthier and pay attention to what I put into my body . In a book I read , she recommended this product to help regularity . Not harsh at all . I take 3 each night and without a doubt , I am now regular !!!!!!! No gripping , no issues . I take them at bedtime , in the morning , there is an `` urge '' and I just go . Most of the time , twice a morning . That is GREAT for me ! I will definitely continue to use this and recommend to anyone that wants something more natural . Adding fiber was n't enough for me . THIS is the trick !
 Hello , first of let me just say that this product was shipped SO fast . . Best product ever !! Works like M A G I C. . This will Definitely be a STAPLE in my household !!
 Aerobic Life - Mag 07 Oxygen Cleanse , 180 capsules is a very good product . I am happy that l bought it to help my situation.I have even recommend it to some of my friends . This is a product you do n't want to do without .
 Many years ago , I suffered from a bad care of interstitial cystitis . I could not sleep because I going to the restroom 8 times a night . I was exhausted and frustrated . Nothing worked . I even consulted with the top medical doctors at the UCLA Medical Center and the USC Medical Center for help . Some doctors were using DMSO and baking soda cocktails that were inserted in the bladder , yet these treatments were controversial . Depressed and desperate , i decided to try Mag 07 . It was a miracle !!! From the first night that I tried it , I was able to sleep through the night ! I will be forever thankful to the creators of this product . I highly recommend this product to anyone suffering from interstitial cystitis .
 This is the first product that has ever worked for me . I am 54 years old and was lucky if I had a BM once a week and always felt horrible . I started taking this product 8 months ago and I now have a BM every day , sometimes a couple times a day . I take one capsule every night before bed and two capsules on the week-ends . I ca n't believe the doctors never mentioned this to me .
 These were reviewed in a book I am reading and they are everything that was promised . Not harsh but very effective .
 Great product , came just as described . Needed it for HCG Diet . Perfect and Effective . 2-3 pills at night , and flushes out your system quickly and effectively . Have recommended it to a few friends and no one has anything negative to say . Would definitely recommend to anyone that needs it !!! U will not regret it !
 I have always been `` regular '' . But then I read an interesting article that got me wondering . Just because you go consistently , does n't mean you are regular . Are you expelling waste from today , yesterday , or a week ago?I feel much less bloated with these pills and would recommend them !
 I started taking 1 , then the next 2 nights took 2 , then moved up to 3 . After moving to 3 I did not notice much of a change -LRB- been constipated for months drinking lots of prune juice just to go -RRB- and got a little angry and stopped taking it . Well over the next few days I was going regularly , good formed movements even , I was amazed . So works for me and I do n't even have to take it every night . I am sure taking 5 would clean you out completely , I just do n't have time to sit on the toilet all day .
 I definetly think these pills do work . Your body might have to &#34; warm up &#34; to them but after a few days of taking them you will be relieved ...
 I have always had gas problems and a weird onset of lactos intolerance and all kinds of stuff . I was just backed upped terribly ! I took this and have been so happy and pleased with it , you just would n't believe . Yes it does get you going but not painfully . It 's an instant stool softener as well.I would n't recommend any other product at all . . and I got to lose some weight ! Ca n't beat that !
 This product has been a god send to me . For years I have suffered from constipation . I have typically resorted to laxatives which leave me with a terrible cramping feeling and sometimes do n't work at all . After I tried this , I will never use another product again . It worked to relieve my constipation without any cramping or negative side effects . I found a lower doseage than the recommended amount was more than adequate for me , so that is something I believe that may vary for each individual , but overall I can not say enough good about this product . I love it and will recommend it to anyone having issues with irregularity or simply wishing to do a bowel cleanse without going to the expense or extent of having a colonic performed .
 As soon as I received the product I started taking it the next day . The bottle says to take 5 pills before bedtime and that is what I did . What I did not know is that I would be going to the bathroom quite a bit . I am going to reduce my dosage and see how it works . I had about 80 ounces of water and I guess the water helped with the flush . I heard about this product from JJSmithonline and I would highly recommend these for anyone who wants to clean their colon !
 I was skeptical . I have suffered for more years than I remember with chronic constipation regardless of diet , water consumption , fiber consumption - you name it . One pill at night before bedtime and all is well ! Awesome product !
 I 'm not going to go into any details , just know that this really works . I highly recommend this product , look no further than mag-o .
 I never take kind of products like this , but I read all the good reviews and it was also a recommendation in a book that I was reading about detoxing . So I decided to try it and it absolutely works great . I recommend this to everyone . I have also noticed some inches lost from my waist .
 I came across these during a detox and they really helped along the process . As far as I know they are non habit forming and are really great when you feel you need to do a little extra cleansing . Take two before bed and you 'll notice the difference in the morning .
 This product works great ! I wo n't be without it . Have used it daily for the past 4 years and swear by it . Works great to keep digestive tract healthy .
 Start off with 1 capsule at night and see how it affects you . I did n't need more than that so adjust to suit your needs .
 based on reviews i was anxious to try this product . It works that i wake up having to go to bathroom in morning . but i do n't feel any different after having used it . I guess i thought i would feel lighter or something ? either it does n't work for me or i already have a clean colon .
 I was very satisfied with Mag 07 , and have ordered a similar Oxygen Digestive System Cleaner Capsules . Have had good results with them also .
 I rarely review a product and certainly not so soon after starting to use it . But I have tried everything on God 's green earth , including natural laxitives of all kinds and forms , may different fibers , prescription meds , etc. . Most recently , I 've gone back to harsh laxitives because nothing else has been working . Well ... just three days after starting Mag 07 , I have lost 4 lbs , much of my bloating is gone and my bowels are working again . The amazing part is I have not had any stomach cramps ... just relief . I 'm so excited to have potentially found a product that will help me . I can only hope it continues to work in the same way .
 I purchased this a couple years ago & only used it a few times because it made my stool very watery -LRB- of course was drinking lots of water at the time -RRB- . The end of last year I was doing some heavy duty studying so I was drinking lots of coffee , caffeine energy drinks , diet sodas , taking Excedrin almost every day , etc. . My eating was atrocious ... lots of fast foods , processed foods , and sugary sweets and to top it off I was barely drinking any water . This went on for about 3 months.When I decided to start eating healthy & lose some weight , although I rehydrated myself -LRB- drinking at least a gallon of water a day -RRB- , I still was n't losing the weight I should have , my stomach was constantly bloated , & I was barely going to the bathroom . I tried metamucil bars which worked a little , then I tried psyllium husks which also worked a little . I tried senna capsules & that barely worked , even an enema barely produced results . At first I thought `` maybe I 'm not backed up '' but I was n't going hardly at all ... I would get the urge but then ... nothing.I then began taking 3 Mag 07 in the evening & let me tell you ... things are REALLY moving now ! Not just water either like before ! This is a stool softener so do n't expect your stool to come out formed , but this worked when NOTHING else did . I 'm going to keep taking 3-4 every evening for the next 5-7 days as recommended on the bottle as a cleanse . HIGHLY recommend this ... no cramping & very predictable . I 've been taking it at 11pm & by 4 or 5am I have to go.UPDATE - MARCH 17 , 2012
 I searched for this product to replace a different brand that is much too expensive , PoopDoc . Love the name , but do n't like the price . After reading the Mag 07 label , reading the instructions , and seeing that the feedback is pretty much the same ; I decided it has to be the same product . After trying it , I 'm happy that it IS the same product and for about 1/2 the price!I am 64 and have had severe constipation frequently since I 've been 2 years old . No one knew about dairy intolerance when I was growing up and my family ate dairy products every day . Even when I learned about it in my early thirties , I did n't know it was n't lactose ... It was milk protein or something like that which causes the opposite effect . Anyway , not eating dairy helped , but apparently all those years of eating it caused a very sluggish system . When I say `` severe '' constipation , I mean once or twice a week was a good week . There were many times I did n't go for two weeks ... awful . Doctors were unhelpful so I had to resort to expensive and possibly dependency-forming products in the drug store . Sometimes laxatives did n't even work nor did prune juice until after taking it for three or four days . Sorry for the boring story , but I 'm a great test case for this product.Thanks to this formula , I can have a healthier digestive track and I feel a lot better . Since it only affects the material inside the intestine instead of forcing the intestine to contract , you do n't have to worry about dependency . I did do the 3-day cleanse by taking 5 capsules nightly . Yes , of course that causes diarrhea , but amazingly there is no discomfort or cramping . After that , it does take awhile to figure out what dosage is right for you for maintenance . I do n't take it every night . It seems to be fine to take it every other night or even every 3 nights -LRB- for me -RRB- . I take two plus one magnesium citrate supplement at the same time . They seem to work well together . If I 've had ice cream or pizza , i have to take 3 . The minimum you must take at one time depends on your individual system . For me , one is not enough to work , so I always take 2 or more.Remember that Mag 07 is not a replacement for magnesium supplementation . That form is not as absorbable in the body as other forms of magnesium , at least that seems to be the concensus of the majority . Also , do not take Vitamin C in the evening when you take Mag 07 . It seems to prevent it from working . The nights I forgot and took Vitamin C , the Mag 07 did not work at all so was a waste of pills.Hope my review is helpful .
 I found Mag 07 Oxygen cleanse very effective yet gentle . I did n't even change my diet , just kept eating normal.The only thing I wished for was that I took a 1 week leave from work , to be close to the toilet ! .
 I 'm a long time user of this product . Been using it for 8 years now . I 've suffered my whole life from constipation , ever since I was a young child . I 've tried so many products over the years to keep myself regular . Mag O7 is THE BEST !!! You can use it two different ways , as a colon cleanser or as a maintenance product to get yourself regular and keep yourself regular . Mag O7 causes absolutely no cramping like laxatives and many other cleansing products do.You need to find the dose that 's right for you , whichever way you wish to use it . Taking too much can cause runny stools . If that happens , you need to take a capsule or two less until you find what works best for you . For me , I take 4 capsules once a day , only every three days . That keeps my system working well . Some will need to take 2 capsules every day or any other combination . Play around with your dose until you find what works for you and gives you the result your looking for.If I want to do an actual cleanse , then I 'll take 4 to 5 capsules a day , every day for 7 to 10 days . Some who suffer from occasional constipation due to short term medication use or any other reason will only need to use this product as needed.I highly recommend this product !!! BEST OF THE BEST !!
 I have been using Mag 07 for about 9 months now and I would n't give it up ! It works and works well . After years of not eliminating regularly I was really surprised at how much there is that needs to come out . I take 4 capsules almost every night . I have had no problems or side affects . At first when you use it you need to find your dosage that works for you . Taking too much however does not make it so you can not control yourself or make you not able to leave the bathroom for a day . It is also not gas producing .
 Mag 07 is a great product if you 're looking for an easy 10-day detox . No cramping or bloating . * NOTE * Start with 3 tabs instead of 5 to be sure you know how your body will react . Once the 10-day detox is over , lessen the intake down to 2 tabs for maintenance or you 'll find yourself going to the bathroom EVERY TIME you eat or drink ! Believe me , it was n't pretty when I stuck with 3 tabs a day - luckily I was staying home that week !
 That 's the best colon cleanse everrrrrrrrrrrr !!!! It really works and it does n't hurt . I could be a little cheaper though but It 's worth it . I love it . Ca n't live without it . Just stop taking if you get pregnant or if you are breastfeeding .
 This product is amazing ! I feel like a brand new person . I was constipating after my surgeryand my system could not get back to normal . After using this product everything back tonormal . I even lost weight ! Make sure you drink a lot of water while using this capsules .
 I 've been taking Mag O7 for the past year and hope I never have to live without it - at least until my system normalizes -LRB- which it has n't in the past 16 years -RRB- . Just two caps a day and my system evacuates normally and I feel great . MUCH better than miralax - which makes me feel bloated and does n't work well .
 Best product for a sore throat ... and while the taste is just alright , the flavor is still a million times better than the disgusting cherry medicinal one ... I 'm expecting a medicine taste with the mint flavor , so it works out for my tastebuds . And it soothes and numbs a sore throat ...
 ... at a little over a buck a pack , a third of the usual price for the same HIGH quality and an expiration that ends the spring of NEXT year . YES , this is a winter winner !
 i have used Cottonelle travel packs . I thought i would try this . They are actually better in most way . The only annoyance is the large margin at the top and bottom of the packaging . Since these are for travel , it is important that they be as compact as possible . But otherwise , a great choice
 I do n't know how to rate this item cause ... I have n't tried it yet but as soon as i do try it I 'll do another review !
 This product was recommended to my by a healthcare provider and I have found that it complements the other joint treatments I use .
 I bought this initially because I was having trouble sleeping . While it does n't knock me out , so to speak , it definitely gives me a nice , calm feeling . I 've been drinking one a day since !
 I LOVE this tea . Not only does it taste good but it gently relaxes you .
 Awesome tea ! Tastes wonderful and actually helps soothe my aching joints ! I highly recommend it !!

 **** This Kava Stress Relief Tea from Yogi Tea is for anxiety relief . It 's an unusual tea , slightly sweet -LRB- it contains stevia -RRB- and very carob-y . The good news is that it does not have any of the usual kava taste or smell that many people find offensive . The bad news is that I ca n't feel any of the anxiety relief effects of the tea , although it does say that there are 78mg of kava root extract in the tea . Still , it 's a lovely cup of tea , and relaxing because it just tastes good . I can also taste the spiciness of the tea , which is very pleasant . I usually brew two bags in one cup , which is recommended on the package for a stronger and more relaxing effect ; however , I even tried four bags once , but still did n't notice a relaxing effect . I am familiar with kava and the overall effect of kava is pretty subtle anyway , so this is something to be aware of . Your experience of the tea may be different.Kava Stress Relief Tea comes with an expiration date -LRB- a good thing , because it 's not full of preservatives , plus you can tell if it is fresh -RRB- and has many organic ingredients.The ingredients in Kava Stress Relief Tea are
 however doesnt keep you asleep . have to drink early or your will be getting up in the middle of the night to use the restroom .
 i cant tell if its working or not because i 'm always going through something different every other week ... smh ikr ! ...
 I 've been taking melatonin for 10 + years as a sleep aid , and have recently discovered that chamomile and other nighttime teas greatly aid the sleep process . However , Yogi is the first tea I 've tried that has eliminated the need for additional sleep aid . The flavor is much fuller and rich , making it very enjoyable . The price is cheaper at my local grocer , but it 's worth a higher price !
 I have been enjoying this tea for years now . After a long day of hiking or hard work it can really help to put the mind and body at ease . My apologies to anyone who has been pleasantly enjoying the placebo effect from this tea ... For those interested in using Kava , you should know that the threshold dose for feeling any effects of from kava is about 150mg of kavalactones - keep in mind that this is considered a low dose . One bag of Yogi 's Kava tea contains just over 20mg of active ingredients -LRB- kavalactones -RRB- . At lower doses around these levels I have noticed slight mental relaxation and occassionally very vivid dreams . Doses of 300mg -LRB- which equates to about a full box of Yogi tea -RRB- and much higher are more effective for relief of anxiety and muscle soreness , and are more typical of the dosage in traditional use by Pacific Islanders.When I use this tea I always use between 10-16 TEABAGS PER CUP ! This looks ridiculous while steeping , but makes sense considering Yogi only puts about 1/8 of a dose of Kava into their bags . Unsurprisingly , the suggested dose of 1-2 bags has been totally ineffective for me . When brewing the tea as strong as I do , I find that it is effective , delicious and requires no sweetener . Flavor can be improved -LRB- personal taste -RRB- by the addition of some milk or cream . It makes me laugh to read Yogi 's instructions to add &#34; another &#34; teabag -LRB- for a total of less than 50mg kavalactones -RRB- after a stressful day . People , use at least half a box if you want to feel anything other than a placebo effect!Hopefully this is helpful to some of you folks !
 Wow , this stuff is great . Gentle yet effective . My advice would be to start slow . It takes several hours to work . I 'd wait for a day or two before taking a second dose .
 It is delicious and very calming ! It does help relax you . Just steep it in hot water and sip it
 This tea is perfect for the end of a long stressful day . I love that I can buy this online when I ca n't find it in my local store .
 I am quite happy to be able to buy multiple boxes at one time . I go through this tea quickly .
 This works wonders for the voice . Not crazy about the taste but I overlook it for what it does . Works well ! People who like berry tea might like it better taste-wise .
 Taste grate smells even better ... I have anxiety and it helps to calm me down I drink it twice a day ...
 This tea has a nice flavor and really helped me to calm down and relax . I recommend trying it to anyone who has problems sleeping , falling asleep or like me if you have a mind that likes to keep going after you lay down and doesnt let you you sleep .
 I purchase this tea for my boyfriend due to how much stress he goes through on a daily basis . He 's tried the tea and says it helps him to be calm and it also helps with is sleep , placing him in a relaxed state .
 I tried the Yogi Kava Stress Relief tea after being a user of Valerian root in my herbal tea for a while a year or so ago and having some success with that but wanting to try something different - I was finding myself in a situation where on most days I needed to get up at one consistent time but then one day of the week I needed to get up three hours earlier , thus causing a great amount of upheaval in my sleep schedule the night before and then after that early morning.As some earlier reviewers have noted , there is a strong , almost metallic note to this tea . I have tried Stevia as a sweetener previously and had not particularly cared for it , but that did not seem to constitute the entire `` note '' that I was sensing and not finding pleasing here , so some of it must be the herb itself . However , this taste is not any more displeasing than Valerian is to my palate when I compare them.I steep two of the teabags for approximately 7-8 minutes with the water almost a boil when I add it to the tea -LRB- the instructions said that the tea could be steeped for as long as 10 minutes -RRB- . I add just a splash of cream and a generous tablespoon of clover honey to mine , and within twenty minutes I feel the effects . Some have noted that they do not feel any differently - I can say that I do , but I should mention to be fair that I am a mere five feet two inches and barely clock in at above one hundred pounds . Still , I would say that this is to its credit - it would n't put me to sleep if I used one teabag for test anxiety , which I foresee using it for in the very near future . Instead of knocking you out , it simply stops your mind from racing relentlessly , or at least that has been my experience .
 Not only does this tea aid in digestion , but it worked wonders on my 10 year old daughter 's sore throat . She was experiencing moderate pain , and after trying Ibuprofen and Lozenges , I made her this tea . I added honey , and the tea had an instant effect . She claims that it did something to numb her throat . She continuted drinking it every night through the course of her cold . I am so pleased to have found this product ! Excellent tea !

 This tea has a pleasant cinnamon like aroma and has a cinnamony/Carob like flavor . It take longer to brew but is worth it ! It takes the edge off stress and is an enjoyable tea for morning or nightime ! I take it in the morning 1/2 hour before stressfull meetings and 1/2 hour before I go to sleep if it has been a stressful day . I like to stock up so I am prepared when things get tense !
 I have been getting painful cluster headaches , and read in a nutrition book that there are several herbs that will dull or get rid of your headache . I noticed that this tea has a lot of those herbs , and it worked ! It has worked several times ! I do n't know if it only works for cluster headaches , but try this -LRB- along with a hot pad or cold compress -RRB- before any painkillers . It helps so much !!!

 I love this tea ! You drink it and you just quietly get tired and no med type hangover in the morning ! I have a pretty high med tolerance so actually finding something to help me fall asleep is hard . It tastes good and works !
 This tea is amazing for stress relief . Just one cup and I am very `` chill '' . I have this tea in the reserves for particularly tough days . It has a rather pleasant taste and while I can fall asleep after drinking it , I can still stay awake enough to accomplish tasks . Though , for best use of stress relief plan to just lie down and do something calming .
 So I 've had my fair share of green and black teas . I received this certain tea as a present from a good friend . I can not tell you how amazing this tea is.It 's got two things going for it

 First , any Yogi tea is a great product . And , while this one is n't like taking a Xanax , it 's really a good tea to relax with . It 's tasty and soothing and good for you . What else is there to say about a tea ? I have a hard time finding this in the local stores so I 'm very glad to find it on Amazon .
 I got this because I am pregnant and experiencing nausea . Ginger is known to be a remedy for nausea , including morning sickness ... but the thing I thought was funny about this product was that it says on the box to check with your doctor if you are pregnant ! I did , she said as long as it was n't the only thing I drink all day , I should be ok ! But if you are pregnant , I would check with your own doctor before use . The thing that dissappointed me a little bit was that when I got my package , the box was smushed . They had only packed it in a bubble mailer envelope . However , I have had a few glasses of this tea now , and I must say , it does take the edge off of my nausea ! It is not very spicy or overly gingery like other ginger drinks I have tried . I would recommend to other pregnant women ... but ask your doctor first , like the box says !
 Why Should You Buy Yogi Get Regular Tea :1 -RRB- It tastes great ! At first , I was afraid it would have a very bad taste , so I mixed it with Organic India Tulsi Lemon Ginger Tea . But one day when I was out of the other tea , I ended up drinking it straight . It was great , smooth and has a slight sweetness to it .2 -RRB- You can use the teabag 2 or 3 times . I use my teabag twice . Not only is this cost effective , but it helps me to go to the bathroom 2-3 times daily . When you are all done with the teabag , do n't throw it away . Use it as a facial cleanser or toner by gently wiping the teabag all over your face and neck . It will do wonders for your skin .3 -RRB- It does keep you regular , but not `` runny . `` 4 -RRB- They have great quotes attached to each teabag . Not only does the tea keep you regular , but the great quotes attached to each tea bag 's label has great quotes.Enjoy !
 I have never been regular . Never . Never ever . By that I mean that no matter what diet I seem to eat , I 'm still lucky if I can manage to poo 2x a week . 4x unheardof , 3x high , 2x average , 1x uncomfortable . So , because of this issue , over the years I 've tried all sorts of things to help my system out . Nothing worked well or for long . Until I found this tea . Seriously , this stuff works wonders ! It can easily become addicting it works so well , I try to only use it a few times a month . Be warned though , the first time you take it , it is going to hurt like crazy !! You will feel like you 've pooped out every part of your body thats under the skin . But , after that first time , it works much more comfortable . I highly reccommend this product !!

 This is a good tea to drink in the winter because it is quite warming . The ginger , licorice root , black pepper , are all very good at warming the body through . It took me a while to get used to having pepper in my tea , but now that I have I like the little kick of spice it adds . I do n't even add honey anymore . Some might consider this to be a very `` biting '' tea . This is why I say it is good for winter . I 've bought it during the summer and feel it would be more satisfying in cooler weather . I have to say that I wo n't buy again because of the pepper , but this reflects a personal preference , not impression of quality.Yogi Tea uses organic ingredients and 100 % recycled cardboard for their attractive packaging . They are a company based out of Oregon.I could n't say how well it helps with digestion , as I do n't drink it on a regular basis . But we all know that ginger is very good for the body .
 This was very relaxing and when you want to nap , you can drink this and then take a nap . It contains no caffeine and gives a nice break from every day stresses .
 The taste is pretty good , although i did n't feel the stress relieving properties it was said to have . at least no more than regular tea would have on me . but still , tasted great .
 LOVE . Get that Cali girl bright white smile . Results are fantastic . Warning
 I do n't have very yellow teeth , I just bought this because I wanted to brighten up my teeth a little and get a better smile.I got what I expected , results in three days!Plus I did n't even two strips a day , so I was definitely happy.Don ' t expect this to brighten up your teeth like four shades , but it DOES work.Plus for the price , I definitely recommend this.I 've had no gum problems , and the drooling is OK for me.So this is definitely the product for me .
 I use these strips yearly . I get compliments all the time on how white my teeth are . When I use these strips , I try not to swallow any of the whitening paste because I do n't trust that paste is safe to swallow in small amounts . It does make you drool and I ca n't imagine using these outside of my house with the exception of a work commute . Definitely work if you have mild-moderate yellowing .
 When I first met my wife , it was n't too long before she suggested that I might have whiter , bright teeth and a better smile by using `` Crest Whitestrips . '' Whiter teeth ? Moi ? I brushed my teeth twice every day and had them regularly cleaned twice a year . Yet , close inspection indicated they were indeed a bit yellow and stained , and I always assumed it was just my age . Or maybe it was the coffee or red wine . So , if a new girlfriend suggests Whitestrips , then Whitestrips it is . Several days later we went to a pharmacy and purchased the `` Crest Whitestrips Premium '' packet.I followed the instructions as closely as possible . It was a bit difficult getting started with getting the strips on and then holding them in place for the suggested time . I finally worked out a routine wherein I would fit them in prior to driving to her place . When I 'd get there , I 'd discard them . When I 'd head back for home -LRB- about a 20-minute trip -RRB- , I 'd put a new pair in and take them out upon arrival . I 'd make the round trip about every couple days so it took a little longer for the total whitening treatment but the arrangement worked fine and did n't waste any time . Plus it was easy to remember.We began noticing the whitening after about three or four days . It was very subtle and gradual at first , but by the end of the packet , my teeth were noticeably whiter and brighter . It was a good improvement . The whitening agent was applied , of course , only to the front teeth , but those are the most noticeable and it works out fairly well for my smile . I 'd say if you want whiter , brighter teeth this is a reasonably good product and not very expensive . It 's not perfect , and I may try a few of the other whitening methods . It 's also not permanent and I 've now got a third kit for another go at whitening . Using the procedure about every year to 1.5 years seems to work best for me.Gary Peterson
 Okay , so the first time I tried Crest white strips was back in 2000 or so . I must admit , I was n't impressed with the results at all . So I never tried using them again . However , I recently bought these Crest Whitestrips Premiums , and I am amazed with the difference already ! I 've been using them for about 4 of the 7 days , and the difference is already quite dramatic ! I am thoroughly impressed with how much whiter my teeth are , and it 's quite a bargain . I was n't expecting good results from these , and was planning on paying around $ 150-200 to get it done at the Dentist 's office . I would have expected results around these -LRB- and it 's not even done yet -RRB- . . I 'm 26 and most of the stains were yellow from food/coffee/wine / and smoking ... yellow stains .2 Negatives though
 Being a smoker and coffee drinker , I was skeptical that this product would do much for my teeth in just seven days but it worked amazingly . The other thing is I am sensitive to just about everything in the world , hair dyes , etc. , and this product did not bother my teeth or gums at all . I will say , however , that I did not use them twice per day like the instructions say . I only bleached once a day and sometimes skipped days . The results , however , were still great . I 'd like to go a bit whiter than I am now but I 'm sure that 's because I started off with yellowing due to smoking and coffee drinking . All in all , I loved this product . The biggest thing to remember is that some people -LRB- me being one of them -RRB- drool a lot with the strips in their mouth , so I would never leave the house with them in my mouth . I just surfed the net , watched tv , read a book , did the dishes or whatever and kept my drool rag handy . It was n't the most fun I 've had in my life but since I was determined to have whiter teeth , it was worth it .
 This product is a great whitener . I have had the bleaching trays from the dentist before but they are sort of annoying to wear . When I needed to rewhiten I asked my dentist for a recommendation and she said I should try these . I did and I think these did just as good a job as the whitening tray and they were much more convenient .
 I used everyday for 2 weeks instead of one - so I did once a day . This way my gums did not get so sensitive and the results , in my opinion , were great ! My teeth are whiter ! I 've done professionally whitting at the dentist office and I prefer this system better .
 I was kinda hesitant in purchasing a teeth whitening product at frist , but there was a coupon in the newspaper for a good couple dollars off and thought I should try it . This thing works ! Whiter teeth in a couple of days !! The only bad part is that if you have sensitive teeth , the product will make your teeth feel really sensitive when using it . I love how does not take up a long time sitting with the stripe in your mouth .
 I have been a huge fan of crest white strips for a couple of years . Once year I purchase this product and always see fast/accurate results !
 I 've had yellowed teeth for years , probably due to coffee and tea comsumption . I decided to try an inexpensive fix and this seemed the ticket . I tried the Crest Whitestrips and they did just that , whitened my teeth . I am very happy with the results and recommend them .
 I 've only used it for a few days and it has worked a lot and I would buy this product again and recommend it to others as well .
 My teeth were already pretty white , but wanted a little brighter . Says you notice difference in three days , I noticed in ONE ! I had tried the Listerine Dissolving Strips , TOTAL waste , I think I saw more difference just using regular whitening toothpaste . I gave this five stars because it DEFINITELY whitens AND WHITENS FAST!Strips do take a bit getting used to as they can slide around and you have to be very careful when putting them on , but I would definitely use them again . I might get the Premium Plus next time just because there are more strips and that way , if I want to brighten a little more in a few months , there are the extra strips . I also used the Classic Crest Strips and these definitely worked faster and better .
 Pain is not beauty when it comes to this product . They were very painful and made my teeth very sensitive . They got whiter , but not by much .
 Crest White Strips Premium do do a good job of whitening , but they also made my teeth ultra sensitive . I could not complete them in the instructed 7 days , and instead took over a month to use the strips as my teeth were SO painful ! I had to take off days in between use . Hot or cold foods were AGONY on my teeth . I live in Upstate NY & it is winter and the cold air felt very painful . If I use these again it will be in the summertime !
 I wanted to try this one because it 's an actual brand and supposed to be the best ... blah blah . . but ... it really was n't the best i 've ever used . Do n't get me wrong ... the product DOES work . . but just not the best for the price . I 've bought the cheaper brand and it actually worked better .
 I truly recommend this vendor , they are the best on customer care , they go the extra mile for our complete satisfaction , I got the product in the expected time and their products are great.Thanks so much for taking so good care of my order.Many thanks to Israel , EO
 The strips are easy to apply and whiten effectively . The only down side is that they 're a little pricey -LRB- use coupons -RRB- .
 Teeth were 2 shades whiter after using this product-very simple to use , and I experienced no sensitivity .
 I have been using this product for about 5 years once a year and love it . I recommend it to anyone who does not want to spend 300 to 600 dollars at the dentist office for teeth whitening . It is painless and over before you know it . You will start to see a difference in 2 to 3 days and by the 7th day you will have definitely whiter teeth than you had before using the Crest Whitestrips . This is a great product and I am so happy Crest came out with it .
 Reasonable price and Very effective . Although I did not get ` white ' teeth after using it for a week , my teeth definitely became whiter !!!
 I have sensitive teeth so I expected to have some of the symptoms described in the reviews , but WOW ... I did n't know what I was in for . I would describe the the pain as sharp zaps that come and go . It is unlike any other tooth pain I 've ever experienced , and I can see why some people would stop after their first encounter with this pain . I decided to stick it out anyway , and I 'm glad I did . I saw results instantly , and by the last day my smile was perfect . A tip for anyone with sensitive teeth
 I have used this product few times and by far it is the best.-Nebil .
 I am a dentist who recommends Crest-brand White Strips to my patients becasue they do work to whiten teeth . However , they have to be used correctly and I recommend that you follow the directions exactly as specified inside the box .1 . First brush your teeth with a wet toothbrush to remove the layer of plaque -LRB- toothpaste is unnecessary -RRB- . Rinse your teeth well with water . Tooth enamel has pores , and the pores need to be open for the chemical to penetrate .2 . Use the strips as directed on the box . The instructions will tell you to bleach twice a day for 30-minutes a time .

 I am a dentist who recommends Crest-brand White Strips to my patients becasue they do work to whiten teeth . However , they have to be used correctly and I recommend that you follow the directions exactly as specified inside the box .1 . First brush your teeth with a wet toothbrush to remove the layer of plaque -LRB- toothpaste is unnecessary -RRB- . Rinse your teeth well with water . Tooth enamel has pores , and the pores need to be open for the chemical to penetrate .2 . Use the strips as directed on the box . The instructions will tell you to bleach twice a day for 30-minutes a time . The inner part of the strip has a chemical called hydrogen peroxide ; -LRB- in-office , or dentist-assisted dental whitening uses a 15-35 % version of the same chemical -RRB- that causes the stains inside your teeth to be oxidized and turn white .

 I 've been using this product for 4 days and I can see a result already . Not the glow in the dark , frighteningly unnatural white that you often see on people who have had a dental bleaching -- you know that silvery white look that does n't occur in nature . I think the strips have whitened my teeth without making it obvious I 've been whitening them . It 's how my teeth looked ten years ago , before ten years of coffee and soda buildup . Although I 've read reviews that state people have had pain in their gums and teeth , I 've not had a bit of trouble with pain . The only real caution is -- DO N'T SNEEZE . Or if you have to sneeze , keep your mouth firmly closed . When I sneezed , the strips came flying out of my mouth . Also , you really ca n't talk very well while they 're in your mouth , and you feel a bit like you 're foaming at the mouth . However , there is very little after taste -- and my teeth look cleaner without look other worldly . I would definately recommend .
 I 've used the regular Whitestrips before this and got great results -LRB- my sister , a dental hygienist , saw me and exclaimed `` wow , your teeth are white ! '' -RRB- , so I was eager to try the Premium Whitestrips.Contrary to what some reviewers are stating here , the difference between the different Whitestrips are not how white they make your teeth , but how long the whiteness will last . Crest Premium Whitestrips supposedly make your teeth whiter for 12 months , whereas the Ultra ones keep your teeth whiter for 18 months . The original Whitestrips supposedly last 6 months . You can do the math and see what 's worth it to you financially -LRB- and if you really think it will last as long as claimed -RRB- . True to the package cover , I started seeing measurable results at around 3 days . Actually , I noticed whiter teeth after even the first day , but by day three , I was feeling a few shades shy of Regis Philbin 's pearly -LRB- okay , stark -RRB- whites.The Premium kit will give you 7 days ' worth of strips . You wear both upper and lower for 30 minutes twice a day . I would suggest you do it exactly as prescribed rather than following the other reviewer 's claim that it 's okay to wear them back to back for an hour . Things are prescribed a certain way for a reason . In this case , it may be due to the time necessary for your teeth to `` recover '' from the treatments . What I mean is , unlike the basic strips , I 'm noticing lots more sensitivity with the Premium ones . I 'm following the directions and wearing for 30 minutes twice a day . Chocolate , anything sweet or acidic all set my teeth on edge . Something about having that gap in treatments during the day seems to give the teeth time to calm down and be ready for the next session.Others have mentioned that it 's hard to keep the lower strip in place . This can be true . I 've found a couple of things that help immensely . Before applying the strips , dry your mouth and teeth with a clean towel . Then apply the strips , trying to limit them to your teeth rather than gums as much as possible.Finally , though some have said it 's possible to talk with them , just do n't . Your life surely has 30-minute increments of time that you 're simply not needing to talk . I would also suggest not doing anything incredibly vigorous -LRB- such as cleaning the house -RRB- during that half-hour . For some reason , I 've found that makes it more difficult to keep the strips in place . Perhaps we salivate more when we 're working up a sweat . So reading , watching the news , driving to work , vegetating-these are all good activities.When time 's up , pull the strips off and toss them . Do n't brush your teeth ! Things are sensitive , so give your mouth and gums a rest . Instead , rinse with slightly warm water , and take your index finger and `` brush '' your teeth with it to remove any extra gel . Spit -LRB- do n't swallow that stuff -RRB- and smile.I have only two days left of this round of Chrst Whitestrips , and I 'm already incredibly pleased with the results . Your teeth are some of the first things that people notice about you , and they also are something easy you can do to make yourself look more youthful . You 've got nothing to lose but some gray-yellow staining and a little bit of cash . And to help with the cash , be sure to check Crest 's web site where they sometimes offer coupons for the Whitestrips .
 Be prepared for a nasty taste and slimy , slippery strips . But they really did work well . Do n't believe the commercials that you can use these anytime , anywhere . Not unless you do n't mind drooling on people in public . The strips slip all over when you try to talk or even swallow , and especially DO N'T SNEEZE ! But as for the whitening , I was pleasantly surprised . A lot better than I was expecting .
 The Crest Whitestrips do reveal good results , but if you drink tea or coffee , you are fighting an uphill battle . Instead of whitening your teeth all at once -LRB- although that is a good option at the start -RRB- you may want to keep these around for occasional touch ups , important occassions and feel good moods.The strips for upper and lower teeth are easy to use and do n't seem to promote as much tooth sensitivity as other whitening procedures -LRB- like with the annoying gel -RRB- . In fact , it almost seems to make your gums more healthy than before.Probably the most pleasant whitening experience on the market with fairly good results . Why the box has a mirror in it , we will never know unless it is useful to see the results of the whitening . It would be difficult to hold the box and put the strips on your teeth.I 'd recommend trying these and then keeping a box handy for touch up use . Probably will whiten your teeth one or two shades on the first use . ~ The Rebecca Review
 Too much tea had made my teeth look less than sparkling so I decided to try this a month before my wedding . It made my teeth look bright and white , but not like fake white and so I had real nice pearly whites for my wedding . They 're really easy to apply and take off , although the gel on the strips can whiten the tips of your fingers if you do n't wash it off immediately . Even so , this whitening effect on your fingers will go away . What else ? It did hurt my gums a little bit a few times but not so much that I was in agony or anything . My husband tried it later and for him , it hurt his gums and teeth and his first strip was his last . But the directions do say that it is not for people with weak teeth and gums and not to use it right after brushing . Anyway , the verdict for this for me is that it 's a really good alternative to whitening your teeth for an expensive cost at the dentist because it works well and is affordable . Bravo for Crest !
 I 've been using Crest Whitestrips for about 4 years to maintain a professional whitening . The Whitestrips definitely help brighten teeth and even out discoloration from coffee & tea . I must warn that the Premium strips can cause some serious sensitivity . I am on day 3 of 7 and had to take the strips off 1/3 through because the pain was so intense . Another person who rated suggested applying the strips every other day and I agree . The strips do work well though , without a doubt . I swear by them and get a lot of compliments on my teeth . Just keep in mind the sensitivity issue .
 I apply these once a year to keep my teeth whiter , and just brush often the rest of the year . The premium 7-day pack is more convenient than the two week , and premium plus is pretty rough on the gums . Things to take into consideration is the mild discomfort associated with tooth whitening , it can make your gums ache and your teeth sensitive . Some people with already sensitive teeth should probably find another method for whitening , still though , they are a heck of a lot cheaper than having the dentist do it . Also , the dentist usually does such a good job whitening teeth that they look like you brush with radioactive toothpaste or something . . I 've always stuck to the principle that your teeth should n't be any whiter than the whites of your eyes , that way they look nice and white , without that freaky whiteness . In that regard this product will get you where you want to be . Plus , if you brush regularly with a whitening toothpaste , you can maintain your results for a year .
 I 'm on day 3 of 7 days and I can already tell a difference ! It is a little inconvenient because you ca n't talk , eat or drink with the strips in . The strips need to be on twice a day for 30 minutes each time . I put them on during my commute to work , and then again while I 'm watching the nightly news . The first couple of times putting them on was a little tricky and uncomfortable , but then you get used to it . When you take them off there is this slimy gel that remains or your teeth . I just wipe it off and it still seems to work . I am experiencing some gum sensitivity , a slight stinging sensation , but nothing unbearable .
 I like the 7-day Crest Whitestrips better than all the other products ; you see a difference more quickly than using other brands . Much better price , too !
 Excellent product . . More comments on whiter teeth and nicer smile than i 've ever had in my life ! Most everyone noticed w/out even a prompted question to them .
 I do n't really know what to say . It worked wonders for my boyfriend , which is why it 's getting 4 stars , but it barely did anything for me ... so I guess it depends on your teeth .
 I recently got my braces removed and decided to whiten my teeth . During my previous experiences with the strips i experienced no burning , but after i got my braces off , i experienced an unbearable burning . Im sticking through it , but when i take them off ... my gums turn white where the strips were . i do n't know if this is bad or what , if anyone could tell me i 'd like to know . But when i did use them before i had braces , the effects were incredible . they really work
 Okay I am not going to go over the same moans and complains that you have heard everywhere . The main thing that you should really think about is the fact that if you need deep cleaning all over , then this is n't for you because they really only do the front teeth . There is nothing more gross than seeing someone 's front teeth bright white and then they grin and the side ones look gross . It is a weird and creepy effect . Also you have got to put them on straight every time ! Otherwise you could have spots that are n't as clean as the others . Yuck ! Can you imagine looking like you have a piece of a popcorn hull stuck in your gums forever ?! Another important thing is that they will not fit everyone 's teeth . I have relatively standard sized teeth , but my husband 's are a bit wider , so they did n't cover his teeth the same . Keep this in mind because his teeth are not big . I have seen big ones that they will not cover completely regardless . The main thing that I am sure has been mentioned over and over is pain . Well , do n't think that it wo n't bother you . It will . Some people can take it better than others , but almost all feel some sort of pain and sensitivity afterwards . To me it feels as if a layer of your teeth have been stripped away . You have a sort of raw feeling like you get when you cut yourself , but not deep enough to make it bleed . Well imagine all of your front teeth feeling like that ! They are exposed to liquids and foods of all kinds of temperatures . Yikes ! This feeling sticks with you for quite a while after this , so if you can afford it , go to the dentist and get the real stuff done . Otherwise be prepared to pay more than the $ 28.50 for it .
 I kept hearing stories of people 's teeth becoming really sensitive from these strips . Asked my dentist friend and he told me that is likely due to getting the material -LRB- peroxide -RRB- on the gums . Also told me that the results are directly proportional to how long you leave the strips on . With this info , I used the strips with good results and no discomfort.If you 're wondering what it feels like to use these , it 's very similar to getting an x-ray or mold at the dentist . Something in your mouth , which should n't be there , but you 'll be able to work around it with a little practice . Not uncomfortable , just a bit odd , at least at first .
 These work great and the price was reasonable . They have a new one out now that grips better with the same results but way more $ $ $
 I 'm really excited because after three days of use , I can see some improvement in my teeth already . I 've had no burning of gums and have experienced only a slight sensitivity to my teeth . I do n't know if the Sensodyne I started using two weeks ago in preparation for the use of the strips had any effect but the sensitivity is very tolerable for me . Some gripes
 I tried this product about a month ago and I must say I 'm actually pretty impressed . Admittedly , my expectations for this product were n't that high prior to using it , but I think they exceeded those expectations in the end.I knew I would n't get the same gleaming results as I would by getting my teeth whitened at the dentist office ; anyone who has those kinds of expectations from a $ 25.00 grocery store item is setting themselves up for disappointment . However , the results I did get were a lot better than paying loads more to the dentist.Like the box says , I noticed results after the third day and by the end of the week my teeth were very noticeably whiter . I 'm 27 years old though , so my teeth were just starting to get that yellow-ish tint to them . I 'm sure someone older than my self with a life time of say , smoking , drinking coffee or tea , would probably want to get themselves two boxes . However , if you 're like me , and just had a bit of a yellow tint to your teeth and want to brighten your smile a bit , this product will do the trick.As other reviewers have stated , after a few days of using the product your gums may become a bit sore . It 's not unbearable and it goes away shortly after you take the strips off . I did notice my gums were a bit sore while brushing my teeth a few days after the last day of the strips , but hey , no pain , no gain . That little bit of pain was worth it to me to have a better smile . I feel a lot more confident when I smile now , that 's for sure .
 I just bought this product and have been using it for 3 days and already I see a difference . I purposely only did my top teeth at first because I wanted to see if there was a true noticeable difference . I truly see a difference -LRB- not glowing white , mind you -RRB- so this morning I decided to put the strips on my bottom teeth . After trying to install the strip on my lower teeth is when I also decided to write a review . Before purchasing the strips I read the reviews and I noticed that a few of the reviews said that the strips were hard to place on the teeth . I decided to go forth and purchase them anyhow because the resounding tone was that the strips really did work . Since I only started with my top teeth I felt lucky that they worked and I found that they were not hard to place on my teeth . The strip went on and stayed in one place . However , when i started my lower teeth this morning , I found that I have the same problem as many others ... the friggin strip moves all around your teeth and just when you think you have it right where you want it , you move your tongue and it has rearranged itself . My solution ... use the strips on your upper teeth and use the paste on the lower teeth . I can not imagine fighting with the strips on my lower teeth for 6 more days!Final review ... buy the strips , they really work !
 I just finished using this product . It took me 9 days instead of 7 since I would only use one strip on certain days when I experienced some sensitivity in my teeth.I really liked this product , I posted my before and after pic in the customer gallery up there , check it out and you can see my results . As you 'll be able to see by the pictures , my teeth are obviously less yellow and much brighter.The bottom half of my teeth are still a bit yellow , but with another pack I might be able to get a shade whiter if I want . Overall , this was a great product for the price.If you do experience sensitivity like I did , cut it down to one strip pack a day like I did and I think you 'll find that it still works just as well . Definitely check out my before and after photo and see the kind of results I got !
 years ago when the original whitestrips first came out , i tried them . i had great results and the whitening actually lasted longer than i had expected . fastforward a handful of years and i have decided to try the premium strips . i 'm getting braces in a month , and i wanted quick results that would last at least through a portion of my treatment . i used the premium strips for 30mins lastnight and i had amazing results from only one strip ! if my teeth keep whitening like this , i will have to stop using them before the box is done to prevent having the unnatural ` hollywood glow ' . i was blown away !
 I found this easy to use and my dentist recommended it . My gums burned a little but not any real pain . I am on day 5 now and my husband actually said my teeth looked great . I would feel confident in recommending this product to any of my friends .
 I have used this product for 3 years and I love it . I use it once a year just to whiten my teeth and it always does a great job . I always have people notice my teeth . LOVE IT !!!
 I 've used this product twice before and I really like the results . I 've never had professionally whitened teeth so I do n't have a comparison but find these results good for the cost .
 I have n't yet bought the strips from Amazon , however , I have used them before . In fact , just a couple of months ago I did the entire 7-day process and within the first two uses -LRB- That 's one day if you do it day and night -RRB- I saw results . There was a little mild sensitivity , usually immediately after use and would disappear throughout the day . Other than that I had no gum pain or anything , nor did it turn my gums white like it warns is possible . I 'm someone who brushes my teeth daily and has good dental hygiene , but I 'm also a coffee drinker . Over the years my teeth had built up yellow-ish stains and my smile was definitely not very white , though it was n't terrible . I would usually smile with my lips closed or cover my mouth when I laughed because I was n't confident of my smile . After using them , I noticed an immediate change in that I smile openly and more often than I have in years . It definitely gave me a confidence that I 'm grateful of . The best part is that , even though I was skeptical about the label mentioning that it lasts for up to a year , I have n't used them since those first 7 days and , with daily brushing , my smile is still as bright as it was after day 7 . After my year is up , I definitely plan on buying more and using this product again and I more than recommend it.The only downside to it is that I had a strange after taste from the chemicals , but I easily solved this problem by chewing minty-fresh gum daily , which is something I would have done anyways . The taste can last a little longer than the 7 days , but within the next week it was gone .
 They make my teeth hurt if I use them too often ... but not as bad as the `` classic '' whitestrips that they used to sell .
 I have used these for a while and I have seen results with them . They are easy to apply and usually stay on for the full time once they are applied . If the strips start to fall off -LRB- and that is rare -RRB- I just press them firmly back into place with a cotton swab and that usually does the job . I did take off one star because at times they can be somewhat painful because of the added pressure . Overall the Crest Strips are among the best whitening products I have used .
 The product works very well . I chose this item based on the best price I could find on the internet .
 excellent product . I noticed a difference after a few applications . My teetch became noticably whiter very quickly .
 These are the only white strips i trust ! they actually whiten your teeth . I would higher recommend . They shipping was very fast also .
 The whitestrips worked pretty good . I experienced no sensitivity , and only minor burning to my gums . I ca n't really say how well it works long term , but the short term effects were good . Overall the product is a great value and a good buy .
 This is a very good product , and a good price for it , but they send me the product close to expire , that 's the only thing that I do n't like .
 Just after couple of days of use I got whiter smile . This product really works , no bs . you should check this product out .
 This product really works but ... if you have tooth coldness problem -LRB- I do n't have better word for that -RRB- you will be using the strip once in two days . It makes sensitive teeths more sensitive . Other then that do what it says , and available in a good price .
 this has worked AMAZINGLY for me , but my bottom gums have been burned by the peroxide and my top gums have bled sort of profusely , it does n't really hurt though . it just ca n't be good for you.worth the pain though , definitely . beauty over pain any day .
 I bought the TARGET brand . This is my first day and I did notice a difference - a little whiter . . But omg . . it hurt . I never thought I had sensitive gums . . but OUCH OUCH ! And I barely made it through the time needed !! And my mouth is still tingling . . not to mention my tongue hurts ... so I think I will do it once a day at the most . BTW . . I have been through childbirth and have a high tolerance to pain . . but ... this was just REALLY uncomfortable .
 This product is great . It whitened my teeth , but not to the point of looking funny . The box warns about tooth/gum sensitivity , and I have heard of some people having a difficult time with it , but personally it has been quite minimal . I happen to have one porcelain veneer in the front of my mouth , and I found that while the strips whitened my teeth , they did n't do it so much that it made my veneer look out of place . This above all pleased me the most -- I got whitening , but I do n't look like I have a fake tooth in front.The only reason I docked the product one star is because it is a bit annoying to use . I found that the only way to make sure the strips did n't slide around was to wipe my teeth dry before I applied them -LRB- i.e. the same concept as when the dentist uses an air tube to dry an area of your mouth before he works in it -RRB- . This helped the strips to stay in place while I was waiting for the 30 minutes . The only other annoying thing was that if I swallowed I got nauseous -LRB- probably from the peroxide on the strips , some of which in all likelihood gets mixed into your saliva -RRB- . So while it was ultimately the least unpleasant to let a big wad of spit accumulate in my mouth -LRB- and then spit when I was removing the strips -RRB- , it was not exactly enjoyable . However , considering I am without the luxury of a dental office where they use the draining tube for that , this product does the job just fine !
 Cheaper then any deal going on in local markets right now . Product does just as it claims , whitens teeth . I noticed a remarkable difference after just a few days . After 7 days my teeth were glistening . The first few applications did make my teeth a little sensative , but the sensativity did not last .
 my husband I and have used these twice . the first time we were amazed at the results !!!! that was about 8 months ago and now for the holidays we just did another treatment this week . they are very easy to put in and there is hardly any taste if at all . they fit very well also and I have had no problems of them coming off liek others say . I mean seriously for the price you CAN NOT BEAT IT !!! esp for my husband who is a heavy coffee drinker , pop drinker and smoker . the only thing for me is YES the first 3-5 minutes my gums burn and it is uncomfortable but not too bad . . the results are WELL WORTH it for me ... I would not say it lasts 18 months but about 6 months for me ... great product !! I highly recommend ! plus other people even say How did you get your teeth so white ???!!!!
 works really fast ! If you have very sensitive teeth I would recommend using crest regular -LRB- 14 days -RRB- system . It 's more mild , takes longer , but gentle on the teeth.easy to use and really works !
 My experience after using them 3 days
 Works very well over 7 days ; my only complaint is that the lower strips tend to come off .
 It came very fast and I have had great success whitening my teeth . My teeth did get pretty sensitive , but it goes away after a day or two of not using them . It 's not necessary to use them all in 7 days so you can definitely take them over a few weeks or so if you have sensitivity troubles .
 Well these strips work great . I 'm always skeptical about products like this because I 've rarely known a quick-fix product to work for me , and I think alot of the time the results are all in the consumer 's head . I also never have the patience to go through the entire duration instructed on the box . However , I 've been using this product for two days now , and I already notice a difference , and my friends do too . I can only imagine how white my teeth will be at the end of the week . The fact that it only takes a week is worth it to me , too.The only reason I do n't give this product 5 stars is because it is making my teeth ridiculously sensitive ! I 've had my mouth closed for an hour now and the pain still has n't subsided . I might just be a big baby , but it 's a very intense tingling , that of which I 'm not sure I can handle for the entire week . However , all in all I do recommend this product and I doubt your experience will be as painful as mine .
 I bought this because my teeth were beginning to yellow . My dentist -LRB- of course -RRB- suggested that I use an in-office whitening system that would cost a LOT of money . I decided I would give the Crest system a shot before I took the plunge with the dentist . This worked GREAT . In a couple of days my teeth had already begun to get lightened . Now , after the whole 7 days , I am pleased . They could be whiter for sure but they are absolutely good enough -LRB- especially at only $ 25 -RRB- . Application was pretty easy - be sure to press down the strip as much as possible as a lot of saliva collects while they are on . I got a little tender but nothing I would even remotely describe as painful . I am super glad I bought these !
 I received these whitestrips as a X-Mas gift and recently finished the 7 day application . They worked quite well . My teeth are brighter and whiter than they have ever been . I am completely satisfied.You are supposed to apply the strips twice a day for 30 minutes at a time -LRB- so 1 hour per day -RRB- for 7 days . It took about 3 - 4 days before I really noticed a difference and after the full 7 days , there was a great improvement.I never had any tooth or gum pain using these but I know someone else who said it made her gums hurt a little . Wearing the strips makes it a little hard to talk so do n't plan to converse a lot while you whiten . Also they seem to cause more saliva to produce in your mouth . However , it 's only 30 minutes at a time.As the title suggests , these strips are a quick and easy way to whiten your teeth . I recommend them and will probably use them again if my teeth become too dark .
 I received a free sample of Crest White Strips in the mail and I am very pleased with the results . For anyone who has tried whitening strips in the past , Crest White Strips offer significant benefits . First they do n't slide around in your mouth , competing strips I have tried have to be adjusted every time you speak , swallow or breathe ... not convenient . Second Crest has eliminated the slimy-gel that gets all over your hands while you 're putting them in . And finally b/c the strips adhere tightly to the surface of your teeth the solvent is equally distributed and you do n't get a messy half-white , half coffee-colored look on your face . My teeth feel cleaner and look healthier , strong recommends for any caffeine junkies out there . Cheers , K.
 I 've tried many different ones and I 'm like alot of people that want results fast , and this whitener did . I have already recommended it to several people .
 Im suprised , these things actually work . The stuff left on your teeth puts a bad taste in your mouth but I guess thats the price of whiter teeth . Could have made them a little whiter but overall I 'm satisfyed .
 I was very satisfied , as usual , with my crest whitestrips . I usually use them about every 6 months and always get comments on how nice my teeth look .
 My teeth and gums are pretty sensitive so I thought it might be wise to stay away from these after reading some of the reviews , however I was able to use them with no pain at all . The only thing I disliked about them was that they were extremely annoying to deal with and the taste it would leave .
 Used this for a week straight and have visibly whiter teeth . Different enough so that people comment on them being whiter . I did not experience any discomfort with this product at any time . But my room mate how also got them did mainly teeth and gums sensitive to extreme temperatures . It was my first time using and his 3 so we think its because he has used white strips before . Overall great will use again in 12 months !!!
 im on my third day and already see results . so glad i got these . i dont understand why they hurt some people . i dont feel a thing . i guess i dont have sensitive gums and teeth.i recommend this to anyone that wants results after 3 days .
 I like it so much ! It is really potent . I take 2 right after my breakfast and one more after dinner 2 days a week . I take only 2 after breakfast for 5 days a week . I love it !
 Only product I found which contained my recommended dosage . It certainly strengthens . I Will certainly keep a supply on hand .
 I had used Eugalan Topfer Forte in the past after having taken antibiotics . This product will help anyone recover from the damaging effects of antibiotic use . I had difficulty remembering the name of the product and local health food stores did not carry Eugalan Topfer . After several internet attempts trying to recall the name I found the product . This product is better than all other probiotics or yogurt that I have taken for this purpose , especially those in pill form . Once mixed as per directions , Eugalan Topfer is a tasty , easily consumed beverage with a vanilla flavor . You will enjoy the flavor and health benefits .
 This product has a pleasant , mild malt taste . I purchased 1 box and took the 5 Tbs . dose twice daily until gone . I have a bit of a sluggish digestive system and I noticed improvement within the first dose , however once the product was gone my system struggled even harder to regulate itself . I probably needed to purchase a couple of boxes and stay on the product longer . Also , there was no measuring spoon included in my product . The instructions do give an equivalent though.As an afterthought , I have digested dairy products much easier since taking this product . If I could give it 4.5 I would .
 I have used this product when needed for almost 15 years . After a round of antibiotic use or for general cleansing , this product puts back the good bacteria that antibiotics destroy in the digestive track . For some reason the label information is only showing the vitamins also included . On the package itself it shows the pro-biotics that are in it.I just threw out the box I ordered a few weeks ago or I 'd list the ingredients . I have ordered 2 more to keep on hand , just in case.It really makes your stomach feel great . And if you use , like I did , 5 scoops in warm water 3 times a day , it will take about 4-5 days to complete the treatment.At one time I used this product for a full month , using less scoops and using more than one box . But at that time I could not eat dairy products at all and my doctor recommended I try this to see if taking this would fix my lactose intolerance . It did . Have been eating dairy with no problems for over 15 years now .
 I love this stuff . My father is from Germany and gave it to me when I was a kid . I started taking it again recently and it has helped with my intestinal problems such as bloating and gas . I love the taste , and it also has helped with my lactose intolerance . I think you have to take it for a long time , like most products that actually cure illnesses instead of just quiet the symptoms . I 'll be taking Eugalan for months to come .
 I love this product . I take 3 a day to ward of symptoms of depression . They are very easy to take since they are capsules . It takes about 3-4 days for me to start feeling the effects . I do not want to take prescription drugs so this is a great alternative .
 This is my favorite brand of Vitamin C . It is the purest that I have seen on the market , in other words , the one that is simply Vitamin C and not a bunch of other items added as well . I like these because they are time released which is reputed to be better for the system to absorb . The 1000mg pills are especially large , so I do n't recommend swallowing too many at a time . But this KAL brand of Vitamin C is one that I seek out especially in all the health food stores , as it is the one that seems to be the most effective for me . And it does n't have any added ingredients such as gelatin that causes me to have MSG headaches and so forth . So in closing , this line of Vitamin C is pure and healthy . I recommend it heartily .
 I have tried number of manufacturers and this is the best for me . Not aggressive to stomach yet strong . Prevent flu from developing with one of these and 500mg aspirin .
 Heck , who has n't heard of K-Y Jelly ? K-Y brand has been in the lubricant field since 1917 ! But , K-Y Liquid is a newer product . It is thinner than K-Y Jelly , and pours from a bottle -LRB- rather than being squeezed from a tube -RRB- . K-Y Warming Liquid has a certain something in it that causes it to give a mild warming feeling on contact - this can be quite nice if you are prone to feeling cold , as I am.Overall , I found this to be a pretty good lubricant , and I liked the warming properties . Now , among its ingredients is `` Acacia Honey , '' and some people say that it is more likely to cause a yeast infection than regular water-based lubricants . I have n't heard one way or another from anyone authoritative , and have n't experienced a yeast infection since I started using it , but you might want to keep that in mind . The worst downside to me , though , is the taste . If you use this stuff , and then get it into your mouth , you will find it to have an odd , bitter taste that is probably the ingredient trying to `` warm '' your tongue.So , I would say that this is a pretty good lubricant , one with a bad taste . So , if you are considering using this lubricant , you will have to decide if the balance of positives to negatives is worth it or not . Overall , I like it.FYI
 I love this stuff ! It works really well , and it feels great when I 'm masturbating . I used to dry masturbate , but after I bought this I am having the best orgasms to date ! Go get some !
 I 've used about 25 different formulas in the last 10 years or so , and without question , Gary 's `` Bug Out '' is at the top of the list . I feel like some formulas I 've used in the past are too strong , too bitter , and left me with irritation in my bowels and inflammations . Gary 's Bug Out is gentle , yet extremely effective . You can literally feel the parasites begging for mercy ! My energy increased 200 % after using this supplement . It 's extremely beneficial .
 Cats Claw is such an effective immunobooster that the AMA has listed it as a drug to avoid in the case of organ transplant . I 'm sold .
 Lady Speedstick Invisible Dry Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant Shower Scent is effective , as far as providing odor protection , and does keep you dry - for the most part . I find that when I have really been doing something aerobic -LRB- I enjoy walking for long distances -RRB- , I still am all sweaty . This is okay though . It means my sweat glands work ! I am still very pleased with this product and would definitely use it again !
 The lady speed stick deoderant is light in fregrance and lasts long . The price is right and it doesnt cake .
 I ca n't believe that this product is no longer available . My wife and I have used it for decades , and now nobody is carrying it ? It specifically targets throat discomfort from sore throat to cough . It has a very pleasant lemon flavor with a spicy Echinacea bite . Quite refreshing and a very functional product.I hope they bring it back !
 Tums has been making antacids for many years but it was only recently that the company decided to stray from its usual chalky tablet formula . The result is Tums Smooth Dissolve , an antacid tablet that works as effectively as regular Tums without so much of the chalky residue.When I first heard about this product , I assumed that it was going to be harder and similar to a cough drop . This is n't the case . The tablets are smoother than regular Tums , and that means less of the chalky bits of the tablet will be stuck in your teeth after you chew . But they are not completely smooth . This means there is still some residue , it just is n't as bad as with regular Tums . The body of these tablets is a little bit softer and less crunchy , making them break apart more easily than other tablets . But they are not like a cough drop or other medicine that require a good amount of time to dissolve completely.Tums makes this antacid in assorted flavors to satisfy most anyone 's taste preferences . The tablets are pretty effective , too , bringing fast relief to an upset stomach . They also include calcium and some people take them as a calcium supplement . They are not strong enough to handle the more extreme cases of acid buildup , like that brought about by acid reflux disease . But they are good enough to eliminate most of the symptoms of common heartburn and acid indigestion .
 Tums are just as effective as all the famous `` purple pills '' . And now they have a texture anyone can live with . `` Tastes Great Less Crunchy '' .
 I bought it precisely because of the review which describes it as `` too strong . '' And it is . It really increases your vitality and energy . I also bought it because it 's made by Oregon 's Wild Harvest , which is known for high quality control of its organic products . I would suggest start from 1 capsule , let your body get used to it , then 2 , then 3 -LRB- the recommended dosage -RRB- . Couple that with exercise and diet and you 'd see results .
 This pretty stylish ring looks great on and helps the arthritic pain in my finger joints .
 I have had this ring for two days and can not believe the difference ! I am not constantly aware of pain in my thumb and I can pick things up without wincing every time . I love that it is easy to adjust to fit tighter . My thumb joint is enlarged with arthritis so by time I get a ring large enough to go over it , it is very loose and annoying to wear . Not with this ring , it easily adjusted to fit snugly . I only gave it four stars because it does leave a black ring underneath . But the pain relief makes it well worth wearing it anyway .
 I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WHEN I RECEIVED THIS -LRB- PROMPTLY -RRB- ITEM . IT 'S FASHIONABLE , NOT AT ALL CHINSY , AND DOES WHAT IT PROMISES . FOR THE PRICE ... LOOK ... AND OTHER PURPOSES MAKE THIS RING A NO BRAINER . I 'LL NEVER TAKE IT OFF AND PLAN TO BUY A FEW MORE FOR FAMILY AND FRIENDS .
 I have been using Gillette 's Fusion Razor for a few weeks now and it 's a nice razor with some pros and cons compared to Gillette 's other blades . Gillette has some of the nicest products on the market , and I expected the Fusion to blow me away , but unlike the jump that was made when the Mach3 came out , I was not as excited after my shave as I was for the hype beforehand.The Good - The 5 blades are very smooth and glides across the face easily . - Shaving time IS reduced with this new razor.The Bad - With so many blades , I felt like I was shaving off layers of skin . I feel there is a limit to how many blades are realistic , and this felt like it was too big for my face and I could seriously cut myself if I was n't careful . - Shave is n't much better than the Mach3 Turbo . While shaving my skin felt really smooth , but my hairs grew back just as quickly as they did with the Mach3 Turbo -LRB- no noticeable improvement -RRB- . - This razor is SO big I found it hard to get around facial areas like I could with the Mach3 . - The lotion strips on the M3 Power feel better and seem to last longer than on the Fusion razor . - Design and look of the Fusion is n't as slick or nice as the M3 Power . - Blades are no longer interchangeable . They went with a new interface for putting blades in that seems to take a step back , and having to buy the new razor to work with the new blades was a sneaky move in my opinion . - The single blade on the back is useless . It 's very hard to get the angle correct , and it barely gets anything off . The M3 Power got in tight spots just fine.In conclusion , I plan to stick with my M3 Power . 3 blades seems to be just the right amount for getting in all areas on the face . While it might take a shave or 2 more to get all the hairs off then it does with the Fusion -LRB- on the large surface area portions of my face mind you -RRB- , the M3 Power just seems safer in general.This is more like 3 1/2 stars . Yes it 's a nice shave , but it 's not worth all the hype or additional financial burden this new blade will put you back . **** RECOMMENDED
 I 'm cursed with sensitive skin and a tough beard . I 'll break out or rash up if my skin gets irritated , so I have to carefully prep for shaving . After years of trial and error , I 've finally settled on a good shaving cream system
 I 'll concur with others on the closest shave yet . The head is massive but it glides really well . I completely disagree about the blade on the back being useless . Without that blade , which cuts very close safely , I would not be able to cut my mustache area due to the size of the head . When compared to the Mach3 which you had to use for this area the closeness is not even in the same league . That 's my problem area for closeness and so far the Fusion is the best I 've used . My only con is how damn expensive the blades are . I 'm trying my best to only use 2 a month , shaving every other day and none on the weekends , but that 's about the best I can do . That works out to about $ 6 a month just to shave . I 'm going to have to start growing a beard year round and walking to work pretty soon with all of the astronomical increases in prices . What option do you have though ?
 The Fusion does truly gives me the best shave ever , and I have a very thick beard , and I have to agree the blade on the back is useless . One thing though , you have to be very careful . One slip of the hand and BAM ! I 've cut my lips 3 times now , twice bleeding profusely . So be careful ...
 Until I tried Fusion catridges , I got decent shaves but not great . I was always cutting myself atleast once a week , especially on my chin . Now , I get the smooth shaves and I never cut myself . I also think the shaves are closest to the skin that is possible for me . Razors today are vastly superior to razors twenty years ago . I grew a beard for two years to avoid shaving . It seems every 2-3 years , a new shaving product comes out that is much better . I think Fusion is that product . I like the power option as it seems my shaves are faster but maybe it is psychological . I like shaving now because of Fusion .
 This was a good product with a Great price . Shipping was super fast . I will order again from this seller . Thanks a Lot
 One of the best product , arrived on timeOne of the best product , arrived on timeOne of the best product , arrived on time
 If you still uses cartridges to shave yourself you must buy this pack its really really good . must have it .
 Definatly like the gillette fusion power , and if you buy the blades online it comes out to be like .50 cents a week , thats cheap as can be.Gives me a great shave , glad i upgraded from my mach 3 .
 These EXPENSIVE blades work as advertised . This is the closest shave I 've ever gotten from a razor . I have pretty tough facial hair . But these blades cut through them like butter and with less irritation than the Mach 3 I used before . I worried that so close a shave would encourage razor bumps and ingrown hairs . But that was not a problem with these blades.My only complaint would be how darn expensive these things are . In spite of that , I would still recommend them .
 Excellent for people who break out after shaving . Have n't suffered razorburn since I started using .
 I bought a Gillette Fusion razor about a year ago . The other day I realize it needed a new blade -LRB- admittedly I do n't shave every day -RRB- . I 'm going to have to buy some more of these in 2016 .
 They are very sharp . Watch out because now there are six blades to cut yourself with . One of the blades is n't placed right tho . hmmmThey do make a face feel better after the shave tho .
 I 'm curious why the plastic on these blades does not match any of the plastic on my razor or the colors from my other blades purchased at my local convenience store , but since these blades work I 'm not -LRB- totally -RRB- complaining . 5 blades are definitely better than 1 . I think the price in general for this brand is out of control , but it 's probably the best that I 've used .
 These are the best razors for guys by far . They are the most expensive out there but it is well worth the price . They last for a long time . This 8 pack for my power fussion lasts for me about 6 months . The price on Amazon is great becasue these razors almost never go on sale and if you get the subscription delivery you can get even more of a discount .
 The Gillette Replacement Cartridges , although very high per unit , were sold at the most reasonable price I 've seen on the internet .
 These blades shave great , The closest I have gotten without nicks and cuts all over my face . But no matter how you cut it -LRB- no pun intended -RRB- they are expensive!Thanks offering them at a more reasonable prise than brick & mortar stores .
 I was impressed this is the best i have used so by far.I usually shave every other day but this has given me the freedom to skip a 3rd day . wowsers !! . cool item
 The Gillette Fusion Power Replacement Cartridges does cost a substantial amount of money , but it gives the person the realization that he is pretty clean shaven . In a military environment that I live in , we constantly have to be clean shaven . It also means I have to spend a lot of money shaving my face to look good .
 24 count in three 8 count packs , at a much cheaper price than I can even get at the local membership warehouse . I 'm very happy with my purchase .
 After one shave , it is immediately apparent , the five smaller blades beat the 3 or 2 blade models , hands down . A move comfortable , smoother shave for me . I could hardly feel the silky way it removes hair . I had to check some of the strokes to see if anything was happening . I was a recent upgrade to Mach 3 and liked it a great deal . Fushion is quite a bit better . I was surprised . I like the reverse side feature of one blade for under the nose . All Gillette razors give you a shave , but if you are going to shave every day , this is the most comfortable and nicest feeling one .
 This is the only razor that get my face totally smooth and does n't cut my face .
 Best blade on the market ! Best price I could find ! When I run out I will buy more from this vender only !!!!
 Like Homer Simpson , I too am a slave to the Gilette Corporation . Every new razor they come out with I try . It 's an addiction but I have never been disappointed . This razor gets a 4 of 5 from me because of the price of the blades . Seriously , I 've had car payments lower than the cost of an 8-pack . Still ... Shaving with this razor is like shaving with a warm stick of butter , but with a closer shave . It 's close , comfortable , and luxurious . Treat yourself .
 I have owned every incarnation of the Gillette razor , and I can easily say that this is the best . Look , the Mach 3 is a superior razor , and if you are happy with it , do n't worry about immediately running to the store for a Fusion . However , the next time you are about to invest in blades , I definitely recommend you consider making the switch . You will be happy . If you do not own any of Gillet 's miraculous contributions to mankind , good lord , it 's like you have been watching a black and white TV.To address some of the issues brought up in the other reviews :1 . The single razor on the back is necessary to shave some hard to reach places , and although it is an effect of the enormous shaving face , it is well worth it .2 . King of Shaves shaving oil is amazing no matter what razor you use .
 These blades are extra fine I have some . But I have no record of ordering this package of blades . If I did then they are excelent .
 this is the first time in my 60 years + life they actually have a great blade and a great shave . its a little pricey but worth the cash , if you have it to spend.thomas
 This is the best price I could find anywhere . Blades are new and not chinese copies .
 Here 's my take on razors in general
 I 've read alot of reviews on razors where the purchaser believed the product was inferior to the ones you would find at the stores . But , this was not the case , product was as advertised .
 Excellent directly through amazon.com ! No different than at the stores , except for the price . Make sure you order them ONLY directly through Amazon or be VERY careful ordering them through other sites . We had a bad experience with ordering them from someone else other than amazon.com . We ordered them somewhere else because of price . They had good reviews when we ordered , but they ended up being counterfeit . They broke and literally pulled the hair out of your skin instead of shaving it off . We then went to order through amazon and went back to that site to see MANY complaints . They looked like the real thing and the packaging was exact , but they were fakes .
 When I purchased my first Gillette Fusion Power razor a few years ago , I thought it was kind of silly and the vibrating action was a mere gimmick . From my first shave I have been delighted . It really gives the smoothest shave . On the back side of the cartridge is a single blade for the bottom of sideburns and under the nose and other hard to reach places . The cartridges are expensive but they last me for months . This 8-count package should last me for a couple years of happy shaving . I would n't go anywhere without it and I keep an extra one in my gym bag .
 A good shave but blades do n't last long enough to make up for high price.It shaves very smooth.I use it regularly.Would like to see them cheaper though .
 I use this everyday . I doubt the power aspect does anything other than add a gimic . The blades work great and leave my face very smooth -LRB- I would have a very heavy beard -RRB- . I especially like the extra blade on the back to do sideburns and keep the back of my neck looking clean . The blades also seem to last for awhile - mine go two weeks or so before needing a change .
 The service was good and the price was less than retail . Liked the free shipping .
 I am a previous mach3 user and made the switch to fusion power becauseit is a more comfortable shave and I can make blades last for 15 daysor so .
 I used to get lots of nicks and burns with other razors because of my tough beard . Rotary blades were never able to do a close enough shave . Power Fusion gives me a very smooth shave each and every time I use it . It lasts over 20 shaves without any issue . I just make sure that the blades are dry after each shave . Great buy !
 I grow a heavy beard and I hate shaving . This blade allows me to go two days before I really need to shave . Blade last a long time . I surmise that the it is from the fact that you can clean it really well with the vibrating feature of the razor . I will not use any other razor than this one .
 I have loved the Gillette Fusion Razor Blades , but they have become so expensive I thought I would have to change to a different blade . I was very happy when I found them on Amazon.com with a great savings !! If you have n't tried them , I would recommend them . When you need to buy blades , come to Amazon for your yearly supply . Thanks for a great product at such a super price .
 Cartridges are replaced without ever touching them . They snap right into the Fusion razor and can be replaced by just pushing the button on the cartridge . They last about 2-3 weeks and always give a smooth no-nick shave . Gillette has come up with the perfect razor and perfect blade replacement system .
 This one is great . It works very well , the skin is smooth and soft . Just try use this . I recommanded for it . It 's perfect and convenient .
 Gillette Fusion Power Replacement Cartridges , 8-Count Packagemay not be the greatest value out there , but if you have aGillette Fusion Power Razor , Phantom , 1 razorthese refills are what you need . While I can understand that some accuse Gillette of a gimmick , I can say that these razor blades definitely do seem to shave closer than the Mach 3 version . So if it 's a gimmick , then I too have been fooled.However , as it pertains to value there 's no doubt that these come at a premium price . I was hesitant to accept it at first , but after using these refills for a while I am willing to accept the premium . Perhaps its because of the extra blades , but these refills seem to last longer than my Mach 3 ones did.I 've also heard it said that Gillette manufactures refills to a lower qualtiy than the initial blades . Once again , I 've been using mine for a long time and did n't experience that first hand . But be aware of this for yourself as you try these refills . That way you 'll be able to report if I have been fooled about that too . : -RRB- I think this 8 cartridge pack will last me a LONG time . One word of advice , do n't store them in your bathroom where the steam will degrade the blades before use . Store them in a dry pantry or somewhere else till use.Enjoy !
 Best Razor I 've used yet . I progressed from the Mach 3 to the Schick Quatro and was happy with teh move . With this move from the Quatro to the Fusion , the difference was astronomical . I 've heard mixed reviews on the vibrating aspect of razors , personally , it is great for the Fusion .
 Yea I know the blades are a bit expensive but this razor shaves so close I could n't imagine anything else . Plus they have to make up the money somewhere , they basically give the razor away for free . This razor is well worth the investment , I loved my Mach 3 but this is just much better in my opinion . Schick is in trouble now , their crappy 4 blade razor was n't even as good as the mach 3 now what are they gon na do . I recomend this to everyone espically for those who love the close shave !!!
 The item itself is great . The postage sucks . It cost $ 50.00 for an order that cost $ 100.00 . The weight of the item could not have cost more than $ 15.00 . It was also send to me by Priority mail which I did not want.In the future , I believe I will shop at regular stores , pay taxes and not be paying to put lots of extra money in someone 's pocket.All I know is that a 1 , 1 1/2 pound item does not cost $ 50.00 to mail !
 The item was received in a timely manner and we are delighted with the product . No doubt we will reorder when the time arrises . Thank you for offereing this `` great deal '' on a product used daily in our home .
 i really enjoy this product . i threw my m3power away as soon as i got this . 5 blades +1 is better than 3 = P
 I ca n't find these cartridges at my local grocery , for some reason , so it 's nice being able to just order some .
 A VERY GOOD RAZOR AND THE PRICE IS RIGHTWHAT MORE CAN I SAY
 Great razor blades . I get a close shave that leaves my face feeling better than other products I have tried in the past .
 This was a much better value then purchasing locally and the blades are as described in normal retail packaging . Would buy again .
 Excellent cartridges together with Amazon 's excellent cost make this an awesome product . If you happen to own a pair of scissors , there would be NO NEED to get the Frustration-Free packaging . Worked for me ! I like to use these without shaving cream , just water only . Start with the single bladed side then use the 15 bladed * side . Just be gentle and you will avoid bleeding . * That was not a typo . I was just kidding though I would n't be surprised if Gillette released a new razor with that many blades .
 I have been shaving for 40 + years , trying all types of products from disposable to electric razors . I have recently started shaving my head and am happy to say the Fusion Power provides the best overall shave I have ever experienced . It is a little more expensive than other disposables but the close , comfortable shave makes up for the price . Too bad Gillette has stopped mainstream marketing .
 I am one of those guys who have always had to deal with the `` five o'clock shadow that shows up around noon , so it is a tremendous advancement in shaving technology that I can get a close shave that wo n't require a second shave in the middle of the day.Just a tip here ... make sure you use the right shaving `` cream '' ... not just any will do , mind you . The special coating on the razor 's `` face '' -LRB- the blue strip -RRB- mixes the best -LRB- for me -RRB- when I use `` Head Slick '' by Headblade . It is a mentholated cream.HeadBlade Headslick Mentholated Shave Cream 8 fl oz -LRB- 237 ml -RRB-
 I see that by the time I 'm writing this review , the price has gone up.The order was a steal in terms of value , but I see other reviews claiming they are not the real deal.I often felt that something was a bit `` off '' , but was never sure . -LRB- still not sure . -RRB- Would be 5 stars if I was sure if its authenticity , but until then 4 will suffice !
 Of all the blades I have tried in the past , these blades give me the closest shave with almost no nicks or cuts . I have been using them for about 2 years . While a little on the pricy side , they offer more comfort than any other blade around .
 My husband says that `` Everyone who uses the Gillette Fusion knows this is the ultimate shaving product . Smooth as silk ; does n't miss any part of your face . I ca n't imagine any possible improvement that can ever be made to deliver a better shave .
 The blades work as expected , which is very good . The only problem I have is that the price is too expensive . I am only saving it might be $ 1.00 - $ 1.50 on going to the local store and getting them there .
 I really find it much better than the M3 . You just have to pass the blade less times on your skin than with M3.It 's a little bit expensive , but it worth it .
 My first time using a powered stick razor . I definitely get closer shaves when using the power in addition to the 5 blades . The power is nothing more than a small vibrator motor , like a cell phone , but it provides a closer shave because you end up applying more pressure with slower strokes . I used to get 2 or 3 days out of the Mach 3 before it was semi-dull . I can get about a week of close shaves and an additional week of not-so-close shaves out of the Fusion.Overall , the best razor I 've ever had . Also , the most expensive blades I 've had to purchase but Amazon 's subscribe-and-save program is cheaper than Wal-Mart !
 I used a Mach 3 for years and was satisfied . I was reluctant to try the fusion , but a sample was included with my morning paper delivery a year ago , who would have thought to include it with the paper?Anyway , after using the first razor and cartridge , the closeness of the shave was incredible ! I used it for almost 3 months before having to bite the bullet and buy cartridges.The shave from this razor is incredibly close , with no irritation . My beard grows every which way , leading to some discomfort with single or twin blade cartridges . This shaver , while refills can be expensive , provided a closeness in the shave I have never experienced before.I have achieved a longer use per refill , partly I think , because I do not use a traditional shave cream . I use `` Kiss my Face '' shave cream , which does tend to extend the life of the cartridge , while also providing a better and closer shave , with far less irritation.If you use this , try different shave creams , and be sure to thoroughly dry the cartridge between uses . This will help to lengthen the life of the cartridges.One caveat ... my beard is not thick , and I do sport a goatee , which may also help with longevity of cartridges . I currently use one cartridge every six weeks or so .
 This is the best shave I have had from any razor , wet or dry , outside of a barber 's chair .
 I use this product and I , am very pleased with it . I shave about every two days and my Fusion blades still last from 45 to 60 days . Great Product . THANKS ART WOLF
 Although it 's a bit expensive , it 's the only razor that I think thataccomplishes it 's task
 I love the Gillette Fusion razor blades . They give a better shave than their Mach III predecessor , but the cost of blades has risen quite a bit over time making me question if it is even worth the price of the higher end blades .
 I love this razor . It does such a good job when I shave and the tip with the blade helps when I want to trim my mustache or beard . I would strongly recommend this to any guy who needs a great shave .
 Overview
 This is the first blade that does not cut and nick my face and leave me with sores or ingrown hairs . I do n't even have to be careful with this blade . And the fact that they always last 3 or 4 times as long as other blades makes them not nearly as expensive as you might think at first . Recommended .
 Best and smoothest shave I ever Had . The only thing wrong the better the shave the more expensive it gets . Thank goodness for Amazon . Nice blades !!
 I am 71 years old and this is the best razor blade I have ever used . No nicks , no pulling and smooth as a baby 's butt !
 I normally cut myself when I shave with a razor , but with this guy , the cuts stopped . My face would be bleeding after each shave before this guy .
 Such a close effortless shave . You would swear there are no blades except there is no beard left after you slide it across your face . You might think it a bit expensive but my first blade is still in the razor after about a month .
 It 's torture to have to force myself to pay so much for these blades , which results in a lot of price comparing . For some reason Amazon had these Power Blades cheaper than the regular Fusion blades , -LRB- they look identical to me -RRB- , plus they had free shipping and no tax . Much cheaper than any place in town .
 Fusion power razor blades are great but very expensive . I saved over $ 7 for the 8 pack through Amazon vs retail stores .
 I wish these things were n't so darn expensive . I mean really - shaving blades ?! This much money !? Come on ! But - if you use Gillette , you GOT TA get the refils too . They work fine . Really it 's the cost that holds back that extra 5th star ...
 I am very happy with the Gillette Fusion Power . Gives me the best shave I 've ever had , and I shave daily . Very smooth results , and no irritation.I actually received some faulty blades from my recent order - they pulled and dragged on my face , and caused me to breakout . So after testing each blade in the pack , I called Gillette -LRB- 1-800-GILLETTE , of course -RRB- and brought this to their attention . Within about 4 days , I had a coupon in my mailbox for a free replacement 8 pack . And I did n't even have to send the old ones back - they went right in the trash.So kudos on the product , and kudos on the customer service !!
 This item came to me in a timely manner and there was absolutely nothing wrong with this product .
 Once a person uses the Fusion Power Razor , they will never want to use another brand or type !!!
 I WOULD NOT TYPICALLY TAKE TIME TO COMMENT ON SOMETHING AS MUNDANE AS A SHAVING PRODUCT BUT , I HAVE TO SAY IT MAKES A DAILY ACTIVITY SOME WHAT ENJOYABLE , THE POWER RAZOR REALLY DOES WORK WELL & GIVES YOU A REAL CLOSE COMFORTABLE SHAVE!PRICEY FOR A RAZOR BUT , I CONSIDER IT AS A WELL DESERVED LITTLE LUXURY .
 Came fast from the supplier and my husband 's happy with the fusion power blades . Great place to shop if you want to find a great deal on these .

 Great Price and arrived very quickly . I will never pay full price for blades again .
 This is an amazing gift for a Daddy to Be ! He will Love it . It was for my brother in law and he is a 1st time daddy . He wore it with pride and it was the hit of the shower !! Would recommend it to anyone looking for a gift for a man who has everything !!
 I bought this as a gag gift and the recipients LOVED it . We could n't stop laughing . The apron could really be used , it 's durable canvas like material . It 's not small but definitely would n't fit a big guy either . The price for the quality is a little high , but it was worth the laugh . A little splurge for a gift is okay in my opinion : -RRB-
 This gift is sure to get a lot of laughs at any baby shower . Lots of little goodies are included in the pockets , and you can add more of your own .
 Had no idea what to get a friend who became a first time dad . He thought it was the most hilarious thing . Great selection !
 The product seem to be good quality did not have anything to compare to do n't know how helpful i can really be .
 On the Dr. OZ show , he recommends taking vitamin C with this supplement in order to get the full benefits .
 These are great suppliments . I have never heard this brand before . But , now I take 1-2 AFTER my workout . They seem to help in joint and muscle ache and fatique .
 I was exceptical when i bought this pills cause of the low price . But after taking it before my aerobic training -LRB- mostly basketball -RRB- i nottice that i had less fatigue -LRB- more energy ? -RRB- and i sweat a lot more than usual.The only down side is , like other reviewer commented , 2 pills are 500mg , not one , so it will run up quick if you take the recommenden dosis -LRB- between 1-2gr pre-wo -RRB- but for the price and quality , really cant complaint .
 I prefer the capsules , but the tablets work just as fine . I have tried many brands and they all seem to work for us and the motor tics our boys experience with thier muscles from Tourette Syndrome .
 i purchased this along with some other supplements meant to help with chronic fatigue due to fibromyalgia . like i told everyone , if i had to narrow it down to just 1 or 2 supplements and that 's all i could afford , this would be on the list . i noticed a difference within a few days of taking it . i am still on the ultimate supplement search , but this was definitely worth the money .
 While I ca n't attest to it 's fat burning capabilities it definitely helps with muscle fatigue and soreness . If I have any complaints is that I 'm taking 9 pills a day and it burns through the bottle in no time .
 This is a good product for those looking for paticular results - do your research - it 's hard to find a product that has such good quality . Arrived on time and had clear product information .
 i so good for me and my friend we love it PowerNutra L-CARNITINE 500 - 90 Capsules 500mg Metabolize Food

 I learned about this product from a Health-Program on TV . I researched it to get more information and then ordered it on-line . I take it daily , exercise and eat healthy meals , a combination that works.Eva in Texas
 While it is too soon for me to review the product , the transaction was a very good one . The price was reasonable , and they were prompt and arrived in excellent condition .
 I 've been the U.S. Army for 22 years , 8 months now . Shave at least five days a week . I have never had a razar that shaved so well . I was given the Gillette Fusion before my deploymet to Afghanistan in late 2006 . I 've used all types of blades ... single , double , triple and even dipilaties . I was able to make one razor last 20 days throughout that deployment . Did I mention that I use it to shave my head also ??? Since my return at the end of 2007 , I 've been getting a month out of each razor on both my face and scalp . I start to get some drag after about twenty days but what razar gives you this much use that long ? It seems expensive when you 're paying $ 20 + for each package but it last eight months . You have to admit , it 's money well spent .
 Every review I have read regarding the Gillette Fusion razor and blades has been from a male . I am a female and love this razor for my legs and underarms ! I received mine in the mail as a promotion about a year ago , and am still on the original blade ! I often use my Remington electric shaver , but when I want a really smooth , close shave that lasts almost a week , I use my Gillette Fusion . So , while I 've had it a year , I 've probably used it a couple dozen times and the blade is just now starting to dull . I agree with others that the trimmer on the reverse side is a gimmick , especially for a female who does n't shave sideburns or nose hair . My only complaint , like many other users of the Gillette Fusion , is the cost of replacement cartridges . Thankfully , one or two cartridges will last me a very long time !
 The best shave ever . The cartridges are expensive but Amazon has by far the best price for the replacements compared to everyone . CVS and Walgreens can not beat the Amazon price for these replacement cartridges . Well worth the price by not cutting up your face and walking around with stubble and razor burn like you would with less expensive razors ... get the POWER fusion and you wo n't be sorry .
 The fusion system is the best ! I 've used all other methods , and they do n't compare . I 'm amazed at how long the razor blades last . The replacement blades are pricey , but worth it . The vibrating aspect of the razor seems to be helpful , also , but I think it 's really the quality of the blades that does the job .
 Very fast shipping and an excellent product . Also , cheaper price than what the grocery/convenience stores charge : -RSB-
 Makes shaving enjoyable . Close shave , easy use , effective head swivel , no hair clogging , and no hair snagging . I have n't drawn blood with this one regardless of the situation -LRB- cold water , no shaving cream , substantial hair growth , etc. -RRB- The trimmer is quite easy , intuitive , and effective in defining sideburns . A + Gillette , and thank you for the free sample which brought the quality of this product to my attention .
 I received these cartridges by mistake instead of the Mach3 's ordered . The idea of 5 blades that are battery operated to vibrate in an orange handle seemed like something out of a Dr. Seuss book . Very gimmicky and overkill and bordering on kitsch . But rather than going through the hassle of returning them I popped in the battery after rolling my eyes at this corporate invented need and gave it a try . As much as I wanted to hate it , I found it to be a definite notch up the shaving food chain . The blades are very sharp and the vibration somehow seems to allow the head to glide more smoothly and evenly over the beard . The shave and closeness were the best I 've ever experienced . Even the single blade on the opposing edge for maneuvering in tight crevices like under the nose worked perfectly . All this comes with a cost . When I surfed over to see what the cartridges actually cost I was horrified . Soon they 'll need to be locked in a glass container at the grocery store with an armed guard in front of the display . Second , not sure if it 's planned obsolescence engineered into the cartridges , but the blades seem to last only a few shaves , making them even more costly . The blades being mounted so close to each other also make them hard to rinse and they clog easily . Buying in larger quantities lowers the cost per unit somewhat . Personally , I 'm hoping beards come back into style to create some downward pricing pressure .
 After getting my prime membership I realized that I can get a lot of everyday items here on amazon.com with free shipping and at a very reasonable cost . So one of those items turned out to be the ever so expensive -LRB- at the grocery store -RRB- razor blades . I for one dread the day I have to run to the store and spend close to $ 30 on razor blades , I find it to be so expensive and outrageous that it offends me . Of course in comes amazon with a great price on a package of 8 blades for a great price , under $ 20 and free shipping , that 's nearly $ 2.50 per each razor blade . Truly a great deal , I even saved 15 % extra because I signed up for an automatic re-order in 6 mnths . Go amazon !
 There is n't much to say . It seems new razors come out every other week . For the time being , these are my preference but I 'm sure there will be 6 blade razors next week .
 My only problem with these blades is that they do n't last all that long . The aloe strip lasted about three weeks on average and thats not indicative of the cost . For the price of these blades I could go and get a barber shop shave three times a month .
 Gillette Fusion is been my favorite since it came out , I usually go through one every 2-3 months which means this thing is gon na last me few years . great product but just make sure you get it with some coupon or some special discounts .
 great razor , the price was right , and i am enjoy using it , would difinetly recommend to any one in need of a good razor .
 I have been using these Fusion blades for 8 months now , and they give the closest shave that I have ever had . These are a lot cheaper here at Amazon then buying them in a regular store . Thank you Amazon .
 I used to buy Fusion blades on Ebay , but I always worried about getting counterfeit blades . I do n't have that worry with Amazon . I use Sam 's as the benchmark for a good price and legitimate blades . Thanks to free shipping , my price here was a little below Sam 's , without that worry of getting bogus product and delivered to my door . I 'll come back .
 My husband swears by these . He used to shave with cheap plastic razors and bought this one on a whim ; he 'll never go back . He loves this razor -LRB- or more specifically
 For those who already using these blades , need I add more than the great value offered by Amazon!In terms of these blades , they offer the closest shave and minimum of re-application to the face , which can create the ` soreness ' ; very sharp and does not blunt down that quickly so there is great value per blade even though the intial cost seems a little high . Yep , bettter than an electric razor shave and saves that much more time and less dragging effect across the face , which I am sure helps to keep the skin in better shape !
 Nothing shaves better . They are crazy expensive , and unfortunate sacrifice to get a nice comfortable shave ...
 Finally try Gillette Fusion was using Mach3 Turbo . This is much better if you have senitive skin . Less chance of cutting yourself while shaving . Also face feels better after shaving . Worth payng more for .
 The 12 pack seems to be the only way to get these at a reasonable price .
 I feel with razors you get what you pay for . These blades are totally worth the money
 The product was dekivered on time . It was very reasonable and the product is excellent . Best shave I have had with these blades .
 Pricey blades but give a close shave . Best price I have found is right here on amazon .
 the blades are exactly the same as inthe stores but much cheaper with amazon . and ... they are delivered to my door .
 Wht go to a drug or discount store ? The price is soooooo much better here !
 This is exactly what it says it is . It was shipped super fast . I would recommend this to anyone , these are great razors , my boyfriend swears by them . The deal you get on this versus any other store out there , is outstanding . Even walmart could n't beat these prices .
 Buy this if you want to be sure of the best shave experience of your life
 I still believe that Gillette has not done anything spectacular since the Sensor razor blade . All the upgrades since just seemed more gimmicky to me -LRB- lotion pad that wears after 2 uses , extra blade that makes the razor too big -RRB- , and based on previous changes I would have ignored this one . However I got the razor and 1 blade free in the mail and gave it a try . I have been using the same blade for 4 weeks now and I love this thing . I feel like that thing performs wonderfully well . The shaves are close and it has minimized the need for shaving in reverse which i need to do . Also i feel that the strips on this last longer because i still get that squeeky clean and smooth feeling each time . Another big plus is how easily the hair is cleaned from this blade . The running water removes all hair thanks to the design that leaves the front and back of the blades fully exposed . I must say that this product exceeded my expectations . However , i have taken off a star due to its expensive blades -LRB- almost $ 3.50 per blade , retail -RRB- . When i go back to my original shaving system , i will decide if this price is worth paying but somehow i doubt it
 Well , I 've got ta hand it to the Gillette people ... They 've come up with an excellent product ... One that you will want to use again and again ... Of course , they charge an absolute premium for these blades , because they know that people will come back to them . While the blades are indeed excellent , I 've found recently that the real key to a good shave is using a premium shave cream ... Not the stuff you normally find on grocery shelves , but something natural from a company such as Arbonne . At any rate , the blades work as well as advertised , although in my experience they only last about 4-5 good shaves before replacement is needed . Here 's a money-saving tip for you ... You DO NOT need to use `` power '' replacement blades on a Fusion `` power '' razor ... The Fusion non-power blades fit the `` power '' razor , but cost a chunk of change less and work exactly the same .
 I have used most of the Gillete series of razors going back to the Sensor . I have found the Fusion blades to be the best of the bunch . I have tried the newer Proglide Fusion blades , but personally do n't think they are worth the extra money . In fact , I think the Proglide blades tend to dull faster . I also opt for the manual blades as I did n't notice a difference when using the power blades , which are a bit more expensive . Thanks to Amazon for frustration free -LRB- and less -RRB- packaging !
 Buying new blades for your razor is never a pleasant experience . They are expensive and your struggle with justifying the cost each time . However , I will say that Amazon has once again come to the rescue with the price of the Gillette Fusion blades.These blades are about 20 % cheaper on Amazon.com than they are in any other store near me.As for the product , these blades give you a great shave . I can usually get through about 3 weeks before needing a new blade . I have found that cleaning the blade with HOT water after each shave lengthens the time between needing a replacement . The shave with this blade is very close . The first time you use with , you will feel it gently glide against your skin . I have yet to receive a cut with using this blade . Of course , just be careful when using it.Pros : - Amazon has the best price anywhere for these blades - Severely less tug and pull during the first few uses of each blade - 5 blades makes the process smoothCons : - Price - Lotion Strip is pretty meaningless , it does not last very long - Single blade on the top of the cartridge is useless in my opinion . It 's too small and not sharp enough to do anything meaningful .4 / 5 Stars ... price the only downside but you will not find it cheaper anywhere else . Amazon has the best price for these blades and I have been using them for years .
 This product gives the best shave ever . There are 5 blades , all parallel to each other , which is the secret to the close shave . Each blade is sharper than the one above it . The first blade , which is the least sharp , functions to pull the hair out of the follicle a bit , then the second blade cuts the hair and pulls on it some more , then the third blade cuts some more and pulls the hair out even further . Finally , before the hair can snap back , the fourth blade moves in , and cuts the wily hair to infinity . My theory is that the fifth blade is just a marketing ploy and it really does n't do anything . So , if you are willing to spend the money for the closest shave ever , buy this product . Or , if you are out of work because of the economy , you should get a Bic razor from Wal Mart .
 These blades are very comfortable , and the single blade on the back gets into every nook and cranny . When I shave every day , I can use an electric to keep up . When I 'm on vacation or just do n't care to shave every day , these guys do the job when I get around to it . If I use them exclusively , I get 30 days of use out of a single cartridge , whether I shave 30 times every day or 10 times every 3 days . My son has the power version , which is fun to use but does n't seem to work any better .
 I do n't know about those who say `` only four uses '' ... I use one blade for two weeks -LRB- 14 uses -RRB- ... Anyway , I like the smoothness of the cut of this blade . It 's really nice . My only complaint is that the blade is so fat -LRB- wide -RRB- that it 's hard to get those tricky places , like your moustache under your nose.Great product , and I do agree , that once you are a `` Gillette man '' you are always a Gillette man . : -RRB-
 very fast delivery and great prices i recomend them highly
 When I first saw the Gillette Fusion at the drugstore , I thought to myself
 A Work of Art and the best shave I 've ever had ! I laughed when I heard Gillette was coming out with a razor with 5 blades but it did n't surprise me . This is the best shave I have ever had . The 5 blades glide across the face without friction or burn and the shave feels effortless . The 6th single blade is gimmicky but good for what it is for ... under the nose and sideburns.I cringed when I saw the cost of replacement blades but buy your blades on EBAY and save lots of money . I bought 64 Gillette Fusion blades on Ebay for about $ 85 .
 I was nervous buying this because I thought that maybe I was not getting the real deal with this . I was encouraged knowing that with Amazon this would not of been a problem so I went ahead and ordered -LRB- since I knew I could return easily with Amazon -RRB- . I got my razors and they work great . I have used the same razor for 3 weeks now and still do not need to replace the blade . They do not fall apart like someone else mentioned . They do not go dull very fast either ; I shave at least 5 times a week and still am using the first blade after 3 weeks . I recommend this to anyone who is trying to get the best deal for blades . Feel free to ignore the other reviews that say this product is fake or defective ... I agree with another reviewer who said that they believed those reviews to be miss leading .
 This blades are by far the best I 've ever used ... I have very sensitive skin and since using these magic blades , my girl can not get her hands of my face . Also I used to get a lot of razor bumps in the neck area ... however Gillette have taken care of this problem for me . Absolutely the best !!!
 I have very very sensitive skin , and try to shave only once a week if it helps . Max 3 times . I have tried almost all damn razors and shaving gels in market worth trying , nothing has come close to Gillette , be it disposable ones or Mach or Fusion or Series gels , they win hands down . But they have their limits . Some one wrote that they last longer if we dry it , rust is what blunts a blade kinda ... naah not at all . Generally I hate water , be it a razor or a towel or anything else . I dry my razors using hair dryer for a minute after shave , and consequently the blades get dry too . It helps keep water of my rack too . But no matter what , personally , I have n't seen blades remain sharper for more than 4/5 shaves at the max or more than 3 weeks if once a week shave . For a good and a clean shave , a blade lasts Max of not more than a month . No problem with it for 6 months , it will work , but would be a damn bad shaving experience . We do n't need to get a Gillette for that , any run of the mill Chinese throwaways would do .
 Honestly , the original Fusion blades are better then the newer ProGlides , which are interchangeable on any Fusion handle . The ProGlides just sting more .
 I switched last year to the Gillette Fusion razor -LRB- ProGlide -RRB- - and love it . I never thought a simple razor -LRB- powered by a simple AAA battery -RRB- could be so efficient and effective . But with every razor comes the need for blades -LRB- which is what ends up being the true expense of shaving -RRB- . Buying quantity reduces that price - and buying monthly through Amazon 's reminder program facilitates the process . The Fusion Manual Cartridges are excellent in my opinion . They are reliably consistent , providing a time-efficient smooth shave . I use each blade 2-3 times - and for me , am happy to have finally found &#34; my solution &#34; for shaving that eluded me for many years with numerous previous razor systems and blades that I have tried . Thank you for this product !
 those who know use the best . these are the best . been shaving My head for well over 10 years . tried them all . these are the best . cant touch the price locally .
 While this is the most affordable option for this item I found , it is still quite expensive . Glad to find them here .
 Very good price and free shipping.Just like advertised.Very comfortable and close shave . Highly recommend this product . Blades last a long time .
 My husband has been using these for years , but this is the first time we purchased them on Amazon . They work great and arrived quickly and the price was even better than Costco !
 Item just as described works great and arrived quickly . I Will order again when items needed . No problems very happy .
 fusion blades are great for the manual razor . i have never had any issues using them so far !!!
 This is the first time I have ordered the fusion cartridges on line and they are working out just fine .
 PROS :1 . Good quality razors , for my wife , daughter , and myself .2 . Price is reasonable , if you are on subscribe & save plan.CONS :1 . Pricey if not using Amazons `` Subscribe & Save '' .2 . Can find cheap at your local discount stores.I used Amazons Subscribe and Save for the easy of use since my family uses razors at a regular interval . I hate shopping at the brick & mortar discount stores .
 The higher cost is easily off set by the smoothshave and the logevity so I use less blades and ultimately spen less with fusion blades
 I get a much better shave than with any other blade . Tried others - in my opinion , this is the best one .
 It 's no secret razor blade cartridges are outrageously expensive . That 's why the handle itself with 1 cartridge is always cheap -- where they get you is on the replacement cartridges . I bought the batch of 12 , it came exactly as advertised . Not sure why some people had bad experiences and gave 1 star ratings ; the ones I got are definitely legitimate . Comes in a little white box with the Gillette logos all over . 3 sets of 4 cartridges . Much more cost efficient than buying a pack of 4 or 8 retail .
 My mother gave me a Fusion for Christmas last year . I used it for the first time just a couple of months ago . This is , no doubt , the best razor I 've ever used ! I can shave my legs and underarms quickly without the fear of nicks . This razor glides across your skin so smoothly ; I could n't believe how close the shave was . My underarms and legs were absolutely hairless and stubble free!I did n't realize the razor used replacement blades until I looked on Amazon in search for another razor . Once I saw my razor on there with replacement cartriges , I bought the 8 replacement cartriges -LRB- BTW , the blades last forever so 8 will probably last up to 6 months -RRB- . I will use only this razor from now on .
 Shaving every day , you are introduced slowly to the dulling of a blade . You forget how well they shave when new . The indicator strip reminds you when to change the blade . I 've never had a close a shave with any other product . These are pricey , but worth the money .
 The price was good the blades work great i would buy them again and recommend them to friends buy them
 Les doy mi mas sincero agradecimiento por el producto que recib&iacute; se los agradezco saludos desde venezuela siempre los recomiendo por tan buen servicio
 I acidentally ordered these when trying to order Fusion ProGlide razors . I actually like these better than the ProGlide ones . I get less irritation , which the ProGlide is supposed to minimize , and it has lasted jsut as long as the ProGlide razors .
 The quality of the item is amazing . Gillette Fusion Cartridges rate an 10 of 10 . I ownly used Gillette razors for my sentives skin .
 I always get a great shave with the Gillette Fusion and had been buying these razor cartridges from a local store up until last week when I noticed I could get them online for a lot less .
 These are good razors and a grate value , but there just not very good on my neck gives me bad razor burn other than that they are grate ...
 these are great razors and better price than buying them at the store . the 12 count will last awhile in our house .
 I have been using this razor -LRB- on my LEGS not face lol -RRB- for quite a few years now and it is the best ! I prefer Men 's razors to Women 's because they give you a closer shave -LRB- though you do have to be a little more careful ouch ! -RRB- and legs stay smooth longer . I will be subscribing for this item and I will be trying the shower spray tip that reviewer `` Jonathan Sabin '' wrote in a previous review . I hate the cost but it IS worth it ! -LRB- tip for the girls , with some hair remover soap and / or lotion makes very smooth legs for longer ! -RRB-
 I really like the Gilette Fusion razor blades . The only thing I do n't like is the price . Razor blades have gotten really expensive . None of the ones I 've tried have lasted as long as the Fusion blades . But even they should last longer for my pocketbook .
 My husband has alwasy liked Gillette Fushion and when I found this on Amazon.com and saw the price , I had to order !
 The Gillette Fusion system is a great for shaving . It may be a bit pricey but I have never had a closer shave with any other product . I switched from a `` three-blade '' system which was good but it can not compare to the 5 blade . I was skeptical though I 'm glad I made the switch .
 Nothing special to mention here . They are just Gillette Fusion blades . Price was still lower than anywhere else . I only shave once a week so I can use same blade quite long .
 The razor blades were received extremely fast from vendor . The blades arrived in original packaging . I would order again from this vendor .
 This deal rivals Costco and BJ 's . I 'm happy with it and the Razor works significantly better than many other cheaper razors out there .
 It 's really an awesome product from Gillette ... Gives me a real clean shave ... What 's more ... The price 's great at amazon ... I highly recommend buying this product from amazon .
 I know it 's a stupid question , but I 've always used disposable blades until now.How the heck do you take the cartridge out ?
 not much to say . its what I ordered and expected . Del was also as expected . not much cheaper , but anything to get back at California .
 I bought this prodcut three weeks ago . I received the package on-time and the prdocut was the right original one , but the only thing which was different , is that the posted photos of the packaging setting was different from what I got . It is really not a big deal , since I got What I ordered . Over all , I recommend this product .
 These are pretty good blades ... let 's face it , they get the job done.Some people say they 're costly , and I agree they 're not cheap , but neither is buying an electric razor . Sure , you may be able to buy one for $ 30 , but look at the reviews ... usually they suck . Sometimes you pay over $ 100 for a good one , and even some of those are n't that great.If you buy these on Amazon , they 're much more affordable . I still agree they 're somewhat overpriced , but they work pretty well , and I do n't cut myself much . The life-prolonging tip on the other review sounds great as well , though I have n't tried it yet .
 I got this at a good price and definitely worth it , an excellent shaver for DH he will not use any other !! thanks !
 I 'd been using the Mach III for so many years and decided it was time for change - ` Yes we can ' . Anyhow using the Fusion is a lot more effortless and even gives a closer shave .
 i am new to manual shaving , having switched from electric shaving about a year ago . As a novice , i 've tried different blades and shavers , but was not quick to get to Gillette Fusion due to a number of angry negative reviews . Many of them pointed out a relatively high price of these blades . Well , after a couple of months using them i can say that the blades are super sharp , leaving my face feel absolutely smooth , while never cutting me , unlike some other blades . I say - give them a try and see for yourself . As for me , i signed up for a regular once every four months delivery .
 As the title says , this make my life easier . I just buy them from here when I 'm running low , and they seem to be the same product that you get in the store , as far as I can tell ... The price is about the same , and I save on gas and time by not driving to the store and then waiting on someone to unlock the hanger .
 I shave my head - so a clean , heavy-duty blade is a must . The shave can not leave spotty stubble , and the blade ca n't dull after 2-3 attempts either.These Fusions are the best blades I 've used for the task . I often go more than a month with the same blade , with no noticeable extra effort needed on head or face . The shave is clean and usually just a few passes with the blade will do the job.Even with a week 's growth on the head , the blade is up to it -LRB- granted , I 'm pretty bald , so we 're not talking a full head of full , lustrous hair , here -RRB- . It might take extra work , but the blade rinses easily and a little extra time is all that 's needed.The one flaw is not the blade 's fault - but it 's still something to be aware of - if you screw up with these blades , especially if you 're using them for headshaving , your mistake will not be painlessly forgiven.I 've cut myself quite a few times , usually on the fingers when I 'm switching hands , or other accidents - and the multiple blades guarantee more than a nick . It will flay the skin along several lines , and it can be pretty deep , and it will bleed a lot . It can be the kind of cut you 'll actually need to pay attention too.Other blades can cut too , of course , but this razor 's series of blades will make it quite a bit worse . If it was just my face , I probably would n't make the mistake , but since I 'm shaving my head I ca n't always see what I 'm doing , and that can be the problem . I 've never cut my head - only my fingers and rarely , face.That is not the blade 's fault - it 's mine ! But I ca n't imagine I 'm the only one whose done this . I know we 're all careful with blades , but this one deserves a bit of extra care and attention - it will not forgive any carelessness.But - the blade itself is a rare product that works maybe better than advertised . If you need a clean shave for thick stubble , this should work for you .
 Husband uses only this blade and likes the shave he gets . This time he purchased them in quantity so he saved $ .
 I bought a 12-pack of these before moving overseas for a year . There 's not much to say really , they worked fine and lasted a long time .
 Have been using this style razor for a while and would not know what to use to replace it . Ordered a well priced replacement blade package that was delivered on time in excelent condition .
 I have used the Gillette Fusion razor since it first came out . I really like the shave I get and the blades are comfortable and fast to use . With 5 blades I do n't have to shave the same spot on my face multiple times , the first stroke gets it done right . This eliminates razor burn for me and results in a more comfortable shave.I like how the blade assembly follows my face and provides a good shave by keeping the blades at the right angle and in full contact with my skin . I also like having the one blade side for trimming my mustache and side burns . The lubricating strip is a nice feature as it improves the gliding motion of the blade head and also acts like a blade wear indicator . I get a lot of use out of these blades as they seem to me to last longer than other brands and blade designs.Out of all of the types of razors I have used for many years , there is no comparison to the Gillette Fusion . I even hate to use another brand or razor because I am so used to the comfort of this design .
 This is a great product . I have been using it ever since it came on to the market . The Amazon price is number one .
 Buying this product on amazon saves a ton of money . I would recommend it to anyone over going to a store and buying it for at least double the price I paid .
 Im in Afghanistan , and I shave every friggin day . I need alot of change outs for my gilly Fusion so I went ahead wih this pack of 12 . There is no difference between these and the 4 pack ones .
 Enjoy the blades and convenience of online ordering . They are making me write 12 more words to fit the format .
 Works great . The razor blades are the original product in the original packaging . Make sure not to get the electric if you dont need .
 If these things are different in any way , shape , or form from the store bought cartridges it probably requires inspection with a quality 10x loupe and more knowledge of Gillette manufacturing standards than I will ever bother picking up.Cuts perfectly smooth against the grain -LRB- the only reason I got caught up in the blade count frenzy -RRB- , the first blade has been in every other day use for well over a month . Pretty much what I have come to expect from the Fusion cartridges.I expect nothing surprising when it gets warm enough to shave my head again .
 My guess is that I am not alone in this experience , or maybe I am.This cartridge does a fine job - it MUST be used manually , as the product 's name suggests.Without paying attention to this important difference , I turned on the power and experienced pain.If you read any reviews with the word `` pain '' , that may be the reason.Happy shaving .
 Love these razors -- ca n't beat the price here . Arrived on time -- I am very happy and will order again .
 Not a lot that you can say about it , but it is a nice quality product , that gives you a good and clean shave , and also lasts a good bit of time
 The best for now.I love it.Comfortable and easy to use , Lasts very long time and it appeared the cheapest shaving cartridge .
 Cartridges for most razors are pretty darn expensive . I 've been using the Fusion for a long time and am still happy with it and the cartridges that are made for them . I 'm really pleased with the cost of this 8-pack ! The blades last long , and the trimmer on the opposite said does a decent job ... a nice added feature.Hope this helps .
 Being in the military we have to shave often , and being black , I get razor bumps -LRB- our hair is curly and when you cut it , it regrows under the skin causes irritating bumps also visibly unsightly -RRB- so this razor along with the battery powered razor helps reduce razor bumps greatly!For those looking to buy , buy a 4 pack and they should last a year , that green strip does n't really mean anything at all , you can put on whatever aftershave or lotion on your face when that wears out , and you are not Chuck Norris , your hair does n't damage the blades , what damages the blades are the minerals in your tap water . So just get a 50 cent bottle of alcohol to rinse the blades after you are done shaving , and this product will last you a while . Just think how often do you sharpen your lawn mower ? And sometimes those blades nick cement !
 I 've been using these razors for years and love them ! They give a great shave and the moisture strip on them is nice , but I continue to use the razor head for long after it is gone -LRB- I just soap up -RRB- and it still gives a great shave with no nicks .
 I get really good use out of them , they last and the price is better than Target or other places I 've seen them
 Gillette does make the best blades . They are too expensive and they do n't last but three shaves but that 's fine .
 These razors give me a close , smooth shave . Each cartridge lasts me 3-4 weeks with every-other-day shaving . An excellent value !
 Standard Razors , just as advertised , no complaints from me . Just wish they were not so expensive but they are cheaper than WalMart
 I 've used these blades for years , graduating from the less expensive type . I originally started shaving with the dual-side , double blade that sold for 5-cents and lasted for years . Amazon offers the Fusion in several different packages . The way I figured the 8-count offered the most savings ; I ordered four which should last until next Fall.They work when the beard is soften , the shave cream is spread thin so as to avoid clogging the blades , and avoid irritating the sensitive skin -LRB- usually the neck -RRB- by repeaded overage . I remember an old SNL satire on the &#34; 5-blade Gillette &#34; which was funny and intuitive.Check the quantitiy when order for the best value .
 Thank you guys.It was delivered quickly and really good quality.I an using Gillette long time over 15 years.I love Gillette product line , Gillette Fusion is my favorite .
 I like the price . The convenience of home delivery . I can use one of these blades for six months of shaving every other day . Sure , the little green glide strip is gone after the first use but that is what shaving gel/cream is for . I buy in bulk , it is less costly . Have fun !
 Fast and good service . I really appreciate your efforts . Too bad we have to use so many words to put in our review !
 I 've been very happy with the Mach III for the past few years -- but then a Fusion razor and cartridge came in the mail and I figured I 'd give it a try.I 'm probably a good one to test razors ... see my photograph -- not only do I shave my face , -LRB- though I typically have a goatee -RRB- , but I also shave my entire head as well.I 've been using the same Fusion blade now -- daily on my face , and just about every third day on my head -- and despite some claims to the contrary , it 's still going strong ... after almost three weeks !! Why has my blade lasted this long , despite my pretty heavy usage ? EVERY time I shave , after thoroughly rinsing the blade , I GIVE IT A QUICK SPRAY WITH SHOWER CLEANER . -LRB- Such as `` Clean Shower '' or any of the no-wipe cleaners that you spray after using the shower . -RRB- Then I set the razor so it 's standing with the cartridge end down.This does two things . The shower cleaner ensures that no film of water remains to dry on the edges of the blades , leaving spots for microscopic rusty areas to form , -RRB- and standing the razor blade-side-down makes sure that gravity takes any debris or water that MIGHT be left on the blade , DOWN and AWAY from the blade edge , since the edge of the blades face UP when you have the cartridge down.Prior to doing this on the Mach III blades , I 'd also get about 3 or 4 good shaves out of a blade ... but once I tried it , I got as many as 30 . It makes a HUGE difference ! I should also point out that I almost never get nicks and cuts . -LRB- I 've been shaving my head for about 4 years , and I think I 've nicked it shaving ONCE ... . part of the reason is because I 'm very careful about using my blade-cleaning technique . -RRB- Note to Gillette ... Send me a lifetime supply of Fusion cartridges and I 'll consider removing the blade-life extending tip from this review ! ;--RRB- - Jonathan Sabin
 I shave about every other day due to skin irritation from other razors that I have used . I purchased a Gillette Fusion razor with a $ 4 off coupon out of the Sunday news , and that gave me the razor for about $ 1 after the in-store rebate.This is easily the best razor I have ever owned/used . One pull of the razor across my face makes the skin unbelievably smooth . I wo n't be switching to anything else after buying this product.TIPS : Do n't throw the cartridges out after the aloe `` indicator '' strip fades - that thing is useless junk added on to make you replace the blades more often than is necessary . Keep a bottle of alcohol handy with your shaving supplies . The thing that dulls most razor blades quickly is hard water deposits of calcium and other minerals that build up on the blades when they dry after rinsing . They key to getting the most use out of the blades is to rinse the water off with alcohol after use , and then let the blades air dry . I can get more than a month of shaves out of a single cartridge before the blades dull and start to nick or pull at the skin . Buying a 12-pack of blades lasts me longer than a year ...
 The Gillette Fusion is a great blade but does n't last long . I found a secret that makes a blade last 4-6 months . After shaving , rinse the blades well , knock the loose water from the blade by taping on a dry towel and then blow on it until it is very dry . Shaving does not make the blade wear out -- rust does . Leaving the blade wet will lead to micro-rust in a few days so figure out how to dry it after using and it will stay very sharp for months . Try it and you will see .
 I have been using Gillette 's Fusion Razor for a few weeks now and it 's a nice razor with some pros and cons compared to Gillette 's other blades . Gillette has some of the nicest products on the market , and I expected the Fusion to blow me away , but unlike the jump that was made when the Mach3 came out , I was not as excited after my shave as I was for the hype beforehand.The Good - The 5 blades are very smooth and glides across the face easily . - Shaving time IS reduced with this new razor.The Bad - With so many blades , I felt like I was shaving off layers of skin . I feel there is a limit to how many blades are realistic , and this felt like it was too big for my face and I could seriously cut myself if I was n't careful . - Shave is n't much better than the Mach3 Turbo . While shaving my skin felt really smooth , but my hairs grew back just as quickly as they did with the Mach3 Turbo -LRB- no noticeable improvement -RRB- . - This razor is SO big I found it hard to get around facial areas like I could with the Mach3 . - The lotion strips on the M3 Power feel better and seem to last longer than on the Fusion razor . - Design and look of the Fusion is n't as slick or nice as the M3 Power . - Blades are no longer interchangeable . They went with a new interface for putting blades in that seems to take a step back , and having to buy the new razor to work with the new blades was a sneaky move in my opinion . - The single blade on the back is useless . It 's very hard to get the angle correct , and it barely gets anything off . The M3 Power got in tight spots just fine.In conclusion , I plan to stick with my M3 Power . 3 blades seems to be just the right amount for getting in all areas on the face . While it might take a shave or 2 more to get all the hairs off then it does with the Fusion -LRB- on the large surface area portions of my face mind you -RRB- , the M3 Power just seems safer in general.This is more like 3 1/2 stars . Yes it 's a nice shave , but it 's not worth all the hype or additional financial burden this new blade will put you back . **** RECOMMENDED
 Not too much to say , but the Fusion is my favorite razor . They cause the least amount of pain , and get the closest shave out of anything I 've used . This is probably the best price you will be able to find anywhere ever , except for some knock offs that wo n't be nearly as good . It may be slightly cheaper to buy them in a larger number , but really . . not that necessary . Just buy enough to get free shipping and you 're set . Cheaper than any other website , cheaper than a 40 pack at Costco.These are full of win .
 My husband has a tough , fast growing beard . -LSB- He is on medication that stiumlates hair growth , so the beard is abnormally fast growning . -RSB- Gillette Fusion Manual does the trick for him .
 I do n't know how Amazon does it but this is 12 razors for the price of 8 anywhere else . Even better it comes in an easy to open and store carton , not those extra sharp plastic packages you can only open with a scissor .
 I would like to say that I have tried them all including electric and about every blade system available and this is by far the best shave in my experience . The Fusion does not irritate my skin nor do I get a razor burn with it as I do other brands since I have very sensitive skin . This blade system is so precise I can even dry shave if it is the first use of the blade when I am in a hurry and that would not be possible with any other razor I have ever used , after the first use the blades do dull a bit and I have to use shaving cream or I can get shave burn . The only con I can think of is that they can be a bit pricey if you buy the singles so I would suggest that you either buy the biggest multi pack available to save the most.Update - still the best but I have found an electric shaver that finally gets close to the smoothness , Norelco 3D 1290 .
 As expected , the product is the same as I know . The package is a bit cheap , not like the one you get when you buy at the store , but it 's not important .
 The title pretty much says it all . If you can order enough and ahead of time to get free shipping they 're same as the store but cheaper .
 I am 63 Years Old Male and have been Shaving since I was Sixteen Years Old . I have used so many different types of Blades until I received a FREE Gillnetter FUSION Razor in the Mail Many Years Ago , when they first came out . I have an Average Density and Medium Beard Texture , so in my First Experience I really wanted to Test this NEW Blade . So with taking care of it by softening my beard with just warm water before shaving and then using just plain soap to lubricate my face before shaving , then washing it out with just warm water , I was able to make `` ONE Blade '' LAST almost a FULL YEAR ! When I Purchased my 1st 4-Pack at the local CVS Drug Store & paying about $ 20.00 for it , I 1st thought this was rather expensive , but when I really thought about it , I realized this was actually less expensive than buying those cheaper disposable blades ! And then more recently to FIND OUT that `` Amazon.com '' DISCOUNTED this Product -LRB- 3 4-packs for about $ 30.00 , PLUS FREE Shipping -RRB- this is about ONE THIRD of a regular Drug or Retail Store 's Price ! WOW I have NOW Become Not ONLY a `` Gillette FUSION '' Addict but an `` Amazon.com '' Addict as well ! THANK YOU Gillette ! THANK YOU Amazon.com ! Jerry Barton , Sr. , from the South Poconos in PA. .
 I have used these razors since they were first introduced and have always worked great for me . The razors are very smooth .
 Love the razors . . Been using them for three years now . Always smooth results . . and the price is unbeatable . You will not find it cheaper anywhere else .
 My husband was very happy to get these , hard to find them , but we know where to get them now.Nancy Gebbie
 A 4 pack of the blades is 16 dollars at Walmart which is usually the cheapest place for blades . You ca n't go wrong with this price for a 12 pack .
 smooth shave every time - long lasting -LRB- compared to other blades such as ATRA - will buy again
 You ca n't get this product anywhere else at this price !! Plus you get free shipping .
 Gillette Fusion in 12-count packages has the best cost-benefit . Not even mentioning the good quality and efficiency of Gillette products .
 Provides close shave and the wear indicator bar shows when the blades are getting too dull for my skin . Works well .
 i have started using the fusion manual cartridges and they work great . Sharp , dont cut my skin , and get unclogged easily under the tap . Long life too .
 Do we really have a choice anymore ? These blades are the only ones I 'll ever buy . And when they come out with a version with 10 blades on it , I 'll buy that too . These work so well . When they 're new - it 's like you 're not shaving at all - it 's so smooth . As they age , you definitely feel it . I can get 2-3 weeks with one blade - not bad .
 I used the Gillette Sensor 2 blade razor for years . Gives an excellent and as close a shave as possible but not easy on skin ; left it chronically slightly rough . The 3 blade Mach 3 was as good but could n't shave under nose closely . The Fusion solved both problems . Shaves as close as the Sensor and has the single edge to shave under nose . And it is very easy on skin of face . The Fusion lasts a month shaving once a day ; I 've timed several blades .
 Probably the best razors I have ever used , and I always find the best prices here on Amazon .
 I certainly like these blades . However , have found them to be profoundly expensive in the stores ... too much so.The prices on Amazon with 3 sets and and shipping dropped my per unit cost to $ 2.19 @ as compared to over $ 4.00 per unit in my area.Wouldn ' t use any other kind ... as long as I can find them at an affordable price .
 I bought this for my boyfriend as far as I know he loves this product for saving his head . He does n't buy anything else so I bought him some for Christmas ...
 These blades may be a bit pricy , but are well worth the extra cost in my book . I usually get 30 days worth of shaves off of one blade , twice the normal . And the trimmer on the back works splendidly for my goatee .
 Like others have said , the cartridges are way too expensive and wear out much faster than they should . But for the first time since I started shaving almost 20 years ago , I can finally say I 've found a comfortable shave . I 've been using Gillette products for several years now , always switching to the latest product . Each one improved on the comfort over the prior , with the possible exception of the `` power '' versions over their `` manual '' counterparts . But until now , I was never completely satisfied . Now I just have to wait for the next product so they 'll hopefully lower the prices on the Fusion replacement cartridges .
 If you suffer from folliculitis , this may just be the razor you were waiting for ! I tried the Mach 3 a few different times over the years but all it would take was just one shave and , boom ! , my face would break out with folliculitis . Although Gillette claims the Mach 3 reduces irritation , I always found it super irritating.Two things seem different about the Fusion . The closer spacing of the blades seems genuinely to reduce the irritation I found in the Mach 3 . The Mach 3 always seemed to dig into my face and scrape away layers of skin . Not so with the Fusion!Second , it seems to me that the way that the Fusion shaver cartridge is mounted to the handle makes for a better angle of shave . I have n't noticed that Gillette makes any claim that the way the Fusion 's blade is mounted is any different from the Mach 3 , but still , I think it is slightly different . I always felt like the leading edge of the Mach 3 shaver cartridge had too sharp an angle against my skin . It seems like the Fusion avoids this by mounting the `` hinge '' farther back on the shaving cartridge . Thus , the rubber fins in front of the blades makes the cartridge ride more level or flat over the face . Truly an improvement however it was achieved!Also , before I used the Fusion , I thought five blades were a little ridiculous . I figured you could never get close in front of the ears , under the nose , etc. . However , I have found that five blades are n't ridiculous . The special trimmer blade is nice but I find I do n't hardly need it . I can get into close spaces generally without it.In the end , I have used the Fusion and enjoyed a totally comfortable shave ! No folliculitis outbreaks resulted from my use of it ! I really like the razor .
 I have tried all razors and if you have thick growth these are about the only thing you can buy ... pricy but you got ta have it , Come by my profile to visit my blog
 All the blades in this package were super sharp and provided many smooth shaves . I recently bought what I thought were the same blades but was sadly disappointed as they were dull , they pulled the beard and did not trim as advertised . The trimmer was installed incorrectly which leads me to believe they were knock offs .
 convenient packing ... good shaving ... nice product ... good result ... i just love it ... value for money . . and the name stands for it . .
 Love the close shave that I get from these razors . They last longer than the cheep store brands , which cost more and are not as comfortable .
 These are the read deal Gillette Fusion blades and they provide an excellent shave . Some reviewers -LRB- old reviews I think -RRB- have said that these blades were knockoffs but that is not true . Great price on great blades and the eco-box shipping works just fine holding the extra blade cartridges until you need to swap in a fresh blade.TIP
 Good price and arrived as expected . The subscription feature is a good option for this type of item of course .
 I buy these all the time and they last for many shaves . Still more expensive than buying blades for electric shavers .
 Best cartridges for my husbands ' beard . Received the order days faster then stated ; this made him very happy . Would buy again .
 These were much cheaper than buying at my local store . Thankfully my husband only shaves once every few months so these will last us awhile .
 I have used Gillete for over 50 years and these are the best blades yet . Would n't use any others . Outstanding
 I like these cartridges , I got a good deal on them and bulk ordered ~ 80 of them.With the number of blades , they usually give a clean shave in 1 pass , 2 on trouble spots .
 These blades are great . I use these with Nivea Sensitive gel and I do n't get the razor burn and nicks that I got before .
 I enjoy using my fusion razors . They last for months and give a great shave . I plan to use these for a long time .
 Very close and safe shave.I still use an electric occasionally but nothing shaved closer than my 5 blade fusion.Usually after shaving with my Braun I have to do a touch up with the fusion to get that smooth feeling
 It is expensive than I thought , but it is the best Cartridges I have ever used . Anyway , it is worth it .
 This Item has the best price I could find anywhere locally in stores and online . You want to be careful buying cartridges online since sometimes they are not genuine ones . That is why I buy from amazon since I know they will last and work well . The subscribe and save is especially great . These blades last a while , but it is still nice being able to get them every few months and they are also at a 5 % discount which makes the price even lower ! Will continue buy these cartridges from them since great price and great shave ! Highly recommend
 This is my first product review but I was so impressed with the product packaging I thought I would write one . I have had the razor for a while and have been happy . But when I saw the Frustration Free Packaging I thought I would give it a try . One of my biggest complaints is trying to open the traditional packages . You traditionally need a sharp object to open the package and it is just kind of a pain . In this case it was just a small box &#8211; paper that I was able to open using my thumb.Good Stuff !
 a little pricey but have n't found anything better -LRB- for head and face -RRB- . Improvement over the sensor and way better than disposable
 Price is ok . No complaints from the husband or grandson so I assume they are pleased at always having a new blade when needed .
 A guy friend turned me on to this razor but I have to say the razor and blades are better than anything out there -LRB- for women esp . -RRB- . So glad I got such a deal !!!
 I 've been using the Fusion since it came out and it has been my favorite razor since purchasing it -LRB- I had swapped between a variety beforehand a well as some electric ones . -RRB- Best manual ones I 've come across so far .
 Schick and Gillette ... Hydro vs. Fusion . I love them both and alternate between them on a monthly basis for the same `` feel '' is very different between the 2 brands . Prices are comparable . I 'm a big fan of both and the price here on Amazon was by far the best i saw in a long time .
 The Gillette Fusion cartridges give an excellent shave , and you 're getting a pretty good price break by buying the 12 count package . All in all , a good deal on a great razor .
 Just as you 'd expect these work great . Never had any issues with this type of blades and well worth your cost .
 Product was exactly as described and the best price for quality and quantity that I have found anywhere ! I would recommend this product to anyone !
 I really like this razor and blades . The blades stay sharp a LONG time , and they rinse out nicely after use . This packaging option with 8 blades is very convenient - fewer times to run out . My only wish would be that they were less expensive .
 I keep trying other blades and razors because of the price I have to pay for the Gillette Fusion blades , but I keep going back to the Gillette Fusion - they 're just the best blades for me . So , I signed up for Amazon 's monthly shipments to get the price down some and that helps . Now I can use the blade I prefer without feeling so guilty for spending so much on razor blades .
 Yes , they are a little expensive , but after my husband and I tried them for the first time , we decided we could n't use anything else!The pivoting head is great ! I personally have never had a nick or scratch with 'em !
 Once you 're stuck with Gillette , you 're stuck for life !!!! OK so yah this new blade system they got going on is nice . It is a nice shave . And the first use or 2 , it does n't feel like shaving cause it 's that smooth . But really that 's it . You only get maybe 4 shaves out of each blade before you have to switch . Unless you LIKE looking like a bloody mess . Expensive - Gillette has a death grip on all American men . Cause the stuff works that good but they charge you a mint just to get the goods . I like it , I 'm a user , but arg there 's no way these are worth so much money .
 These blades are my husband 's favorite for shaving . He ran out so I priced them and found that Amazon had the best deal pricewise so I bought them and now my husband is set for quite a while . He 's very happy . Highly recommend !
 This is a great rqazor and it givews me the best sshave i 've ever had .
 I love these razors/blades , not quite sure why the women version is n't nearly as good . I buy these for myself and my husband . I hate the price , but I have never had better results except waxing !
 I think that the Gillette Fusion is the best disposable shaver on the market today . All my friends and family have complimented me in how good my face looks . I highly recommend this product .
 I ordered a 12 count of these razors . I 've used Gillette Fusion Razors for years and always bought them at a brick and mortar store . This time , I figured I would save a little money and ordered through Amazon . The ad pictured a sealed pack of 12 razors . Well , I received my package today . Eight razors were in a sealed Gillette box and the other 4 were received unwrapped . I 'm pretty OCD about personal hygiene and to me , this is kind of disgusting . I have no idea where these exposed razors have been.Seller did refund my money , although he only needed to refund me for the 4 razors . Therefore , I changed my original 3-Star Rating to 4 Stars.Thanks .
 I am extremely disappointed . I had ordered a quantity of TWO ! 12-Count packages FOR A TOTAL OF 24 CARTRIDIGES and ONLY recieved one 8-count and one 4-count packages for ONLY a TOTAL of 12 - cartridges . I would like to receive My remaining order as I had paid for . I paid over $ 50 for this order . Be careful when ordering with these guys , cause you may not get what you paid for on time . I am awaiting a response and will file a claim against Jerry TF Liquidators if they do not either return half of my money or send me the other half of my order.EDIT / UPDATE
 The product is just fine , fit my fusion power handle.When I search , this product popped out as Fusion Pro-glide , and in the link for this product , the text also suggested proglide , but the product I received is just normal fusion . On the webpage itself , the description is correct , but if not looked carefully but just believe the search result , you will think you are buying a proglide . It is confusing .
 When I first saw the ads on TV I thought it was a joke . Five blades !! I saw the item locally so I purchased it with the intention of shaving with it first thing in the morning . I am currently a Mach 3 user and I love it so I wondered if this Fusion thing would make a big difference . I honestly feel that the shave with the Fusion is of the same closeness at the Mach 3 . However the Fusion has a HUGE bonus the extra blade -LRB- six -RRB- on the back of the shaving headto hit those stray hairs that remain under the nose that the Mach 3 normally misses . Also it is much easier to trim sideburns with the Fusion because you do not have to worry about hacking off a huge chunk with the mass of 3 blades with the Mach 3 . A bit pricey and if the razor came at the same price as the Mach 3 I would commit to the upgrade , -LRB- Very Hard for guys to change hygeine products , we love the good old reliables -RRB- . If you do not have a Mach 3 then I recommend purchasing the Fusion . Bottom line
 I have been using this from shortly after it initially came out , moving from the Gillette Sensor . The difference between the two is pretty significant . These are more expensive that the Sensors are but they last you forever . I found I got maybe 4 or 5 shaves max out of the old Sensor where I can use these blades for a good month and a half before I feel the need to replace them . The added time of use more the outweighs the increase in cost.The comfort of the blade is by far the best I 've experienced . It stays nice a smooth and cut free for weeks after I start a new blade and with the Sensor I could start feeling the use on that blade after the first or second shave.The blade on the back I have found to be very useful which is something that , if I remember correctly , the Sensor does n't even have .
 Yes , these are the best blades out there . The aloe strip , that some use to gauge when to replace the blade , fades much quicker than the Mach 3 , but as it really is n't too necessary of a feature , I would suggest just using the blade for as many uses as you would with your Mach 3 -LRB- this will vary depending on the user 's beard -RRB- . As far as price goes , the price per blade of this 12 pack is cheaper than the price per blade of Costco 's 16 pack -- especially when you use Amazon 's subscription feature and consider the no tax .
 Incredible close shave everytime . Contrary to these other reviews , I found the blades last a long time even with my thick daily beard . You need to understand , these blades are light and very thin , so no pressure is needed to shave . Just like driving an automatic car for the first time , you ca n't feel everything in the road , but no effort is needed for a smooth gentle ride . Been using this Fusion system for a few months now and my skin is clear from gentle smooth shaves . These replacement blades are a little more costly , shop around you can find deals . The Fusion razor is so worth it . Excellent razor !!!!
 The Gillette Fusion replacement cartridges work extremely well . While on the expensive side -LRB- best price found was on this site -RRB- , they do the job better and longer without changing than any other blade I 've used . They provide a close shave and the extra blade for trimming and sideburns does its job very well . No complaints whatsoever with performance ... only concern is what happens to the plastic shell if the razor is dropped . Would have gotten 5 stars if more reasonably priced .
 This is exactly like the packs I used to buy at Target BUT WITH FOUR MOUR IN THE PACK . SO LONG , TARGET ! YEAH !!!!
 I actually bought these for my husband . These happen to be the only razors out there that do n't cause him any irritation after shaving . Amazon also had the best price online or compared to the stores in my area .
 Smoothest & cleanest shave ever !! Never a nick or cut ! Using it in the shower without gel or shaving cream .
 What can you say about these blades ? They are excellent . I have found that by using this type of blade compared to other cheaper versions , I have had significantly less razor burn and cuts . They are effective at cutting the hair , and they seem to last a good long time . The five blades adds a smoothness that I never really got from other razors . Yes , they are expensive , but they are worth the money .
 I love these razors . Super clean and smooth shaving . It 's pretty hard to cut yourself , unlike with single/double blades ; you do n't feel like you 're cutting your face with broken glass !
 My wife and I both use these razors , and we both love them -LRB- I for my face and she for her legs , in case you were wondering -RRB- . Women 's razor cartridges never seem to be very good , according to my wife , so she tried using mine and much preferrs it . She said it shaves smoother and the blades last longer.don ' t bother with the powered razor , this works just fine
 the product was as described and was received as promised in excellant shape , i would use this supplier again and recomend them
 I love the Fusion blades . I have the kind of facial hair where I have a five o'clock shadow an hour after shaving and these blades help me to get a very close cut . They work better for me than anything else I 've tried . The only downside is that when dealing with four blades , when you cut yourself , you have four cuts . I slipped shaving near my mouth a few weeks back and had a really nasty cut for a week . That however is my only complaint . If you want a close shave with a nice blade , these are great .
 I love these razors . Glad I can have them shipped to me in timed intervals from Amazon ! They work great , no burn , cut great , last a long time , etc , etc , etc. . I have no real complaints other than they are pricey . I can make do , because I shave about 2-3 times a week . I am not super harry but I am not exactly a peach either . At this point I ca n't see any reason to go to another razor . Buy these with Amazon 's ship program -LRB- where they ship them every so often -RRB- and get a discount . Even if you do n't plan on getting them all the time , take the discount and then cancel !
 The fusion 12-pack is just what you 'd get at the store , but somewhat cheaper since it 's a 12-pack . If you like the fusion go for it . Not that this is not the Fusion ProGlide , which are a bit nice , but also a bit more expensive .
 These razors work well which is why I stick with them but they are a bit expensive and I find that they do not stay sharp as long as they used to . Perhaps they are using cheaper metal or something . This is still a good product and I have not yet found a better shaving razors .
 these are the best razors . i 've been shaving my entire head and face for past 5 years and these are clearly the best razors on the market . this is a great price too -LRB- less than $ 3 per cartridge -RRB- . the single trimming blade is worthless i think . but the 4 blades leave me no nicks/cuts . very very close comfortable shave .
 When I first heard Gillette was selling a FIVE BLADE razor I laughed , but after getting a free one in the mail I 'm hooked . It gives the smoothest easiest shave I 've ever had , plus the blades last for weeks , making the high cost actually well worth it.I do n't go for fads or gimmicks , this is a quality product and worth the extra cost .
 The Gillette Fusion razor blades are a good product , resulting in a comfortable shave . The blades work best when used for 10 or less shaves . The Amazon price is comparable to the large big box stores .
 Have n't tried the power version , but the manual blades work well . I just wish the pricing on this product would go down -- waayyy too expensive .
 I compared the other vendors and this was the least expensive per razor cartridge . I calculated ~ $ 1.62 per cartridge . This was up to $ 1 less per cartridge than other offers . It is an awesome deal . Delivery was very quick - 5 days , I think .
 My husband loves the Fusion . Glad I found them here at such a great price and free shipping
 The Fusion has been one of my husband 's favorite razor for some time . These blades are the best price I could find . It 's much more convenient for me to order these online , save some money , and not have to go to the pharmacy area because the blades are locked up in my local drug store.I have continued to purchase the replacement cartridges through Amazon .
 These are the exact same packages you buy in the store and were sold at a much better price even with shipping ! No reason not to buy from this seller and save yourself some money .
 Great product for a great price . 12 count Gillette Fusion Manual Cartridges will keep your face fuzz free for a long time .
 The Gillette fusion has been the best blades ever . Now , I found this 12 blades for less . Great deal at the best price . Thanks AMAZON for these deals .
 This product was no different than what I would purchase in a store . Works well and I will plan to purchase again in the future .
 As a man , and having sensitive skin and a tough beard also , I suffer from the worst of both worlds !!! . Thanks to these razors , I get a close shave and my skin goes unaffected and is left smooth for the wife to touch . I only see that you can only get a few good shaves from each razor and then it is basically showing wear and not shaving close enough . While everything else in the world has cheapened up , so has the metal we use in the US . But , for the money , it is the best manual razor I feel out there . I subscribe to auto delivery and save additional money right through Amazon . These razors in a 4 pack at Walmart are $ 15.97 and I pay $ 10.38 from Amazon with auto delivery , so why not ! . With these tough economical times , why not save a dollar and I wrote this to let other people know about this deal that is available . Thank You .
 My son shaves his face and head and likes these as they do n't nick , leave bumps and last thru numerous shavings !!
 It 's not always easy to get a smooth shave , but these blades work well . They provide the cleanest smoothest shave I have ever had . Better than the single blade and even 3 blade razors I have tried . You can get a smooth shave from fewer blades , but they tend to cut the skin more - at least in my case . I recommend these blades .
 These blades keep their edge quite well . I do n't have to change out the cartridge near as much as I had expected . Other than the price , these ca n't be beat .
 I am quite picky about my razor blades , since my neck can be cut by a razor pretty easily . The Fusion has completely eliminated the problem of my razor nicking my neck . Though there are five blades , the way they are spaced creates dramatically less pressure on your skin . This results in a nick-free , incredibly close shave.In addition to the five-bladed front , a single blade is on the back to allow for fine trimming , like the edges of beards and sideburns.The one downside of this blade is that it tends to do less well if you let a few days ' worth of whiskers accumulate ; they tend to get caught up in the blades . You can avoid this by shaving every or every other day , or using another razor or trimmer to cut the whiskers short and then use the Fusion to finish them off.For those of use who will be shaving every day though , the Fusion is our blade .
 I have used the Gillette Mach3 Shaving System , 1 system for several years and found the closeness to be excellent with one blade lasting three weeks . It costs about $ 9 . The Gillette Mach3 Cartridges , 8 cartridges cost about $ 10 . Now I 've tried this Gillette Fusion Power razor at a cost of about $ 12 with Gillette Fusion Power Replacement Cartridges , 8-Count Package costing about $ 20 . For the extra $ 3 for the razor , it can not be beat . Gillette has raised its own bar for excellent shaving . This razor has five blades instead of three , guaranteeing the closest possible shave with several cool features . The blue lubricating strip turns white when the blade reaches the end of its use . It comes with a AAA battery that fits in the ergonomically slip-free grip handle -LRB- with a low battery light indicator -RRB- . This vibrates the five blades at a high rate to ensure a very close shave . The microchip in the handle turns the razor off after eight minutes . Plus , on the back side there is a ` precision trimmer ' blade that cuts those sideburns exact and is gentle enough to trim around your moustache , goatee and nose . Gillette claims each disposable blade will last up to a month , but I have found Gillette blades -LRB- the three blade version -RRB- to last three weeks . So I expect this five blade version to last well past a month . That 's amazing.The Gillette Fusion handle costs $ 3 more and the refills -LRB- 8 -RRB- cost $ 10 more , but they last longer and the shave is so much closer . Spend the few extra dollars and get a razor with blades that last longer than any other on the market . I suggest buying in bulk to save money . You do get what you pay for .
 Gillette Fusion blades are insanely expensive and a lot of the cheaper fusion blades on Amazon are either fake or seconds that failed QC . This supplier has the real thing and its the best price you 'll find .
 I have tried them all and the winner is Gillette Fusion . You get a close shave all the time with no nicks and no cuts . The price from Amazon.com ca n't be beat either . Do n't waste your money on the power version , the shave is the same ! Gillette Products rule !!!
 I 've been using this for over a year now . It 's a great product and Amazon sells it cheaper than the local stores and free shipping : -RRB-
 If you -LRB- like me -RRB- suffer from that terrible combination of a tough beard and sensitive skin then you 'll find the Gillette Fusion shaving system a real godsend . Yes , the replacement cartridges are very high-priced BUT you 'll get an ultra-smooth and very clean shave every time -- and your skin will thank you . The idea of a 5-blade razor may seem extreme to some but it really does work well and -LRB- with proper preparation -RRB- will give you the smoothest shave possible . For me , the best thing about the Gillette Fusion system is I can shave -LRB- both my head and face -RRB- with virtually NO irritation , redness or razor bumps AND get it done very quickly -LRB- at least in comparison to single or twin-blade razors -RRB- . Case in point
 Not as sharp as I expect a new one would be , it does the same job like my old Gillette cartridge which has been using for 8 months . Is it good or bad ??
 I have been using Gillette razor blabes for over 50 years and what amazes me is that every new razor surpasses the previous great razor . This new Fusion razor is by far the the best to date . Shaving is so much faster , easier and smooth . Personally , if this was the last version of Gillette , I would use the Fusion until my last shave .
 Being a standard product , the quality is not in question . It was a good price shipped in a reasonable amount of time -LRB- less than 2 weeks -RRB-
 I think just about anyone that gets around to trying the Gillette fusion finds it the best they have ever used . I got mine as a Christmas Present 2 years ago . It took me just over 4 months to use the three cartridges that came with it . There is no downside . It was both the best shave , as well as the most economical one I had ever experienced . I admit that I was a little taken back by the cost when I finally ventured out in the spring to buy some replacements . Around here they either lock them away in some little Fort Knox in the store , or even enclose them in security boxes that sound an alarm if you try to open it or run out the door . I can only imagine that too many men , -LRB- and some women too -RRB- have considered larceny over cheaper blades if they ca n't afford the fusions . The fusion cartridges may be a little steep , but the truth is 8 of them in a pack can easily get your average Joe through an entire year of shaving . Here on Amazon , I got 8 refills for $ 20 and free shipping ! That 's not only a good $ 5.00 cheaper than the best place here , but that 's not including the savings on the sales tax . Believe me when I tell you that I spent over an hour one night searching for replacement blades online and finally settled on Amazon as unbeatable . Nobody even came close with the free shipping . If you 're not already a Gillette fusion shaver , become one . If you are , buy the cartridges here . Amazon not only has the best price for them but it is actually easier and more convenient to buy here . You will never be tempted to resort to larceny ...
 Use subscribe and save and get these razors even cheaper . Cost about half of what it does at walmart and you can set dates for new ones to arrive . Amazon comes through yet again ...
 my husband prefers these blades but at over $ 2 per blade , they 're not cheap ! perhaps each blade will last a little longer than the standard blades .
 I have yet to find a better razor . This is so good that i ca n't even bother with electric razors and any of the cheap knockoffs
 My order was delivered timely and in perfect condition . As an Amazon shopper , you ca n't ask for more than that . I definitely recommend the product and provider .
 I priced this item all over and I MEAN ALL OVER.I only remembered amazon because i had purchased christmas itemsthere and was very pleased . this is the closet shave item on the market today and amazon definitely by far -LRB- even wal-mart -RRB- has the best price.Barry 'n philly
 Every year , blades get better , and more expensive too . I have a tough beard , and of all the blades over the years , probably over 40 types , these work the best . Expensive , but I have n't found anything well that cuts my tough beard as well .
 Like all other Italian boys I started shaving at a young age so I could look like my mother.Now I 've been shaving over 50 years and I have to say , this is by far the best shave I 've ever had . Amazon offers a pretty good deal on the twin pack . They can be as much as double that amount retail.All in all it 's a great shave and even a better deal when purchased on Amazon
 I have been using the fusion razor for some time now , so I have to buy these catridges , I found the best price on amazon so I bought it here .
 the product is what is said about it , ALL new , NIB , , and a VERY good price.will buy again , ,
 These are some of the best blades on the market for shaving ! They last a long time , give the closet shave possible , and at Amazon ... you get the lowest possible price .
 I was a shick man but these blade cut close and do n't nick as much as the quatro .
 Hooked on them . Too fat for under nose . Need a cheapo blade to get under the nose .
 So I as a young women I have both the gilette fusion and the Mach 3 turbo ... both work good but the blades do n't last long at all !! The aloe strip is gone in 3 uses or a little more . . these 2 are definetly the best razors that I have ever triedas of yet ...
 They got me . I got a sample Fusion razor and wow what a shave!I was hooked , and now I spend my time looking for refill blades on line . They are simply too expensive in a retail store - thus the 4 star rating . Online you may find them still somewhat expensive but you can buy them without selling off your portfolio.The shave is smooth as silk and franky it 's worth the extra cost . It 's a better shave in half the time .
 Somehow I ended up with one of those `` free '' razors as a pull to get you to buy the product . I 've seen all the humor on multi blade razors that do seem over the top . Well , surprise ! This sucker really works . I mean , it really works . Cleanest shave I ever got . No pull , no nicks , no need to take a second stroke . Expensive , yes , but worth it for me .
 Typically I 'm skeptical of `` premium '' brand names , but I 've used mach 3 , a few generic razors , and earlier Gillette models , and I have to admit the Gillette Fusion cartridges are the best . Using these blades while sharp I almost never nick myself . My facial hair is a little tough so I used to have trouble getting a clean shave on the first try . With these razors that 's never been an issue for me.Granted , these are the most expensive razors you 'll typically see in stores . However , the amazon price is great -LRB- especially with subscribe & save -RRB- . Moreover , using tips I saw on another razor review , I can get an individual Gillette razor to last about a month . By rinsing the gunk off with hot water after shaving , spraying the razor with shower cleaner , then propping it against the wall the durability improves dramatically.Honestly , if I had n't discovered I could make a single razor last a month I would n't bother buying these . I think they 're the best , but they 're not THAT much better than other razors . A dull razor is a dull razor regardless of brand . Yet , if you can make a razor 12 pack last a year , and they 're so cheap on Amazon , why not buy the best ?
 This has been my default razor for a few years now , but it does tend to leave a little bit of stubble behind . It 's not as close as they may advertise and takes a few strokes to get things right . It does n't irritate my skin and each razor lasts for a fair amount of time , so it 's bad , it 's just not great .
 they keep coming out with newer blades that are just more and more expensive . but these are good blades -LRB- per my husband -RRB- and a better price than the store .
 I have been using these blades for years and by far one of the best shaves ever . The only major problem is that they are a bit pricey . While I do use the extra single blade , if that knocked the price down considerably I could do with the 5 on the other side . The single side is great for edging your side burns and those tricky hairs in-between you eye brows -LRB- not a full on unibrow -RRB- . The shave is close , comfortable and smooth . I also wished they held up a little better for a little longer . The shaves after the first few are great , but nothing like the first one with the clean fresh blades.If you have the money and are looking for a better shave , get this product .
 I paid about $ 26 dollars for the 12 count package , the local CVS had a 4 pack on sale for $ 14 . Enough said about the price , awesome deal ! Received the package in good order and they were Gillette Fusion blades , no bait and switch . Ended up going with the subscribe and save option as well .
 So you already love the brand and the great shave that these blades give you
 The only razor I use . Wish they were cheaper but what can you say . That seems to be the trend . These things should cost pennies when really they cost several dollars a piece . These do stay sharp for a long time and that is part of the reason I still use them . I see no reason to switch at this point . Hoping the price comes down a bit .
 Great price for a good product . Even better if you do subscribe and save . I 'll never buy them from the grocery store or Costco ever again .
 If you use the Fusion razorblades this is a great price for 8 blades . The packaging is a little more generic then what the grocery or drug store carries . They still come in the cartridge so you can load them into your shaver holder -LRB- they click into the back -RRB- . Unlike another review stated these are NOT imitation blades , these are the real thing . Exactly the same as what you get at a brick and mortar store , just less packaging at a much better price .
 My husband loves these . However they tend to be pricey so when we found this on Amazon with the best price , we had to get it !
 I bought these for my husband because they are so much cheaper online , and they were exactly what he wanted and in amazon 's frustration free packaging . It really is frustration free and if you make sure to order directly from amazon you do n't have to worry about imitations !
 My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside , I will make one confession about Gillette 's Fusion blades
 Bought on June 4 , 2010 for $ 23.89 with free shipping using Prime . Local supermarkets charge $ 30 + , love Amazon !
 like many customers I hate how expensive these razors have become . So I have bought some off of ebay but have since read that I may not be buying the real Fusion blades which may explain why they do n't last two weeks for me . I decided to give Amazon a try because this looks like the real deal , and not a knockoff .
 Good way to buy the blades cheaper than what they sell for in the store . I just add them to my smaller orders from time to time to qualify for free shipping .
 The Gillette Fusion Manual Replacement Cartridges we 're much better of a deal here at amazon.com . Of course I received sooner than expected . These will last me another 8 months .
 I 've tried many other razors before but nothing compares to these guys . They 're good , but expensive . Buy them online and you 'll cut your costs in half !
 The Gillette Fusion razor provides a clean comfortable shave , and at these prices is a luxury everyone can afford .
 I have to shave often and have used just about every razor on the market . I really like the Gillette Fusion . It costs more than most of the other products , but I find the I can use the blades much longer . I definitely gives a much closer shave and it takes less time to shave .
 Before I tried this razor , I did n't know what to expect . After all , how many blades does a razor need ? A world of `` hype '' had made me cynical . Well , the Gillette Fusion blade is worthy of the hype . It does what it is supposed to do , give you a great shave , and does it better than any other blade I have ever used . That 's it . Give it a try . You wo n't be disappointed . No hype !
 This was not only a great price , but the razors came in the mail relatively quick too . I was quite impressed .
 I started shaving using the Gillette Fusion Proglide manual razor for a long time , but wanted to see what the cheaper version would be like . To my amazement , it was better for a few reasons . The first is that the blades seem to be thicker than the proglide razor and make it easier to cut through thicker hair without much pulling . I tend to shave every other day so the regular fusion blades seem to cut through a light beard easier . I also seemed to get less irritation using the regular fusion blades due to the increased surface area below the blades . On the proglide , this `` squeegee '' is reduced a lot and every otherday or two I would get some irritation . So if your looking for a cheaper alternative to the proglide , I would say stick to the regular fusion blades and save a couple bucks .
 I have to write some stuff in here , because this thing would n't submit unless I write some text in here .
 I went back to my old Mach III for a while to save some money and things I have noticed -- shave is much better and closer , blades last longer , skin looks great after shaving . I also purchased directly from Amazon and did n't have any problems of having any knock offs . Also , the easy packaging is helpful as well . I hate getting the big boxes and have to cut them open with concern of cutting myself .
 I 've used Fusion razors for a number of years , and continue to be amazed by the virtually total lack of nicks , even with shavers that have been used for months . There was controversy awhile back , with some Amazon customers questioning the authenticity of the Fusion packages . I find these units deliver the same repeated close shaves as those I 've bought in the past , online , and elsewhere.Some reviewers have stated that three blade shavers offer the same advantages for a lower price , and while I can not comment on that assertion , I can say with assurance that Fusion razors are incomparably better than any one or two blade model I 've tried .
 These are the same razors you purchase at the store - but for a third less . Even beats costco 's pricing . Great deal
 I figured I would try these razors because Amazon.com has a great return policy if it turned out that these were fake , but I see no indication at all that these are not the real thing . I 've been using the same style razor for a few years , and its quality and longevity are superb . Some people are so convinced that something `` will be '' fake , that even when the real thing is in front of them , they wo n't see it . I am happy I took a chance to try these out , I will buy them again .
 At the time I began to shave -LRB- which I consider the bane of being a guy but look forward to getting done for the sake of looking professional , pleasing the lady , and not having a scraggly beard or whiskers -RRB- , I 've always wanted to shave as close as possible and not cut myself while shaving . -LRB- I 've always looked lousy with a mustache and/or beard . -RRB- No razor blade is perfect but the Gillette Fusion is good enough . I refuse to pay prices at the supermarket and drug stores or go through all the madness of getting it cheap at Costco . The best bang for the buck and to save time is to get them via Amazon .
 Gillette Fusion Manual Cartridges , 12-CountThe blades are new and the price is excellent . I am happy to be able to purchase these blades as they are really good on my face and beard .
 I got these today and hey appear to be the real thing . I priced them at the local drug store for $ 41 dollars so I save a few bucks . Definitely the best brand razor blades on the market .
 This was good for the money because since they are disposable cartridges they do n't last as long as I would like them to . I use hot tap water and that destroys the metal and wears away the protector strip by the second use . But if you use cold water it will work a good four , maybe five times
 This is the best razor on the market!This is a great price for 8 blades as well . Definitely ca n't beat it.In addition it comes in an easy to open package . Not the same package that you have to hack open that you get from your normal store .
 Great product . I use it to shave my head . The long razers take less times to cover my head . I love it .
 After reading some other reviews , I was worried that these would be lower-quality knockoffs . When they arrived , they were not in retail packaging . However , the quality is very good , and they seem to be authentic . I would buy them again .
 This is the best price I 've found for these . I really like this razor , but really wish it was cheaper . I honestly think it 's worth the money though .
 These guys are expensive , but do a great job . My face is prone to irritation w / shaving , using these helps cut down on irritation and give me a smooth shave . Like the extra blade for trimming sideburns .
 So much more convenient than having to shop when I run out . Product is no different than what I buy in stores .
 I have been doing the subscribe and save on this item for a year . It 's o good deal , and it saves me A trip to Costco or Walmart , to buy it .
 Left to their own devices , the Gillette Fusion could end global hunger and bring world peace . Had they been around there would have been no WWI or II .
 These razors are excellent and are the cheapest I could find . Make sure you take care of the blades so they will last longer .
 I 've been using Gillette Fusion razor blades since just after they were released . They are miles better than the old Mach3 blades.With my beard , I can get about 3 weeks out of a blade before I need to replace it . I 've also tried the Fusion Power blades . They lasted a little longer ... but I did n't feel the performance was enough to justify their additional cost.Speaking of cost ... man are these blades expensive ! My advice - use Amazon 's Subscribe and Save program and buy the best per blade deal . It 's not like they 're going to go bad before you use them !
 Different color than what I expected , but who cares ? They 're razor blades , not a shirt ! Smooth shave , and I like the single blade for trimming nice lines -LRB- ie sideburns -RRB- .
 This is a really good price on these razor cartridges . Getting the 12-pack is certainly the most economical , but the 8-pack is probably an easier price to swallow . You get two 4-packs , basically.As for the razor itself , it 's good . I shave in the shower with no shaving cream or gel , just hot water , and it leaves no rash or burn . I can usually get about 7-8 shaves out of one razor cartridge , which is n't a ton , but I guess is par for the course . I 'm not actually super crazy about the `` lubrastrip '' as it leaves a slimy film on the first couple shaves . But I get that that is meant to help have a smooth shave . Overall , this is one of the better blades on the market .
 Love these razors , they do a great job , leaving my face smooth without irritation . They also last longer than most other cartridges , giving me more shaves for my dollar over all .
 Allthat Wal-Mart used to sell was the 6 pack . I now have to buy as often with buying more . I think they work well and they did n't take long to arrive .
 When it came to shaving I always used to avoid products that came with bells and whistles ; thinking that these are just another marketing/sales gimmick ... You think for shaving `` all you need is a blade and a shaving cream '' , Right ? ... Wrong ! ... I 'm glad my wife convinced me to use these Gillette Fusion blades . They are just amazing ! No cuts , smooth shaving and they actually last longer than the normal 2 blade cartridges . I have been using them now for almost a year and I 'm really happy with the product .
 This shipped in a 100 % frustration free package in a little paper box , unlike the burglary proof plastic-sealed retail cases you find locked up behind glass in your local store that treats you like a would-be shop-lifter . For as long as I live in the US , I do n't think I 'll buy razor blades any other way again ; this is perfect .
 Gillette has created another `` cutting edge '' product with these cartridges . Talk about a `` close shave ! '' They do n't get much closer than this !
 I use the Mach III Turbo and am very happy with the three blade system for my face . I tried this one ONCE on my face and cut myself in two places . It is just too big . HOWEVER , I am an avid cyclist and body builder and shave my legs and chest . THESE WORK GREAT for large areas like legs or chest if you are `` into '' that aspect of the sports . I have to shave at least once every two days or I get complaints from my wife when I cuddle up to her at night . I like the definition of my legs much better shaved as well as my abs and chest . Fortunately I do n't have to shave my back as I have next to no hair on it .
 These razor blades are the exact same -LRB- packaging and all -RRB- as in store -- but at a substantial savings via this web site . Note - they are not the `` power '' version , but the `` regular '' version . No complaints at all .
 My husband has a thick beard and sensitive skin . He says of all the razors he 's tried , these give him the best shave . However , for a military family on a tight budget , the blades are too expensive to replace as often as necessary . He 's lucky to get two uses out of each blade . So ... . great razor , but not quite good enough to justify the cost .
 Gillette Fusion - Replacement Cartridges , 8 Cartridges - Remarkable product at an even more unbelievable price !
 These blades shave closer and smother than any blade I have ever used.The blades are a bit expensive , but we are talking about running blades across the face . They are worth the extra $ .
 The 5 blades are better than the Sensor 3 - but I do go back to the Sensor 3 blades when I run out of the Fusion 5 blades . It is worth it if you can get a good deal on the blades .
 I 've been very happy with the Fusion razor . Get a close shave , with miinimal facial irritation . Only complaint is that the replacement blades are overpriced . But then again all brands are overpriced . At least these last longer than most other brands .
 Gillette Fusion Manual Replacement Cartridges -LRB- 8 Cartridges -RRB- I get the best shave from this razor and the blades last me about a month before I have to replace it .
 I 'm sitting here chuckling as I write this . When they came out with the Mach 3 , I thought to myself `` How ridiculous ! Who needs three blades ? '' . When the Fusion came out , I was openly hostile - `` How many ***** blades do we need ? Stop the madness !! '' . Well , I recently bought some Gillette body wash and in the package was a free Fusion . I resisted for about a week and then finally used it . Needless to say , I 'm here on Amazon ordering some Fusion blades . I guess that 's why the New England Patriots play in Gillette Stadium ...
 yes , there has been deafening hype and marketing surrounding the fusion , but guess what ? the damn thing is pretty amazing . it really does provide a crazy close shave with little to no irritation . yes , the blades are pricey , but hey , it 's your face ! you could keep hacking away with cheap Bic razors , but do you really hate your face that much?P.S . I am also a head shaver , and this thing is very well adapted to the scalp .
 and it last , is very comfortable and ultimate , economic , my son and my husband have been using this product , and loving it
 Do n't get me wrong , it 's a lot of money to spend on razors but the Fusion is the best I 've ever used . The best price I found and typical Amazon speed and ease .
 I purchased the 8 Pack of Gillette Fusion Razor Blades and they are great . This razor is the best one I ever used . You do n't have to go over the same spot twice , like you do with other brands.I could n't believe how quick my shipment arrived . . great job Amazon.Com .
 I have been using the fusion razor for some time now , so I have to buy these catridges , I found the best price on amazon so I bought it here .
 While the number of blades increases , I am unsure if the shave is any better since the dual blade design ... . I still get a shadow by midday -LRB- my stubble is very light compared to some ! -RRB- . The best is still the man with the cut-throat ... but who can trust a man wielding a cut-throat ?? I will say that with the extra blades I s1eem to have lower frequency of shaving cuts and the process is less arduous - effectivity of the shave process is slightly increased ... What does surprise me is that the cost of the blades is not reducing , are we paying for technology with no return Mr Gillette ??????????
 simple as that . with 2 or three blades i get some irritation when i shave . with the fusion razors there is no irritation .
 Could not find this size in stores so this solved my difficulty . Nice size for workout bags . Little too much tape on product for packaging
 I 've used brushes before where the whole head vibrates - I get toothpaste all over the bathroom , not to mention my face . This one has a standard brush at the bottom , the spinning head at the top , so you actively brush your teeth AND have the spin head action . My teeth are very crooked , and this gets in between in all the awkward spaces and leaves my teeth feeling like I 've been to the hygienist . I also like having regular batteries rather than a rechargable base - I can take it in my suitcase or camping , and it does n't weigh a ton . Quieter , too . Still is messier than a regular toothbrush , though .
 I Received one of these razors from my Fiancee for Christmas been using since and works great.I have been using the same cartridge all week and received a very close and comfortable shave each morning.I really like it the trimmer works well for trimming side burns not sue what else.Really helped clear up my razor burn and prevent future bumps .
 I recently started back shaving . I do have senstive skin , and years back when I shaved , I basically did it incorrectly and from there I got the unpleasant razor bumps . Simply because I wanted to save money by decreasing my trips to the barber shop and I wanted to shave my head -LRB- bald -RRB- and face , I purchased this Gillette Fusion Manual Razor , as well as other products like Bump Patrol and some traditional Gillette shaving cream . To make a long explanation short , this razor is tremendous , and it gets the job done in every way . When it comes to shaving my head completely bald and shaving my face -LRB- and under my chin -RRB- , it delivers a very close shave and the results speak for themselves . Shaving every night has become a routine procedure now -LRB- thanks to advice from a close friend and Bump Patrol -RRB- and I 'm fully satisfied with this Gillette Fusion Razor . Highly recommended !!!!!
 This razor is amazing . Super close shave in just one pass . Two minor flaws though . First with 5 blades the head on this thing is large making working it into tight places a bit more of a trick -LRB- especially if you are gon na use it downstairs -RRB- . And the second problem does n't help the first . The other problem is the single blade trimmer on the back . I 've never used it but come close to cutting myself with it a few times forgetting it was there . Overall though it is still a great product and I 've already ordered replacement blades so I wo n't be without it .
 These razors are expensive , but they last a long time . The 5 blades make the shave very close . There is a strip at the top that changes from blue to white when the razor is ready to be replaced .
 I was pleasantly surprised . This is really the best razor I have ever used . I just assumed that having 4 blades was just another gimmick , but it really provides an amazingly smooth and clean shave and minimizes nicks and cuts .
 This is the first time I bought this product . Actually I bought it for my father who is very naive in using advanced technologies . The manual version of this razor was perfect for him . He likes it so far . The precision of shaving is great . It is little expensive as compared to other available razors . But it is a great product for the amount you pay . I would recommend this one to others . I hope the blades will last long enough which I am yet to find out .
 My aunt is a notorious coupon clipper and she got one of these for free which she gave to me -LRB- bless her heart -RRB- . At first i was thinking who really needs 5 blades ? I thought that was overkill but i gave it a try when i ran out of blades for my mach 3 . The shave was very close with much less irritation and i was n't even using my favorite shaving cream -LRB- Kiss my Face -RRB- , i was VERY impressed to say the least . I hate to shave at the best of times but the Fusion makes it very easy to get a close shave and i no longer have to go against the grain to get down to bare skin which is a necessity for those `` intimate '' moments .
 You 've come a long way , Baby !! Who would 've thunk 55 years ago that razor blades would become this efficient and durable !!
 I do n't have Gillette stock or work for the company . I hate shaving . I have a tough beard and sensitive skin . A bad combination . I bought the Fusion on a whim . I did n't expect it to be signficantly better than the previous generation Mach 3 but hope springs eternal . After two weeks and 7-8 shaves with the same cartridge -LRB- ! -RRB- , I can wholeheartedly say that this is a very noticeable improvement over the Mach 3 . The cartridges have an astounding life . The Mach 3 would give me about 3-4 shaves before the blades dulled enough to result in razor rash . The Fusion has at least doubled that and is still going strong . Amazing . The conspiracy theorist in me wonders if Gillette is using a higher quality steel in the blades for the product launch . Time will tell . Secondly , I get far less razor burn from the Fusion . Almost none actually . Lastly , it 's more difficult to cut myself in the nose/lip area which was something I had to watch carefully with the Mach 3 . I 'd guess this has to do with a larger blade surface area . In short , the Fusion really is an improvement over the Mach 3 . As long as the cartridges continue to last for 8-10 shaves each , I will be a loyal customer .
 I bought the Gillette Fusion Manual Razor and shaved with the blades it came with and the shave was okay , no better then an Mach3 . Then I tried the other Fusion blades , what a revelation.The best shave comes from using the Gillette Power Fusion blades -LRB- orange color -RRB- with the Manual Razor . When I did this the shave was phenomenal , baby butt smooth . There was no irritation , no razor burn , simply a great shave.Try this combination , you wo n't be disappointed .
 Let 's face it . Guys usually do n't get excited about new shaving products . Shaving 's about as pleasurable as a molten lava enema . Fortunately , the right products can make it a little more bearable . I 've never anticipated the release of a shaving product of any kind before , but this razor got me really intrigued . Could this be the razor that conquers my impossible face -LRB- and wallet -RRB- once and for all?Gillette have been the masters of shaving comfort for several years now . Their introduction of the Mach 3 razor was a breakthrough , just like they said . A lot of you likely still use the Mach 3 , but it 's a good bet the Fusion will make you want to upgrade.I 'll admit , I was a little wary about using a five-bladed razor . I felt the same way about the Mach 3 ; I envisioned pressing too hard and slicing into my jugular , or worse , going to work with an entire roll of toilet paper on my face . Thankfully , the opposite happened , and I used the Mach 3 and M3 Turbo for years . I even bought into the M3 Power when it came out , but found there was n't much difference in closeness or comfort -LRB- which is why I chose the manual Fusion over the Fusion Power -RRB- . Still a really good shave , though.Anyway , about the Fusion . First off , do n't be intimidated by the five blades . They 're close enough together that you really have to try to cut yourself . In fact , that 's one of the beauties of this razor . Even a face like mine , which is very susceptible to cuts , accepted the Fusion 's blades with very little irritation . The first couple of times I used it , I had to watch out for pressing too hard and suffered a couple minor nicks , but I quickly got the hang of it . The blades really do all the work . The head of the razor is bigger than the M3 as well , which actually does cut down on shaving time.I 've always liked the `` indicator '' strip on the top of the M3 blade that lets me know when it 's time to change the blade , and it 's here on the Fusion as well . It 's made with aloe , if you 're interested in that sort of thing , which supposedly aids in shaving comfort . You 'll get about a week 's worth of good shaves before the blade wears out , which works out to a pack of cartridges a month -LRB- about the same as the M3 -RRB- . It 's best to pick these up in bulk -LRB- packs of 8 -RRB- ; if and when you switch to this razor , you 'll need them anyway , and you 'll save a little dough in the process.The extra blade on the back of the razor is rather neat indeed . It does help even out your sideburns and touches up those tricky spots right under your nose and above your chin . I would n't use it for beard sculpting or anything , but for tough areas it does a good job . Just be mindful of that blade when you 're shaving near your ears . I accidentally nicked my earlobe shaving my jawline the first time I used it . Yeowch!Changing the blade out is just as easy as the M3 also . Just pop , slide , and click a new blade in.The `` comfort guard '' under the main blades is a slight improvement from the M3 , but it 's not really a `` wow '' factor . The `` ergonomic '' handle is pure gimmick ; it does little more than make the Fusion look like a phaser from Star Trek . I would rather just buy the blades and have them fit on my Mach 3 , but what kind of marketing savvy would that be ? Oh well ; the razor itself is n't exactly a bank-breaker , and you only have to buy it once.All told , this is the Porsche 911 of razors . It 's a smooth ride , it 's comfortable , it 's fast , and yes , even though the blades are pricey , it 's worth it to me . If I had my druthers , of course , I 'd use an electric -LRB- they 're much less expensive in the long run -RRB- , but they 're just not compatible with my face and Rocky Mountain-ish peaks and valleys of my neck . -LRB- Believe me ; I 've tried five different kinds . -RRB- The Fusion 's the closest shave I 've gotten with a blade yet . If you really saw the difference between the M3 and M3 Power on your face , you 'll probably notice it with the Fusion Power as well , but I figure I 'm paying enough for the one without the motor.I 'm glad I made the switch , and after comparing with the Mach 3 , I wo n't go back . Try it and see for yourself .
 I have been using Gillette 's Fusion Razor for a few weeks now and it 's a nice razor with some pros and cons compared to Gillette 's other blades . Gillette has some of the nicest products on the market , and I expected the Fusion to blow me away , but unlike the jump that was made when the Mach3 came out , I was not as excited after my shave as I was for the hype beforehand.The Good - The 5 blades are very smooth and glides across the face easily . - Shaving time IS reduced with this new razor.The Bad - With so many blades , I felt like I was shaving off layers of skin . I feel there is a limit to how many blades are realistic , and this felt like it was too big for my face and I could seriously cut myself if I was n't careful . - Shave is n't much better than the Mach3 Turbo . While shaving my skin felt really smooth , but my hairs grew back just as quickly as they did with the Mach3 Turbo -LRB- no noticeable improvement -RRB- . - This razor is SO big I found it hard to get around facial areas like I could with the Mach3 . - The lotion strips on the M3 Power feel better and seem to last longer than on the Fusion razor . - Design and look of the Fusion is n't as slick or nice as the M3 Power . - Blades are no longer interchangeable . They went with a new interface for putting blades in that seems to take a step back , and having to buy the new razor to work with the new blades was a sneaky move in my opinion . - The single blade on the back is useless . It 's very hard to get the angle correct , and it barely gets anything off . The M3 Power got in tight spots just fine.In conclusion , I plan to stick with my M3 Power . 3 blades seems to be just the right amount for getting in all areas on the face . While it might take a shave or 2 more to get all the hairs off then it does with the Fusion -LRB- on the large surface area portions of my face mind you -RRB- , the M3 Power just seems safer in general.This is more like 3 1/2 stars . Yes it 's a nice shave , but it 's not worth all the hype or additional financial burden this new blade will put you back . **** RECOMMENDED
 I went from disposables to the Mach 3 Turbo when they sent me one in the mail , and i loved it , got so much closer . Now i use the Fusion exclusively . Some say the 5 blades is a gimmic , but i can feel a difference in that i dont cut myself at all , and the surface is wide enough to cut more at a time .
 When I first heard that somebody was actually selling a 5-blade VIBRATING razor , I thought I 'd never EVER try it . It sounded like a perfectly good way to turn my face into a pepperoni pizza with extra EVERYTHING on it . The truth , however , is that this is a FANTASTIC product , and I now wish that I 'd bought one MUCH sooner.Random thoughts -LRB- since so much has already been said in the Amazon reviews here -RRB- :1 . I HATE shaving . I just frigging HATE it . I can never quite seem to get it just right , and I generally do end-up looking like something straight out of a Stephen King novel when I 'm done . THIS razor has actually changed that for me ; I have yet to cut myself with this thing -- believe me when I tell you that -LRB- for me -RRB- that is really saying something -- and I honestly think that you 'd have to TRY to draw blood with this thing in order to do so .2 . Thirty -LRB- plus -RRB- Dollars for a dozen replacement blades is absurd . -LRB- I do pay it , though . Because the shave IS that good . -RRB- 3 . The originally installed blade -LRB- usually -RRB- in products like these is a high-quality -LRB- pharmaceutical grade -RRB- titanium -LRB- this is true for almost everything sold in this retail space , by the way -RRB- , and is designed to give you a fantastic first impression -- which it does . The originally installed -LRB- set of -RRB- blade -LRB- s -RRB- is an incredibly sharp , long-lasting set -- a finely-tuned , well-engineered piece of highly-toleranced machining that is designed to keep you coming back for more -- which means
 I am a huge skeptic when it comes to products and gimmicks to sell them . Which is why I was skeptical when I heard there was a 5 blade razor on the market . In short , I was ` blown away ' by this razor 's performance and longevity of the blades ! I have a very tough and thick , fast growing beard , and this 5 blade easily beats the performance of a 2 or 3 blade razor . My shaves are faster and closer , and the trimmer blade really comes in handy when trimming the hair by my nostrils , and ` fine trimming ' my sideburns . In addition , i 've had a single cartridge last me 4 months , as long as I rinse it clean after each use ! Talk about ` cost effectiveness ' ! As skeptical as I was initially , after using this great razor for over a year now -LRB- and comparing to others -RRB- , it is easily the BEST razor out there in form and function . WTG Gillette !!!
 I 'm a comparison nut on shaving ... I had been using the Sensor Excel since it came out - I tried the Mach3 when it came out and was disappointed , so I stuck with the Excel . I tried both the Fusion Power and the manual Fusion . I liked the manual Fusion better than the power version . I did the half-face comparison on the Excel and the Fusion for a week . It was close with occasional nicks from the Excel , never from the Fusion . The Fusion WINS ! I now use only the Fusion with Aveeno Positively Smooth shave gel and a shower mirror in the shower - The best combination for a shave at any price . The downside is that the Fusion blades are inexcusably pricey , but they last seven shaves or more .
 If I was very disappointed with the powered Fusion razor -LRB- which I reviewed much earlier -RRB- then I must say that I 'm extremely well-pleased with the manual version . Unlike the powered Fusion the manual one allows for incredible flexibility and a truly close but comfortable shave . In retrospect , my problem with the powered version is that the `` micropulses '' take away your control and the vibrations will cause you to press harder on your skin -LRB- leading to nicks , cuts and razor burn -RRB- . I 've been using the manual Fusion razor for almost two weeks now and am so impressed that I 've stopped using the Schick Quattro Midnight altogether . All in all I give the manual Gillette Fusion razor my highest recommendation .
 Pros : Handle is weighted well.Very close shave.Less irritation than previous generations , even against grain.Extra blade on back = worth it.Cons :5 blades get gunked up quickly , requiring more passes.Long surface area -LRB- of blade -RRB- takes some getting used to.Expensive ; not compatible with Mach3 system.Update : Down to 2-3 Stars.Used the razor for about two weeks and found that it did not function as well as the Mach3 . If you are not an everyday shaver -LRB- sometimes I do n't shave on the weekends or holiday breaks -RRB- you will suffer significant beard-pull when you shave off those few days worth of growth . Also , I found that I simply was n't getting as close a shave as I did with the Mach3 , even when shaving every day . I agree that there was less irritation , but only slightly so . I do miss the sideburn blade and the heft of the handle , but I 'm happy that I returned it and purchased more blades from my Mach 3 Power instead -- for me , at least , this was n't an improvement .
 This is the second razor that I have . The first one I lost on vacation and when I was looking for a replacement this one works so well I just bought it again
 I always hated disposables and would just get whatever costco had when I needed a new razor since the replacement blades are so expensive . I have been using a mach 3 for years and liked it very much but when I tried this razor it gave me a better shave , no irritation on my very sensitive skin , and a quicker shave -LRB- especially than my merkur -RRB- it quickly became my favorite razor .
 This product is good for the one who wants deep clean shave . Performance is good for sure .
 What is there not to like in the Fusion shaver ? It has five shaving blades that thoroughly cut and smooth out any stubble . Five blades also means less wear/tear on the individual blades and less costs for replacements . It has another blade on the opposite side for trimming of sideburns and and hard to reach spots -LRB- near lip line and nostrils -RRB- . A lubrication strip that is redundant because the shaver is very comfortable and reliable . The head of the shaver pivots with the contour of the face and that again means a more precise shave and less cuts/bleeding . The handle is ergonomic and thick which allows for less fatiguing of the hands . All of these features make for an incredibly close shave that is less time consuming . What else can you ask for ? I use it when my beard is beyond 7 days growth and using an electrical shaver is going to be painful . It 's now my preferred shaver for all occasions because of it 's thoroughness and reliability . The only concern is that the replacement blades are being counterfeited by bogus manufacturers ; so if you find a hard-to-believe price for the replacement blades beware and go to Google for websites -LRB- Ebay -RRB- that have articles on spotting the fakes . I found the best price on genuine replacement blades on Amazon . This is a great product that ca n't be improved . It 's just that good . FIVE STARS A + + + .
 I finally made the switch from the Mach 3 Turbo to the Fusion with 5 blades and the difference was very noticeable . With the Fusion it feels like you 're simply dragging a butter knife across a perfectly smooth , freshly saved face.There is virtually no sensation of the whiskers being cut . This could only be my own personal experience because I do not have a heavy beard.However , I do notice a significant difference in sensation of the hairs being cut between the Fusion and the Mach 3 . So , there is obviously an improvement in this area.Overall , I wish I had made the change when the Fusion was first introduced . Expensive , yes , worth it , definitely .
 I just stole this razor from my husband as he uses an electric shaver . My legs have never been so smooth after shaving . I can not say enough about this razor !
 I do love the spot-on reviewer comment below about the Gillette BladeMask . Whenever these shaving companies come out with these number-of-blade toppers , the inevitable question asked is `` where will it end ? '' I think the BladeMask comment answers that question in a facetious but , hey who knows , perhaps accurate way . Touch&eacute;.I 've always been a -LRB- very -RRB- early adopter of Gillette blade innovations , so I bought the Fusion first day of release . -LSB- Hey , A.G. Lafley bought the whole freakin ' company after testing a Fusion prototype , so that 's a pretty good testament . -RSB- In terms of the Fusion itself , there are pros and cons vs. upgrading from the Mach Turbo 3 . The pros : - Does seem to be a better shave -LRB- certainly takes less strokes , that 's for sure -RRB- . Gillette has succeeded in raising the bar again . - I suspect you 'll get less wear on each blade meaning you 'll be able to keep the blade in the razor longer . -LSB- A key point when you read my ` cons ' . -RSB- - The industrial design of the razor , the blade and how the two pieces fit together is a thing of beauty . A real indication of the increasing pervasiveness of CAD in every aspect of our lives and the need to compete on functionality , price AND design . -LSB- Thank you , Steve Jobs . -RSB- - The blade on the back is a real breakthrough . Sounds bizarre in concept , but great in practice . You 'll keep your sideburns straighter and not bang up that space under your nose trying to cram 3 + blades under there.The cons : - Well , of course you need that backside razor because the darn surface face of the blade contraption is so big -LRB- this is the `` Big Bertha '' of razors -RRB- and spongy-flexible like a teenage gymnast that you ca n't get the shaving impact area within a country mile of the undersize of your nose . The backside razor is n't just a coolness factor ; it was birthed out of necessity . - Gillette has now taken its famed `` give way the razor to get the blade revenue '' business model -LRB- and the mother of all business analogies -RRB- to a price-gouging extreme . $ 25 for eight blades ? -LRB- and that 's the discount -RRB- . What will happen is that shaver across the world will look for a way to extend the life of each blade . Gillette famously does n't recommend when to change blades leaving the decision to each shaver -LRB- and , hey - Richard Nixon and I had different shaving needs , so how could they possibly recommend a standard -RRB- . But - my reaction will be to double the tenure of each blade I put in play . I think others will consider the same practice .
 I have been using the Mach 3 now for several years . I have been very pleased with how it feels/shaves . Then along came the Fusion -LRB- 5 blades -RRB- . And honestly , the shave from this one is better . I never thought that possible . You can hardly feel the blades just glide across your face . I for one will continue using the Fusion . Even though I do n't like paying double for the blades . The shave is well worth it .
 I was very skeptical -- had been using two-blade razor for years . But once you get used to the floppy head , the Fusion gives an incredibly smooth , nick-free shave . I 'm out to buy a second one for my travel kit .
 I had such a horrible time with razors basically eating up my face . I had been using the Mach 3 and Gillette 3 blade disposible -LRB- along with Edge Ultra-sensitive gel -RRB- , but noticed more and more razor bumps . It got so bad , that I had to take the day off from work because I could n't show my totally raw/cut/irritated face . Needless to say , my skin is sensitive.Well , I did n't shave for 2 days trying to baby my skin so it would recover . The next day , I had to shave so I had to make a decisionAs with most cases , when I need something answered , or need other people 's opinions , I fired up the good ol' web browser . I started by researching electric razors since I heard they were easier on your face , but after reading the reviews , I could n't see spending $ 150 for something that may not even help and probably would n't give me as close a shave.I had heard of the Fusion and it did sound interesting to me . The 5 blade feature did n't impress me as much as the fact that the blades are closer together . I figured if they 're closer it would n't give my skin the chance to get between them and be sliced off - excuse my graphic language :-RRB- I looked up reviews on the Fusion and found some mention of it being good for sensitive skin . That did it for me , so off I went to buy a Fusion.When I got to the store , their were rows and rows of empty racks -LRB- I would guess at least 20 rows -RRB- where all the Fusions had been . Seems like they 're very popular with the local crowd . Anyhow there was ONE left and I nabbed it.Got it home and immediately went in to shave.What a difference ! No razor new razor bumps , and it did n't even irritate the old ones -LRB- from my Gillette disposables -RRB- . No cuts , no irritation whatsoever ! And it really gives you a smooth shave . Even my wife was impressed with my smooth face!So , moral to this story . If you have sensitive skin , and you want a really close shave with no irritation , get the Fusion . And yes I agree , the cartridges are pretty expensive , but to me my face is worth it .
 The first thing that came to mind , and many have already said it , was the Saturday Night Live skit with a 15-bladed razor . I thought , `` Come on , FIVE blades ? `` Then I tried it.Holy smokes , I think there is actually a product that lives up to its claims . I 'm 45 with pretty sensitive skin - nick and burn easily . This razor does it and good . No nicks at all , and a smooth , comfortable shave . I use it with Neutrogena 's Razor Defense gel , and think there is n't going to be any better combination . -LRB- This is for the manual razor . The notion of sticking a battery/vibrator in a bladed razor just gives me the willies . -RRB-
 My girlfriend picked this up for me at her work . Personally I 'm glad she got the thing on discount . It 's no better than the M3 Power razor I have . The difference in closeness of a shave was minimal to nonexistant , more closely bordering the latter I 'm afraid . On top of which , the new head design renders shaving with the grain , or the downstroke , completely useless . And the detail trimmer on the back of the head is dull and useless right out of the packaging.The single improvement this razor has over the last generation is that the handle of the blade is more comfortable in the hand and balanced better . The downstroke is useless , the upstroke is the shave . The total shave is overall the same except that I ca n't use the downstroke at all anymore . And at the jacked up price they 're pumping out these beauties at , it 's not worth anything at all . I 'll stick with my M3 Power . Sorry Gillette . Your new thing just ai n't the best a man can get .
 This razor is perfect for shaving my head . It is big and hard to get behind the ears but I manage just fine . Perfect on the back of the neck . I can where high collared dress shirts after I just shaved and it doesnt burn .
 this razor works really good and shaves very closely . its all my dad uses and I just love it especially when his cheek is smooth whenever I hug or kiss him .
 It was shipped to me in brand new condition , just like you were to buy it at Walmart or Target , I love Gillette products and you should too .
 My boyfriend and I only use gillette razors . they are the most effective for us . I really like the flexibility in the razors so we can get a close shave without cutting ourselves .
 My son requested this for Christmas . He really liked it and I was so happyto find it on Amzon.com .
 Close shave and the handle has a nice grip to it . It has a little weight to it which keeps your hand steady and slow . Especially good for younger shaver since it 's harder to slip and knick yourself with so many blades . Just be gentle while shaving and do n't apply to much pressure , it very easily can cause razor burn .
 I have been using the Gillette Fusion Manual Razor for years and have never been disappointed . It has consistently given me a closer , smoother shave than any other razors with no nicks or cuts . My wife uses Gillette Fusion as well citing the fact that it is better than any razors marketed for women.FYI from the manufacturer-Gillette Fusion Manual Razors offers : * 5-Blade Shaving Surface Technology with 5 PowerGlide Blades spaced closer together to help reduce pressure - with more comfort and less irritation than MACH 3 * Precision Trimmer on the back of the razor for those tricky spots like sideburns , under the nose and around facial hair * Flexible Comfort Guard for a comfortably close shave * Enhanced Indicator Lubricating Strip gradually fades to white when you are no longer getting your optimal shave , so you always know when to change the bladesIndications
 I held out with the Mach 3 up till now , with highly satisfying shaves . Two shaves with the manual Fusion Proglide illustrates the improvement convincingly . The spots around the nose are just as easy to shave with both . The upper lip is easier with the Proglide . My main problem area is the chin . Even the Mach 3 has to be maneuvered carefully to shave effectively and without skin iritation.Enter the Proglide
 I only use a manual razor as I have yet to find an electric one that will cut my whiskers without seeming to pull them out . I prefer the multi-blade razors as they always seem to do a better job and the best I have used so far it this Gillette Fusion . The five blade head shaves my face smooth on the first pass and I do not have to often reshave an area over . Multiple shaving over the same place tends to give me razor burn.The flexible head follows the contours of my face and always keeps the blades at the proper angle for a clean close shave . The single blade side is good for trimming my side burns and my mustache . I also like the Lubrastrip and when it is gone it is about time to change blades . It is a good indicator of the razors usage.The grip elastomer coating on the handle makes it nice to shave with as you can get a firm grip on the razor even with wet and soapy hands . Overall it is a good design and it works well for me ! I get a close comfortable shave .
 I hoped and wished that there would be a competing product that was cheaper . But there simply is n't one . Gillette Fusion , the one with five blades , is the best in shaving . Period .
 The main part of the Gillette Fusion -LRB- r -RRB- is indeed better than the Mach III -LRB- r -RRB- . The shave is close , smooth and free from razor burn . The lack of razor burn is remarkable with a new blade.But the extra single-blade is another matter altogether . Because the main 5-blade setup is so big , some provision had to be made for tight spots like under the nose . It 's an old-fashioned single blade . I really do n't remember when I last used a single blade . I think that 's why I dislike shaving . Oww , yes , it 's that old-time razor burn in spades.So after any shave you can contrast the burn beneath your nose with the smooth , closely-shaved , unharmed skin on the rest of your face.After their big-buck R & D efforts , Gillette needs a way to solve this . -LRB- Or use a Mach III under your nose and the new Fusion on the rest of your beard . -RRB- BTW , somehow they seem to have solved the clogged-blade problem that haunted the 4-bladed Shick Quattro .
 Tried different razors , but this is the best . I got a much better shave than the one with the batteries . With the Fusion blade , this is the best shave I have ever gotten .
 First of all , I 'm a woman . I 've been using Venus razors for years , with okay results . I 've tried the Mach 3 , which did n't really impress me . I decided to try the Fusion since my husband uses one , and that way we could buy one kind of blade instead of two . I was blown away with the shave the Fusion gave me ! Super close with no nicks , and today 's day two and my legs feel just as smooth as yesterday , something the Venus never did . The only gripe I have is that I miss my Venus handle -- I 'm finding the Fusion handle to be pretty slippery in the shower , and harder to hold onto .
 My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside , I will make one confession about Gillette 's Fusion blades
 When I started using Mach3 , I thought this was the best shaving experience I 'd ever get . And then Fusion proved me how wrong I was . Shaving becomes just too damn easy and smooth with Fusion - GO FOR IT !!!
 It 's alright , I guess , if you like spending 5 minutes shaving.Otherwise I suggest waiting until they come out with the Gillete BladeMask , that you just stick your face into , and a cacophany of whirling razors shaves everything in a few seconds.Or lasers . Lasers would be sweet .
 I just got this a few days ago , and I just had to say that this is one of the best razors that I have ever used . And its unded $ 20.00 . The Fusion combine 5 razors , making it one of the fastest and most perscise razors on the market . This razor just seems to glide across your face . When I start shaving with it , I went over my face about another 5 times because I did n't think it was shaving . Yes , it is that smooth . The percision blade on the back is n't really nothing to get hyped up about . In my opinion , I think it is quite usless . But that aside , it is an amazing razor , and I stongly suggest it .
 This succesor to the Mach3 has the same style and sizing , but does the job better.Unfortunately with many of the reviews here , you ca n't tell what the person used before , what their skin and hair type are , etc. . So for me
 A Work of Art and the best shave I 've ever had ! I laughed when I heard Gillette was coming out with a razor with 5 blades but it did n't surprise me . This is the best shave I have ever had . The 5 blades glide across the face without friction or burn and the shave feels effortless . The 6th single blade is gimmicky but good for what it is for ... under the nose and sideburns.I cringed when I saw the cost of replacement blades but buy your blades on EBAY and save lots of money . I bought 64 Gillette Fusion blades on Ebay for about $ 85 .
 Gillette has hit a 3 run homer over the wall with this razor . I 've been using it a month now and it is perfect in all respects . The only safety razor I 've ever owned which has not caused even one knick , it is very smooth and the separate single blade for sideburns and under the nose is a great feature . Absolutely the best razor and blade combination ever conceived by man . Some may complain about the price , but as in most things in life , you get what you pay for .
 I have been using the SensorExcel for several years and thought I was happy . I received the Gillette Fusion as a free promo and decided to try it . The initial sensation of having 5 blades scrape across my face was a bit unsettling -LRB- I imagined a layer of skin being shaved off -RRB- but the results were startling . Very close and comfortable shave -- only the beard was removed , not the skin . Single blade on the reverse side works fine for trimming sideburns and under the nose . I used the first blade for 22 shaves and did not nick myself once . I could only get 6-7 shaves out of a Sensor blade so , for me , the high price for Fusion blades is justified .
 As a Gillette Mach 3 owner , I decided to give the new Fusion a try . Much to my surprise , this new shaver is hands down better than the previous model . Cuts better , smoother and the five blades result in a faster shave . Unlike the Schick Quattro , the Fusion is very easy to clean after use .
 First let me qualify myself as someone who last used a non-electric razor when I was 18 ... over 25 years ago . Thus the beginner tag . I stopped using a bladed razor because of cuts . For years I kind of accepted an average shave from electric razors because I just knew a blade would cut my face . I even grew a goatee because I could not get a clean shave on my chin . About two weeks ago I received an unsolicited free Gillette Fusion in the mail . I just sat it on my desk and figured I would toss it out eventually . Something inside told me to `` research '' it on the Net . I did and decided to give it a whack come Monday morning -LRB- Nov. 6 -RRB- . After perusing these reviews I decided to not buy the Fusion gels . I instead bought the Face Scrub , Shaving Gel and Post Shave Lotion of the Neutrogena Men , Razor Defense line . Let 's just say I did not know I needed a Face Scrub product . : - -RRB- With some trepedition I went ahead with my `` test . '' I could not believe how gently the Fusion glided across my face . And , just as importantly , what an improvement over my electric razor . I honestly do not think I could cut myself if I tried . Okay , of course I could . : - -RRB- I recommend this razor . I have not used Mach3 , Sensor , etc. so I ca n't say it is better or worse . But I like it.P.S . The cartridges are , of course , overpriced .
 I got one of these in a free promotion . I have to admit , there I was standing in the shower looking at this thing and thinking `` I think I can pick up a squadron of German bombers coming in '' . Seriously , it looks like a WW2 coastal radar , not a razor . I mean it is big . . huge . . ridiculous . I pictured the coroner finding my severed head in the shower , this thing clutched in my hands , `` air raid '' scrawled on the shower in blood . I have to admit - it is arguably the best shave I have ever had . I shave my head as well and I half expected it to look like a bowl of coleslaw when done but nary a nick at all . I found that due to it 's size it did need fixing on a curve or two , but overall I was very impressed . I have been using Gillette disposable up till now . So it has impressed my skin , but now it has to make peace with my wallet . It all boils down to how long the blades last . I expect at least a week out of each . Usually those green `` lube '' strips are the first to go and after that the razors become pretty brutal . AT this price point I do n't want to use more than one blade every week . If they can manage that and send me some coupons then I am sold . But I think 5 blades is the stopping point - anything beyond that needs a pull starter .
 I have to say BUY THIS RAZOR . I cut easily , and I 've tried them all , you name it , and I 've tried it . This is the first razor that 1 -RRB- does n't cut me 2 -RRB- gives me a great , close shave , even after 2 or 3 days growth 3 -RRB- leaves no bumps or scrapes.I thought this was a marketing ploy , and while it very well may be , the product still produces . In 2 words `` IT 'S GREAT '' . I ca n't say enough about this 5 blader , other than it does make sense that the 5 blades leave less space between the blades to catch your skin in . I 've only tried the manual , but since it does the job as I 've said , I 'm one happy guy who always hated to shave.I know I must sound like a company member but I 'm not . I 'm just a consumer that gets surprised when something radical comes out on the market , gets alot of ad space and promo time , and is actually as good or better than the ads and promo says it is.So I say again , BUY IT !! .

 4 b/c the replacements are too expensive.Should be a 5 . This is the best Razor ever .
 My stepdad gave me one of these a few years ago when he got it as a promo in the mail and ever since then , I have been an avid fan of this razor . I used to use disposable razors or swipe my sisters ' nicer Venus razors , but I have since fallen in love with the five-blade concept ! In fact , I can not find a woman 's razor with more than only four blades.The cost of the razor is okay , the replacement blades are outrageously expensive , but I find that they last a long time . I 've noticed that the guys who have reviewed on here have to replace them far more often than I do ... it probably has a lot to do with the fact that I 'm using them on my legs rather than my face , and my legs are a lot less sensitive than faces are . Still
 Have to say , i will never use a woman razor again , this is the softest skin i 've ever gotten after a shave . AMAZING blades . very nice shave . close shave . love it . all my friends use it
 product is good price and speedy delivery . After a few uses both are dull and no longer sharp . Can I get refund or new product shipped ? Thx
 The best parts :1 . No nicks on my face / neck because the multiple blades are very close together so it does n't `` dig '' into your skin like the other 2-blade razors . The razors remove your facial hair , but not your skin .2 . Precision Blade makes sideburn trimming easy -LRB- note
 LAS MEJORES RAZURADAS DE MI VIDA , SIMPLEMENTE INCREIBLE , Y ME DA MAS DE 10 RAZURAS , POR CARTUCHO , QUE PUEDO DECIR SON MUY BUENAS
 It 's got the power of five , five blades that is !!! The Gillette Fusion is a great manual blade razor -LRB- the battery Power version is also great ! -RRB- , it 's a bit costly , but you can find them on sale at a nice price if you look !!! I got a thick beard , and even with that a blade will last me over a week before going dull , and these great blades do n't cut and nick my face up , just a nice accurate clean smooth shave !!! A truly great man 's razor !!! Recommended !!! A +
 I bought this for my husband -LRB- who insists on using manual razors -RRB- . He loves this razor ! He said it is a very smooth , close cut . And he really liked the `` flip side '' sideburn trimmer . We also bought the Fusion shaving lotion and balm , which he would recommend .
 For as long as I can remember , shaving has been a dreaded event . I always got razor bumps and ingrown hairs , and my facial hair is n't even curly . I have tried everything from electric razors , to clippers , to double edge safety razors , and even changing the directions that I shaved . Nothing has ever really worked.I received a free fusion in the mail , and was skeptical . I tried it , but I still got razor bumps . But then I thought for a second about shaving WITH the grain and NOT stretching the skin , and thought even more about using a shaving brush that I had purchased . I also decided to use a simple , cheap shaving cream , Barbasol Aloe Shaving Cream that I already had in my closet . I found the SOLUTION!But I should also mention that I shave in the shower with a mirror . I now look forward to shaving , and I feel that shaving everyday is best because it allows your face to grow accustomed to shaving , also allowing the hairs on your face to grow in the direction that you shave , remember-WITH the grain . If you shave with the grain you greatly reduce your chances of having ingrown hairs . If you want to love shaving , and be like that guy who has a perfect shave , get yourself a gilette fusion , a shaving brush , a shower mirror , and a mug.Shave in the shower : Let your face get wet with hot water for at least 2 mins , put some shaving cream on a brush and stretch your skin out -LRB- only while brushing -RRB- and brush your beard for 2 mins , fill your mug with hot water and dip your razor in the mug every couple of strokes . Shave in the direction of hair growth , never against and do n't stretch it , if anything puff up your face ! I make two passes , after the first one I re-lather and fill my mug up again with more hot water . And you do n't need to leave the water on !!! That 's what the mug is for . Try this for a few days and tell me , someone who has suffered for 7 years , that it is n't the best shave you ever had .
 I have tried just about every configuration of razors
 I FOUND THE GILLETTE FUSION RAZOR GIVES AN EXCEPTIONALLY CLOSE AND COMFORTABLE SHAVE . IT ALSO HAS A VERY WELL DESIGNED GRIP FOE EASY HANDLING . REPLACEMENT CARTRIDGES ARE SOMEWHAT PRICEY , BUT THEY LAST LONGER THAN OTHER CARTRIDGES SO OVERALL IT EVENS OUT .
 great , its out in the states , you lucky sods!will we ever get them ? how come they 're not out at the same time as over there ?
 How can one rate a product before it is tested ? From everything I have read about this product , it would be a great addition to the shaving world . I 'm ordering a razor and I 'll rate it from there . I do n't care how many blades it has as long as it makes progress .
 I have a very sensitive face . After using disposables many years ago and being left feeling like my face had just been lacerated , I switched to electric . Several years ago I got a Mach 3 razor free in the mail and started using that periodically . It was the first blade shaver that worked for me . Then I gave the Schick Quattro a try and found it to be better , though the blades got clogged easier . After using that for a while , I got a free Fusion in the mail . It was heaven . I will admit here and now that the Quattro gives me a very slightly closer shave , but the Fusion gives a more comfortable shave . I 'll take the latter . My only big criticism is that the blade on the back is useless ; the two times I used it , I nicked myself . Would be nice if they made the blades slightly cheaper without it.As an aside , I tried the power versions of both the Fusion and the Quattro -LRB- my wife got them free with coupons and sales . -RRB- I found both annoying , but the Fusion to be far more annoying .
 Obviously only a small segment of the population shaves their heads , but if you 're sporting a bald dome , I can recommend the Gillette Fusion as the best razor for your head.After trying both the Mach 3 and the Headblade Sport for my head , the Fusion took top prize hands down -LRB- the high-quality Mach 3 came in second ; the Headblade was fun , but only gave a pretty good shave -RRB- . The Fusion gave my head a very close shave , and with less irritation than the other razors . Though , at first , the Fusion 's five blades can feel a little heavy scraping across the scalp , I 've been pleasantly surprised to see that it was n't taking off skin or causing an excessive amount of tiny little bumps on my head -LRB- I 've found that light , quick , and long strokes eliminate any discomfort , while still providing an excellent shave -RRB- . Of the three razors , this was the only one that provided my head with that baby 's - butt-smooth texture that I was looking for.This razor also shaves my face closer and quicker than the Mach 3 did , and the extra blade on the back is quite handy for cleaning up around tough areas.The cartridges are expensive , but hear me out
 Gillette has hit a 3 run homer over the wall with this razor . I 've been using it a month now and it is perfect in all respects . The only safety razor I 've ever owned which has not caused even one knick , it is very smooth and the separate single blade for sideburns and under the nose is a great feature . Absolutely the best razor and blade combination ever conceived by man . Some may complain about the price , but as in most things in life , you get what you pay for .
 I rate these razors at the top of them all . I 've used them all , and simply can not complain about them . I used to use the Shick quattro and thought it was the best , four blades , right ? Wow , what a difference . But it 's not just the 5th blade that does it ; they use MUCH higher quality metal for the blades , and what really makes a huge difference is that on the fusion , the BACK of the cartridge is OPEN , so that each time you dunk it for a rinse , all of the hairs come right out , and it 's 100 % clean for the next stroke . Those were the two major weak points on the 4 blade razors , they are closed off mostly on the back , so when you do a fair stroke , it fills with small hairs , and tapping or shaking it around in water just doesnt get it out , and it just gets worse , and worse , and worse ... Best razor ever . Make sure you wet your face at least 1 min beforehand , use a thin cream , rinse the blade often , and dry it after shaving . I 've never had a cartridge last me less than 2 or 3 weeks , usually a month is the norm . I bought 2 8 packs , and they lasted me 14 months . . Anyhow , that 's my 2 cents ; the open back makes a HUGE difference , along with the ultra high quality blades . I have SUPER sensitive skin , and tried every blade razor but avoided shaving until this one came along . The only thing I think should change is a slight price drop , but as long as they do n't go UP in price I 'll keep using them for life .
 I received a free sample so I gave it a try and have been using it for about two months . It is expensive compared to twin-blade razors , but the five-blade shaving heads last longer . The blades are available from a variety of sources ranging from local supermarkets and drugstores to Internet sources , so shop around for the best price.I found that this razor gives a smoother shave than the older twin-blade razors , and the flat five-blade surface has less tendency to cause nicks . The trimmer blade on the back side is convenient - something that was missing on the twin-blade razors.It is worth spending a few bucks to give it a try . I will probably stick with it .
 I bought this on Amazon as it is not yet available here in India . The replacement cartridges they are very very expensive . -LRB- of course Amazon has it on sale right now , but they are still too expensive -RRB- . As far as the shaving experience goes , it is absolutely fabulous . It is extremely smooth and saves time while shaving . The lube strip seems to wear out faster than the Mach 3 , but I could be mistaken there as I 've been using it for a a few days only now.Once a week I do n't shave for a few days -LRB- weekends ... one gets lazy -RRB- and the razor cuts through with ease , as if it were cutting through a days growth . Not only that , I used to have problems with hair getting stuck between the blades , whenever shaving after such an interval . with the Fusion it is not an issue . The hair washes off under the tap -LRB- means faucet for those who did n't understand `` tap '' -RRB- , no struggling required.Expensive as it is -LRB- like other reviewers have observed as well -RRB- , I 'm not going back to the Mach 3 that I used earlier . and certainly never to the Sensor excel I used before that . No regrets at all.definitely definitely recommended ...
 I just got this razor today and I love it . I had an old Mach 3 razor , it was good but I needed a new razor.The design of this razor is amazing . The wieght of the Fusion is pretty similar to the Mach 3 , unless you have the battery powered one , then I guess it would be heavier . I thought , `` 5 blades ? Are you kidding me ... when will it end ? '' But I swear to you this razor cuts better than any 3 blade razor I 've ever used . I also thought that the small razor on the back of the Fusion was pointless , but I was wrong . The small razor is great for side burns and getting small places like under your lip and under your nose.I only nicked myself once , but WOW this is a great razor . I highly recommend the Gillette Fusion .
 I just picked up one of these razors today and i also got the Gillette Fusion shaving gel . This is the best razor i have ever used . My old razor , the Gillette Sensor , used to irritate my face but this one does n't , and i love that .
 I moved from a SensorExcel -LRB- 2 blades -RRB- to this and this one is much better.I had a full face of hair -LRB- I had n't shaved in about 4-5 days -RRB- , enough to start a beard . One slow stroke across each section of skin with this razor was enough to clear out the hair with more precision than the SensorExcel could after 3 or 4 strokes.That is
 I am 68 years old and just had the best shave of my life . I hate shaving and as a result I buy every new razor , blade and cream that comes on the market hoping for the shave I just got from this razor . I just ordered the one with electric handle , just keep hoping , buth this was great .
 My wife gave me a Gillette Fusion razor blade prior to my train-up for a deployment to Afghanistan in late 2006 . During that deployment , I managed to use the same blade for 20 + days at a time . Did I mention I also shaved my scalp with the same blade ... ? Since my return home at the end of 2007 , I 've been getting a month 's use per blade on both my face and scalp . I start to get a slight drag after about 20 days or so but , what other razor can give you approximately 15-20 uses for that long ? On the 1st of each month , I replace the old blade with a fresh one . The price per pack is expensive -LRB- $ 20 + for each 8-count pack -RRB- but , each 8-count pack last me eight months ... . You have to admit , that 's money well spent.I 've used all types of blades starting when I was 15 ... single , double , triple edge blades ... Electric shavers , clippers , and even depilatories -LRB- which I loved using except for the time it takes to prepare it , spread it on , wait for it to cure , scrape it off , and wash the excess off my face -RRB- . I 've never had a razor blade that shaved me so close , for so long.To close this review I 'd like to add that I 've been on Active Duty in the U.S. Army for 24 years , 7 months & 21 days now and will retire in 41 days -LRB- June 30th -RRB- . I will continue to shave my face and scalp with the Gillette Fusion but , I doubt I 'll do it as often . I 've earned it . Hey , maybe I 'll grow a beard and make the razor last two months ...
 My first razor was a single blade Schick Injector razor -LRB- mid-1960s -RRB- . Then I had a couple of electric razors . About three years ago my wife informed me I needed to go back to a blade . Even though properly maintained , the electrics were not doing the job.Single blade razors were not available anyplace I looked . I bought a two blade razor . It seemed to work OK . One day a Gillette Fusion appeared in our mailbox as a sample and I have been using it since . It does a better job that a two blade razor . I even had opportunity to shave for a week with the two blade system again . It can do a good job , but it takes more effort to get a good shave . The Fusion generally does a good job , but also needs good technique to get the best shave . This includes shaving against the whisker grain at all times , lathering up and waiting a minute or so for the beard to soften , and making my skin tight so the whiskers can not roll under the approaching blade uncut.The blades are not cheap . I get more life from them by cleaning the shaving foam out of them with water , shaking the razor to expel excess water , and then rinsing the blades with rubbing alcohol to absorb the remaining water and prevent microscopic surface rust , which is a leading cause of blades dulling . I get about three times my normal blade life this way .
 Smoothest , most comfortable shave I 've ever had . The back blade is nice for trimming under the nose . With all the blades with wide heads that have come out , that 's been a tricky proposition ... until now.At first , I rolled my eyes at a 5-blade razor , but man , this thing ROCKS !
 Surprisingly good ; definitely better than the Mach 3 . On the plus side it really hugs your face , shaves cleanly with a single pass , and does n't nick or abrade the skin . Even the edges under the jaw line came clean . I hate shaving and often skip weekends yet find that it works quite well on one , two , or even three day 's worth of growth . Have n't gone longer than that so I could n't say for sure but seems like it 'd do okay for another day or two . Any longer and it would take a pass with an electric trimmer to shorten things up first . The handle is nicely ergonomic too , easy to grip and control when wet . On the minus side the single trim blade does n't work horribly well , at least not for me . I 've got to even up my sideburns and trim around my goatee and this just does n't do the trick . Considering what they cost , the blades do n't last as long as I 'd like either . I 've used it regularly for about three weeks and it 's just starting to dull enough to consider changing the blade . Might be able to stretch it another week but that might be pushing it . Considering that I can go a year with an electric model -LRB- Braun -RRB- on a single blade/screen set I 'd think they could make a manual that lasts more than a month ... Despite the downside , it 's the best manual razor I 've used so far . Quick , clean , comfortable shave ... Got one as a free promotion and liked it enough to pick up a pack of refill cartridges . They are a bit pricey but not overmuch . I expect to continue using it for some time to come .
 Just got this yesterday and so far am very impressed . First off , great design from the shape of the handle etc to the holder itself . If you like cool industrial design for the masses -LRB- think Michael Graves and so on at Target -RRB- then this will make you happy . It 's also an impressive piece of manufacturing , that they can get the five blades lined up with such accuracy . Extra points for the design geeks.More importantly of course , the shaving experience itself . I live in Minnesota which right now -LRB- winter -RRB- has quite a dry climate , so a harsh shave will leave you with raw , uncomfortable skin for most of the day . I 'm not sure if this razor gave a closer shave than with my Mach 3 , but it certainly was way quicker and required fewer re-strokes , which cuts down on irritation and the potential for nicks and cuts . It was easy to shave the hard-to-manage parts of my face where the hairs are n't all lying in the same direction , like under my jaw , which again cut down on the number of re-strokes . Once I got used to the extra razor on the back of the cartridge , I liked the way I could use it as advertised
 My thoughts regarding the multi-blade razor campaigns aside , I will make one confession about Gillette 's Fusion blades
 i received the free gillette fusion razor in the mail as a sample . the first time i tried it , i was like `` HOLY SMOKES THAT FEELS SO GOOD ! '' the shave is very close , and it leaves my skin feeling really smooth when i use it with edge advanced shaving gel.i shave about 2-3 times a week , and have been using the same cartridge for about 8 months -LRB- january 09-august 09 -RRB- . do NOT use this with anything less than edge advanced . i used the shaving gel that came with the razor , and it does n't quite cut it very well.the reason why i only gave this razor 4 stars is because of the price of refill cartridges . those things are EXPENSIVE . i just bought some off of ebay , and they run for $ 2 a cartridge . those are pretty pricey , but retail stores are even WORSE - they average about $ 4 a cartridge in-store . if you 've got the money , get it . this razor is great .
 I ca n't believe I ignored this razor when it first came out . I thought it was a marketing gimmick with the 5 blades . I stood behind my trusty Mach 3 razor . I was wrong . On a whim I picked up this razor and tried it out . I was amazed . It is so much better than the Mach 3 . My face is smooth and I never get razor burn . With the Mach 3 I would get razor burn when I failed to change the blades often . If you think this razor is a gimmick you are missing out on a major improvement . I feel like an idiot for waiting so long to upgrade my razor .
 try price at Do It Best stores they deliver free to store near you price is $ 3.79 for 32 oz or $ 5.99 for 64 oz
 have had a hard time finding this product online . We use it at work and order it by the case . works great on machine screens . great product
 Great product for many types of cleaning . Best product out there for windows and for the car window cleaner bottle . Removes grease well . Have used for many years . TeeBop ships quickly and is always available by telephone for questions .
 The chair was just what I was looking for . Easy to operate , and direct as to what I need for . Bathroom safety , and accessibility is very important to a person who can not walk or get around ... I love this chair . I recommend to people who have older love ones that can not get around by themselfs .
 This bath chair has been a great help to bathe my mom who has late stage Parkinsons . It is sturdy . The padded vinyl seat keeps her from slipping off and it 's open enough to make sure she is clean . I am glad that we bought it . Also , one store actually recommened Nova products as they tended to be more consistent in quality than other manufacturers .
 Deluxe Shower Chair CommodeI purchased this for my husband on Friday , June 1 , ,2012
 This is a long overdue review ... almost 4 years ago when my daughter was born , I had many stressful sleepless nights and developed an eczema all over my body . I tried so many things and nothing worked to relieve it . Someone suggested Haelan 951 fermented soy beverage , this person claimed to have been cured from cancer years ago . Then couple of months later through friends I met another person who said to know several cases of people whose conditions improved with this drink.That was enough to spring me into action , even that my case was totally different . What made me try it was evidence that many nations -LRB- Japanese traditional diet for example , or some regions in Korea , Kazakhstan -RRB- that have significant intake of fermented beverages enjoy great health and longevity . There are a lot of naturally happy people there too . It 's interesting that health , longevity and happiness often go together . I 've studied biochemistry in the past for many years , and among many other things I know that intestinal system is the place where most neurotransmitters are being produced . So are components of the immune system , and many other wonderful things take place in a healthy GI tract . You do n't have to go further then any decent encyclopedia to learn more about it . Aside from all of its other functions , the GI tract is a lymphoid organ , and the lymphoid tissue within it is collectively referred to as the gut-associated lymphoid tissue or GALT . The number of lymphocytes in the GALT is roughly equivalent to those in the spleen . In other words , serious stuff happens there and fermented soy drink theoretically can provide benefits to the gut beyond normal intake of regular food.I really did n't care for the taste , but potential for healing was much more important to me . To my astonishment , eczema disappeared within a month . Completely . I had a smooth , perfect skin as if nothing ever happened . I thought it might have been coincidental , but about a year later I had another bout of stress , and again in the midst of it , it went away within about a week of using this soy drink . This all could have been coincidental , but it certainly did n't feel to me that way , as I have felt within couple of days the healing process starting and I just felt overall calmer and more focused . In essence , all the things that are traditionally happening when people consume good fermented food and have intestinal system working perfectly in tune . With additional benefit of eczema gone , which could n't have been obtained just by normal fermented food , since I tried other things with no results . I really LOVE its effect . Even that it was years ago , I just had to come back and give my contribution ; who knows maybe someone might benefit from the review.The only drawback I thought initially was the price , but I realize that I believe 22-24 lb of soy go into production of 1 bottle , so if you count of cost of that plus shipping ... I would n't call it reasonable , but it starts making sense why such a price . But not having to do with an illness is priceless.And lastly I have to say , service from ALOSY Health Products is outstanding ; they helped me patiently several times , going beyond call of duty . I bought a few times directly through their website and a few times from them through Amazon . I got ta credit where credit is due . They might be one of the most accommodating sellers on Amazon . God 's blessings to everyone !
 When we moved into our new house we did n't realize that the washer was moldy . When the washer broke the repair guy showed me the pump and how it was full of mold . But even after we had the pump replaced a scent of mold still lingered in the laundry room . We tried leaving the fan on and that helped a bit . However it was n't until we bought this odor absorbing gel that the scent of mold completely went away . Now when I open the laundry door I 'm greeted with a lovely scent of honey and flowers . The only thing ocean about this gel is a slightly salty scent . This gel will freshen 400 square feet for 90 days . I love it and I think you will be amazed too . ~ The Rebecca Review
 The product was sealed however , it did take some time to arrive . Other than that the product is good .
 For those on the go this is a great option in the morning and/or lunch . Tastes better than any other protein drink and gives you the energy needed to run strong .
 Meals in the morning is very important and that 's when I take the shake with a herbal life protein . Excellent nutritional meal for the mornings it taste good .
 I have found that the Herbalife Formulas are easy and extremely manageable in my busy day . Herbalife is a very safe , healthy and effective way to lose weight or manage your weight . I highly recommend this product .
 I Love herbalife . It helped me and my husband a lot to loose weigh . Besides this product is very healthy and I highly recommend it . The seller its good . Shipping was fast .
 I was completely satisfied with the purchase of my item . I would definitely buy this product in the near future , especially from the seller . Thank you .
 I like when a seller deliverers fast service!I use this product as a meal replacement to help me eat better and lose weight . It does everything its supposed to and it tastes great .
 Have lost 46 lbs so far and counting - 4 more to reach my goal . WooHOOO
 it 's not the lean shake but it still works and tastes just as great ! definitely recommend giving it a try !
 The product tastes great for a health shake . I have recomended it to several people already .
 I really like this flavor . I like the tiny pieces of chocolate at the bottom .
 This shake is great , it tastes so good too . Its my fav flavor . I drink the shake every morning , I dont need to lose any weight , but it helps me get throught the day !!
 Everything goes perfect . The product came in 4 -LRB- labour -RRB- days . It seems very reliable , it comes in a HL box and with the HL magazine.I know that this product really helps to loss weight or to keep with a healthy diet.I know people who lost weight and the keep buying HL shakes.I really think this is a very good product .
 product is works just as anticipated . out the door price is great , delivery time is great
 From a girl that 's always scorned things like diet shakes and meal-in-a-glass sustenance , this Herbalife was n't so bad . I 'm using it because it 's quick and easy to pack in the mornings before dashing off to school , but it tastes pretty good . I wo n't lie and say it completely fills me up , but pack a handful of almonds for your crunch craving , a serving of fruit -LRB- I recommend the Fruit Leather products -RRB- , and of course , a bite or two of dark chocolate - and you 've got yourself a meal . I have n't been using it long enough to say its effects on my weight , but I 'm sure it 's doing the job . I 'm too hungry by dinner for it not to be .
 The product was received on time great service . The camera has lasted such a long time superior service and quality of product
 I Like so much this drink , have good taste , I drink it for breakfast and I do n't have hungry until noon .
 Order came quickly -LRB- within 3 business day -RRB- . Packaged well so it wo n't be damaged during shipping .
 I 'm on my second canister , I find the `` vanilla '' flavor a bit too much , so I throw in some frozen rasberries and it really makes a huge difference , cuts down on the `` rich '' sweetness . Sometimes I want a meal replacement but do not necessarily want it to taste like dessert , so tweaking this a bit and adding your favorite frozen fruit or nut butter , etc. is a great way to go . I also like this product because it really does keep me full , like a `` regular '' meal would . I use this product for weight loss , replacing one meal with shake , instead of the recommended `` two '' because im already on a raw food type diet , so im not taking in a whole lot of calories anyway . So far in 9 weeks , I 've lost 15 lbs . Im very satisfied with these shakes and glad I found out about them .
 Product was great ! It actually fills me up ! I mix it with Almond Milk w/vanilla because I 'm lactose intolerant . It 's delicious !
 I 've tried different types of shake mixes , and this is one of the best tasting one . I highly recommend it .
 Easy to make , great tasting , and excellent nutritional value . I add chrushed ice to give it a frosty shake texture .
 fast delivery and great shakes for weight loss . has a great taste when blended with frozen fruit and almond or soy milk .
 Super fast shipping , got my product 4 days later . My current product was low and just go this new one . This seller sells the product the lowest price i 've seen . This seller has a new loyal customer ...
 This has better taste than the other brands that I 've tried in the past . I mix it with fruits and Herbalife protein powder to give me more energy and full til the next meal .
 Tastes pretty good ... add some frozen pineapple for a thicker smoothie like consistency . Will buy again .
 I absolutely love this product . It has a great flavor and is easy to prepare .
 I love this flavor . It is by far my favorite . It blends well with fruit but tastes great alone.Of course taste is relative . This one is definitely my choice .
 I lost almost 20 pounds just by taking herbalife nothing really worked for me , i was so desperate did n't know what to do ... I even try diet pills over the counter but i always got a side effect by taking them . I 'm still loosing weight from 250 pounds to 160 pounds -LRB- oh yeah baby -RRB- , Like the song says I 'M BRINGING SEXY BACK YEAH ! Make sure to use formula 1 shake mix and 3 protein , just replace a meal if you do n't eat breakfast like me drink the shake every morning ... 2 scoops of shake mix and 1 scoop of proteinand you 'll see results NOT KIDDING !
 I have used this product as an energy booster and for a healthy living for several years during on and off periods , and have felt great . I love the flavor especially of the Cookies & Cream and Capuccino , but vanilla and cocoa are very good too . This summer I used if to loose weight after childbirth and lost almost 10 pounds without much effort , also accompanied by the protein -LRB- formula 3 -RRB- , multivitamin complex and Fiber & Herbs ; -LRB- Salvado y Hierbas in Spanish -RRB- . Everyone told me I was looking great on the beach!I am a fan of all herbalife products in general and have studied in depth the compnay 's history , philosophy , products , etc. . They are natural and scientifically created and tested by a honored team of MD and scientists of UCLA , one of them Nobel prize winner -LRB- Dr. Louis Ignarro -RRB- . So to the guy that had an issue with soy protein and thought Herbalife was stuck in the 80 ` , - that ` s not the case dude.I want to clarify that I am not a Herbalife seller neither part of their Multilevel Marketing scheme . I ` ve just had the chance to try their products and have loved them , their cosmentic products as well . Such a pitty that in Europe they are far more expensive that in the USA !
 I got this product to make my life a little bit easier after the birth of my third child . I figured it would make for a quick breakfast and might help me lose the baby weight a little faster . So far , I 'm impressed . I wake up and already know what I 'm making myself for breakfast . I add a banana or strawberries and I 'm ready for the crazy day ahead of me ! I 've found I 'm not hungry throughout the morning and end up eating a reasonable lunch . I 've lost 25 pounds in the two weeks since the baby 's been born -LRB- alot of it water weight post-baby , I know -RRB- , have a good amount of energy -LRB- all things considered -RRB- , am healing from my 3rd c-section well , and exclusively breast-feeding ! I could n't ask for a better system right now , since I ca n't work out yet . I have never been a meal replacement type person , but this is working for me !
 * Hi im updating this , its been a while . I did not lose any weight at all with this product , at first it curbed my appetite but the effects wore off for me . I am not saying it will not work for you but give it a try . I did lose 45 lbs with atkins , just saying.Ok so I got this for like $ 42 at a small store I wish I would of gotten this from amazon for 12 dollars less.But I must say its delicious . I am kind of picky what I eat but this is great . Also great with water . I tried Muscle Milk before and that did not curb my appetite.I love that this gives you energy also.Today I consumed about 1700 calories and I had the energy to exercise for 1 hour 15 minutes.I am pleased with this as I am 325 lbs and never have energy to exercise and I can easily eat 3,200 calories per day . I am not hungry I feel totally fine . Might even have a yogurt as a night snack.Let 's hope I can lose some weight , I 've only been on this for 2 days and already have the energy to take on the world!Did I mention its delicious too?You should go to a their independent stores and try one for yourself and see which flavor you like best and then buy the tub cheaper here on amazon .
 The herbalife line of product is very good if you are trying to loose some weight . Taking a shake a day made me lost about 16 lbs in about 2 month without any effort or drastic change in my eating habits .
 Love that I can buy my herbalife online . AND its about $ 10 cheaper then buying from my herbalife coach ... Great product !
 I 'm on a low-carb diet and use this for at least one meal . It fills me up very well . I use a blender with some Splenda to sweeten it up and it 's pretty good , especially with a straw , to make me feel special . Sometimes I add a little unsweetened yogurt to give it a tang and extra creaminess and that makes it even better .
 I 'm using this product for about 2 months , It 's supposed to loose weight and even I work out every day and take this product I did n't see results in my weight , but I do feel a lot better in my metabolism and I do n't feel heavy any more even I did n't loose pounds I feel healthier . I recommend the prouct for people who wants to feel healthy .
 Ok so like other mine didnt have a experation date ... 866-617-4273 herbalife ! So I got the number from amazon . IT was really complacated . At the bottem of the container of your shakes thiers a number the third number in is the year so if its a 0 thats the year it was made not the experation date but the year it was made then the next three numbers you subtract 300 ! wierd right anyays mine was723 so it came to 323 so march 23 2010 is the date it was made it is good for two years from that date if not opeaned . so mine is march 23 2012 and it is good for ayear once you opean it so thats how it works in case eveyone needs to know its complicated but if I did a bad job of explaining it the number is the number at the top that icallled they will explain it hope this helps people !
 I ordered this item on dec 17 and it got here on dec 23rd ! Did not expect it this year at all . Great shipping speed ! I have been taking Herbalife formula 1 shakes in conjunction with other Herbalife products since january 2011 . I have lost 40 pounds . This tastes so much better than other competitive brands . I usually add 2 scoops with 8oz of nonfat milk , 1 banana , and 2 frozen strawberries . YUM . Then I vary the fruit I use . Its a great healthy breakfast or even meal .
 I love this protein mix as once you have added water , ice , and any fresh fruit you have the perfect smoothie with no powdery taste or after-taste . I am now addicted to strawberry smoothies using this mix .
 I placed an order with this company on Friday December 2and and received the item on Wednesday December 7th . I am very pleased at how quickly my package arrived and i will definitely order again !
 I DID N'T PURCHASE MINES OFF AMAZON , I HAD THE FREE TRIAL , SAME SIZE AND EVERYTHING . I ALSO HAD THE COOKIES & CREAM FLAVOR THIS IS MY 1ST TIME TRYING SHAKES AND THIS HAS BEEN THE ABSOLUTE BEST THING EVER , OH AND IT TASTE GOOD TO ! IT CONTROLS MY HUNGER FOR HOURS , CONTROLS MY CRAVINGS FOR HOURS ! I LOVE IT ! I HAVE N'T EVEN FOLLOWED IT COMPLETELY LONG ENOUGH -LRB- BECAUSE MY BF TEMPS ME , I THINK HE WANTS ME 2 STAY FAT ?? -RRB- , BUT I 'VE LOST 6 LBS IN 1 WEEK ! THAT 'S MOTIVATION FOR ME TO STICK TO IT ! I DO N'T FEEL WEAK , NOR TIRED , I 'M ALERT AND ACTIVE . AND GUESS WHAT ... I BARELY DID ANY EXERCISE ... BARELY !!! I 100 % RECOMMEND THIS FOR PPL TRYING TO LOSE WEIGHT AND HAVE PROBLEMS WITH CRAVINGS ! PS . I 'M DEFINITELY BUYING MORE ASAP !
 I 'm still in the process of finding out if this product is good for my personal goals ; however , the seller was real good in providing feedback on how to use it . Will definitely make business with the seller again . Fast shipping and product was in great condition .
 it 's good good stuff i say to get it but remember you must combine a workout plan with it , it works
 Being health conscious , yet time limited , I 'm always on the look out for a nutritional product/drink mix that I can `` eat on the run '' . This is everything I want and need from a product such as that . The flavor is great , it mixes well , and easy to digest .
 It did what it was suppouse to do ... but I would n't reccomend this flavor !! Other than that its awesome : -RRB-
 Since I have purchased the product , I have lost 15 pounds . On Friday , I will definitely be ordering another one . Thanks !
 My wife loves this product . Mixes it with strawberries , splenda and nonfat milk and that is her breakfast .
 First time trying the vanilla shake and I must say that it is soooo much better than the Berry one ! As for the seller , I ordered on Sunday night and it was Fedex-ed to me from the Herbalife distribution center by Wednesday ... talk about fast shipping !
 have been using this product for two months , have lost over 15pounds , herbalife does works . .
 I liked the taste & easy to make , better with fruit like bananas , strawberries and blueberries . It is filling !
 Arrived quickly.I love Herbalife , have been using it since Aug and have lost almost 60 pounds . Have never felt better in my life since using it !!
 I 've been drinking it in the morning and it has a great taste . I sometimes blend it with frozen fruit , greek yogurt and spinach . Tastes great . I HOPE to see results soon !
 The specified product arrived timely and in good repair . It was properly sealed and found to be free from tampering .
 This product is great I love the fact that you are eating a delicious shake and not feel hungry all the time -LRB- like I USED TO -RRB- . My favorite shake is the cookies and cream I mix it sometimes with the french vanilla and sometimes with the cafe mocha . For those of you that say that it dose n't taste good you are not doing it the correct way . Try this one scoop of vanilla protein , one scoop of cookies and cream and one scoop of french vanilla trust me it will be delicious and if youre willing to spend a little extra try the prolessa .
 I have been on the Herbalife plan since July . I have dropped alot of weight and I feel amazing . I have been on MANY different diets throughout the years and so has my husband , and we both agree that this one makes us feel the best.I was really nervous to try this shake mix . I had no idea what it would taste like , and I am not a fan of Diet shakes at all . I was amazed at how many recipes can be used with this shake mix . Vanilla is so versitile , and this one if my favorite of all of the Herbalife shake mixes because you can make any kind of shake with it . My favorite is white recess , YUMMMM!What shocked me the most about this was the fact that my picky kids even love it as well . If you drink it plain with skim milk it will taste like crap , in my opinion , and you WILL have the diet shake flavor , but when you add things like fruits , sugar free pudding mixes , powdered peanut butter , spices , sugar free davinci 's syrups , flavored yogurts , etc. . . you can create really healthy & AWESOME tasting shakes.Some might be skeptical wondering if drinking the shakes will be enough to keep you satisfied . Will you be hungry and therefore binge during the day ? I felt like I was hungry the first couple of days because I was use to eating so much more and gorging myself at almost every meal . I use the protein powder from Herbalife and add one scoop to my shake mix because I require more protein.I found that the free fruits & veggies throughout the day along with the protein snacks really help alot as well . My favorite Herbalife products to use with this shake mix is Herbalifes Total Control which gives me lots of energy and the Celluloss which got rid of my excess fluids.I want to make it clear that I do not sell Herbalife , this is an honest review from someone who is using the products . THEY WORK !
 I have been using this product for the past 3 months and it is great , easy and it works ! I especially like the French Vanilla because I can add different flavored -LRB- low cal -RRB- fruit juices to customize my drinks . The other flavors are good too . I have lost 35 pounds in 3 months . Go herbalife !!!
 I have been taking Herbalife products for about two yrs now . The first time I took them , I would eat a regular breakfast , lunch and shake for dinner . I am 5ft4in and weighed 190 lbs when I started taking them . Within six months I was down to 145lbs have felt great and maintained the weight lost ! I went from a size 16 to a size 8 ! People that I had not seen in a while did n't even recognize me anymore !! The shake is delicious and I look forward to drinking it ! Also , the herbal concentrate tea is also yummy and it gives me tons of energy , something I surely need by the evening when I have a messy house to clean and three kids to bathe , change and get ready for bed ! It also helped me not be constipated , which I suffer from . Best of all I dont get any nasty side effects . I have tried phenthermine recently only because my sister in law works at a weight loss clinical and recommended it to me , all i can say is I did lose weight but felt AWFUL the wohle time I was taking them !! I became tachycardic -LRB- very fast heart rate -RRB- , hypertensive -LRB- I have NEVER had a BP of 138/95 ever ! -RRB- , insomnia , migraines , dizzines , and almost passed out a couple of time , NO THANKS !! Therefore I am sticking to Herbalife ! Its a great product and it works to keep you full , lose weight , and feel great at the same time . The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because the products are pretty expensive !! Wish that would be different : -LRB-
 This is the second time I have been on the herbalife diet . The first time was great , I lost weight , lost inches , and I felt great . This second time , I have n't been doing it very long this time , but I already feel better and feel like I lost weight . I wanted to go back on the herbalife diet , not just because of past exprience , but becuse the products are more natural . I considered using other dietary suppliments , but was uncomfortable with the idea of their ingredients.This shake is best used with other shapeworks products like the multivitamin and the cell activator . the shakes taste good too . You just mix two scoops of it with 8oz of milk -LRB- i also add 2-3 ice cubes in a blender -RRB- and enjoy . You can have one shake a day for weight management or two shakes a day for weight loss . As a meal replacement , the shakes do n't completly fill you up , but definatly do n't leave you hungry .
 This one of the better meal replacement drinks that I have tried and simply replacing one meal a day with this shake has helped me lose 20 pounds over the last 6 months . It 's best to blend it with ice and fruit . This product is not usually sold mass market , but it 's about time that it was .
 I was hesitant to try this product because I HATE the taste of other weight loss shakes , but this actually tastes really good . I 've been using the fomula 1 shake twice a day for two weeks and I 've lost 10 pounds already . I do n't expect to lost 10 pounds every two weeks , but it is a great start ! I also feel really good . I have more energy . I am going to keep using it!Also , to the guy who is so mad that it is being sold on Amazon
 The cookies and cream flavor of this product is DEEEEEEEEEEElicious , if it 's not the best flavor , I do n't know what is . Every day I look forward to drinking this twice a day and lose the weight . I 'm not hungry most of the day and I live an active lifestyle . If you 're just starting this program , start with this shake !
 I 've been on the Herbalife nutritional supplements for about 3 months now and while i am probably an extreme case due to the amount of exercise i regimented myself to ; i firmly believe that Herbalife helped my body to lose over 35 lbs since the beginning of the year . After completely revamping my nutrition and exercise schedule , i take great pride in the weight i 've lost . I know it is an expensive product but if you are serious about losing weight , and promoting a healthier lifestyle i stand by the product through and through.It 's not going to be easy , losing weight is slow and tedious and a culmination of good daily decisions to eat right and exercise . I , for example ; ran for 45 minutes a day 5 days a week for a month -LRB- and continue to do so 3-5 days a week -RRB- , while also cutting out ALL FAST FOOD , SODAS and Alcohol . After the first month of sacrifice , I 've since returned to having 1-2 drinks a weekend but thats just because i love my booze ! =-RRB- 4 Small Meals a day of high protein and 1 colorful balanced meal of healthy veggies , carbs and lean protein -LRB- chicken or fish -RRB- and i was on my way . I 'd love to help anyone else that is interested and dedicated to changing their life like i did ! Thank you Herbalife !
 I bought recently this product and I think that it is a wonderful way for improve your health because it helps to reduce your high triglyceride and cholesterol levels . Of course you must to do some excercise regularly too .

 Did wonderful . Really helps the body , very healthy easy to mix up helps people with restricted diets . Very good .
 I 've lost 10 inches already lots of energy and just feel so much better over all . I would recommend to anyone wanting to lose weight .
 Formula arrived very fast . I love this product ! I love to add peanut butter and banana to my shakes ... yum!Really does curb my appetite .
 I am so happy to get the product so fast way out here in Afghanistan . Thanks for the all your support for us out here in the War Zone fo southern Afghanistan !!!!
 I am the pickest eater ! I love these shakes and they work I take it with their multi-vitamin , cell activator , personalized protein powder , and total control . I do not like taking pills so I just blend in the multi-vitamin , protein and total control . I take the cell activator by mouth because it leaves a peppery taste in the shake . I 'm super sensitive to caffeine so I only mix Total Control into my morning shake . If I take more than one Total Control my heart races like crazy and I feel anxious.I feel great and have energy ! These meal replacements fit into my busy lifestyle so well . Which is why I started because I never have time to eat breakfast or lunch which causes my metabolism to crash at least now I 'm doing something healthy and my metabolism is in a better place than it was ! My son always begs to drink my shake so now I have to buy him the kids shakes .
 I would definetely buy from this seller again , prices were reasonable and not too expensive my mom and myself would definetely buy from MaxNutricion again . We placed our order on Wednesday and got it by Friday very well packaged , we will definetly recommend you to some of our friends who are also doing the diet .
 When I was placing an order a system was updating causing an error -LRB- quantity -RRB- on the web site . I did contact a seller after receiving my order and within a few hours I got an email back . Next day I did receive another email with an information that they shipped additional case . I am very pleased how the Customer Service solved this issue . Also shipping was very fast . Quality of product is very good too . Markers have fine yet soft tip -LRB- very good for drawing on the skin -RRB- . I will definitely come back for shopping to this seller .
 And now a word from David Lynch , as spoken by Dean Stockwell as Doctor Yueh in DUNE
 It this item on the recall list ? I could n't find out elsewhere?Thank You .
 So , I 'm on Atkins , and some days I feel a bit tired . I was half-assing the `` take your vitamins '' rule , but after browsing a local hippie shop I decided to pick up a small bottle of these ... Normally I do n't feel much of a boost from vitamins , unless they are packaged with a horrible amount of caffeine.These ... are killer ! I took them at night , and woke up feeling great . I am usually a zombie in the morning , so it was extremely odd , and refreshing . I was n't expecting to feel any different after only 3 tablets , but wow ! Total energy boost.Very mild taste for a multi-vitamin too . Certainly worth a try if you feel like spending a bit more for multi-vitamin .
 I gave this vitamin a try . I do n't feel tired at all it definately gives you a boost . I do wish they could make the pill a smidge smaller they are quite big in my opinion .
 I have been taking this vitamin for over 15 years ... I tried other brands here and there ... nothing , and I mean NOTHING compares with this super food.Energy , great immune system booster , feeling of well being , sharpness of the mind and all the anti-oxidants ... fantastic product ... !
 I have been using this product for several years now and you can really feel the difference in your energy and health . Just read the label and you can tell its excellent stuff . Start with one pill during a meal and work your way up to three a day . It is especially good to use when you are stressed out and tired .
 i do a lot of back packing , weeks to months on end . food supply is limited , we pack , fish & hunt when we can but sooner or later it will be just u , jar of peanut butter and these . check the supplment facts , lots of good stuff . because they have whole foods , herbs , enzymes . they wont hurt ur stomach when food supplies run low . they do help with energy but more importent . the keep u alive . i take them daily .
 This supplement really works for me . It increased my stamina as I had read about it in other reputable , medical publications . I 'm on it to stay . Also , other benefits of this supplement is that it relaxes your blood vessels and results in decreased blood pressure - my blood pressure is now well within the normal limits - which I believe is partly due to taking this Arginine supplement . I highly recommend this product to adults .
 This Arginine product by Jarrow works better than other Arginine products that I have tried . It seems to lower my blood pressure and helps when I am doing my weight exercises push out a couple more reps than I used to be able to do .
 When it comes to reviewing supplements , it comes down to the trust with the manufacturer and the price . Since the apparent usefulness is mostly marginal or sometimes even non-existent , you 've got to go with the manufacturer 's reputation because of the lack of FDA supervision . Jarrow is among the better supplement companies based on the past history of random tests published.I had no adverse effects using this supplement . How much benefit did I get ? That 's harder to answer without a long running experimentation .
 Arginine gives me huge pumps in the gym.I recommend this product to all gym goers and those looking for some strength gains
 After reading reviews on this item and seeing that the manufacturer has a great reputation in the field I opted to buy this one over the others out there . Plus the price was the lowest .
 I have been feeling pretty bloated and had/have immense belly fat , and I read an article about how those who have hypothyroid problems would benefit from taking on amino acids . Have only been doing it for about a month and I must say I have been seeing a change in the belly fat -LRB- before it never budged no matter WHAT I did -RRB- and my energy level has improved .
 I think these are great quality and a very good price compared to what is available locally . I will be reordering if they are in stock
 I can not find a way to know if this really is a good product or not . . The bottle looks good and that is about all I can say . . Guess time will tell ... . I had to trust the experts on this one !
 I ordered this product for my husband who has hypertension . A friend recommended L-Arginine to help bring his pressure within range . We read the many comments about this product and decided this was the one . We have not been disappointed .
 This is the first purchase of Jarrow products for me . So far , I am pleasantly impressed with the quality and price .
 &#34; Takes away muscle aches the day after by releasing the toxins that build up while working out &#34; according to my Brother In Law . He 's right !
 Great add to any lifters diet . Taste fine and convenient in the 1000 mg form . Combine this with a lot of protein and you 'll see great results .
 I rate this product as excellent . I bought Jarrow ia a good brand and it has been in the market for long time
 I 've been taking one tablet twice daily now for two weeks and have experienced a better pump during my workouts . Also i have seen a measurable increase in my arm size by 1/4 &#34; in that time span . A little water retention has also been noticed . The quality and price of this product make this a smart choice .
 I initially bought it to add some wow factor to an no2 supplement i was taking , but when i used them both i was overwhelmed and jittery . I thought maybe the arginine made the no2 supplement work better , but not at all . The arginine was doing most of the work and giving me a mega pump . The no2 supplement was that cost a bout 4 times as much ... Tsk tsk tsk .
 we never need these - but they are cheap and a good item for the bog out bag or vehicle .
 These batteries last forever in my Sony Voice Recorder !!! I havent used them for anything else .
 Excellent Product Looked just like the picture It was AAA Batteries brand new and Have been working fine and last a rather long time : -RRB-
 Miracle Greens are amazing . I love this product and tell all of my friends and family about it . From the organic products contained within to the reasonable price I am a true fan .
 If you want to have all the fruits and vegetables servings that its need it daily this is what you need to buy . The taste is nice and sweet , I usually mixed the miracle greens with the miracle reds and is delish .
 I feel a lot better after adding this to my routine . I got this stuff in October and do n't drink it everyday but have yet to get sick this season and I typically have a terrible immune system ... I mix it with 1 cup unsweetened almond milk and half a scoop of metrx protein powder along with another half a cup of water . The protein powder and greens mix well and taste delicious !
 Thank you very much ! I Recommend mixing this with apple juice , mango , banana and ice . Almond milk and banana is good too . I do n't recommend it with berries , although the Macro reds might go well with them . Purchase a personal blender and your good to go !
 I 'm not a serious Macro-dieter , but I was looking for something healthy and nutritious to mix with water or a smoothie in the morning for breakfast . I bought this in conjunction with some whey protien and Miracle Reds , and I have a shake mixed with 12 oz of milk every morning . The shake leaves me full until at least 1PM , I feel great , and I can tell the greens are making digestion easier ... Believe it or not , I even like the taste ! I 'm a convert , I 'll be back for more Miracle Greens for sure !
 I 've been taking this product twice a day for years , as it pushed my ulcerative colitis into 90 % remission and my symptoms have never been as bad since.I should point out that the individual packets seem stronger and more potent than the bulk supply . One tablespoon of the bulk should equal one packet , but I 'm not quite finding this to be the case . Hence only 4 stars .
 Miracle Greens is a tolerable tasting formula , & is a great addition to a diet that is lacking in green vegetables , It also contains Spirulina & a great fiber complex which helps digestion . I drink one glass every morning & I do feel a little bit more energy through out the day !
 For any product to actually make a difference in my physical well-being , I most certainly feel I owe a review . The actual ingredients would be good for anyone , but particularly helpful for one with low energy problems and difficulty eating all the fruit and vegetable servings recommended in our Food Pyramid -LRB- which I DO believe in -RRB- . Also I am super caffeine sensitive and was relieved that the small amount of it in the green tea component did n't phase me in the least , i.e. no shakes . In total I simply have more energy that feels organic and am also calm because I feel better !
 I have been drinking this product for over a year on and off . I really enjoy the benefits to drinking it . The time i have n't been drinking it is just the times when i run out and do n't get more for a while . The taste is awful , probably one of the worst things i have ever had to drink . There is no sweetness in this product , although , I have gotten used to slamming it down . This is an awesome product for those of us who do not eat enough veggies . It taste AWFUL , but works AWESOME !! I have no intentions of stopping the use of this product due to the flavor and I would recommend it to anyone !
 Excellent product . Believe it or not , it actually tastes pretty good , even though they suggest taking it with apple juice - it actually has a sweetness of it 's own . To me , it 's the BEST green drink product on the market .
 My holistic doctor prescribes greens powder often . This is the one he prescribes most often.Others often taste like garden dirt , but this tastes pretty good . It is also a a greatly reducedprice and the same product . I 'm glad I found it online .
 Over the past two years I have been using several different green food products to try to find one that has a reasonable taste and seems to satisfy my physical needs . At age 70 those needs are many . After approximately two rounds of trying , it is Miracle Greens that has been most consistant in good taste and at the same time satisfying many of the needs I have for feeling better in general .
 It 's tough to eat the daily recommended amount of veggies ! This type of supplement is the answer for me . I also mix this product with mighty greens from wheatgrass.com along with the micro reds . Before I used to just take vitamins and still get sick twice a year ... Since I 've been doing the greens , I hav n't been sick ... We are talking 6 years ! ... Now I can use all my sick days as vacation days ... It 's worth the investment ... As an old guy told me when I was in my twenties
 For excellent taste , wide spectrum of quality ingredients -LRB- many ingredients are Organic -RRB- and pricepoint , I always choose the 30 oz . size -LRB- 90 day supply -RRB- of Macro Greens . I purchase it from Amazon for an average price of about $ 55 with free shipping . To do the best that I am able to under my circumstance , I -LRB- gasp ! -RRB- blend it with another powdered green food -LRB- Green Max from Swanson Health , 10.6 oz for $ 11.99 + shipping -RRB- . This works well for me . I enjoy quantity , quality and taste all within my budget .
 I love miracle greens . I 've been putting it in my smoothies for about a month straight now , and I really notice a difference . I have more energy , my hair is thicker and shinier , my nails are thicker . This may also be attributed to my overall healthier diet as of late but I 'm sticking to the macro greens powder ! I also use miracle reds daily , both are great products .
 I was buying the small tubs of the greens and reds and decided to look for a larger amount because I kept running out and was spending 3 times as much as buying the large tubs . I 'm so grateful that I can drink my greens and reds . I tend not to eat enough of either . Now I can stop stressing about it . Thank you for producing such a wonderful , healthy , nourishing , and tasty drink . Half an apple , half a banana , 1 cup plain soy milk , one scoop of each of the red and green and I 'm set for the day . Ahhhh , so good . I can feel the health flowing in to my body .
 I mix it with plain water , and actually crave my daily doses because it tastes so good . Slightly sweet , and full of tasty , nutricious greens ... this is the only supergreens supplement to try . I have more energy and balance , and it also helps curb hunger pangs . Worth every penny .
 I go through 5 of these per year . Very effective as long as this vendor keeps the price down . Quick shipping .
 I put this in my almond milk for a pick up after my workouts ! Tasty and keeps me going .
 I have purchased this at Whole Foods in the past but when I saw the pricing here I jumped on it . No it is not inexpensive , but when you read the label and the array of superfoods , probiotics , enzymes and more , and realize it lasts you 90 days if you use daily it 's a bargain.One 's health is priceless , and in these times where so much of our food supply is suspect , to have something to add like these greens , makes one feel the immune system is getting extra protection and fortification.It had been awhile since I 've taken it , but when I had two scoops in my smoothie yesterday -LRB- which also consisted of carrots , aloe juice , a little whey , and a few drops of Lugol 's solution -RRB- , I felt really sustained smooth energy all day , and no ` munchies ' , I feel it really kept my appetite in check.I have experienced that when one is really fulfilling the body 's needs , nutrient wise , that appetite for empty calories really goes down . I 'm going to keep taking this and hope to enjoy the energy benefits and a reduced waistline .
 I started using the Miracle Greens and Reds about two months ago . My psoriasis on my knees and elbows has gone away . I had a small growth on my temple doctor said was non-cancer not to worry and it is gone . I feel so so much better , stronger , more energy and I am positive my immune system is crazy better . Psoriasis is an immune system disease . I was on 3 meds for psoriatic arthritis , ankle would swell up , and it went away and I no longer have to take anything but a anti-inflammatory . Amazing products . I mix this with Muscle Milk Lite Vanilla Cream for a breakfast shake . Makes this product taste yummy . Do n't think about it just buy it and take it religiously.J .
 I 'm giving 4 stars because the taste is not good . It 's like you are drinking a collard juice if you mix with water.I mix with the miracle red which taste better
 Love this product . This is my second purchase of Miracle Greens 30oz . Having tried at least three other products I can say that this is by far the best of the group ... mixes easily , the taste is mild or non-existent mixed into a smoothie , is GF and certified organic . Here is the recipe for my favorite smoothie :1 Cup of Almond Milk1 Scoop of Miracle Greens1 Scoop of Miracle Reds1 Scoop of Bioplex WPI -LRB- Whey Protein -RRB- 1 Tb Fit Flax1 Tb Fish Oil or Flax Oil1 Cup or more of Fresh-Frozen Strawberries -LRB- or other fruit -RRB- Mix in a Vitamix or blender and enjoy.Have one of these in the morning and you 'll start the day out with the nutrient equivalent of 5 servings of vegetables and 5 servings of fruits and berries from the Miracle products alone.Read the label . If you like the idea of ` real ' food supplementation over vitamin pills , I highly recommend this product .
 I have been enjoying Macro Greens for over 2 yrs now . It is perfect when I am doing a liquid fast as well as everyday use . I have tried blending it with many different liquids and have found that coconut water works the best for me . I also enjoy the Macro Reds .
 I definitely do not get all of the vegetables that I need in a day , and in fact right now , I am not getting any . I was advised to incorporate the Macro Greens , as well as the Micro Reds , while I am on the Almased Very Low Calorie Diet . I admit I am a drama queen where it comes to taste and texture , and this was not very enjoyable for me , though I admit it was better mixing it with half sugar free apple juice . I emailed the Macro Greens company , and discovered that while they do not offer it directly , it is possible to take it in capsule form . So ... I purchased the `` 00 '' size vegetable capsules , and The Capsule Machine , both here on Amazon , and I made a capsule form . One tablespoon of the powder equals approximately 10 capsules . Which may sound like a lot , but broken up throughout the day , really is n't bad at all . I have been taking them for about a week now , and already have a noticeable increase in energy , my skin looks brighter , my hair feels healthier . I love this product . And highly recommend it to everyone.The Capsule Machine , To fill `` 00 '' size capsulesNow Foods Veg-Capsules Double `` 00 '' Empty Capsules , 250-Count
 This product tastes great with milk ! I never thought it would taste as good as it does . If I had to compare the taste , the closest thing would be an ensure shake . I recommend mixing this product with a protein shake . It really makes the protein shake taste much better .
 I 've been using this product for about a year . Its hard to get all your greens in one day but not with Macrogreens ! I mix it in my water bottle every morning . The taste does not bother me . If you put it in a smoothie , you ca n't even taste it . This stuff makes me feel energized and healthy . Some of the other green powder products have that `` scratchy '' feeling when you drink it . This does not . I love it !!!
 I have been using this product along with the Red and have gotten great results from it . It takes great in any juice - no problem for me at all . I put a scoop of green and red along with a packet of B-12 in 1/2 bottle of vitamin water every morning . I have not gotten sick , have more energy and just plain feel better . I will not stop using this product !!!
 I stopped drinking green juices because of the fruit content and switched to miracle greens with my protein shake . Wow , this stuff is a great wake-up in the morning . Its become part of my daily routine for getting my vegies , minerals and greens .
 I 've been using this product for over 1 year , my skin is healthier and younger looking , and I 'm able to get the benefit of green vegetables without eating fresh greens every single day .
 My wife & I have taken this product for over 10 years-everyday ; sometimes twice a day . Its amazing and everyone I 've turned on to Miracle/Macro Greens has loved it.I usually by at Ralph 's in LA , CA but this value from Amazon is too good to pass up . Its a 3 month supply for the price of 2 -LRB- although the month never stretches as long as you 'd think -RRB- . Between my wife & I , we 'll blow through a 1 month supply in about 3 weeks . enjoy !
 I really like this product . I have been using it daily for about 3 years . It is one of the best tasting green drinks on the market . Do n't be fooled though . These things are never going to taste as good as the types of drinks people normally drink . This is a health product and does its job with minimal pain .
 This stuff is great , I feel better than I have in years , and my skin is simply radiant . I recommend this to anyone who worries about not eating right or not getting all of your necessary nutrients from what you eat .
 This tastes great and is the easiest way to get something of this high quality into your diet . Great for those who do n't have the ability to cart around fresh veggies all day or do n't have the time . I love it for those reasons personally , and love that it helps me get nutrient-rich veggies into the diet of my `` veggie haters '' . Even the fiercest vegetable haters do n't know they are having it when I mix it with a little cherry juice and yogurt for a smoothie with a secret . ; -RRB-
 I started using this product from a local health food store . Buying from Amazon saved me lots ! Micacle Greens has proven to be exactly what I needed in my diet as I do n't always get enough vegs . and fruits in my diet . I feel more energetic , skin looks great , and I 'm more regular -LRB- sorry ! -RRB- . I even shared some of my large container with 2 friends who are now going to order their own becuase they saw the same results .
 My wife started me on this product over a year ago and I have been taking it everyday since . I had tried a few different products that didnt contain the right combinations of herbs and foods that fortify and alkalize the body like MACRO GREENS . Medical Research has showed that a acidic body is a breeding ground for dis-ease and maintaining an alkaline body through a consumption of fresh raw fuits and vegetables daily help along with positive mental outlook in being healthy.I am a 43 years old male and I went for my yearly physical in March 2007 , and my doctor wanted to know what I was doing because I didnt have high blood pressure , high sugar or prostate/impotent problems and I know supplementing with MACRO GREENS has helped tremedously.If you are looking for a truly all natural high nutrient alkalizing product - I recommend using MACRO GREENS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 No more constipation !!!!!! This green powder is the only stuff that actually helped me and saved me in this issue . I can tell my body loves this green powder ! I 'll keep taking this product so do n't stop making it !! Thanks ! : -RRB-
 Miracle Greens -LRB- aka Macro Greens -RRB- is as good as it claims to be . While taking it and exercising -LRB- walking -RRB- regularly , I lowered my cholesterol and lost the weight I needed to lose . I will continue to use it because it 's probably the only way I 'm going to get any vegetables into my body . I did n't give it 5 stars because of the taste . I HAVE to mix it with juice -LRB- I prefer sweet tastes -RRB- .
 I have not been sick ever since I started to use this product . It gives me energy . I take 2 scoops per day in a fruit smoothie I make every day or just mix it with water and ice . I noticed a difference in my body and I 'm addicted now !
 How to best mix Miracle Green/Red ? A blender?When I use a whisk or a spoon -LRB- the instructionssay
 I really like these bottles , they work great just wish they were a bit bigger . The filter part is really cool . You never know where you might be and not have filtered water around .
 I always get confused though because the product I get has a green lid . But otherwise the product is great .
 I expected this to taste awful like all the other `` so called '' green antioxidants . I was surprised , it is not bad at all . I even started using some Stevia Root Beer or Vanilla drops in with it . Have only used it a couple of days so really ca n't say yet if I feel a difference with it yet .
 Delicious , especially mixed with a touch of organic apple juice . A bit pricey , but then , all of these supergreens products are . This has become my breakfast substitute , along with a piece of fruit , and it 's working out fine for me .
 I drink this in red grape juice and water every day-yummy !! It makes me feel great and I have not gotten sick this winter YET ! Last winter I did n't get sick either . Awesome stuff .
 If you do n't eat all your servings of fruits and vegetables everyday , Miracle Greens is great . I even like the taste . I mix it in water in the morning with a tablespoon of fiber .
 I LOVE this product and the best prices are found here at Amazon.Not only does it keep me regular , but since my husband and I started it - we have n't been sick - we stopped once and got sick !!
 One of Amazon 's suppliers is selling this for fifty three bucks , an excellent deal compared to what I can find locally . I love this supplement . It 's not for weight loss , but getting a full spectrum of vitamins and trace minerals seems to reduce my food cravings -LRB- wanting a sugary snack in the afternoon , for example -RRB- . Also boosts my mood . This and a multi-vitamin are the only supplements I take .
 Five servings of vegetables in a scoop . WOW ! I read that several times to make sure it was right ! I put one scoop in a twelve ounce smoothie and I can barely taste it . It is so high in nutrition . In this era that we live in with the depleted food values . Who ca n't use a superfood ?
 Great supplement ! I notice a difference in myself when I do not take it .
 So I was looking for a product that had Barley Grass in it . Macro Greens has some of the most of this ingredient in it . I had tried some other product that had a berry flavor added to it , and it was awful , but Macro Greens has no extra flavor added to it so it mixes well with anything . I would suggest mixing it with a protein mix of some sort . The first time I used this product I got a little tingle on or in my skin , just weird at that . The weirdest thing that happen was by the time I got to work , it seemed that my nose got affected . I could smell all kinds of things , like when someone walked by with perfume , even after a minute I could tell it was in the air yet . I even went over to one of my co-works and complained of someones way to strong perfume , and he did not even seem to smell it , but I could and i ended up walk away for a bit till she left . The big surprise was lunch time , when I could tell just about every ingredient that was in each of my friends different lunches just by smelling it . Very weird affect from this product , and even weeks later it 's still the same . Anyway I think this product is great and I am just glad to know that i get my Greens every day , and feel health .
 and so do my kids . Thanks for another great green drink that my children actually enjoy drinking . I will be purchasing this product again : -RRB-
 I would recommend this product to anyone that is not eating the required vegetables & fruits per day . I was lucky to eat 2 or 3 per week , now I am eating much better because of this Macro Greens Super Food Supplement . I will never stop because I am feeling so much better & @ 70 years of age that is a good thing !
 Great product ! best tasting &#34; greens &#34; out there . I make a smoothie everyday with a banana , almond milk -LRB- chocolate is best ! -RRB- , ice and a scoop of macro greens . Keeps me healthy .
 I 've been using macro greens for years and find that is the best green powder product ! Gives me energy plus all the healthy benefits .
 For quite a while now I 've been using two products called &#34; Green Vibrance &#34; and another called &#34; Miracle Reds &#34; , both of which are superb products . I decided to give this a try . Its very good and if you look at the product information , what it really is , is a combination of the other two I mentioned . Both greens and reds . So if you are running late , this one product will do it all . Try it , you wo n't be disappointed .
 A friend recommended this to me and I am so glad she did ! I add a 1-2 tablespoons to my Arbonne chocolate shakes .
 This product tastes great . Its a little grainy but for anyone else who is very into health and nutrition products , its not abig deal at all . It tastes even better mixed in with the naked drink product ! also the 30oz is the better deal
 As long as you do n't mind a little gritty texture there really are n't any issues with this product . I like it fine with water but it tastes pretty good with different juices . I like to drink it in the morning to feel like I 'm nourishing my body when I have to wait a while until I get to eat food . I just put a scoop in my blender bottle with slightly watered down juice and I 'm good to go first thing in the morning.Good for busy people on the go or anyone that just wants a little boost.When I run out I will repurchase .
 I love this product , I just add 4 oz of distilled water and 4 oz of Diet Cran-Grape and my body getts it 's vitties so much faster than taking a pill . Would also recommend Miracle Reds . I have also noticed more energy and my skin looks flawless .
 I get this product every winter just to keep up my greens ! This will be my 4th winter using this product , I have 4 years cold free . I do n't know if Miracle greens is the reason , but I 'm not willing to give it up .
 If your like me and a health nut but do n't always have the time to eat your fruits and veggies this product will do the trick superbly ! My roommate recommended this to me when he said his sister recommended it to him when she was trying to get pregnant . I do feel good after taking it with my protein shake ; however , I 'd recommend mixing it with something strong tasting like OJ or a protein shake because it has a very ummm `` unique '' taste . Still a winner in my book though!UPDATE !!! I am on my second canister and I have to say that all the positive reviews about it boosting your immune system are 100 % true !!! Lately a mass flu has been going around my workplace and the less than considerate folks have made every attempt at spreading their viruses by not covering their mouth when coughing . I am one of the few who have withstood the flu storm and there is no doubt in my mind it 's because this product !
 This is a great product ! I have been taking a scoop full a day for approximately 4 months and have increased energy and like the fact that I consume most of my daily input for vegetables in just one scoop . I recommend this product to everyone who wants to enhance their overall well-being !!!
 I started using Miracle Greens in June of 2005 . I was tired , frequently experienced URI 's , including sinus infections , and had no stamina . Now it is nearly December . I have lost 10 # , without really trying to -LRB- but then I have a lot to lose -RRB- , have had no sinus infections , colds , or flu . I use Miracle Greens as my breakfast 5 days a week . I mix MG with milk , juice and frozen fruit for a `` smoothie '' . I am surprised at how well it satisfies me . I also relax a bit realizing that if my eating does n't go well the rest of the day , I have at least started with a good dose of `` vegetables & fruits . '' I am very pleased with the product and do n't tend to be one who `` sticks with '' supplements . This is one , however , on which I am SOLD !
 I ordered this product -LRB- 30 oz size -RRB- from DAB Nutrition . They had the lowest total cost after shipping . I first tried Miracle Greens from a place called Grocery Outlet . They had a 10 ounce size for $ 19.95 without tax . I really like the ease of getting your fruits and vegetables in a small scoup . The taste is pretty good -LRB- for something thats supposed to be good for you ... usually yuk yuk -RRB- and it mixes well with juice . I mix it with a JUICY JUICE 6.75 0z juice box.At less than 70 cents a serving , where else do you blow your money ? This is well worth the cost . Unless you put a less than a 70 cents price tag on your health and well being ?? I 'm glad I found this on AMAZON at this great price . Search around on other sites and you 'll waste your time with price -LRB- after shipping -RRB- . So if you do n't want to throw down 1/2 a dozen fruits and veggies -LRB- and deal with the spoilage keeping it in the kitchen -RRB- , this is the product for you . It will give you a boost and balance in your health.PEACE & LOVE ~ Koji
 I highly recommed this product . I , and a few of my close friends , have been using for about 2 years now and have yet to have even a cold ! It is noted for being rich in its ' vitamin and nutrient content . On a personal note - I also recommend the `` Miracle Reds '' . When used in conjunction w/each other , they are wonderful !
 I am a grad student with little income and not big on cooking . I do work out regularly but my diet is not the best -LRB- I definitely do n't get the right amount of fruits and vegetables every day from what I eat -RRB- . I started taking this product a few months ago -LRB- in combination with a protein/vitamin B complex orange flavored syrup and fruit juices - non citrus , plus 3oz of Aloe vera gel -RRB- ... I 've been feeling great , rarely get a cold -LRB- if I do it lasts shorter , and my heartburn is gone , that is thanks to the nasty-tasting Aloe I get separately -RRB- . I do feel you have to take it everyday to feel the benefits -LRB- once a day is enough for me -RRB- . This is definitely NOT a meal replacement for those trying to loose weight . I have tasted other green powder products and this is undoubtedly the best according to my taste buds . -LRB- Flavor tip
 I started using this product a few days ago , and my energy has gone through the roof and a lot of my cravings for ` bad ' food are out the window . After the late shift at work , my first instinct is to go right to the fast food places and order hamburgers and fries . By using this stuff , it is easier to resist those cravings as before it was harder . Kind of like the nicorette for the food industry in avoiding cravings for fast food and garbagy foods . I hope to lose a lot of weight on this and am content in knowing that I am getting my optimal servings of veggies and fruits whereas , before I was getting about two servings a day , and that was mostly from fruit and not veggies . I need less sleep , and feel much healthier .
 Miracle Greens-Nutrient-Rich Super Food Supplement , 30ozMiracle Greens
 I love Miracle Greens and I swear by it . . It 's an amazing product . I have searched for powder supplements for years and have tried so many but Miracle Greens by far has the most and best ingredients I 've seen in any food supplement . It surpasses the nutritional amount of five servings of fruits and vegetables . WOW ... It 's fantastic !!! I always notice a difference in skin , hair , nails and appearance when I take Miracle Greens and Miracle Reds , especially when I take them together .
 I like this product very much . I seem to have alot of extra energy and just feel good during the day . I would not hesitate to recommend this product to anyone who is interested . I do n't have to worry if I miss some of my vegetables daily because I get it with Miracle Green . It also tastes great too .
 I think if my shoes were n't already stinkified I 'd probably have better results . I 'll get new shoes soon - but I think this stuff actually works pretty good . phew ! I was about ready to cut off my feet ! ; -RRB-
 I have used this product before and bought it in a whole food type of place that no longer carries it -LRB- a few years ago -RRB- . I decided to reorder as it really works . I work all day long and then have a 2nd job and my shoes are on all day . I have sweaty feet and it is a recipe for disaster . . This product is excellent and it works great . Just one dab will do yah . . The cream is so thick you just need a smidgen of an amount for both feet to apply to the balls of the feet and the toes . It will keep your feet smelling fresh all day , nylons and all . I bought this product in April and am just reordering it now . . You only have to use it once a week or every 10 days . My feet feel dry and refreshed with this product . It is totally worth every cent .
 Lavilin cream is amazing . I have been trying different products for years in order to control foot odor and wetness . This is the first product I 've ever found that really works . My socks used to be soaked at the end of a work day - no more . It 's simple to use . I noticed the difference from the first time I applied the cream . I immediately bought more and sent some to my son . I only wish I had heard of this cream years ago .
 It feels so good to have dry feet ! Highly recommend and wish I would have found this product years ago .
 My 13 year old son 's feet smelled so awful . When he took his shoes off and left them in a room , the whole would stink . I tried drying his shoes out with a dehumidifier , washing his feet twice a day - no luck.Got the cream , had him wash his feet , then put it on that night . The next day when home from school on the couch w/no shoes , I was amazed . I actually put his foot to my nose - no odor at all . I asked him to do the same - he was amazed too.This stuff works .
 ok this stuff works better then u can imagine , it will kill foot odor , i would bet a months pay on it
 I ordered the product from footsmart and never received it . I had to get the product from another vendor.The product is what the description says it is and that is great . The seller is the worse online retailer I have encountered to date.Vendor claims 6-10 days shipping time on what should be 2-4 days via USPS First Class Mail . Since I never received the product , I do n't know what shipping method the vendor used , but the shipment could not be tracked , so I assume they use third class , bulk rate postage . Not only did I not received the order , I had to buy the product from someplace else , I also have to wait until footsmart decides to issue a refund.Two words describe this vendor ... THEY SUCK !
 This natural deodorant really works , and lasts for days as advertised . I highly recommend it .
 Willow bark makes wonderful tea , but I have found more enjoyment of my coffee by adding just a tiny pinch to my grounds before brewing ; my aspirin a day , so to speak . Willow bark is exactly this , aspirin in its natural form rather than chemically assembled . It does not work as fast , but works longer and better ; IMHO . DO NOT USE this product for ingestion if you take blood thinners or have thin blood as you will begin to bruise easily and bleed when you would not normally ! ASK your doctor before using past a random cup of tea for stress relief or pain relief though it is probably a good idea to mention its use in any case . Regular usage comes with side-effects and these must be independently evaluated by each person as no two people react the same.My personal benefit :1 -RRB- Inflamation around the bouchard nodes on my finger joints have stopped being inflamed and have ceased to grow .2 -RRB- General mobility has increased due to lessening of pain in my joints .3 -RRB- My morning coffee tastes like coffee from 20 years ago in its great flavor .4 -RRB- It replaces formulated chemicals , aspirin , with naturally occuring chemicals .5 -RRB- My white head and chest hair began to turn brown again after 6 months of usage though it did not change my beard.A friends daily usage has her able to work up to 6 hour shifts after two months usage rather than the struggling to stay afoot after 3 hours previously.I will NOT guarentee this to be an alternative to anyone or that it will work for everyone the same way as these are my experiences and that of a friend as we share the orders . It also must be stated that I live in extreme pain as a disabled veteran and take no opiates or synthetics for pain . Willow bark coffee and tea do not alleviate this pain completely though it does make it more bearable at times .
 I cut hair and it goes everywhere ... . these broom picks up even the finest of hair ... and all my other dust and stuff too ...
 I have owned a Harper 118 Broom for the last 5 years and it has been so wonderful . Friends and family who have used it have always asked where I got it , wanting one for themselves . It was a gift and I never could find anywhere locally that sold Harper Brooms . We needed a new broom for our shop and another one for our basement that is finished with bamboo flooring so I began my search anew , hoping to find the elusive Harper 118 . I finally decided to try this one , the 108 , it 's different from the 118 in that the handle is hollow aluminum instead of wood but handier in that it has a hole to hang from . The bristles and sweeping are just as spectacular as the 118 we 've enjoyed for so long . I know it sounds silly to gush about a broom , but the typical brooms you find at big box stores are just absolutely AWFUL by comparison . If you want to experience a broom that does a really terrific job , give a Harper broom a shot ! I even LIKE sweeping up our schoolroom and playroom now . It 's wonderful , I 'm buying two more so we can have one on each level of our home -LRB- we 've tile and hard wood/bamboo flooring everywhere -RRB- . HIGHLY RECOMMEND !
 i like the size of the brush ... multiple bristle rows ... it works well on smooth floors . Much better than brooms found in retail stores.i recommend it !
 We bought two brooms for the kitchen hardwood floor.We tried many others over years but this brand is the best ever by far!You wo n't regret buying this one !
 Made in the USA ! Leaves nothing behind . I 'm glad I bought this broom . I clean houses for a living and this company will be featured in my next news letter to clients !
 This broom is great for tile floors . Bought one a couple of years ago and wore it out then bought another . They clean awesome and easily get the grout lines .
 I had the earlier version of the this broom and it still works well but not as well as it did when new so I bought the new one which is larger than my old broom but still a good size . Great for getting all the dirt . Only problem is that the handle has a tendency to unscrew itself . Will probably glue it soon if it continues . Otherwise one of the most efficient brooms made
 This is just the broom that I was looking for . I am from Germany and this is the type of broom that we use . It picks up the tiniestdust particles .
 This broom really does pick up dust and dirt better than any other broom I have ever owned . My only issue is I wish it was angled like a house hold broom , the straight block does n't seem as natural to use as the more traditional angled head .
 I had my last broom for 15 years . The Harper products are worth the money , and long lasting . Will order again
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 This thing is simple to setup and use.Overall , it did a good job making my apartment smell nice , but I would n't keep it on all the time as the odor can become overpowering -LRB- especially if the space you use it in is n't that well ventilated -RRB- . So I 'd recommend leaving it on for a few minutes , then turning off once the fragrance fills the space you 're using it in.However , I 'd avoid this thing if you 're really sensitive to fragrances -LRB- such as perfumes , cologne , etc -RRB- .
 Product came quickly and was exactly what I wanted . It 's a great product to use near litter boxes which is what I wanted it for .
 This one of the products I need to for a sassafras beer I was making ; So delivery was great and timely.Product was very good quality .

 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !

 I have been using Palmer 's Cocoa Butter cream twice a day for the last 6 months . I am 34 weeks pregnant right now , and still have no sign of stretch marks.The lotion is very thick and takes a while to absorb into my skin , but I could care less since it works so well !
 The cocoa butter worked well . And it did not have a smell , which is good.It would be nice to offer more sizes of containers .
 Muy buen producto se notan los resultados en cuestion de semana la compre para mi novia y a ella le ha encantando !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 the Product is great . I truly impressed with the results . I highly recommend this product . If you need that subtle boost throughout the day this product is for you

 This may work better in a small area but I have it set up on top of our rabbit hutch in large living room . You can smell it when u walk by it when fan is going , I like the citrus scent best so far and I tried outdoor scent as well . Wish they would make holiday scents for this or more scents in general , I tend to love warm rich scents , and these do n't seem to be very awesome ...
 I had purchased one of these in a store many years ago . I loved it and got many refills . However over the last few years I no longer saw them in my stores or the refills . So I was using the old bottles to refill with another kind of liquid oil . It just was not the same . Have purchased many things from Amazon and thought let 's see if they have these Oust fans and lo and behold they did . I purchased 4 of them and my house is once again smelling like it use to years ago . I just hope to be able to get the refills in the near future . I like that they are battery operated and I can take them into any room . If I do n't want the scent coming out I can easily turn them off for a few hours and turn it back on when I want them to cycle again . In my opinion well worth the purchase . Thanks Amazon so glad I found them again .
 My homeopathic MD recommended this product for acid reflux . I have been taking it for 7 years and never have a problem with acid reflux as long as I take one with every meal . I highly recommend this product instead of taking prescription meds for acid reflux .
 I had severe gas in my stomach for years . When I had blood tests done my protein , minerals and vitamin levels were all low . Within a week of taking this product the gas was gone and my blood levels were in the normal range . My doctor said to take between 1-4 per meal . Warning that I would know if I took too much because it would burn like acid-indigestion . She was right about this also . This product gas been a life-saver for me .
 This product helps with my IBS , it helps my intestines to digest the foods , I do n't have enough Pepsin in my stomach for proper digestion . One of the problems of IBS .
 This product along with other digestive enzymes really helps my system to absorb and break down my foods . I am now able to eat a normal diet .
 First , I these plugs are great , and I know , because I 've used plugs every night for a decade , and have used all shapes , sizes , materials , and price ranges . I also use them during the day at times to create some quiet for reading , work , or just QT . Nothing comes close to these except Flens cotton/wax -LRB- if you do n't mind the oily feel ; I love them at night -RRB- . And now that I 've put in a good plug for these plugs , click on the pricing and ask yourself who would pay more for 500 pair than for 600 pair -LRB- 3 sets of 200 pair , for the mathematically challenged -RRB- . The answer is that few would pay it -LRB- though Barnum said there is always one -RRB- . But the very presence of this `` option '' causes the price for 200 to appear relatively cheap -- a real bargain -- so more will buy them than if there had not been the pricier option.I was fascinated to read some of the psychology of marketing , and how we can be tricked into buying something we 'd not have been interested in otherwise . There are excellent examples in the book `` Predictable Irrational '' -LRB- eye-opening and fun book -RRB- . Such approaches work great with magazine subscriptions , from National Geographic to Harvard Business Review , and people spend small fortunes to get the `` freebie '' when we all know nothing is free.I do not , in the least , fault these sellers for their psychological tricks , because it is a great price , regardless . But as the economy tightens , marketers are getting savvier , so it pays to make sure we know the true value of a product , versus its price . Frustrating sometimes -- but fun if you take it as a challenge.Sweet dreams with these plugs ...
 When winter came this year , it caught me - and my lips - by surprise . But just a few days with LIP and it got much better ! It is noticeably better than most of the other lip balms I 've tried
 Having a Zeiss lens in front of my Sony Camera body ... I am quite picky about what touches my lens glass -LRB- obsessively so ... -RRB- . Having Bought Kodak lens cleaning tissues , I was incredibly dismayed at the smearing/scratching by this product ... My review of this product is posted on the net . Bad news ... Do n't go there ... In contrast , the Carl Zeiss lense cleaning tissues are insanely superb with respect to gentleness and cleanabilty . After gently cleaning the lense , the solvent evaporates leaving absolutely no residual residue ... it is as if I had just pulled the lenses from its original packing material ... I can not speak to the condition of the previous reviewers glasses ... probably needs his eyeglass prescriptions adjusted ... Any Photographer looking for premium lense cleansing tissues ... look no further ... this is the best I 've found ever ... My next dime is going to the Zeiss Vario Tessar 18 - 80mm lense at a whopping dime ... the only thing touching this lense is the Zeiss whipes ... Hope it helps and happy foto shooting ...
 The `` Zeiss Lens Cloths '' are just about the best and most convenient lens cleaner I have found . We use very high grade digital still and video cameras in our business and trust these cleaners to get the lenses clean without removing the protective coatings.We also wear glasses and these also work great on them as well , leaving no streaking at all.Recommended!CFH
 I am baffled by the bad reviews posted about these wipes . -LRB- ? -RRB- These wipes work perfectly.They work great on my glasses and my daughter 's , even though her 's get really dirty & even greasy.And they work great on our digital SLR camera.Plus , they are about half the price -LRB- or maybe less -RRB- than the Bausch & Lomb wipes!I can not understand why some people have such problems with them.I almost got the Bausch & Lomb wipes instead , even though they are about twice the price , because of some of the bad reviews.But I took a chance on these and I am delighted!Plus , I 'm not wasting money by paying about twice as much for the same thing ...
 Great price on large quantity . I use them on multiple surfaces . Just think through the expected usage you will have . Any such pad will eventually dry out , even sealed in the individual packets . Will surely remain perfect for at least a year . So much cheaper than in smaller packages most often found in drug stores !
 Love these wipes . I use them on my eyeglasses and camera lens . No residue , no lingering odor to irritate your eyes .
 My sister gave me one of these to clean my glasses . It worked wonders . Got off all film and dirt and made my glasses like new . Used them on my laptop , magnifying glass , loop , and cell phone . Would recommend highly .
 I use these wipes all the time to clean my glasses because I hate dirty glasses and they work wonderfully ! I love that they are in individual packages because it makes carrying them around so easy ! I always make sure I have some in my purse or travel bag . They always get my glasses streak-free clean when I use them and do not leave behind any lint ! I highly recommend them !
 I bought these to care for the lenses for my new camera but in just a few days time I already have discovered that they are also great with sunglasses/eyeglasses , small mirrors , and my computer screen . Yes , as everyone says , they dry out quickly but with a box of 200 opening a second wipe is not exactly going to ruin my day . The title says it all - spotless!Highly recommended !
 I , too , ca n't believe the bad reviews for this product ! I have been using Zeiss pre-moistened lens cleansing wipes for YEARS and they provide a fast , steak-free shine every single time . After cleaning my eyeglasses , I often use the rest of the `` juice '' that 's left in the cloth to wipe down my iPhone or clean my bathroom mirror.I have noticed that if you buy the wipes in bulk and it takes you quite a while to use them up -LRB- say , 1 year -RRB- , the last batch of wipes may be dryer -LRB- have less juice -RRB- and not clean quite as effectively . Now I buy only what my family can reasonably use up in a 3-4 month window . After all , why stockpile them ... they are available everywhere!And yes , I do know that I could save money by using a bottle of the lens cleaning solution and a clean , soft cloth . But in the morning , as I head out the door to work , convenience counts !
 The lens cleaning wipes in individual packets are very handy for cleaning the microscope in the office . No need to look for the fluid and a clean cloth for wiping the lenses !
 I use these wipes daily to clean my eyeglasses , iPod and cell phone . They are effective without being harsh . Leaves items streak-free and clean without scratching .
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 Be aware that a `` strap handle cover '' with this tray means a lid , not a sealed cover . This is a good product for the stainless steel feature .
 The instrument tray is quality stainless steel at a great price . It is the right size to sanitize my facial and waxing instruments and is exactly what I needed and expected . The tray arrived at my home quickly and in great condition .
 This flavor which is my favorite is no longer sold in my town . After trying cherry flavored I was not happy . I was thrilled to find this on amazon . Nothing is my experience takes sore throat pain away like this .
 I am just getting over strep and tried everything to take the blowtorch burn out of the back of my throat . Lozenges did n't cut it . My favorite herbal tea came close , but did n't last long and it was tough to swallow.Chloroseptic was what my pharmacist suggested . The spray does n't taste as good as the lozenges or the tea , but it offers the longest relief out of any of those options . And when you hurt , numbing the pain is what it 's really about.Rebecca Kyle , January 2009
 The replacement blades are for a razor I already own . The price was MUCH better than the local discount or drug store . I would reccomend this product .
 I have bought pretty much every type of razor , and always come back to this one . Love these blades , they 're gentle , last longer than others , and they WORK .
 These blades truly last a long time and they have conditioning strips and four blades . Reading magazines in the tub alerts me to all the personal care products I 'd love to try . This particular razor was featured with a few other razors and sounded like the ultimate razor for women . Well , it honestly is superior to anything I 've tried so far and it is the first four-blade razor to touch my legs.Yes , you really can skip a day here and there due to the supremely close shave . The smooth lime moisture strip helps the blades to slide gracefully over your most delicate skin and there are four tiny strips of wire over the blades that create a protective environment . The artistically designed fuchsia rubber grip on the metal handle -LRB- the weight is still light , but heavy enough to make it more stable -RRB- encourages precise control and it does n't slip out of your hand . The shower hanger is a true bonus and attaches easily to the shower wall with a suction cup.When you order the razor there is one razor , one shower hanger and an extra blade . The shower hanger is great for keeping the razor out of the way.Results
 I always get these razors , so of course I like the product ... the main reason for buying this particular one was the good deal . Ca n't beat the price for something you 're going to restock on often : - -RRB-
 These razors are the best . I bought one years and years ago and have NEVER bought anything else ! My husband had used a new blade once and then `` stoled '' have the blades for him , so now he has his own Schick quatro for men !
 Great for my skin , lousy for my wallet . I have tried Venus , Intuition , and a number of other pricey razors , and this is the one that 's my match . I know women who feel the opposite way , so try before you buy a large quantity . This keeps getting more expensive , so I 've tried new razors again , but I keep coming back to this.The blades last much , much longer on hair that 's < 1mm long . If I need to shave something longer and I have an older blade around , I 'll swap them . Longer hair takes forever to rinse out , and even then it seems to end the blade , so I keep this to legs and underarms only . It has no problem with corse , thick hair .
 Have used this product for several years , could only find in Health Food Stores and their prices get more expensive every year , so glad to find at Amazon cheaper than anywhere else .
 Twice as much psyllium husk as I get from the local Spr ** t 's Farmers Market and the unit cost -LRB- $ / oz -RRB- is much lower .
 Well what can you say about plain old psyllium fiber ? This stuff does wait it is supposed to . The only drawback is that you need to put it into a different container or zip-lok bag , since it comes is a regular non - resealable plastic bag .
 Works good . No flavor and no color , better than the ones mixed with sugar . Quick shipping . I have been buying this item for one year now and still continue to be satisfied .
 I bought the Psyllium Husk as an additional extract to add to my power shakes - my shakes include protein powder , flax seed , chia seed , and this Psyllium husk . It helps me fill up since I use my shakes as a meal replacement . In addition , it provides bulk and slows down travel time through your intestine which gives your body more time to absorb other nutrients in your food . This is good value for money compared to my local store and is a pure product .
 I mix this into my Whey protein shakes , and it works great . Much preferred over the name-brand label that adds sugar -LRB- sucrose -RRB- to their product.I also give it to my dog who 's always had constipation issues . I just add some water to it to make it into a cream-of-wheat type texture , and mix it in her food . She loves it , and it works great for her , too .
 Not much to say here , it 's Psyllium Husks and a great value with Subscribe and save . Just like the other stiff I 've bought in stores and on Amazon .
 I was looking for a dishwashing liquid that was not only easy on the environment but easy on me ! With as many dishes as I do a day , I did n't want to use a product with toxic ingredients like dyes and fragrances . And to learn that it is made with vegetable-based products rather than petroleum-based products made it all the better . In my opinion , it cleans just as well as any other dishwashing liquid I 've used !
 Great for washing dishes . I also use it in my hand soap dispensers . If you have MCS as I do , you will love this soap . No scent and it works . Jerry
 I was afriad using something that was `` better '' for our environment would n't work as good but I was wrong . The suds this soap makes with such a little dollop is amazing . Plus knowing it is n't harmful to our pets or our environment makes it a winner .
 A perfect dish soap that can be scented according toyour kitchen wishes . Cuts grease and cleans aseffectively as other less natural dish liquids .
 works just fine . it does like batteries but you can get them on amazon for only $ 2 so not that bad . . overall great purchase glad i got it !
 This is the first time I 've ordered this particular product online . We 've gotten it in the past through a friend who bought it from an ND . Anyway , the product in itself is fine ; however my experience with the seller was not.I decided to delete my initial feedback -LRB- due to the fact that my order FINALLY arrived a MONTH after the fact -RRB- . Since you can not re-enter your seller feedback , I thought I 'd mention it in my post.I placed my initial order on Sept. 4th ; the package was supposedly shipped -LRB- USPS -RRB- Sept. 8th . I was supposed to have received it by the 16th , however it NEVER came . I sent 2 emails to the company on the 22nd & 26th - with NO response . I then decided to submit an A-Z claim through Amazon on the 29th , to which I was reimbursed accordingly . Then TODAY I finally received my package in the mail . The outside of the box showed that it had been shipped a few days ago . Anyway , I notified Amazon this afternoon so that they can re-bill my account.In conclusion , I decided to give the seller 2 stars instead of 1 ; but in the future I will most likely look elsewhere to buy my D-3 . ** The ingredients for this formula has not been included on this page .

 I was looking for something to help boost my energy during workouts to help me complete my circuit/weight training . Na No Vapor really delivered in giving me that rush and endurance boost I . It feels like adrenalin and makes you feel like you have the energy to lift until your muscles give out . I have n't had any side effects using this product , except maybe when I use too much of it and feel like I want to run off a couple of miles AFTER my workout . Bottom line is that it works really well . -LRB- I enjoyed the WWF style description on the packaging . `` You 're not ready for this stuff ! Oh yeahhh ... '' lol -RRB-
 I bought this as kind of an after workout spalsh . Has a sort of citrus-y sporty sense of smell to it . Lacoste brand in general is great , ergo I support the cologne . Try it out , ca n't go wrong .
 Contrary to my previous feedback , and after receiving a very nice email from Wellhaven 's customer service department , this reacher 's claw does actually rotate , as stated in the description -LRB- the instructions that came with the reacher itself are not clear on how to make the ` claw ' rotate , and I did n't think to print the instructions as listed on the seller 's page ... I doubt most people would -RRB- . I originally ordered it to help me reach items stored on the upper shelves of my kitchen cabinets , but quickly discovered it 's versatility ... I have an adorable , ` free-range ' parakeet who likes to climb to the top of his cage , and toss his little toys off the edge ; often they end up either behind or under his oversized cage and stand , and the reacher has proved quite helpful in retrieving those toys that had been difficult for me to get . I just may have to order another one for the kitchen ... again !

 Iron Tek ` vanilla cake ' protein supplement is an affordable , versatile protein supplement with a more than decent taste - getting a bump of protein using water is quick and tasty , and when mixed with lean milk it is a great topper for bran flakes for a great snack with complex carbs , lean protein and high fiber.The ` vanilla cake ' flavor is good all by itself , but it allows you to add a teaspoon of chocolate or instant coffee for a change of pace.Even though a shake mixer works better than a spoon and cup , the mix is smooth and never gritty.Each spring at the Arnold Expo in Columbus Ohio , I pick up a huge variety of protein supplement samples , but when I have to spend my money on protein , I keep coming back to Iron Tek .
 Tastes very good and helps my workout recovery . Easy to mix and dissolves very well . Would recommend to anyone wanting a good protein supplement .
 I went looking for a protein powder as a supplement to my cycling workouts . Almost all the products out there have sucralose or other artificial sweeteners etc. -LRB- why would you want to eat those ? -RRB- - This one does n't . The ingredients on my container say Cane Juice . I have seen other reviewers say it contains Strevia but I do n't see that listed as an ingredient , so ??? This product tastes great . The container says to put it in a blender with ice . I do this , with a frozen banana , ice and some rice milk and blend for perhaps 90 seconds . What comes out is an amazingly thick , rich `` shake '' - highly recommended .
 This is great for when I do not want to prepare a good meal . Helps me skip the snacks and give my body some decent fuel .
 This protein powder has a good taste , and mixes well with my Blender Ball shaker cup . I bought the Banana Cream , and will probably by other flavors also , in the future .
 The best gluten-free protein shake . I mix this with frozen fruit and water for breakfast and it 's great !! The best breakfast .
 One of the best tasting proteins i 've had . Since it has slow absorbing casein in it , I like to make hot chocolate with it and drink it before bed .
 I 'm not sure why some of the reviews for this are so whiny . This stuff mixes pretty well , tastes ok , and is very inexpensive . I also like that it has stevia and no artificial sweeteners . What more could you want ?
 * The whey is sweetened with Stevia . . REAL sweet w / after taste . * Mixes ALMOST as well as Optimum . . mixes better than some , but not as well as Optimum * Requires larger scoop to get 22 gm protein = 5 FEWER SERVINGS per 5 # tub than Optimum . . = 77 scoops vs 82 scoops per tubI paid $ 23.95 w / free shipping for a 5 # tub = 45 % off Optimum.same price I 'd buy Optimum.whey product
 This is a great protein powder.it is sweetened with stevia , which is a natural sweetner.It tastes great !
 Great ingredients . Sweetened with Stevia -LRB- no sugar or sucralose -RRB- . Also has digestive enzymes . Great taste !
 This is my new favorite protein supplement . Easy on the stomach , tasty , all natural , and has some carbs which I prefer to straight protein . It is also certified gluten free .
 If you 're looking for an all-natural protein powder , and savings to boot , consider this product . Wary about taking in so much artificial sweetener and flavors in my old protein powder , I did some extensive research on ingredients and price and settled on this Iron-Tek powder -LRB- formerly Country Naturals -RRB- . Protein blend
 Ironically , finding a natural and healthy protein powder can be difficult to find . At your local grocers , you 'll find plenty of protein powder options , but few stay away from fake ingredients like
 this is a GREAT protein product ! All natural , it doesnt bloat you , tastes great , and mixes very well . It has a great combo of different protein sources and that means a better amino complex variety . I guarantee that you can not find a better value anywhere .
 I have tried almost all protein drinks out there and based on taste this one is pretty decent . Not the best , but very good and definitely better than most that I have tried . The main reason I tried it was because it does n't contain Aspartame or Sucralose , both of which which do n't agree with me health wise . So , for it to taste good without those artificial sweeteners in it definitely deserves a five star from me . No gas or bloating from this as well which is a nice change from other protein drinks I have used in the past . I also occasionally mix this with Whey Protein Isolate from Now Foods with great results .
 I work out about 4 times a week and this stuff helps with recovers big time . And I have celiacs and this has never given me any trouble at all . I use this stuff after a work out and a Pure Fit bar about 1 hour before . Makes quite a difference for me . Just an FYI I do n't lift heavy but I do a lot of core and cardio , do n't know if that would affect how it works or not .
 I love this stuff ! I have been preparing for a fitness competition and found this brand at the Natural Grocers . I tried some other brands as well but this one really has some consistency to it . The others were really watered down when even just adding 6oz instead of 8oz . I would reccomend this brand to anyone and my favorites are the Chocolate fudge and the Vanilla cake !
 This always helps me reduce musle cramping I get after inline skating , wish this was still manufactured , I understand its not .
 this is a very good , all natural protein powder . i recommend it . I do n't know if it is primarily whey though .
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !

 This product truly does what it says it will do . Works as good if not better then many of the prescription creams out there for diabetics .
 Good , durable , scale . Personally , I found all the pre-programmed caloric values annoying , but maybe someone else would use them . To just use it as a scale , it 's great . I gave it to my brother and he 's been using it for years . It 's rugged , too . I saw him drop it on the floor . He shook it , and it worked again . I guess he 's done that before .

 I have been lactose intolerant for years . This product allows me to eat ice cream and even cheesecake as well as all cheeses . In the past , I have tried other products but this works the best for me . I always carry it with me . One tablet is all I need .
 I ca n't digest milk at all unless I take this product and only this one . I can eat cheese at will and occasionally yogurt . This pill also allows me to eat foods that have been cooked with small amounts of milk . its great !
 These are great . Thick card stock . Deep , striking colors . The pattern is whimsical and bright . We use these as decoration , much less as blank note cards .
 I got this vitamin for my son . He has several allergies , including beef , which means he ca n't take most children 's vitamins -LRB- they contain gelatin -RRB- . I found this vitamin and he loves it ! He reminds me every night to give him a dinosaur !

But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 I have been taking this product since June 2009 to help with asthma . I was using -LRB- 2 -RRB- steroid inhalers as well as allergy medication and emergency inhalers . I have changed diet and the way I perform my job -LRB- lessening stress -RRB- . Due to lifestyle changes and the help of cordyceps I have been able to back off my steroid inhalers . I do not recommend any changes for those with asthma or other meds without advice from a health care provider . This product has been immensely helpful in the control of asthma and I will continue to use this product .
 Cordyceps is one of my favorite herbs of all time . I 'm an acupuncturist , so I have a lot of herbs I like ... Cordyceps is used to boost the energy of your kidneys , lungs and heart . It is one of the best herbs out there to improve stamina and energy.Nature 's way has one of the best brands available . You will notice the herbs have a nice nutty smell when they are good quality Cordyceps . If you buy cordyceps and it is flour colored or bland smelling , it is not good quality.One of my other favorite brands is Planetary formulas . They use both alcohol and water extracted cordyceps , so you get a broad spectrum.Planetary Herbals Full Spectrum Cordyceps 450 , 450 mg , Tablets , 120 tablets -LRB- Pack of 2 -RRB- The other cordyceps they carry includes some other kidney tonics that make it stronger for your kidneys.Cordyceps Power CS-4 120 Tablets
 Natures Way is a great company and cordyceps is the one of the best supplements I 've found . It changed my typing speed and accuracy noticeably . It makes your brain more fluid . Everything you do from typing to trying to remember the name of something , comes much more easily . Not many supplements are so noticeably effective , rhodiola being another .
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .

 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 This scent is awesome ! I first experienced it in the bathroom at work . I kept wondering what smelled so good when I went into the bathroom , and discovered it was this scent from Glade . I just wish I could have bought fewer at a time -LRB- maybe a 3-pack -RRB- .
 My family have been Glade users for a very long time . Even though some of the scents are n't the same as they used to be , we have found a new favorite !! I cant speak to if anyone else would like it but lord knows we LOVE IT ! Its very refreshing its not too strong , its not watered down . It does take care of any smells from cooking , etc. . It 's awesome . Glade please never change this one !!!!
 Glade aerosol cans are very easy to spray -LRB- unlike Air Wick -RRB- . Very little pressure is needed to depress the spray button.I prefer the Clean Linen scent . It 's less `` sweet '' . It actually smells like clean linen . It removes odors rather than covers them up . The best spray Glade makes is the odor eliminator spray for smokers . It comes in a brownish can . It removes every trace of cigarette and cigar smoke in a room . It does the same for any nasty odor you may encounter , but the scent is almost impossible to find . Maybe they do n't make it anymore ? The Fresh Linen is the next best thing.There is a big difference between regular spray and odor eliminator spray . Regular sprays just cover the odor . Odor eliminators remove the odors.What 's up with the high prices on Amazon though ? I buy these cans for $ 1 in any dollar store and Walmart .
 Glade 's `` Crisp Waters '' air freshener spray is not as watered down as some people may tell you it is . This freshens the air rather quickly and the scent is pleasant without being too overbearing at the same time . In addition , the can keeps the spray fresh for months after you buy it . I have n't been disappointed with a single can of this yet!I recommend this air freshener for anyone who needs to get rid of unpleasant odors in their home .
 This has been my favorite bathroom aerosol for many years , but Glade appears to have discontinued it in preference for the `` new mist '' version -LRB- I abhor -RRB- , Glade Aerosol Air Freshener , Hawaiian Breeze , 8 Ounce ; ASIN
 Just about the only fragrance we use is the Apple Cinnamon which quickly freshens the air . We use it in the kitchen and in the bathrooms and it works well for us . Each can seems to last a long time and it is a good value . We like that the scent is not over powering and yet it quickly eliminates odors . We have used Glade for many years and it is a trusted brand with us . We also like that the propellant is 100 % natural and does not harm the environment . I recommend this product to you .
 This is BY FAR the best air spray ever made by Glade . I called Glade because I could n't find it in stores for several months . They told me it 's on `` limited distribution '' and obviously , I think that 's a BIG mistake . It has a unobtrusive nice clean , fresh smell that removes all the bad odors in the house . I made a plea to Glade to keep making this great product .
 I work at CVS and these can be found on sale for around dollar a bottle , so if your neighborhood has a drugstore check it out to see if you can find it for cheaper.Now let 's get to the product . I 'll keep it short and get straight to the point . I 've seen many people complain about how they are watered down and does not provide long lasting smell , well all I have to say to you my fellow amazon shoppers is to ignore them . The clean linen has been one of my favorite smell ever since I was a kid , reminds me of when my mom would be done with the laundry and ask me to help her fold , so it has a little meaning to me . The smell is n't strong , but it is just enough so everytime your in the area you sprayed , you will be able to smell it and it wo n't be to overpowering which is very pleasant . I usually spray it around the house in the morning before I leave for work and when I come back later on , the house smells fresh and clean . So you get the idea that it lasts pretty long and you wo n't have to worry about continously spraying for a good smell . Honestly , for the price per bottle this product is great and gets the job done . If you really love the smell of one of these sprays , do not hesitate because you wo n't be dissapointed.Fun Fact
 I have an eight-year-old daughter who is very allergic to mosquito bites . Bites on her leg swell up till it 's so painful that she ca n't walk . If the bite is on her arm she wo n't be able to use the arm in a day or two.Tried everything to help her and it did n't do much good.I just happened to think about the fact that the mosquito injects something that makes the blood thinner and I remembered that vitamin K helps to coagulate the blood.I used to work in a vitamin store and I have a lot of old stuff from that time.I just happened to have an old bottle of Vita-K solution for stretch marks . It is at least five years old . I have used it on her bites twice now and ca n't believe how fast it goes away . She had one this afternoon the bite area was about the size of a dime and that was surrounded by about three inches of redness . I put it on twice in an hour and it is almost gone . Understand in the past she would fight these bites and their painful effects for weeks.I do n't know if any old vitamin K cream would work but this one has a cooling effect . It gets very hot around the bump so the cooling feels good!I will give her a few vitamin K pills . I am wondering now if the mosquito 's might be put off by vitamin K on the skin . I am sure going to give it a try , an ounce of prevention being worth a pound of cure . I do n't know how much vitamin K would go through the skin into the blood stream . It might be worth remembering that Vitamin E thins the blood .
 I first tasted Gin Gins when I was leaving a restaurant in Manhattan and took a few to go . They were refreshing and seemed to settle my stomach after the big meal I had just eaten . The next time a friend said she was going to that same restaurant , I asked her to bring me some . After that I had to have them so I went on Amazon . Gin Gins are delicious with just the right amount of ginger taste-not too overwhelming , but very soothing . Try them !
 This candy is delicious . Not at all medicine-y tasting like I expected . It 's just the right thing to pick me up in the afternoons when I 'm starting to droop .
 These work great in reducing nausea for my pregnant wife . Much better than preggie pops . These also taste good . I would buy again .
 This is the best natural product to keep on hand . It helps with almost all tummy issues and heartburn . I make sure to never run out !
 On a recent ferry ride , the crew handed out Gin Gins to help passengers with motion sickness . I was n't sick , but I took one anyway and have been looking for them in stores ever since ! Finally I found them on Amazon and just ordered them here . I only just received my order today and I ca n't stop sucking on them . I have yet to use them on an upset stomach , so I ca n't attest as to how well they work for that , but just as a candy they 're addicting and delicious ! Shortly after the ferry trip , when I could n't find them in stores , I got some crystallized ginger -LRB- not by The Ginger People , -RRB- thinking it would be about the same thing . It definitely was n't . It only served to inform me that I actually do n't like straight ginger much at all ; it 's way too strong for my taste . But this candy has the perfect amount of sweetness , and yet still the warm punch of ginger that makes it perfect . Delicious !
 I really like the taste of this candy , just the right amount of ginger.I have to take a fair amount of medicine in the morning after I eat breakfast . I find at different times , I will become nause or get an upset stomach from the medicine . Gin.Gins candy really stoothes my stomach and makes it feel better . I even use this candy as a breath mint , when out and about I take along some of this candy in my purse to refresh my breath .
 My 7-year-old gets carsick , and we 've started using both these and wristbands on twisty rides , and it seems to be helping . Do n't know if it 's the bands or the gin-gins , but it 's working so we 're sticking with it .
 This will quell any nausea you may encounter from motion sickness . I used it along with marezine and ginger root pills and had great results .
 We suffered from motion sickness when we travel . GinGin helps alleviate the nausea sensations with a natural product .
 I really enjoyed this product ... as one who really suffered from morning sickness , I found to my delight that these treats also provided great relief when I needed it !
 I first discovered the Ginger people Christmas of 2005 . A friend picked up a bottle of Ginger Peanut Sauce from T.J. Max , as they knew I liked ginger . I cooked with it , making things like Asian snap peas , which my friends started requesting at pot luck get togethers . -LRB- They thought I spent hours making them -RRB- Sadly my bottle was running out . I looked on line to try to find more and ran across the Ginger People 's website . I ordered a half a case of the Ginger Peanut sauce , and decided to try a couple of their other sauces . -LRB- All of which are excellent by the way -RRB- The website offered `` ginger chews '' which I 'd bought before from Trader Joe 's under Trader Joe 's branding . So I ordered a couple of bags of those as I knew I liked them.By having my order reach a certain amount , the shipping was greatly reduced.Being short of the amount , I decided to try the Gin-Gins , even though I 'm not a hard candy kind of guy.A few months later , I was glad I did , however , as one of my new medications gave me dry mouth during the afternoon and when I talked a lot . I was able to put a Gin-Gin in my mouth which kept me from having dry mouth or having to chew on a Ginger Chew during meetings.I recently had another new med introduced , which has a side effect of nausea , the ginger chew helps calm that down , but is n't always convenient , like at meetings , socializing , or other types of interactions with others . Gin-Gins to the rescue again.If you 're prone to having an upset stomach , I ca n't think of too many , if any better way to settle that stomach down than a true ginger based product . Gin-Gins are the perfect all around , right in any setting answer.When taking one out of my pocket , friends , co-workers , or clients , have asked to have one . I 've yet to get anything put positive responses for Gin-Gins taste . So for anyone who just likes hard candy , Gin-Gins sure seem a winner with everyone I 've shared with.Try them , -LRB- and other fine selections from the Ginger People -RRB- you wo n't be disappointed .
 I 'm pregnant with my second baby and my friend sent me a bag of the Gin Gins hard candy as a gift . I was hesitant to try them , especially as my stomach was turning . But I did , and I 'm SO glad I did ! They worked almost instantly to settle my stomach and the nausea completely disappeared ! WONDERFUL ! I 'm going to invest in cases of these for the next three months !!!
 My mom gave me these ginger candies during my first trimester when I was pregnant with my second baby and I liked them . The taste was pleasant and although they never totally quelled the nausea , they seemed to at least take the edge off the nausea . And on the times they did n't seem to help , they at least took that horrible pregnancy taste out of my mouth . -LRB- Yuck ! -RRB- I would recommend at least trying them for morning sickness ; if it 's bad like mine was , try anything you can !
 I am a new lover of Gin Gins hard candy !! I am newly pregnant -LRB- 7 weeks -RRB- and the morning sickness , which for me is all-day sickness , began a few days ago . I feel aweful , AWEFUL . As soon as I found out I was pregnant I stocked up on anything that might help with the impending nausea - PsiBands , Preggie Pops , Ginger tea , Gin Gins . The PsiBands do n't seem to work for me but the ginger candy is AMAZING . -LRB- The Preggie Pops work pretty well too . -RRB- I feel almost normal while I 'm sucking on it . I do n't know how or why but , seriously , after about 30 seconds of popping a ginger candy in my mouth I feel SO much better . I 'm probably going to destroy my teeth by sucking on candy all day but for now it is definitly worth the relief . Thank you to everyone who rated these highly and convinced me to try them !! -LRB- My only complaint is that the candies are a little small and so seem to go fast . -RRB-
 I bought these for my wife after she was diagnosed with Gastroparesis , after eating various feeds GP causes her to feel mildly nauseated , after eating she pops one of these in her mouth and they actually work well with settling her stomach - she also takes then on trips when driving now and found they help with motion sickness as well .
 We love Gin-Gins ! We eat them all the time . It took a while for my kids to like them but now they love them . They work great for my daughter 's motion sickness . She is good at getting that in the car and has pretty much `` broke in '' every vehicle we have had . Took them with us on our trip to Colorado and guess what ? No upset stomachs from the curvy roads ! I do n't consider the ginger ale you buy at Walmart real ginger . If you want real ginger eat Gin-Gins !
 I found this product when I looked through a search engine to find natural ginger . I was taking a medication , that made me very sick to my stomache . Because of all the other medications I was on , my doctor was reluctant to give me another medication to address this side effect , so he suggested natural ginger . The first product I found was in a super market and it was ginger pieces that I would hold in my mouth , it worked ok , but one day I was in a super market and found some all natural ginger candy and that was great . I looked for it again to no avail . When I found these online , I was thrilled , but I was even happier when they arrived !!!! I would highly recommend these to anyone who is pregnant , or going through cancer treatments , motion sickness and of course side effects from medications . They are inexpensive and worth a million !!
 Originally bought these for nausea , but find myself eating them for pleasure . I love the little hit of ginger . I would not call it overly gingery and they are definitely sweet enough . I prefer the hard candy to the chews . These are really yummy .
 If you like the taste of ginger , this is about as much flavor as you can get for 11 calories . Very tasty and a little goes a long way .
 I bought the ginger chews at the market a few months before trying these hard candies , and I was expecting the same potency . The chews really have a burn to them when you eat them . These hard candies are much more mild . I like both , but for something you can actually enjoy for a few minutes , these are great . Wish they were perhaps a LITTLE more potent though .
 Okay , I know this review might seem a bit premature , since I only received this product yesterday , but WOW ! I am 6 1/2 weeks pregnant and have been having horrible , all-day morning sickness for about a week . The minute I received these yesterday afternoon , I popped one in my mouth , and by the time I had finished sucking on it my nausea was 100 times better ! Last night I was actually able to eat a real meal ! This morning , I popped one in as soon as I woke up , and was able to eat a real warm breakfast -LRB- my nausea has been so bad I have seriously been limited to saltines and plain bread -RRB- . I know every pregnancy is different , but if you are suffering from nausea and vomiting like I was , you owe it to yourself to give these a try !
 These are soooo good , warm and refreshing . Originally my friend sent them as a gift and I ca n't resist them and bought more . The packages are about the size of a bag of cough drops , but so much better . The delivery was a few days faster than anticipated so I was very happy . I keep going back . If I could find them in a store I would , but I do n't mind , it 's a good price and I ca n't drive so I like the delivery and very prompt .
 These candies are warm and spicy . Also they do help to settle an upset stomach . Though they are a little pricey , they can be worth it if you are traveling .
 These candies are spicy like cinnimon , but of course do n't taste like cinnimon . Not quite as intense as a spicy cinnimon candy either . I got them because I am pregnant and experiencing nausea . They do take the edge off ! One thing that bummed me out was I found 2 wrappers that were sealed up with no candy inside . Other than that , they are ok . Not something I would eat all the time , but it does help take the edge off my nausea . I would reccommend to other pregnant women !
 I do n't like the flavor of ginger but these candy are good . did n't helped with the nausea but they taste good .
 These are very tasty . I got them for nausea from my migraines . They did not help for that reason . I am not sure if they would help for any other nausea or not
 I usually get this ginger hard candy from &#34; Down to Earth &#34; store but they were out of it for over a month . Decided to order it from Amazon . I use it especially when I feel a cold coming on or coughing . It really soothes the throat and clears up congestion . I prefer the hard candy over the chews although the chews are good too . It also helps when your throat is dry . It 's worth it with the free shipping .
 Yum ! I am a ginger fan , and The Ginger People have yet to disappoint with their products . It 's great that Amazon is offering these now , so that I can restock my desk without battling traffic to get to a specialty store . These flavorful hard candies are a great afternoon pick-me-up that satisfy my need to nosh with a single candy - better than the super sugary candies that make you want chew through a whole bag . Also , the individual packaging is convenient for slipping one into my pocket for a long meeting !
 I buy these in large quantities for my friend going through chemo treatment . they said it really helps settle their stomach .
 I bought these for morning sickness . Not a magical cure , but they were helpful . I would recommend these for this purpose .
 I had the worst morning sickness in my 1st trimester ! I took some advice and ordered Ginger candy and it worked like a charm ! I was still in school and working and I never had to call in due to sickness because of these babies ! I recommend them to all my pregnant friends , and they all agree . Its also an awesome alternative to tums when you have to take something for a belly ache . I still eat these when I 'm ill . Great buy !
 I originally bought GinGins when I was pregnant to help stave off boughts of nausea , and they really work ! I keep them by my bed so if I wake up nauseous , I can pop one in my mouth before I sit up . However , they continued to be a go to for motion sickness and colds . They 're great melted in hot tea when you 're congested . Now , we always have some in the house !
 Great for upset stomach . Although I found them at my local World Market so I wo n't be ordering them online again .
 I have been using Kal Dolomite powder for many years now . I get the Calcium and the magnesium in the correct proportions and I get it as a powder , by the pound . This makes it very reasonably priced compared to buying separate Calcium and separate Magnesium supplements .
 i purchased this product not for human consumption , but for use with my dairy goat herd . I have seen the results in just a very short time . Hoof problems are starting to disappear and I have n't had a single doe experience any problems kidding and no white muscle disease in my kids.Next time , I will purchase a case of it .
 I wo n't go on about its attributes , but it was recommended to me that I take it , not just a calcium/magnesium supplement , but exactly this form , not necessarily brand , because of the natural state and balance dolomite is in . I think it helps promote serenity , has a calming effect on me , even helps me sleep . I take it at night along with D3 which is needed to promote absorption of calcium . It 's a very fine smooth powder . I like to mix it in milk and it 's almost like its not even there . I guess iI 'd give it another star if the container were n't almost twice as big as it needs to be .
 I really like the availability of a calcium/magnesium supplement in powder form . And I am sure KAL does a fine job in quality testing . I give it four stars only because you must be very careful with the dosage . I used their recommendation for a few weeks and wound up missing several days of work with terrible diarhea . After taking several weeks away , I started again with half the dosage , and have had no problems.I recommend taking this conjunction with a good vitamin D3/K2 supplement .
 I put this in my shakes and smoothies as a calcium supplement and it works great . Always mixes smooth and no clumps .
 Given that we 're darned sick of the pills we swallow around here , this is very handy.It 's a good supplement for calcium and magnesium and has little taste , so you can just add it to broth , soup , stew , grain or legume dishes , whatever.It 's a very handy way to boost mineral content in the diet .
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love .

I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 Jointflex is one of the products out there that certainly helps relieve pain . Both my husband and I use it on our backs and also leg areas where pain persists from day to day . It does relieve the pain and make it easier to move . We both have herniated disks and although it is not an alternative to procedures recommended , it does help to alleviate the pain and ease walking and sitting or standing . Also it does not have an overpowering smell like some products . The smell dissipates very quickly which is a plus .
 This has definitely helped with the arthritis pain in my joints . I apply it before bedtime and in the morning the pain is gone . I would highly recommend this .
 I bought this product for my mother , which is suffering from knee-arthritis , difficult to even walk . This product has given a relief for atleast 2-3 hrs after every use , which is very big thing for my mother . Now , she can atleast walk slowly to complete her basic works . Thanks !
 I depend on joint flex cream . I have chronic back pain from sports injuries , car accidents , and falls . So far , it 's the only over the counter pain cream that seems to work . Have tried `` aspercreme '' , `` stop pain '' , and other therma heat creams but none help . I highly recommend this product .
 Tired lots of products in past . This is one of most effective , and no offending odor to boot , and easy to use . So , it works , as good as expected , and will let you stay active .
 I have ordered the 12 count 20-ounce bottles 4 times now and the product has been received as described every time . The product is the best I 've encountered for my sport,high-performance tennis , and my go-to drink during long matches on hot , steamy summer days .
 Aging and weight gain seem to be related ... at least in me ... aceyl L carnitine has helped me with balancing my metabolism . It is not a weight lost fast fixed ... but it has me to keep weight off without changing my dietary intake too much . When I first started taking this supplement , I felt a slight flush , but after a week . . my body has adapted with no other reactions .
 This capsule is stronger than what I had been taking . As of yet I have n't seen any changes in memory function with more miligrams .
 I had a case of shingles in fall 2012 . Did a lot of reading and trying of lotions and potions . This particular cream helped the combo of itching and pain better for me than anything else . I had an old one in my cabinet and could n't find it in stores . But ... praise Amazon ... i was able to order an adequate supply via my Amazon Prime account .
 the blade came dull and its what i was sorta expecting . i had to get it honed at a shop . no biggy . just a little more infor on what kind of metal it is and all that would be nice for people who would actually use this . other than that full on ya
 I actually did n't need the razor for grooming , just as a prop in a show . So , I have no idea how good it is at shaving.For my show , though , it was excellent . It 's solid , does n't fall apart . From the shoulder to the blade is about 3 inches long . When it 's closed , it stays closed and when it opens it shines in the light.Again , I did n't use it for shaving , but for my purposes it worked great . Fast shipping too .
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot .

 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 This product is the strongest massager I 've ever used.It 's a little heavy and big for small hands , but the effect is very nice .
 They works great , I have had my own before that is why chose , did n't know my mother already had them .
 The post that the floss is wrapped around is now elongated compared to previous versions . It seems to grip the floss better . The floss quality is still only average .
 To use
 Yes the quality of the floss itself could be better but the design and the convenience is great . I have one in each bathroom , night tables , in the car -LRB- after a meal out -RRB- in my purse , in my desk at work in a case . I just love these things . My dentist says since I 'm flossing more I have less stuff to come off in a cleaning . good news there !
 These flossbushes make it much easier for my kids to floss themselves . They 're somehow just the right size and angle - my 7 and 9 year olds have a hard time with regular floss , and with most disposables . These work great for them - I wish they were more broadly distributed -LRB- e.g. our local drugstore does n't carry them -RRB- .

 My wife purchased this digital thermometer after pouring herself over hours of research and reading . Being an audiophile and a Registered Nurse , she 's one of those people that reads the manual on everything first , never makes an impulse purchase and often times calls the company directly via the phone numbers listed on the packaging -LRB- which she usually copies down in the store -RRB- . I had purchased a different thermometer for her as birthday present , but that 's a whole other story . Needless to say the Braun Thermoscan Thermometer was her preferred choice . The reasons are thus :1 . The readings this device give are the most accurate for any ear thermometer on the market at any price . This should be the most important reason - all - the time .2 . The sterile caps are a necessity and even if you 're only using the device on one child you should do everything in your power to cut down on ear infections .3 . The reading it takes occurs very quickly .4 . The beep is more for me than it is for her , which she thinks is a must . Removing the device early is a common mistake .5 . The ` ease of use ' makes taking an ear reading a simple matter . Easier than oral , rectal or armpit and a world of difference over the newer Temporal Thermometers .6 . The storage of 1000 readings which is a blessing when you have to look back at the data , and some of us do.My son likes this thing so much he quickly figured out how to stick it in his own ear a few times and press the button and wait for the beep , which caused my wife to scowl and panic , but of course I just thought my son was gifted like all foolish parents out there.The cost of the small plastic filters is incredibly minimal as is the actual cost of the device itself . Sure , you can go to Target or Wal-Maze and buy yourself another cheapie , but then you 'll be back exactly where you are now sometime later ... looking for a dependable and accurate ear Thermometer.This is currently the best .
 I checked out all of the reviews on ear thermometers before buying this one , figuring I could just return it to the retailer if it did n't work . I was using a pharmacy brand rectal thermometer with my 15 month old son and it would always give us vastly different readings every time , up to a 2 degree difference , and I wanted something that was ACCURATE . As long as it was , I was willing to spend more.I was not disappointed with this . I knew my son was running a temperature by his temperament and feeling his forehead . The rectal thermometer read 103.1 , 102.4 , and 101.9 when taken three consecutive times . Right out of the package the Braun ear thermometer read 101.6 , 101.6 , 101.5 , 101.5 . I took mine and it read as 98.8 , 98.5 , 98.5 . MUCH better than my old thermometer and it took a fraction of the time . Not to mention it 's much easier to get than a rectal temp , and I look forward to seeing just how easy that will be when we need to use it in the middle of the night!No , the screen does n't light up for night time use . Oh well . If the thermometer remains this easy to use and maintains its accuracy , then I think I can easily deal with that .
 This product is so easy to use , and my two year old daughter likes to take her own temperature . With other thermometers , she would run when she saw it coming , and with this one it 's easy , quick , accurate , and she likes to hold it herself . I highly recommend this product !
 Easy to use , accurate and saves time . Very consistent . Excellent purchase . Would recommend to anyone.Have been using it daily for a month . Consistant readings .
 Have had no problems . Works great . Took a while to receive but I like it . I would recommend to others .
 Seems accurate . Easy to use even with squirming baby . Only drawback are the little plastic shields to keep it sterile . They are an added cost
 A fast read out makes this a winner at our house . Easy to use , and intrigues my kids long enough to allow me to take their temperature . I have had mine for over five years and it is still working like new !
 This is the best thermometer price on the net . The delivery was very prompt . I would highly recommend both the thermometer and the vendor !
 We have a mold problem on our windows because we run a humidifier all winter . Our windows are painted , but this product only removed the mold . This saved me countless hours and a huge mess . Of course , if you use this on any painted surface test in a small area first . I LOVE THIS PRODUCT ! p.s. use your head and ventilate properly .
 Our master bath is poorly ventilated with no windows . We 've fought unsuccessfully against mildew and mold for nearly 14 years . I 've tried countless products that have not come even close to making a dent in the problem . It was embarrassing and gross even when `` clean . '' Though disheartened I 'd pick up something new every now and then and give it the old college try to no avail . White tub/grout was still disgusting with black mold and mildew.I found this product sitting on the bottom shelf of a super store with the daily shower spray cleaners and assumed it was a daily spray - and my husband and I used it as if it were for a couple of weeks . Today our tub , grout and sliding door look nearly new . It has been an amazing transformation ! We are both thrilled and neither of us lifted a finger to scrub -LRB- since we did n't read the label and thought it a daily spray on -RRB- . Having just read the label I realize it does n't claim to be a daily cleaner but it should be.Yes , it 's toxic - but so are mold and mildew . It 's bleach - and that 's what it smells like . I am highly sensitive to bleach fumes so I 've tried to avoid them if I need to hang around and scrub . Despite this fact - you can still have success with this product without making yourself sick . Spray it on as a daily after your shower and walk away . Within two - three weeks you 'll be shocked at the change . Now that we have a sprakling shower after all these years , we 'll drop back to spraying maybe once a week and see if that holds . I 'd imagine that using it daily would start to do some damage . For now I see none - just commercial ready beautiful tile . I 'll update if anything changes . Cleaners generally do n't excite me , but I love this product and highly recommend !
 This great product has disappeared from most stores so I just spent triple what it cost before because it cleans better than any , and I mean any other spray bleach cleaner with no scrubbing . It is truly awesome so if you do n't like the fumes , I suggest you hold your nose !
 This truly is a scrub free mildew remover . I have used it inside the house , on beach chairs that were stained and other things outside the house - and I never had to scrub and it removed mildew stains - that nothing else worked on .
 This is a great working product ! People keep commenting on the smell , it is a CLEANER not an air freshener ! If you have a caked up grime , you have to clean better , more frequently , anyway . It is not the cleaners fault that you are a disgusting person . This product will take off a moderate amount of mildew and will bleach a pink-yellow-white shower curtain to white again simply by spraying on and rinsing off . Ventilation is needed for ANY good cleaners . This product performs wonderful if the directions are followed . My mother used it at my house when they came to visit and wants me to get some for her now but I am not able to find any retailers for it now . Two thumbs up for the product that does wonders ! Two thumbs down to all the people that like perfumed cleaners that do n't even clean well .
 I USE IT FOR CLEANING MY BATHROOM AND ESPECIALLY THE WHITE TILE . DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB . CAUTION
 I recently purchased this lighter and the quality is awesome ! . . It has a nice hefty feel . . not flimsy at all . Emblem on front is raised and adds more dimension to the standard zippo . . love that about this lighter . stays lit even in windy conditions.Use often and have only put lighter fluid in once so far . . Highly recommend this lighter .
 I have used alot of toothpastes and this is buy far the best ! My entire family and most of my friend 's use it ! I made sure to turn everyone onto . Such a feeling of Clean . Mix it with an electric toothbrush for and even better feel . Zest it up with the Kiss my Face AloeDyne mouthwash . Strong , Long lasting , Clean ! Get Some !
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products .

 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot .

 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 Got batteries ? The price is right because hearing aids eat battery life like a vacuum sucks up dirt . Excellent value .
 So I decided to go on an organic trial run , and ordered a dozen or so different Kiss My Face products . I actually do perfer them , especially after finding a website telling me that the main ingredient after water in my 99 cent bottles of Suave from Amazon.com was used in engine degreasers , and garage floor cleaners . I sent the stockpile of Suave shampoo back to Amazon.However , this mouthwash is quite pricey . As of now , it clocks in at 56 cents an ounce , whereas the big 1.5 L of Listerine on Amazon.com goes for 11 cents an ounce.It 's quite minty , and strong like Listerine , only missing a bunch of chemicals on the bottle that I ca n't even pronounce . My mouth feels quite clean after using it . But it does n't last long . Filling the cap 3/4ths of the way resulted in this bottle lasting only two weeks being used just by myself . $ 125 a year for one person for mouthwash is a lot.I 've decided to try `` Tom 's of Maine '' mouthwash now though , since it 's cheaper , comes in a larger size , and is also made with natural products.This mouthwash is made in Italy , and is not ADA approved.In summary , I enjoyed this product a lot , it just seemed to want to kiss my wallet often , along with my face .
 This product works well unless you accidently put new batteries in the wrong direction in which case it will destroy it .
 This was my first purchase of this kind . It has 6 settings . It is just the right strength . It is n't the quietest thing I 've ever heard , but it works well . I 'd recommend it . : - -RRB-
 Red clover extract works really well at getting rid of unwanted fat cells in your body . Herb Pham Large has given my great service every time I 've ordered this product . They are prompt with delivery , and if they anticipate a delay in shipping , they always let me know via email right away .
 I have a pair of GE clippers that are dreadful . I have to go back with scissors to even out the mess they 've left behind . I so much hated cutting my children 's hair because of the pull and mess , I wait until they look like little animals . After reading all the reviews for clippers on this site , I was waffling between these Vidal Sassoon and the Andis pet clippers from petco . I got these at Target today and came right home to cut hair . They already had enough charge to test , but I hooked them to the cord -LRB- which is like a cell charger -RRB- and had my 6 yo done in no time . I am so happy with these clippers ! They have the best attachments I have seen or used yet . They have longer and shorter settings . I did n't even have to use scissors on my 9 mo. I did use the scissors on my 6yo . They are nice too , not flimsy . The clippers have a nice look and feel - good control , wonderful cut , worth the money . I am delighted .
 I have been a stylist for 13 years . I bought these to use at home , but they worked so well I use them in my shop ! They easily compare to my cordless clippers that cost over $ 100.00 Thanks for the great deal !
 We bought this for my son when he needed a haircut because it was easier to cut his hair at home then take him to a hairdresser . We like this because it 's wireless . Like all clipper , it makes the buzz sound , which my son is kind of scared of , but as long as we distract him , it does n't bug him . We dropped the trimmer once , and broke the # 1 clip , so we use it without the clip , and it still works great.Saved us a lot of money by not taking my son to the hairdresser .
 THis product was perfect for me . I can now cut and trim my own hair whenever I wish to . It is very easy to use and clean .
 I tried these after a bunch of headaches with a Costco clipper I got a while back . It works great . The cordless feature is a huge plus too . My wife cuts my hair pretty quick with these things and they have stayed sharp for at least 6 months now . For the price these clippers are awesome . I have no idea why there are so many negative reviews though . Maybe it works differently if you trim your hair really short . I think we do 1/2 '' on the sides and 3/4 '' on the top .
 First we used it to cut one of my friends and it seemed to work OK because his hair was so thick . After my wife cut my hair , her worries dissapeared because it worked so much better than my old one and it is also cordless so it is really convenient . I hated when the cord of the old machine used to touch me while cutting with its cold cord . I definitely recommend this hair cutter because it does its job really well , it is cordless and very affordable .
 My boyfriend is really happy with the product allthough the case is really bad I give that no stars . It doesnt close unless you put every piece in perfectly and it does not hold anything in place very bulky plastic , they couldve done better . Otherwise the razor works great !
 I bought the clipper because my son 's hair grows like a weed . I got the kit and watched the DVD ... I have never used clippers to cut hair before and was a little conserned that I was going to mess it up . I used the different combs included in the set and it was really easy to do . His hair looks great and other people think that he went to a barber to have it done , and that was only my first time using it . Thank you for this awesome product , my son will look better and I will have more money , since I do not have to take him to the barbers all of the time now.Mickella
 This item came in a fair space of time and was exactly like the product showed on the Internet . Would not have expected anything less .
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 AMBU CPR has a great product here . This mask is one of the cheapest on the market , has a replacable valve with filter , and is made from quality materials ! It is a complete saftey kit , gloves and wipes included in a bright red , hard , crush resistant case . I have recommended this to the American Heart Association CPR instructers in my area . These masks are much easier for beginners to use than faceshields and the disposable plastic liner types . I noticed many people struggling to get a good mouth seal with other cpr shields , they tend to move around while doing compressions , dont get me wrong all cpr devices are a good thing , but this one is at the top of the line with the laderal units ! Thanks AMBU , keep up the good work !!
 What can I say ? I needed one for my Rescue Diver certification training , so I bought this one . It had the oxygen tube -LRB- not all pocket masks do -RRB- and a case . No brainer .
 This mask worked very well in Professional Rescuer CPR and DOT First Responder training . It 's easy to get a very good seal on a patient 's face , and it 's compatible with most bag-valve mask and O2 systems.The neck strap tends to get in the way . I suppose it 's a nice touch , but I would n't depend on it to keep a tight seal on a patient 's face without hand pressure .
 I like this mask because its just like the one I used during my CPR training . A lot of the other masks have funky attachments or O2 inlets sometimes , and this was just what I was looking for . I keep it in my backpack or my bag sometimes when I go out -LRB- just in case ! -RRB- = -RRB-
 Received this product quickly . While I hope to never have to use it , I feel that this is a good piece of equipment to have on hand just in case . One way valve and filter seem adequate for -LRB- of course -RRB- single use . AMBU is a good name in the industry ! ~ Firefighter for 10 years
 Thank God I have n't had to use this device , but it appears to be built well and was ready to go when I opened for test . Delivered a day earlier than quoted .
 This is a good high quality pocket CPR mask . I hope I never have to use it , but we have one in both of our cars just in case .
 Never can tell when you have to do mouth-to-mouth of these things are great people to most people have to touch them we use them every day just in case something We love them and I want them to you work only
 This mask gets a good seal and has an excellent one-way air valve . The elastic band can get in the way at times but is easily removed . Perfect for CPR , BLS , etc. courses and hopefully perfect for real-life situations should you ever encounter one .
 This is exactly what I needed for my CPR class and it arrived as pictured in a sealed bag . It does what it 's suppose to do and does it well . Could n't ask for more .
 After having been trained as an Emergency Medical Technician in 1984 I have had numerous occasions to provide medical assistance to injured persons . Step one is check for a response . Step two is insure adequate breathing . In most cases step two requires contact with bodily fluids , such as saliva , blood and/or vomitous . Since the discovery of AIDS you would have to be a fool to provide mouth to mouth resuscitation without the protection provided by a ` mask ' . If you know CPR , and you should , you need a mask . It is of no use unless it is with you . This seems to be a good one at a good price . Do n't be without one !
 Just what is needed to ensure rescuer and victim maintain proper boundaries . Discourages sharing of oral secretions . A true must when mingling with minions .
 I bought the Ambu res-cue mask more to get to the $ 25 minimum for free shipping but was pretty surprised at the quality feel of this thing . I have played with it enough that I am kind of surprised it has n't fallen apart yet . It comes in a nice , sturdy case and hope I get to use it for real some day .
 Compact and easy to use . I highly recommend this to anyone in their car and in their home first aid kit . Great value and good quality . This is a well made product
 very light and compact . works well for a somewhat basic first aid kid . would n't recommend leaving it in a car if the weather is very hot .
 It was exactly what I needed for my class and great for the price ! so much cheaper and nicer than what I would have gotten in a store !
 perfect exactly what i was looking for . not much more to say here but they have a minimum numbers of words required for review . dumb .
 I had used a rescue mask in CPR training on a few occasions and felt like it would be a good idea to keep one in the car . This came in a very sturdy case which is important when stuffed in my emergency back pack . More importantly is that the quality of the mask itself is much higher than the one used in class . When practicing , it is much easier to achieve a good seal . Also , it comes with a set of gloves and cleaning swipe which is all you need for the first time you use it.Overall , I would recommend this product to friends .
 I have not used this in an emergency setting . I bought this because I was taking a CPR class . So far I have n't washed the thing , -LRB- since I 've been using it on the same mannequin -RRB- , but I do n't think it would be that hard to clean whenever I do get around to washing it . Seems like a good enough size , although obviously it 's probably too big to use on a baby 's face . But overall it looks like good quality material and I 'm glad it came with a case , including instructions on how to use it and a pair of gloves .
 I have not had the occasion to use this product -LRB- thankfully -RRB- but it seems to be a decent product , and definitely comes at a good price .
 This product is for my survilal kit and it meets expectations for thatAMBU CPR POCKET RESCUE MASK W / O2 INLET
 The service was great it came right on time . The product was just as described in the ad . I would use this service again .
 Amazon offers this for a great price . For the price it is a very nice mask . It is made pretty well and it would do fine as a mask . I got these to put them in the car , etc. . They are great for that use at a price that is about right .
 Very tasty and strong flavor -LRB- cinnamon/tea tree oil , but predominately tastes like cinnamon -RRB- . Some people will find the taste too strong and feel weird about chewing a stick to freshen their breath . Other 's -LRB- like me -RRB- will like the flavor and think the sticks are cool ! Give em a try and see what you think .
 These are not chew sticks , they are toothpicks ! They allowed me to stop smoking with very little cravings . They taste great , and the flavor lasts for awhile , not as long on the cinnamon flavor , more so on the tea tree which is essentially a mint flavor . I prefer the taste of the cinnamon , but the cinnamon sticks tend to shred really quick , not so much with the tea tree . They smell great and taste great what more could you need ... beats a cigarette any day .
 The Package
 These chewing sticks chew very well and do n't splinter like ordinary toothpicks . My only reason for four stars and not five is because I would prefer more cinnamon .
 I bought these for my husband who recently quit smoking . They have really helped , but be aware the cinnamon flavor is VERY strong and he got a couple of irritated spots in his mouth . You have to put them in and out of your mouth and not hold them in one spot for too long . These were recommended by a smoking cessation counselor and my husband really likes them .
 A friend of mine bought me a pack of these a few months ago and I loved them -- they are the perfect after-meal toothpick because the spicy cinnamon flavor makes your mouth fresh . ALso great if you 're feeling hungry and ca n't eat for a while -- the strong flavor kind of distracts from hunger .
 They 're great for after dinner . They 're great when your sitting on a couch . They 're great for when your working . I love these .
 These chewing sticks are tasty and just strong enough to satisfy my smoking urge for awhile , I also like the container it come in , I can throw it in my purse or put it in my pocket .
 I really enjoy these . It is something I can chew on a bit and get a nice flavor from . They help with bad breath and are an okay substitute for snacking . These have a very strong flavor . I 'd go so far as to say they burn a bit . Do not mistake them for something like a mint toothpick as they are way more strong . They are shaped exactly like a fancy toothpick with one pointed side and one fancy side . You do generally want to chew on them as you will get more flavor from them that way .
 The cinnamon teatree oil sticks were great for me as a cigarette deterrent . They helped me get past the whole `` oral fixation '' thing . Anytime I wanted a cigarette I just chewed on one of these .
 A girl in my son 's college class had these and he came home and HAD to have them ! I came right online and purchased two packages for him . He 's in heaven ! He loves them . They are a little pricey but they go a long way and sometimes you just got ta have something when you want it .
 I ca n't say anything bad about this product other than after many years of using it -LRB- must be between 5 and 10 years -RRB- it has worked pretty solidly . I do n't do crazy cuts , but trim my hair , beard or chest every so often . It has done the job and without fail until this year . Something wrong with the plug connecting to the machine or something mechanical on the inside . So I am looking to buy the same one and I hope it will last for another decade . I will come back to review it then if it fails for some reason .
 I bought these at ebay.com for $ 5.99 each . . bought two of them and they work fine . They 're light to hold ... and with some patience , I shave my head with them ... they are NOT noisy and my pet Terrier does n't mind me using them on his long hair to trim his ears .
 Great product to use . I have small hands and the style of the Clippers made using them simple . The stainless case is a very nice addition . The case , made of medal , gives you the ability to store anywhere and know that the Clippers are well protected .
 the only product I can count on without worry . . Any woman with worry or problems this is the product to count on .

 I was happy to find these brushes as I ca n't find them in stores anymore and the price is very good , but I need a new handle or two . The one I have is an Oral B , probably gotten as a free starter from my dentist . Am assuming I need a GUM Proxabrush Handle , but the Amazon reviews are confusing - it looks like there 's the old kind that these brushes fit into , and a new snap-on kind ? . Reviewers complain of receiving the wrong ones but their descriptions are confusing and the product pictures are too small to see clearly ! Does anyone know where to get the handles ? Thanks .
 ONCE AGAIN MY HATS OFF TO AMAZON FOR THE FAST SHIPPING . I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR A WHILE . THE LAST TIME I WENT TO THE DENTIST , SHE TOLD ME MY TEETH WAS IN GOOD SHAPE , THANKS TO THESE BRUSHES .
 This product is , in my opinion , essential for healthy gums and highly recomended by dentists . Amazon is the only way to purchase GUM refills easily for me . They are shipped the day ordered and arrive in perfect condition .
 I just want to add my thanks to Amazon for stocking this and other hard to find items . I have spaces between some of my crowns and really need these . WalMart quit carrying them several years ago .
 We received the items on time and at a great price . We are defiantly going to order more soon ! : -RRB-
 Purchased GUM Go Betweens Proabrush Refills after visiting my dentist and having my regular dental cleaning . The staff recommended that I use the GUM Go Betweens Proabrush in cleaning between my teeth and after using them for a while I found them to be very good at cleaning between my teeth . The wide size is a little too big for most of my teeth . The medium size works best for me . I will purchase this product again and recommend it as well .
 Could n't find these anywhere locally and was amazed to find it thru Amazon.com . Price was right , so was shipping . Thanks so much .
 Hello , I have been using Gum Proxabrushes for several years now . I love them & they keep my teeth clean between my teeth . I love buying in bulk too , so being able to buy 6 packs of 8 Proxabrushes is excellent for me . Thank you , db77
 Could not find in stores . Good product and hard to go from store-to-store to locate.Happy to find it here .
 I have been using this product for years , but all of a sudden I could ' t find them in the drug stores . Hooray Big `` A '' had them and I paid less over all for them .
 Was glad to find these brushes as the local stores not longer carry them . Was shipped on time and arrived on schedule .
 I live in a small town , and these proxy brushes are n't readily available often , and if they are , there is maybe 2 or 3 packages . Having this product on Amazon is great , and being able to buy them in multiple packages is even better ! Will definetly buy again .
 My Dentist recommended these . I am on my second order so that should speak for itself . I use these after I brush and before I floss . I was amazed how much stuff was between my teeth after brushing so I will keep using them .
 I highly recommend this product . Our dentist recommended between our semi-annual office cleanings , use 2x a day instead of floss to slow and arrest dental plaque buildup and use alongside a pulsatingWaterpik Ultra Water Flosser . I was skeptical . But after a year of use , our family is hooked.You use this product after brushing teeth . Just insert a refill onto a Proxabrush Toothbrush Handle and gently move the bristles between the spaces in your teeth . Then rinse . I do not like theButler Go-Betweens Cleaners 8 eabecause it is harder to maneuver in each of our mouths . Use theGum go-betweens Proxabrush Handle with Refillsto determine what size refills you need and to get your first handle . The bristle refill should slip completely in and out between each tooth so the tapered refills does not work for us . 8 refills are in a single pack.I combine with the Waterpik before bed . Each bristle refill lasts 3 days to just over a week . When bent during repeated use , the bristle refill is weakened , can break and get stuck between the teeth . The user must take care not to swallow when removing the broken end from between the teeth . Because of this design flaw , it is not suitable for children or the aged or people with mobility problems . This happened for me about 1 time out of the 8 refills and I 've learned to be more careful and inspect before each use.Users in their 40s-60s who are more at risk for gum disease and plaque formation should be more than satisfied with the results . I personally have found no product better for arresting plaque and look for and encourage feedback if anyone has a better tool . It feels good to be active in slowing plaque build up.Now my bug-a-boo and why I am writing this review.Our family needs both wideGUM Go Betweens Proxabrush Refills , Wide , 8-Count Packages -LRB- Pack of 6 -RRB- and TIGHT GUM Go Between Proxabrush Tight Refills-8ct -LRB- Quantity of 6 -RRB- refills . The wide are more readily available and often discounted . The TIGHT are harder to come by and for some reason unknown to me , more expensive . None of Amazon suppliers for TIGHT offer PRIME free shipping at the time of this review . But this supplier offers PRIME on wide , thank you.I went to the manufacturer 's website found local distributors and spent 3 days trying to find the product locally . Frustrated , I went back to the manufacturers website , found I could order direct and even found a discount and free shipping code . However , the code does not work and the system bug removes the shipping line charge but includes it in the total . Furthermore , the manufacturer 's web order system requires personal information that I prefer to limit when ordering . In short , Amazon remains my store of choice and I remain grateful for ease of use and security .
 Unfortunately the local stores replaced this product with an inferior version -- thanks to Amazon , my husband still gets to use these brushes .
 We used to be able to buy these at Wal-Mart . So their loss and our Amazon vendor a gain.Thank you so much !
 My dentist asked me to get some of these . Walmart no longer carries them . Those from Amazon came quickly , and are a great benefit to my teeth .
 I have been using these proxabrush refills for years and could n't find them locally . This experience was easy and pleasant so I think I 've found my place to order in the future .
 Very useful small brushes for taking care of teeth and gums . I 've been using them for a long time on a dentist 's recommedation .
 When my dentist suggested I try using a Proxabrush with its replaceable brushes I thought , `` What a pain ! '' I really did not want to be bothered . Just like when I first began flossing it takes a little time to learn how to use it and I when through a couple of the replacement brushes in the first week . But now that I know how to use it I use it at least twice a day and carry the portable Proxabrushes with me as well . It is wonderful to get all the stuff out between your teeth .
 I have been using GUM proxabrushes . it is very difficult to find in stores . I usually get them at Wal-Mart . But recently I do n't have any luck at all . They always run out of it . I am very glad to find it here . It is even cheaper than Wal-Mart . Shipping is fast , and price is great . I have no compliant at all . In case you do n't know . This is model number 614 . I assume they want to start using `` tight '' , `` moderate '' , and `` wide '' instead of model numbers .
 I use this product for several years and I am very satisfied with it.In the last year the manufacturer has launched a similar product which is disposable and needs no refill , but it is more expensive ... As the new product catches in , the traditional golden handle with the proxabrush refills is not available in pharmacies any more , therefore I liked the opportunity to purchase it through Amazon at the old pharmacies price .
 I have only been able to find these at Wallgreens Drug Store -LRB- used to buy them at Wal-mart -RRB- for about $ 4.00 per package of 8 . This is a great savings even with shipping charges . The price was incredible .
 Bought in quantity . When you need the brushes you need them . I found most stores have large selection of toothbrushes but prophy appliances are lacking.Highly recommend for total tooth care .
 I have some area between my teeth that catch food and are wider the dental tape . This product comes in multiple sizes and is literally a small brush to clean between your teeth . They need a handle to hold them & you can reach all spaces inside you mouth . I got my first one from my dentist . I like them so much , I found them on the internet & have continued to use them .
 I bought these for the Proxabrush handle which was recommended by by dental hygienist . I wish they were sold in the slimmer size .
 excellent for getting the stuff left behind between the teeth after brushing ... recommended !! make sure you have the holder -LRB- s -RRB- too ...
 These do the job . If you are not careful the wire holding the brush is a bit sharp but they do a good job . I will purchase again .
 These brushes are extremely good and reasonably priced . Due to the length of the shelf life , the brushes can be ordered in very large quantities that will last for years , a good economical way to purchase and have on hand .
 These are so much easier and your mouth and teeth feel cleaner than flossing . This makes flossing fun and easy .
 Went to the pharmacy and discovered they were no longer supplying these brushes . So I rushed home to place this order . This is a steal of a deal . They are also the perfect size , although I had to make an educated guess because the one I usually purchased at the pharmacy had measurements on them , these just had small , medium , wide , so just be careful of the size
 Great job in getting the food out of your teeth . Recommended to use as a back up to your regular flossing -LRB- though I am no dentist to advise of this -RRB- we use this regularly especially after those sumptuous steak meals . Does what is ti supposed to do.TIP
 The proxabrushes provide the same benefit as flossing . However , they allow you to clean areas betwwen teeth that you might miss with floss due to large/small spaces between teeth . The GUM brand has been ideal for me in maintaining the health of my gums . I recommend them to anyone who needs proxabrush refills .
 I have searched every store for these and turned up empty every time . I was super thrilled to have found them here . The quality of GUM products is great ... add that to the price at Amazon and you have a no-brainer purchase ! I have enough Christmas tree brushes to last for quite a while now !
 I usually buy these brushes in local stores . But recently I ca n't find any in the stores , so went online and found this one.Placed the order on Saturday , shipped out on Monday , and received on Thursday.I put one on the handle . It felt the same as the old ones I had used before.The only downside is the wire broke after three days , while the old ones could last a week . Maybe my using style has changed ? Will see how the rest last.Highly recommended .
 The items were sent from two places but they were what I wanted . These brushes are hard to find locally and do a good job as always . I have used these brushes for over 30 years and they do a good job .
 Finally found these at a good price . My dentist used to give me some at my checkups , but does n't do that any more . This is the same product and the price is much better than at a retail pharmacy .
 better priced and more efficiently acquired than in stores . These interdental brushes , used with a holder , work better than those that come with their own handles .
 good staff , we like it very much easy to use and easy to operations , no problems at alll , if you like it go get it .
 After spend a near-fortune and a year and a half in getting an implant , these work great to keep it clean . This is by far the cheapest place I 've found to buy this great product .
 Even with the S&H , these were cheaper than in the stores , IF you can find them in the store .
 I use these everyday , and I thought the price , how quickly they arrived , and the packaging wereall just fine .
 Good know product so problems there . I usually buy this from local stores but this time it was a little bit cheaper .
 I have seen this -LRB- or a VERY similar product -RRB- on other sites for $ -LSB- ... -RSB- and up . I bought this one because the price was low . The jelly MIGHT rip if you 're not careful , but I just took the straps off and wear it with a tight pair of panties instead . It is just the right amount of vibration , not like an industrial-strength vibe . It drives me bananas , and I ca n't wait to pounce on my bf . The remote works great from more than 25 ft away , and we love wearing it out to a club for discreet fun . I have even used it on my bf before during oral sex , and it drives him wild . The shaft is just right for females or males . I recommend this product for couples who want to have some fun together in public and in private . Just be careful when you 're adjusting the batteries or straps , or you might rip the jelly .
 I really enjoy playing with this at home . However , I bought it with the intention of wearing it under my clothes in various public places . It 's a little too bulky to be inconspicuous , and a little uncomfortable to sit on for very long.Still , lots of fun at home !
 i bought one of these mostly because i was curious as to how well it worked . its not the most powerfull vibrator i own but i love it anyway . its great for those times that i feel like being lazy and dont want to work for the orgasm . pretty nice if you are just laying in bed watching a movie .
 I could n't believe the difference this product made . I feel for the first time that I have some sort of control over my surgar cravings and it really helps keep my sugar levels stable . I do n't seem to have low blood sugar drops as often , -LRB- probalbly due to less sugar in my diet -RRB- , and when on the run if I do n't get a snack in , I can make it an extra hour . I would reccomend this product .
 This product has really made a difference for me . By the second day of taking the GTF Chromium twice a day , I could already tell that I was not craving sweets . I have a little bit of stomach fat and I am hoping that without sugar cravings , it will disappear and lower my risk of pre-diabetes .
 On the plus side , I found this personal groomer to be a step up from the Remington model I was using previously . The adjustable attachment is relatively sturdy , and the trimmer is powerful for its size . I have had it for well over a year now and it still makes for a consistent/even trim every time.The real downside that I encountered was that the jack at the base of the trimmer became loose very quickly so the outlet cord charger slips out all of the time during use . This problem just made it necessary to use the separate base charger beforehand so it is fully charged before I use it . I used to just plug it directly into the bathroom outlet and use it while it was plugged in.You can either charge the trimmer directly by plugging it into a wall outlet or mounting it on the charging stand and plugging that into the outlet.This could be a problem limited to my specific trimmer , but either way it still functions fine with the charger base . I tried the nose trimmer once and never used it again , but I was not purchasing it for that item , and it was simply because I ca n't stand that tickly feeling in my nose .
 This product is exactly as advertised . This product showed up on time and as advertised . I would recommend this product .
 This does exactly what I want it to do -- it hides behind the toilet when not in use -LRB- blends in nicely , has a good design and hides its brush -RRB- and does a good job cleaning the toilet .
 Considering the fact that I recently hand-massaged horse manure into my herb-garden bed , I ca n't be that much of a germ fanatic , but , one fresh thing I basically must have for general sanity is a freshly cleaned toilet , and that means a little dash of Seventh Generation cleaner in the bowl and a wipe down of the seat with Mrs. Meyer 's spray sometimes as often as twice daily . Hence I am on good terms with my toilet brush . I am on better terms with my new one made by Umbra , a home design company founded in 1979 by boyhood friends Paul Rowan and Les Mandelbaum , whose main US headquarters is based in Buffalo , New York , with another large facility in Toronto , and additional offices around the world presently employing a fairly whopping 650 people . In Latin , the word `` umbra '' means shade , -LRB- or more precisely , the darkest part of a shadow -RRB- reflecting the designing duo 's take-off debut product , a printed window shade then unlike anything on the ready-made market in the dark days of mostly ugly home accessories in the `` affordable '' price range . Umbra basically created excitement in the plastic tissue cover and waste-basket categories , no small feat if you ask me . Anyway , the Vapor toilet brush has a super-shiny finish of clear glaze or laminate over the brilliant acid green base and looks very cool ; plus the top fits snugly , no crass engineering or slovenly manufacturing bugaboo here . Given the frequent use mine sees , I might prefer air holes in the lid , since by default I am leaving the two pieces `` open '' so as to allow the brush to air dry . That said , among the best $ 10 purchases I have ever made .
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 I have this product , it works great . I would recommend this product for anyone who has sore and tired feet or leg muscles . I put this cream on my feet and my knees and I feel great the next day . Without this cream , I ca n't even stand on my feet in the morning . I wish that Avon would get this product back and start selling it again . I need some more , mine is all gone .
 Helps my feet feel better , I also use it on my knee and it helps the pain go away there too .
 I have tried many pill containers and these are the only ones I like . They are made of a better plastic that never squeeks like all the others do . I also like the fact that there are caps that have threads on them so that you can separate one stack into sections.When I wanted more of them , I searched for 1/2 hour to find them . They are worth the time !
 My wife has used both the Vitaminder Pill Case Stacker for her meds and theVitaminder Vitamin Dispenserfor her vitamins . She discovered the pill case stacker was perfect for keeping her small pierced earrings and rings separated when we travelled . Never mind the expensive leather jewelry travel case that I bought for her ! By the way , she 's a Gem too - but I could n't quite fit her in the pill stacker ! ~ The Boss
 If you have complicated medications that need to be somewhat airtight , this case is good . My only complaint is that plastic seems a bit flimsy . Helpful if could have smaller version -LRB- narrower -RRB-
 I bought this because I like to shave my head in the shower but prefer stubble over the smooth look . I was worried that this little trimmer would n't be able to handle the job but it 's been great so far . Only issue I 've found is that I really have to make sure I rinse the blades under a strong shower stream after each pass , because the hair tends to end up bunching in wet masses under the blades . No big deal . Very comfortable . Great charge life . And surprisingly quiet too . I 'd definitely recommend it if you 're looking for a way to shave your head in the shower . I 've never used any of the guides/clippers etc. that came with it . Tossed them right in the trash because I just wanted the close blade .
 I have been using my trimmer for about ten months now and it is still going strong . I purchased it because i like to shave in the shower . I just put another one in my basket as this is something that I will want to have for a long time . The battery holds a charge for a long time although I only use it about once a week . The trick to using this product is to use it almost exclusively as a wet razor . It requires soap or shampoo but gets a good close shave on my head and has attachments for beard length and blending . I am hairy but well trimmed . I use it as a whole body trimmer . It looks a little cheap but it is actually pretty durable . Again , it does not work well as a dry razor . But lather up this is smooth and efficient .

 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 Love this !!! It can be powerful or not with the different settings - 9 volt batteries -- LOVE IT !!!
 This is an amazing toy , it does wonders ! I 've been using this type for over a year and I have to say that I am very happy with the performance . The only problem that I have is that it only seems to last 3-6 months for me as well . I do n't think I over used them . And I 'm very happy that the price is so low here on amazon ! I really do think its worth it even if I do have to buy two a year , it 'll only be 20 dollars a year for the best toy ever ! Give it a shot , I promise you wo n't regret it !
 I have been using these massager for a while and while it lasts on average 5 months , I always get 2 when I order . The intensity is GREAT . I only use Duracell 9 volt batteries -LRB- no other brands -RRB- and should I say more ... I am completely satisfied.Great Buy .
 As long as they keep making this model , this is the one I 'm going to get . The 9-volt battery really makes a difference , and if you use rechargeable batteries it 's no big deal to switch them out every few uses . It does suck up a lot of power , but that 's a GOOD thing while you 're using it . VERY strong vibrations . Every toy I 've tried to buy since that uses AA or AAA batteries has been disappointing ; this one has me spoiled.The last one of this type I bought several years ago , and it 's finally giving up from old age . I 'm about to buy another .
 Has 3 pulsing vibe patterns and the standard continuous vibe with high and low for a total of 5 . Operates quietly which is a must when you need to be discrete . First toy that I have owned that uses 9 volt battery . Seems to last longer than the AA or AAA type . Would be even better if it had intensity control for the vibe patterns . Higher quality construction than most similiar type toys I 've owned . Hopefully will last a while longer . Can not beat it for the price !
 This little thing is powerful ! The pulsating modes are fantastic , and powerful , and it has a gentler mode if that 's what you 're in the mood for as well . It really gets the job done well !
 I agree with the other users who said they have to replace often . I 'm here to order another one since mine quit working . I had it only 4 months . Aside from that ... WOW !!! Best I 've ever had !!!
 ooohhh !! is what you will be saying if you are smart and order this toy !! this is a very high powered toy and is great using on yourself and would be even better holding on your sweet spot while your husband/boyfriend is penetrating you ... WOW ... this is a great toy and very affordable . you go to a novelty store and will pay $ 25 easily for the same thing ... so , i suggest ordering through amazon and saving a ton . this toy is so good i told all of the girls at work about getting it from this site !! this toy is recommended by me to get you through a long deployment !! it works VERY well and within just a few minutes you will be feeling amazing !!
 This is the first vibrator/stimulator that I 've ever bought , and I think it was a pretty good choice.Cons :1 . The presentation of the bullet vibrator is pretty cheap ; it looks and feels like it was made with gold-painted plastic , but I think as long as it works it 's fine -LRB- I have n't been able to test durability , unfortunately , so I do n't know how long this plastic body might last -RRB- .2 . The gelatinous sleeve that came with it came to me ripped already , so it only lasted one use which kind of sucks .3 . The vibration is loud unless there 's pressure acting on it . I do n't know if this is natural to all vibrators , but I just thought it was strange . When left by itself to run under the sheets -LRB- in an attempt to muffle any noises it might make -RRB- I could hear a distinct buzzing . But when I pressed it onto my skin it got quieter , so I guess as long there 's actual contact while it 's on the noise level is okay .4 . The fact that there is a cord on the bottom of it is kind of weird . Sometimes it 'd get in the way or accidentally slip somewhere it should n't be . But I guess that ca n't be helped.Pros :1 . It 's really cute ! The switch to change speeds is in the shape of a little heart . The light to show that it 's on pulses with whatever speed you 're on , which is like a little bonus visual stimulation or indicator .2 . The speeds it has are pretty cool . It has two intensities , and variates pulses with the intensities . It 's not currently with me , but if I remember correctly the 5 speeds are

The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !

 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !

 The Vitaminder and Medication Dispenser does work very well . It holds all the vitamins I need . When we travel I use this and it eliminates having to pack all our various vitamin bottles . The brown tint helps shade them from sunlight while still allowing you to see which vitamin is in each slot . For carrying a small extra daily supply of my meds and vitamins in my purse I found theEzy Dose Disposable Pill Pouchesto be ideal . ~ Mrs. B.

 I have a bad back and this has made my trips wonderful . The massaging helps keep my back from tightning up and the heat keeps me comfortable . Anyone with back problems should have one of these .
 After being discharged from hosp with only pain relief , exercises and physio referrals , I was in constant agony for over a week , til I was given this product.I can now walk without pain and am more flexible in my movements.I love it , it 's my new bestest friend !!!
 I just wish that it came with an auto shut off timer . If you get up to take care of something and forget that it 's still on in the other room , it will stay on forever .
 This is a wonderful device at an amazingly low price.I enjoyed it a few times . Then I gave mine to a neighbor that has had terrible back troubles for years . This gave welcomed relief and sound sleep .
 Dr. Scholl 's Massager is a winner . It works very well and is easy to operate . The best part is that it is so inexpensive - a real bargain , and well worth the cost .
 I love this for the heating pad function . It 's great to put on the back of my recliner . It actually helps keep my spine straight and the heat is great for arthritis . I do n't use the massage function so I ca n't comment on that . I have it in my chair at all times even when I 'm not using it for heat because it is so comfortable to lean back on . I would recommend this to anyone who has back problems . It 's wonderful ! Ca n't believe the price .
 much fun , but difficult to adjust speed of vibration once in place . But , is a lot of fun for the wife , which makes it a lot of fun for me .
 We 've tried a lot of these types of products , and this is far and away the best . Get a stronger buzzy thingy to go in it , and keep her happy for hours .
 I did n't expect a lot from it , but OMG was it fantastic . I swear I do n't work for the company or anything , it was just great . ~ Your man + vibrator = this product ! ~
 What do you have to lose ? Ten bucks ?! This is a very flimsy product , but is was fun . It is not really rigid enough to stay in place and provide her with much stimulation , but it is pleasant enough for the man .
 Now I can remember to take my medicine . Very compact and pretty .
 i just received my dr scholls foot massager yesterday and am very glad i purchased it . i asked for this item for christmas but hubby got the wrong kind . he got me one of those with heat and massage but has a hard surface top with bumps on it . i did try that one out but found it to be too hard for my feet . i suffer from several foot ailments and when im really hurting , i can barely touch them to hand massage them , much less place them on a hard surface . i returned that item and bought this one instead and im so glad i did ! its SO soft and warm.you can turn on just the heat , or just the massage , or both , or neither ! if youre looking for a soft pillow for your feet that can massage them and warm them or just give the a soft place to rest , then you should buy this product!the one thing that it doesnt do is allow you to control the massage speed . it alternates from a high to low speed automatically but theres no manual control to do that yourself.one good note to point out , the cover on this comes off so it can be washed . thats not mentioned in the description and was one thing i was hesitant about when trying to decide.overall , im happy that i purchased this item . my feet are being comforted by it as im writing this review !
 i bought it for my fiance , and she loves it !! the instructions say to use it for 20 minutes at a time , but i 'll go back 30 minutes later , and there she is , feet still in , sleeping on the couch !! great product , no complaints at all .
 Sitting at a desk for most of the day , the foot warmer/massager is a terrific way to keep feet `` happy '' . 4 stars due to lack of color choice , other than that , Dr. Scholl 's is an excellent way to pamper yourself .
 I bought this facial bed for my spa , and it came 3 days sooner than it was supposed to , and was a piece of cake to put together ! it 's not a heavy duty bed for lots of moving around , but it works perfect for massages , facials , and anything that is on the more relaxing side !
 Product was received promptly and was well packaged . Product worked as advertised and is very useful .
 This pill splitter works really well . Beats using a knife and less dangerous to your fingers !
 Excellent product . It does a very good job in splitting small pills that were not meant to be split in half . Would recommend .
 THE GRIP SURFACE HOLDS THE PILL FIRMLY . THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT IT IS HARD TO LINE IT UP AS IT DOES NOT MOVE EASY . IF YOU ARE SLIGHTLY OFF YOU WILL CRUSH PART OF THE PILL . THE CONTAINER IS COMPACT SO IT IS EASY TO PLACE IN A POCKET FOR A MAN OR IN A PURSE FOR A WOMAN .
 Every kitchen must have one of these . I use it to split my pills and my puppy pills both . Item is very durable , works great and simply no problems . Been using for months . Highly reccomended . And this is the deluxe model . BUY !!!!!!
 Works great but large pills are almost to big so forget the horse pills been using it for about 1 to 2 months .
 Let 's face it ... after splitting half a dozen pills , they all need new blades . It ; s ok for the money . Never used one that worked any better
 Deluxe Pill Splitter does the job well . It was very hard to split a pill with a knife , but with the Deluxe Pill Splitter it does a great job .
 I have never purchase a pill splitter before but I can tell you about my experience with this one . It is convivent and safe . I like the no slip orange padding and the area to storage cut pills . I can easily keep this item in my purse for use anywhere and have no concerns about safety or losing pills . I am cutting very small pills and it can be a little challenging but I feel like this would be the case with any pill cutter .
 I 've just started using this pill cutter , so ca n't attest to its longevity , but it cuts my daily medication in half evenly . The previous cutter was erratic , hardly ever dividing a pill evenly , which was difficult in monitoring dosage . Very pleased that this one works as advertised .
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update

 I have type 1 diabetes and i travel with the associated medical support items
 i have had this product for twenty odd years when the zipper finely broke.i was amazed when i found the product was available on amazon , i highly recomend it to anydiabetic taktng insulin
 Bought this for my son after his old one finally gave out . The old one was larger , so it took a little time to figure out where to put all the supplies in this one . We like the smaller size , fits better in backpack , less obvious when carried into restaurant , . . etc. . Not too small and not too big . These are sturdy , and our original one lasted a really long time .
 performance and quality are what i 'm after . if you have osteoarthritis and are plagued by swollen aching joints and need quick relief . i highly recommend standback . this med . powder is also highly effective for migraine headaches and hangovers . when used with hemphcativa `` b '' , itmakes the relief last longer . the side effects are minimal if used strictly as directed . DO NOT USE THIS MEDICATION IF YOU DRINK CARBONATED BEVERAGES ! WAIT AT LEAST 16 hrs . IF YOU DO , BEFORE USING , AND DRINK LOTS OF WATER IN THE MEAN TIME ! the main reason that i highly recommend this med . for osteoarth . is because it is safer than any of the other so-called arthritis pain remedies that are just plain , out and out dangerous and should be removed due to causing , upset stomach , bleeding and in some cases death . this is a great product !
 My son discovered these down south , and they are the only thing that helps his headaches , you ca n't find them in the small town we live in so I 'm very glad we found them here .
 I love being able to order supply of Stanback for my severe osteoporosis/arthritis !! It is hard to locate and also have someone purchase for me . Stanback is a great product which helps my pain alot and Amazon has made this easy for this grandma to receive ~ ~ Thanks for taking one problem off my mind . Johnnie McHan , Mississippi
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 This works great and recommend it . However , the suction is so good that the little rubber suctions breaker off the holder in order to stay on the bulb . Not a bad thing as it holds on to the bulb well . However , plan to buy a new one in about a year once all the suctions are gone .

 I just got my product on time . Thanks to Amazon on line , It has helped me a lot !
 very fast shipping . great product . portable and the perfect addition to my diet to fit my needs
 This is my second one . I bought one from somewhere else and then lost it . Works great , no clumps or leaks . I only received one shaker .
 This is just what I 've been looking for . It does leak a little , but it is manageable . I sue it for my Slim Fast shakes with great ease .
 This is the perfect shaker for taking it to work . I just toss it in my lunch box and nothing spills out !
 I have Fit & Fresh chilled Shakers that holds 12oz . They work prefect for me !!! I can put my powder in the bottom compart , the night before I plan to use it . The bottom compart seems to hold about half a cup . No leakage problems -LRB- I own 3 of them -RRB- .
 For those of us that use diet powdered drinks as meal replacements , this is the perfect container for taking it on the go . Put in your powder and later add your liquid and shake , gets all the lumps out and your drink is perfectly mixed , as well as if you had done it at home in your blender !!!!
 I like the design . I would n't trust it to be leak proof sideways in a gymn bag , but is generally well sealed . The biggest downside is the frozen inner core . It definately imparts a funny taste if you use it . Otherwise your drinks will taste fine . The lower portion has plenty enough room to hold a scoop of protein powder or recovery mix . The mixing blades are useful for standard mixes , but not that effective for protein drinks which tend to clump more .
 It took me three shakers to find this one , but three is , indeed , the charm . This is absolutely perfect . It HOLDS 12 OUNCES of liquid , not 6 . And it mixes very well and does not leak .
 I love this shaker ! I love the separate compartment for the powder , so I can mix it later . It holds 12 oz and is plenty big for my shakes . I have n't had any leaks at all , while shaking or toting it around , and I have n't had any clumping problems . I also love the option of using the ice wand . This is the only shaker out there like it , and I 'm completely satisfied with my purchase !
 I am using this shaker for my Slim-Fast shakes , which use 8 oz of fat-free milk and ~ 1 oz of powder . The lid is tight , the milk stays cold -LRB- inside of an insulated lunch bag -RRB- , and the powder is contained . Everything cleans up easily , no clumps of powder in my drink , and the ` ice wand ' is great ! I 'm going to buy at least one more . The Fit & Fresh Chilled Shaker is exactly what I wanted .
 this cup is awesome , the bottom container holds 2 scoops of my protein powder , which are large scoops . and under the lid the spiral angled insert breaks up clumps nicely , and it hold the handy ice pack for those of you who like to take your protein with milk and cant get to a fridge for a few hours . lid does n't leak at all -LRB- YET , after 4 months of use -RRB-
 Pros
 the product does help to control the appetite temporarily . Works well in a `` slow '' weight loss program or to maintain your current weight

 I do n't know if the other reviewer even used it . But I picked up a box from Lowe 's -LRB- for $ 10 -RRB- on recommendation by Alton Brown . I use them to replace Brawney paper towels in the kitchen . I 've used them for everything from drying hands , cleaning surfaces to reoiling my cutting blocks/boards with food safe oil.It 's way tougher than Brawney paper towles -LRB- I used to use select-a-size -RRB- and more absorbant . You can do a lot of scrubbing . Only after major scrubbing does any lint start to appear . Way after a regular paper towel would start , though . Highly recommended for kitchen use.I would like to find a dispenser to put these in and hang it on my kitchen wall above the sink .
 We recently came to know about these rags . They are SO useful ! In many instances , paper towels no matter how great a quality , just wo n't do the job . These rags are perfect for cleaning up messes on the hard floor . We use one of these to 3-4 paper towels sheets .
 I was looking for some heavy duty rags that were disposable . . and came across the Rags-in-a-Box product . . I would describe these as paper towels on steroids -LRB- without the negative side effects like enlarged breasts , acne and violent temper , which is happens a lot with the `` other '' brands of rags -RRB- . Our housekeeper uses them and has no complaints.So for those on the fence about buying this product , the product is as advertised . .200 rags in the box ... does the job . . mission accomplished .
 Very convenient . Provides decent service for a piece of paper . And it is easy to keep around where it is easy to retrieve .
 These rags are probably the some of the best things I 've ever found for cleaning , polishing , drying , and using for about a thousand other purposes.They 're extremely tough , and do n't tear easily -LRB- probably 10x stronger than a standard paper towel -RRB- , so they 're great for wiping down rough surfaces -LRB- like metal , rubber , concrete , etc. -RRB- , and for laying down under a project to make sure screws and other loose bits do n't go wandering off.They absorb as much as a hand towel , so they 're great for sopping up messes , drying things , and placing under leaky things to catch drips.I 've used shop towels for staining , polishing , drying , cleaning , mopping , and dusting , and this box of 200 is good for at least 2-3 months in my usage . I bought a box for my garage and one for my workshop in the basement , and I use them frequently . Amazon offers a pretty good deal -- it 's about the same price here as it is at a local hardware store , and Prime shipping makes it a no-brainer .
 These lint free paper towels/rags are great . We keep the box in the garage and use them for quick spills , clean ups , wiping excess oil , glue , paint , etc. . It 's better than having to wash rags .
 I bought a box of these elsewhere on an impulse . Now , I find that they are actually cheaper than Basics type regular paper towels , as they are reusable . I have used them with various hydrocarbon solvents and they hold up very well . I also found them great for rubbed finishes , such as wood stains .
 got these as a gift for my greasemonkey father and he loves them . great for when you 're working with lots of grease or oil .
 Thanks to endcap placement in Home Depot , this is a very popular product . If it is really lint free , then it can be used to stain cabinets .
 I am a nurse . I saw one of these blood pressure cuffs being used by another nurse , and asked her about it , then , promptly ordered one for myself . At that time it was 100.00 , through a cnursing catalogue . I work in a busy rehab center where I take atleast 8-20 blood pressures daily . What my patients say about this is , `` Wow , it did n't tighten my arm at all . '' `` Did n't hurt a bit . '' `` I 've never seen one like it . `` A doctor and myself measured readings done manually and readings done by this little machine , and found either way to be only a couple of numbers different.My mom loves it , and we found the same model on Amazon for alot cheaper than 100.00 . I have had poor experiences with another wrist blood pressure monitor that was 39.99 . This little Omron is quick , easy , and correct.Some of it 's features
 This is a great product . My stepfather has developed very thin skin as he has gotten older and has to have his BP taken frequently every day . The regular arm cuff has caused quite a bit of damage to his arm . This cuff is around the wrist where the skin is a little thicker , thus saving his skin and not having to worry about infections to his upper arm . Also love the large digits on the screen . He is much happier and more willing to have his BP taken now . Thank you , Omron !
 I have been using Omron blood pressure wrist monitors for a few years now.I found this particlar one to be of excellent value and a great Workhorse.This one you can use in bed and get a true reading just by elevating your arm by your side to heart level.It reads within a Few units up or down as compared to a doctors office unit . -LRB- very accurate -RRB- Very close if not right on . A bit noisy but a fine instrament . .
 This is a great gadget and I feel that the results are pretty accurate . I have found that you really need to position this in just the right spot on your wrist , though , as it seems like an inch higher or lower makes a big difference . I 've found that placing the lower edge about where the lower edge of my watch normally sits seems to have the most accurate readings -LRB- about 1.5 '' from my palm -RRB- .
 This baby has helped me track my heart through all the highs and lows and ultimately allowed me to assist my doctor in verifying that something is seriously wrong with my blood pressure . We 're yet to verify what the culprit is ... but this little guy helps me know when to slow down or kick it up a notch.I would highly recommend this guy if you 're looking for a wrist-inflatable blood pressure monitor . It 's been consistant , reliable , and informative for both myself and my doctor .
 My wife and I were looking for a wrist model pressure monitor that was accurate and reasonably priced . I did a lot of looking at reviews here and other sites . I also looked in local stores as well . I found this model in one of our big-chain pharmacy outlets for $ 69.95 . Just for the heck of it , I came here and looked and found the same unit for $ 45 with no shipping costs . It was a no-brainer and we are very pleased with the unit we bought here . Aside from the cost , which was secondary after deciding on this particular unit , it was the reviews by previous customers , including a nurse that convinced us to take a chance on the Omron HEM-629 . It is reasonably priced , is accurate , and you do n't need to be an RN to operate it . If you are looking for a wrist unit , and do not need ultra-tech stuff , then this is a good buy for the money .
 My doctor told me to buy a cuff to check my blood pressure from time to time . I did n't know what brand to choose so I came on to Amazon and read the reviews . . I am very pleased with my choice of Omron . Directions are easy to understand , fits perfect on my wrist . works terrific . Great price for the money.Amelia Petre/Ridgefield , CT. .
 works great and is easy to use . My husband and I like it . It is a good addition to your home first aid kit .
 Easy to use , and good for those who need monitoring on a regular basis though physicians do n't recommend using it for diagnostic purposes . I recommend it .
 I wanted a blood pressure instrument for home , but I did n't want to throw my money away on junk . When I visited my doctor , and he used this device , I bought one . Works fine .
 As with all Omron products , this item is well made and easy to use . Its accuracy compares favorably to a lab unit and is well suited for use by those who want to monitor their BP and heart rate while exercising . The requirement to be seated and to hold your arm with the monitor attached to it next to your heart is something of a pain but it does give more accurate results when used as directed . It does however give good results in almost any configuration . Highly recommended .
 This blood pressure monitor is easy to use.It fits just about anybody.I have found it to slightly overestimate blood pressure .
 This is my second time purchasing this item . Really loved this product . Bought two of them this time to be presented as gift .
 Good seller . Fast delivery . Item is as described . Thank you for your business !!!!! Pleasant to do business with . Recommended . A + + + + + +
 Great product and works great . I was a little leery about a wrist monitor but it works fine . Compared it to an arm one and was right on.Highly recommended .
 Need a unit that could be hooked up and get a reading quickly . This product does just that and it was at a very good price . We use it in conjusnction with an oxygen level reader . Just great for home use and you can take it with you .
 Its nice and easy to use . more over the price was very competitive.pros - The thing i like about it is small size.cons - some times it do not work as efficiently while u have some kind cloth in between . . still a nice gadget .
 Bought two of these for my family . Everyone is delighted with them . I tried them both for accuracy and blood pressure read correctly . Large viewing screen for elder parents .
 I have used a standard above-elbow cuff model for many years . They are clumsey and having to do the pumping of the bulb perfectly makes it extra work . When my unit seemed to be giving incorrect readings it got dumped and I got the Omron . Outstanding . Slip it on the wrist -LRB- above the wrist joint -RRB- , push the button , and the device does everything , including recording the readings for later recall . The unit stores in a small case and has no long tubes to bother with . I 'm pleased .
 This has been very easy to use . I just slip it on my wrist and press the button . I can keep track of my blood pressure and take my medicine accordingly .
 Happy with this buy as it help us to monitor blood pressure within minutes and very easy.Correct readings correspond with doctor 's measures.Omron is the most accurate company you can get among automatic blood pressure machines .
 I love this wrist monitor . After struggling for a year with the cuff type , this is so easy to use I can check my pressure throughout the day without any effort at all . A relative had this same one and she works in a hospital setting where she could check the quality of the readings against what the old fashioned nurses type cuffs read and the readings were in line with those of the hospital cuff . I highly recommend .
 Very easy to use . You just put it in place and push a button . It inflates and deflates automatically . My doctor wants my bp readings every other day so the memory storage is another excellent feature . I just bring it to his office and he can see the readings for himself . I would recommend this product .
 VERY impressed with the Omron HEM629 Auto-inflate BP Monitor . It 's truly is Impressive ! Reasonably priced , compact , very easy to use and accurate . First tested the unit on myself as my BP and pulse are consistent and easy obtain . Then tested the unit on my wife who 's BP is very difficult to get . We were very skeptical of the unit at first because she normally requires a trained nurse to get BP using a large cuff with a stethescope and pulse taken manually . But the Omron HEM629 BP Monitor was so easy that my wife placed it on her own wrist , placed it up high by her heart while in a relaxed state , pressed the button -LRB- unit has amazing power ! -RRB- and got accurate readings which were VERY close to those take in the doctors offices . The key is to follow the directions to the letter and hopefully you will have the same good experience we 've had . Have only had the unit about a month so ca n't attest yet to duration but it comes with a warranty . Thank you .
 Excellent product . Does just what it said it would . Easy to use . I will carry it to my next MD appt to be positive numbers are accurate , but I am really sure already that they are .
 this product has exceeded my expectations !! it seems to be accurate and simple to use.i have used several different brands and i have found this item to be as good as all , and better than some .
 I was trying to find a pediatric sized wrist BP cuff , but could not find one anywhere , so I bought this one and it works fine so far . And if a kid 's wrist is just too small , I take it on their leg near the ankle , seems to work well that way too .
 I am very pleased with how simple the wrist unit is to use and is just as accurate as the cuff model I replaced . Yes , you do need to follow directions . Excellent choice and great value .
 Bought this for our pregnant daughter that needed to monitor her blood pressure . Easily worked by one person and is accurate wehn compared to a manual blood pressure . Comes with batteries too ! Good buy . This is the second OMRON product we have purchased , quality products .
 I have used this model for a couple of years now , Dr. checked it against his and was quite surprised . Replacing it now because holder one vanished at the office
 The wrist monitor is easy . Just put it on your wrist , press on and your blood pressure and pulse are shown . A plus is it keeps a record of your pressure on the days you take it so you can review . It is as accurate as a traditional arm monitor and much easier .
 This is a must for travel ! My Cardiologist recommended I purchase one and he told me this was the one I should buy . It is simple and easy to use . Before leaving on my trip I checked it numerous times along with my regular monitor and found it accurate . Now after returning home I continue to use it as it is so easy and simple to use .
 I received my monitor two weeks ago , We do a lot of traveling and this Monitor is very handing , In the past my wife would carry her larger unit . We are very please with the product .
 This blood mesurer is the best from all that I had before . I have problems with blood pressure about 30 years.It is very accurate and simplt in use .
 Easy to use , dependable and does not grab you like other type blood pressure devices . Fay B
 Seems to work just fine . We were a bit anxious about the wrist monitor , but our daughter -LRB- a nurse -RRB- told us that they are just fine . Follow the instructions .
 I had purchased another brand for less , and had inaccurate readings , a cuff that would n't deflate . In general , dumpster filler . My dad has an older model Omron , so this time I ordered wisely ! Very happy with the way it works , I like that you can average last 2 or 3 readings over 10 minute period . -LRB- Some people claim that pressure will be differant on left or right arm -RRB- At first I thought readings were low , turns out I was just relaxed . Quite a differance when I took bp while watching sporting events !
 This is by far the most accurate and convenient blood pressuring meter I ever owned and there were quite few . Follow the rules and you can be sure . It 's important that you do NOT move while the test is in progress .
 This is an easy and accurate way to take blood pressure . It attachs easily and is quick in providing the current blood presssure . It also keeps storage of the last 30 + readings .
 We bought for parents and also tried by ourselves , very easy and convenient to use and carry .
 I have had this monitor for about a month now and I like it . It comes with a nice case and is easy to store beside my computer . I have compared the readings to other BP monitors and it is accurate . If you want convenience , I would recommend this monitor . I have a strong paulse so maybe that is why the readings are accurate . If you paulse is weak , perhaps it would not work quite as well but that is probably true for all electronic BP machines unless you purchase one of those expensive hospital kind . The numbers are easy to read and it also stores previous readings so you can go back and review you old reading .
 This heart monitor is excellent and 97 % has good as it regular type for home monitoring your heart rate . Five stars in my book .
 I like this little device because it is very easy to use , holds the information for future reference -LRB- memory option -RRB- and has a large face with easy to read numbers and it is small in size.It takes blood pressure and also pulse . It is so much simpler than the old cuff type , just strap on with velcro strap , press blue button . It seems reliable as I get similar readings with other BP monitors . It uses AA batteries which so far seem to last a long time.Fun , functional and easy . I would give it 5 stars if it held more than one person 's information in memory and if it were less expensive .
 I have to take up to a dozen blood pressures per shift at work , and this makes it very easy . Thing is , the person has to stay very still -LRB- as is with most electronic monitors -RRB- and on patients with Parkinson 's or other issues with tremors , thats no easy task .
 I find this little machine to be easy to use -LRB- when I remember to use it -RRB- . It takes up very little space I have a tremor so ease of use is important . I also like the LARGE digital display . I recommend this monitor to anyone who has to monitor their blood pressure .
 Had this for nearly a year now and works AOK , matches Doctor 's figures so excellent useful item . Not cheap , but a case where paying a little more is a good idea , health control is vital.Took a bit of time to learn how best to work the monitor but since then , easy to use . NOT A TOY , a real quality machine . If you need to check blood pressure regularly at home , this is for YOU !
 I have used this a few times since purchased and it is extremely easy to use . All you do is pop in the batteries -LRB- included -RRB- and put it on your wrist and hit start . The measuring seems very accurate . I also have a watch that measures heart rate , and I have checked it against the wrist cuff , and they always come out the same or within one reading . The memory feature is good , but you may still need to track yours on paper if more than one person uses it because it just tracks the last 60 readings with no other info .
 BP and pulse compare favorably with cuff BP and manual pulse . Be aware if A-fib is present , pulse will not be correct . Use stethoscope and count apical pulse for a minute .
 Ordered this for my dad as it was easier for him to use -LRB- by himself -RRB- than an arm cuff . It , so far , has worked out well and the ease of using it means he will monitor his BP on a regular basis.Medical professionals have told me that it is , sometimes , not as accurate as a cuff . But , if BP is not at a risky level , this is acceptable . One point , with a wrist monitor , it is necessary to 1 -RRB- be at rest for 5 min and 2 -RRB- the wrist must be held up at angle to heart for most accurate reading , not simply laying flat on arm of chair or in lap.I have recommended these to others with aging parents .
 Nice little blood pressure cuff . I 'm a nurse and this comes in handy when we are unable to get a BP by other means .
 This makes taking blood pressure quick and easy for my patients . No more cuffs , pumping and also more comfortable for patients .
 My husband and I use this every morning to keep track of our blood pressure and I would recommend it for all senior citizens .
 Not much else to say . It does what it is supposed to and does it well . Easy to use , and seems to be accurate .
 Muy bueno Excelente , llego en la fecha esperada , muy agradecido y son de muy buena calidad , los felicito 100 % , y funciona
 This wrist cuff is so easy to use , you can check your blood pressure more frequently . It seems to be as accurate as the arm cuffs . Well worth the investment !
 We purchase these units to be used in our dental practice . California state law now requires that we take blood pressure reading prior to use of any administered anesthetic . Since we can not ask patients to remove clothing and put on a medical gown as is done at a doctors appointment , these work great when patients have too much restrictive clothing on . We have one in each operatory . Periodically we check the readings against the traditional cuff and stethoscope method on ourselves and the readings are consistently correct . A number of our patients have told us they use one at home for daily checks . Next best thing to a cuff , and Amazon has the best price we have found .
 I had a blood pressue monitor before that was not a wrist model , and I wanted something smaller and easier to use . This wrist model is very easy to use and the readings for BP and pulse are very large and easy to read . Also , the body of the unit appears to be quite substantial and of high quality ; the readings are made quite quickly and I like the feature that you can store the data . Summary
 I LOVE this BP cuff . it goes super quick for my patients , and it gets the same exact readings as my arm cuff at home ! the only catch is you have to be perfectly still as it is reading , or it gets wacky -- sorta inconvenient for my patients with the shakes , but nothing is perfect . I love how it has memory , so i can compare my readings over a period of time , or take a couple readings before writing them down , which is nice when your busy . Overall , i love this cuff ! im buying another one soon for a friend !!!
 This wrist blood pressure monitor is so easy to use . I have 2 arm cuff monitors and this is the best by far . I can take my pressure anywhere and it is quite accurate . I even talked a couple of other people into buying one as I thought it was so great . They like theirs as well .
 The Hem-629 Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor is as good as advertised . I 'm very happy with this purchase . The monitor is fast , accurate , and easy to use . It comes with a portable carrying case for protection , easy storage , and transportation . It can store 60 readings to memory with time and date stamp . It also provides an average . One negetative thing is that I do n't think it can separtely record the results for more than one .
 I purchased this for my 88 year old Mother . This is very easy for her to use and read .
 I 'm a dental student and I bought this cuff for taking BP at school . I use this twice a day and I find the readings to be consistent for patients with the readings they get from their doctor . I like that this cuff does n't have a positioning sensor , which often makes you move your arm around until the cuff picks it up . The only problem I 've had with the cuff is that it does n't work well on individuals with very large wrists .
 When I ordered this , I expected it would be a few points off , but in the doctor 's office , the diastolic -LRB- bottom number -RRB- was an exact match and the systolic -LRB- top number -RRB- was two numbers higher . We compared several times with the doctor 's BP cuff and it was consistent . However , when I used it the way the instructions said , with my arm crossed over my chest , it was WAY off . My suggestion is that if you purchase this , you simply prop up your arm to elevate it to heart level . It was very accurate when used like that . Impressive little product !
 I 'm a homecare nurse and this is one of the best wrist cuffs I 've used . It works well for most all of my patients , even the squirmy ones . Plus , it 's a great price . I 've paid more and gotten less . The pulse tends to measure high , at least on mine , but I like to take that manually anyway .
 Works as advertised . Easy to use . Wish I had switched sooner . The wrist monitor does n't hurt like the upper arm PB monitors do .
 I have to regularly check my blood pressure . My Doctor suggested this machine , and I love it because it is so easy to use , and the readings are very consistant .
 I had a stroke which left me with the use of my right side . First I bought an upper arm monitor , which was impossible with just one hand . The Visiting Nurse told me about the wrist model I bought and solution at last . This has made me feel secure in being to track my own blood pressure .
 I purchased this device recently not because I thought I had high blood pressure but because I wanted to regularly check my BP to make sure it was n't irregular or too high . I love this device because it is fairly accurate -LRB- I say it 's fairly accurate because I used it at the hospital to check if the BP was the same as what the nurse recorded -RRB- . This device is convenient to carry around if you need to check your BP on the road . I believe it is very affordable for what it is and it 's a great way to stay on top of your blood pressure !
 if you need to keep a check on your blood pressure this is the easiest monitor to use and is accurate , i checked against the doctors and he agreed it was more than acceptable
 The clinic where I works uses these on a regular basis . They work great ! Normally they are really expensive , but getting them for less than 40 dollars is a godsend .
 This is a great value and a great product . It gives accurate readings , and is easy to use.I would reccommend this product .
 Although two consecutive readings might vary by about 10 mmHg , from day to day the readings I get from this device are just as consistent . I 'll have to see when I next go to the doctor how close their reading is , but for now , it 's a great tool . It 's also stupidly easy to use ! You just put it on and go , and it 's really easy to access the memory of previous readings and their average as well . I love that it came with batteries , too . For $ 30 , it seems like a great deal .
 I had an arm cuff style unit that never gave me my pressure and I had paid over $ 100 for it . I was tired of the painful episodes with the cuff squeezing the blood out of my arm . I got this one a couple weeks ago and it is so convenient a child could use it and no pain at all . It always gives me my pressure reading too . I ca n't believe how much easier it is . It also has all the bells and whistles on it . I 'm so glad the price was minimal through Amazon because I did n't want to put a lot into another unit and have it fail me . I would definitely buy this and if you want to know if the reading is as accurate as the doctors unit , take it with you and try it right after the doctor does it with his unit . I am going to do it the next appointment that I have . I feel that I would still use this even if the doctors is higher or lower because I can just add or subtract my units readings.Paula
 Really easy to use , as it goes on your wrist , not your upper arm . My cardiologist at UCLA recommended it , saying ` you do n't need one with a computer that keeps track of months of data , this is good and less expensive ' , and he was right .
 Great product for the price . Easy to use digits large enough to see without readers . Archival mode allows for easy tracking of data especially usefull when providing documentation for those who need anti-hypertension therapy
 I like the convenience of the wrist blood pressure monitor , but it reads low . I do n't know how to adjust it , I do n't think it can be adjusted , so I just remember that the reading is going to be low . It gives me a psychological boost to see my bp so low !
 Well , i bought two of this blood pressure moniter to my parents . They are working well , so far . Some suggestions are as following . i wish the manufacturer will see the suggestions .1 , the battery cap is very hard to open . not complain , but you really need a sharp nail to dip it up .2 , a little confuse if you do not read the manual before first time using . you do not know how to set up the the monitor . actually , it needs two times of reboot to begining its original working .3 , very easy to scratch the LCD surface.Overall , it is a good deal ~
 It 's the best brand in pressure blood monitors , really . you do n't need to buy batteries and the pressure samples are easy and faster . But amazon send me anothe model , not 629 , instead they send me 629-N2 , differents buttons and same operations funtion .
 This is overall a great product . I am an EMT-B and i use it every day . It is nice to have the hard case with it beacause it keeps it from getting damaged while bouncing around in the back of the ambulance . I have gotten inaccurate reading from this bp cuff on a few patients , but that 's not bad considering the volume of patients it has been used on without a problem .
 This blood pressure monitor is easy to use and works great .
 THIS SMALL EASY TO USE MONITOR MAY SAVE YOUR LIFE . HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE IS KNOW AS A SILENT KILLER . WORKS GREAT .
 A friend got these for our wedding with the matching cake server , they looked beautiful in the photo 's . We even took them on our honeymoon and they held up well . The only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is because the decorations came off the glasses after using them only a couple times . Not a big deal , we can just glue them back on .
 I was pleased with the item . A good quality broom and dust pan without over priced shipping . Thank You .
 This arrived just as described . The handle is metal and very sturdy . The dustpan is also great . Have only had it a few days but it performs very well .
 Little did I know it 's guaranteed for life -LRB- still do n't know if it 's MY life or the BROOM 'S -RRB- . I like the snap on dustpan -- keeps it handy . Very sturdy . Great price . I think I 'll get a lot of years out of it .
 These towels are better than any paper towels made , but you can purchase them cheaper at your local hardware store for a lesser amount . I recommend never BUYING PAPER TOWELS AGAIN ONCE YOU USE THESE . .
 The box dispenser needs work . Or else the perforations need to be deeper between each square so that they break free more easily when pulled . Invariably I have a wrench or a greasy part in one hand , and have to wrestle with the box to pull out a single paper with the other hand . I will keep them , use them up , and probably order again , but may put an old starter motor on the box so it will stay put while I snap a towel out of there .
 Great product , good price ! There are a whole lot of paper towels in this box ! Use for all kinds of shop and garage work and love them .
 I keep this in my garage and these are great for cleaning greasy hands and parts . The box lasts me quite a while as a casual home mechanic .
 I had been buying the `` RAGS IN A BOX '' , which are superior in quality and usefulness . I decided to give these a try and I really LOVE them !!! Theyre super tough , easy to start the first towel through the dispensing top and rugged in every way you use them ... yet soft enough to wipe my sensitive face ! NOW THAT 'S A PERFECT TOWEL ! You will not be disappointed by these towels . Like Mikey for the Life cereal commercial used to say ... `` try it , you 'll like it ! ''
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 These paper `` rags '' are like heavy-duty paper towels and work like a charm for cleaning all the surfaces in your home . They stand up to strong cleaning products and really come in handy when you do n't want to waste paper towels or use an actual towel . I like to always keep a box of these on my shelf .
 I use these for an oil painting class and they work great ! They 're a cross between a paper towel and a rag . I love them !
 Not exactly what we were l looking for . We are in search of shop rags that are in bulk for our auto repair facility .
 We use these at our church so there 's no taking rags home to wash . So conveniet and one Scott rag will wash all the dishes and do the clean up without falling apart . Then we just toss 'em when we 're done . Great product .
 These rags are more like really tough paper towels that come out of a box and i love them ! They are great for cleaning anything around the house that you would use a rag for . The only negative is that they are pretty much just extremely strong paper towels , not cloth rags , so I would avoid using them for anything that requires vigorous cleaning , as they will probably rip .
 Hefty is always a good brand to buy . These bags are not very thick so avoid putting pointy waste in them . Regular trash works just find . If you have heavy duty items to throw out , these bags will not work for you . I , myself still was unable to use the bags because I purchase the wrong size bags . I should have purchase 33 gallon bags and not 30 gallon bags . My fault , and Hefty is still a good brand to buy .
 They 're very large , more like lawn bags . My husband likes the bags but they are so big they remind you of the big brown lawn bags .
 I was presently surprised in how strong the plastic was for these bags . It also cost me in total 17 $ with shipping . Not a bad price I say for these . I recommend them . ; -RRB-
 This salve smells great and really heals wounds . It is also very soothing and an excellent pain reliever for cuts . A good friend from Australia introduced me to it -LRB- she let me use hers on a bad cut -RRB- and I had to purchase my own . Every medicine chest should have it . I love and highly recommend Herbal Ed 's Salve .
 Good product . It gets the job done . I would buy this product again .
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update

 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !

 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^

 I started taking Gingko a few years ago when I noticed I was n't as quick on the draw at work . I had read a lot of good things about it and knowing it 's a natural based supplement decided it could n't hurt to try . There was noticable improvement for me within the first couple weeks . I was more focused and my memory was n't as hazy ; there was clarity instead of fog . The fog had been building for awhile so I was happy to see it diminish with the ginkgo.Another boost came in the energy department . As I hit my late 30s , the extra push to get all my necessary work and life stuff done had become a battle . Ginkgo helped me to relieve a lot of that fight which was awesome . I had turned a co-worker onto the stuff as well and she actually came back to me to tell me how much it helped her , but that she 'd found an even bigger boost when she took the ginkgo in conjunction with ginseng -LRB- Ginseng Complex Plus Royal Jelly -LRB- 1000 Mg -RRB- + FREE Ginkgo Biloba Extract -LRB- 30 Mg -RRB- 60 Tablets -RRB- . At her suggestion I gave it a try and wow - all the positive effects were enhanced tenfold ! My recollection skills are as clear as they where when I was a teenager and there 's no longer a fight to clean the house or cook dinner after work ; I have enough energy to do it all.I 'm definitely a more efficient and effective person when I take my supplements . Between the ginkgo and ginseng , I doubt I could be any better at what I do than I am now . I highly recommend it to any and all working people with brain overload !
 I am full time college student and have been using this product on and off for a couple years . I find it extremely helpful when studying new concepts that for some reason have a hard time `` sticking '' . I use it while studying for tests to help improve my ability to focus and concentrate on the material ... and actually retain and recall it while taking the test ! I have had nothing but wonderful experiences with this product although I might mention that a few of my friends who have taken this have had jittery reactions to it . Come to find out they both have a blood type of `` O '' . I am `` A + '' with no side effects . Do n't know if it 's a related occurrence but just something I noticed . I would highly recommend this product but make sure it is complimentary with other medications you are currently prescribed .
 This product has helped my husband so much ! At one point I was afraid he was getting dementia , and I had bought a book from Dr. Atkins on nutrition and he suggested a lot of ingredients that where found in this Ginko smart , I started my Husband on this and Phosphatidly serine matrix - and within a month he was back to being sharp as a tact ! It has made a dramatic improvement in his memory and sharpness , I cant recommend this product enough . Not only that , it is about 1/2 the price on Amazon compared to Health food store !
 I started a diet program through a medical weight loss clinic . They proscribed an Adkins type ketogenic diet and phentramine type medicine . After the initial ketosis symptoms , headache , and fatigue ended , I began to notice changes in my memory . The brain normally uses carbohydrate based fuel , but in an ketogenic diet it must fuel itself from stored fat . As I adapted I noticed an increase in my short term memory , and a loss in my long term memory . So I started taking this product to help . I 've finished to bottle and I feel like my memory and focus are great . Despite the sleeping issues I have on the phentramine stimulant/appetite suppressant , I am still able to recall the tasks that I had prioritized and the stage of completion.Pro 's
 Irwin Natural 's `` Ginkgo Smart '' has many healthful ingredients , including a fish oil base , but contains Vinpocetine , which is a periwinkle extract that might induce side effects such as reduced immune function and depleted catecholamine levels leading to depression -LRB- see wikipedia 's Vinpocetine article -RRB- . For a standardized extract containing both the 24 % Ginkgo Flavonglycosides and the 6 % Terpene Lactones , along with other brain nutrients , one might investigate Karuna 's `` MemoRegen '' , or Source Natural 's `` Ginkgo-24 '' , or Allergy Research 's `` Complex-M w / Ginkgo '' , or Life Extension 's `` Super Booster '' . GINKGO REVIEWED ... THE BAD
 This product has saved my life while in school . I 've noticed a HUGE difference ! My memory , attention , energy , everything is better ! I 'm almost done with my first bottle and will definitely buy more !
 In the afternoons at work , I 'd get tired and not able to focus well . I really needed a nap to reset , but they tend to frown upon that at work , so ... I looked around for a product that included Ginkgo , Choline , & DMAE , to which this product has all and more . The first week , I could tell I was more alert in the afternoons , and was able to focus better . I have n't used it for more than a couple of weeks -LRB- hence only 4 stars -RRB- , and not consistently , but I do notice a difference is clarity level when I use it . No ill side-affects , bad taste , etc. . I ca n't find anything wrong with this product .

 I notice that I am able to think clearer and I do n't live in a fog when I take GinkgoSmart .
 I have ADD . I realize , looking back over my life , that is was a hindrance to my complete success . I am not making excuses , but going by what I now know to be true.Well , life is unlimited . And now that I have found a way to truly FOCUS I am unstoppable.Please try this if you just need to focus and definitely if you are ADD . You will get more done and be more organized.There are other pills containing DMAE and Huperzine , etc. but these are cheaper and due to Irwin 's delivery to the body , take effect better.Keep in mind that you should not take these if pregnant . I did for a while -LRB- because I did n't know I was pregnant -RRB- but I found out that it was possible that one ingredient in these pills could possibly give neural tube defects in baby . My baby did n't have these , thank goodness , but it is good to heed the warnings . Also , other items in these natural liquid soft-gels are simply not proven to be safe or not safe for PREGNANT women . Again , my child was okay but do n't chance it if you KNOW you are pregnant.But barring that , this will work for anyone . I have a baby sister that is bipolar as well as ADHD and they help . They help my aging mother and my &#34; normal &#34; minded husband.At least give them a try and it is good that AMAZON carries this larger bottle . So many health food stores do n't have it or it gets out of stock quickly .
 I am big fan of Irwin Naturals Ginkgo and been using it for years . My wife uses a lot of there brands as well .
 I continue to buy this product . I had been feeling somewhat overwhelmed , like I could n't keep my thoughts straight . I purchased this product and it seems to help with clarity during the day . I definitely can tell a difference when I have not taken it for a couple of days .
 My son was 14 when he took this and it seemed to help him a lot w/out all the chemical side effects he had experienced with the prescription drugs . I would recommend this as a natural alternative for MILD ADHD cases . Please allow 30-60 days to see full effect ! * Your questions or concerns can be found at the Irwin Labs website !
 I 'm in sales , so I really need to be sharp , focused and energetic . This product has given me all three beyond what I expected .
 I have been using this product forseveral years . . It Works !! I highlyrecommend it.And the price is right at Amazon.Go for it !
 WORKS GREAT TO HELP WITH THE MEMORY AND ENERGY LEVELS . PLEASE READ ALL SIDE EFFECTS FROM OTHER DRUGS YOU MAY BE TAKING AND TALK TO A DOCTOR .
 Unlike others my husband has tried in the past , this seat riser for elongated toilets is sturdy , easy to clean , fastens completely securely , and is not difficult to install as long as you know how to loosen the bolts holding the seat/top to the toilet . Highly recommended !
 thanks just what needed just the right height , I am a tall person and i received it in just a couple of days
 I first took Milk Thistle in Europe on advice from a doctor for my liver . I took it sporadically when I was in Canada . I am now down here in CA . and am now 50 and feeling my age . I noticed getting up 2-3 times during the night to urinate . I got milk thistle again for my liver , but noticed a serindipitous side effect ... I was n't getting up in the night as much on 250 mg , all I could find . I just happened to search for it on Amazon and I found Wonder Labs with their 1000mg softgels.I now sleep thru the night , have way more energy during the day . I am back to excercising , losing weight and feeling much better about myself . I will be buying this product for the rest of my life . I have even got my X-wife on it and she is now hooked ! I had never heard of this company nor do I have any affiliation with them . They have the best product for the BEST price and I will definitely be spreading the news to my friends as they have noticed the change in my energy levels because of a better nights sleep ... not what I originally got it for ! I highly recommend this product and they have others I will be trying as well !
 When told I had a fatty liver I was surprised because I 've been taking pretty good care of it . But when I saw Silymarin Milk Thistle and learned of it healthful properties I was intrigued . Hoping the product cleanses and support my big fat liver , I will continue to take it with trust in my heart that it 's doing the trick .
 I 've been using Milk Thistle for many years because of my Liver . Excellent product & works well with other herbs & vitamins . Some brands have made me sick to my stomach , but this one does n't . Once again Amazon has the BEST price for me !
 I ca n't find this product in stores any longer , so I was happy to find them on Amazon for such a low price !
 I have tile floors and two pets and this mop keeps my floors in great condition ! When you have 2 young children and a dog who tracks in dirt all day long , the floors get pretty dirty . The scrubbing head is great for getting the toughest dirt spots out and the sponge head keeps streaking to a minimum . Even works well on my bathroom floors where I have the super small times and lots of cracks for stuff to build up .
 It 's a nice and easy to use mop that does n't leave a bunch of water on the floor .

 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products .

These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself .

But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names .

 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .

 I stopped taking my Tag Heuer wristwatch to the shop for $ 50 battery changes . I do n't punish the Tag so I chose to forego the pressure testing and change out the battery myself . Not too difficult if you have a watch case wrench to open the back without damage .
 Good for a backup because they are hard to find for older Seiko watches and buying locally is at least 2 - 3 times the price .

I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims .

 I prefer the coating action of these compared to the regular Cepacol lozenges . These seem to keep I nice layer of soothing / numbing medicine on your throat just a bit longer than the regular ones .
 The coating action in this cough drop works much better than the same product without it . Lemon lime flavor is great .
 I 've bought several pairs of reading glasses lately . These are the highest quality and best design I found in this very reasonable price range .
 Finally I got Drakkar aftershave.But the price !!!??? $ 49.99 for a small 50ml -LRB- 1.7 oz -RRB- bottle ... How much will cost 100ml -LRB- 3.4 oz -RRB- bottle ? $ 100.00 ? Is this some mistake ?
 I 've tried many different forms of vitamin C , and I 'm convinced that Meta-C is the best , especially if you want to take larger amounts . I 've had chronic joint pain problems clear up quickly and permanently with a high enough dosage . And it was the fastest way I knew to accelerate healing of colds and flu , until I upped my Vitamin D to 5000/day - now I just never get those anymore ! It 's odd to me that Meta-C is so unknown and difficult to find , many other web retailers who carry other nutribiotic products do n't carry it . The company should market it better , it 's truly wonderful .
 I was given a few samples and was amazed at how it relieved pain without the horrible smell usually associated with pain relieving rubs.It does not burn nor have a menthol scent.It has a lemony scent and thin cream texture . It rubs on and gives relief quickly . It is not easily available at pharmacies but found it on Amazon at a reasonable price .
 This stuff works wonders and i even ordered more after the 1st time , i checked some stores and penetran plus cant be found anywhere ... will be ordering from this seller again .
 I ordered this for my mom who swears that it is a great . she says it works quickly . It 's hard to find in stores so I am grateful that Amazon makes it easy to obtain online .
 I bought a tube of Penetran probably 15 years ago and was amazed at how well it worked on my severe arthritis . After all , it had cost me $ 10 for 4 ounces , so it should work . All through the years , whenever I used it , I found amazing relief , so I was dismayed when it ran out . Fortunately , I found it on Amazon , now $ 12 for 2 ounces -LRB- a good price considering inflation -RRB- , and it really , really does work !
 I have used this for the past few years for those times that the knots in my legs keep me from functioning . Works well in taking down the pain level . I always take it with if I am going anywhere overnight .
 I have used this product for years . It soothes arthritis , sore muscles and joints without the `` Ben Gay '' smell or feel . It takes a fraction of the amount you would use in the more popular brands and has a pleasing lemon scent . At night before bed I apply a small amount to an area in need and wake up feeling great .
 BEST YET
 I 've been using this product for years , ever since my mom first found it in a locally owned pharmacy . When we moved out of town , she would still make the trip to the drug store because no chain pharmacies would carry it . It obviously works for muscle and joint pain but I use it most for minor burns and stings and it works FAST ! I 'm clumsy in the kitchen and tend to touch hot things a little too much . Whenever I get a little burn on my hand , I rush for the Penetran and it immediately stops hurting and I 've never gotten a blister when I use it immediately.I would give this 5 stars but the smell is a little odd , like a medicinal lemon scent that is kind of a turn off .
 This stuff works miraculously well on my body . If 'n I found out that its usage was shortening my lifespan , I 'd still continue to .
 I have severe arthritis and just had one total knee replacement done . This lotion really takes some of the ache away from arthritic joints when massaged into the skin a bit . The scent is light and lemony , and the bit of relief it offers is welcomed .
 Over the past three years , the pain from arthritis in my knees has grown to almost debilitating . Stairs are impossible . Standing for any length of time stove me up for the rest of the day . I will NOT say the pain is totally relieved nor can I bound up the stairs like I used to but this has made the pain bearable in a way no smelly rubs or pills have been able to do . I am so grateful . -LRB- And so is my boss since I introduced her to it ! -RRB-
 My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl / wa7AI , with $ 10 off and free samples . Great stuff !!!!! I was told the enormous benifit of Oregano
 i used to get coldsores quite often . . sometimes 4 or 5 times a year ... i hated it . . i 'd pay $ 1,000,000 to not get them again hehe . . thats how bad coldsores kill your social life -LRB- they also leave scarring -RRB- . my mom 's coworker recommended this product to me . . so i decided to try it outyou get coldsores when your bodie 's antiviral immune system levels are low ... and this could be caused by a number of things such as getting sick . . overexerting your body ... getting too much sun ... anything that causes your body to become weaker ... so when i 've gotten sick in the pass year ... as soon as i feel a cold coming on i would drink 4 capsules twice a day during my cold ... and once my cold went away to stop drinking the capsules -LRB- drink the capsules only when you think you 're body is under extreme stress -RRB- . i have done this for the past year and have not gotten any coldsores !! one time i had a hangover from drinking too much . . threw up for most of the morning . . i didnt think anything of it ... a couple days later a coldsore started to appear on my upperlip . . it was in its very beginning stages ... so i quickly drank 4 capsules twice a day and the coldsore never fully formed and disappeared completely after 2 days leaving no scarring at all.this product works ... this is a small price to pay to not have to experience the ugly pain of coldsores again
 It works . Enough said . word word word word word word word word word . Stupid to tell me how many words to write when four words will do .
 No outbreaks have happened for 5 month ! Good Product ! I 've also used Vitamin E , Zink and V-Lysin . No Acyclovir used
 This works -LRB- for me -RRB- I have n't had an outbreak in months ! Before I used to get them at least once a month , for years . This is a true life saver , I ca n't believe this product is n't in the media more.I take one capsule in the morning and one in the evening , it seems to keep the virus at bay . Even when I 'm going out drinking heavely or eating arginine rich food.Suppressive Acyclovir treatment made me feel crummy . I have n't experience any side effects from this product . So glad I found this

 I like this item a lot . It really helps you gain lean muscle quickly if you take it as recommended , and especially if you stack it with Cell-tech -LRB- creatine -RRB- , but the one bad side effect i experienced is that it made me really gassy . I recommend taking it with a meal or after .
 Product is definitely a good one for anyone who takes their training seriously , and does not want to buy separate supplements -LRB- for example

 nitro tech help you gain up to 9 pounds in just 6 weeks . wow !!!!! cool
 I started taking these for minor ailments , which were prescribed by myself from personal research . I have to say that when I take multivitamins I feel better and this seperate C vitamin and bioflavonoids are great for pumping up the C/anti-oxidants in your diet . This particular vitamin/bioflavonoid combo is especially useful if you do n't like to eat fruit . I started taking too many and felt weird so I cut back to only one a day . Various research has pointed to doses as high as 10,000 mg/day -LRB- that 's 10 grams !!! -RRB- for certain treatments , which seems extreme . I was trying 3,000 mg/day -LRB- one at breakfast , lunch & dinner -RRB- but it proved too much too fast for my body . Start with one a day with your biggest meal and see how that works and if you want to take more then add another at a different meal and see how you feel the next day . I have no complaints about this vitamin and this manufacturer has a good reputation from what I have read .
 This is a great Seller.The price was great and the service was excellent!The Cell Guard Plus is a wonderful nutritional product.It helps me to have better energy , health and happiness.My semi-wild `` Barn cat '' had a bad gum infection . I treated him by grinding up these tablets and adding it to his food . -LRB- 2 aday -RRB- for 2 weeks.He got over the infection and has put on weight.Now I have him on a maintainence plan of a smaller dose 3 times a week and he is looking great!Best wishes , Fiddlegrin
 I love this ! Gives me the leverage / angle to work on areas that are tight from working on computers so much . BREATHE ! Get one for your loved ones or yourself and you will feel much better .
 I picked out this tool because it had a the most knobs of any other tool that I found . I think it works great . Admittedly I do n't use all the knobs but it gives me all the options I need for my own issues . The only problem I have with it is all the knobs have a crease down the middle of them , which can be a little uncomfortable if you press down hard on bare skin . This seems like an obvious thing the manufacture should have addressed . I took a file and smoothed all the heads down and it 's much more comfortable . This tool works great for me but admittedly a cheaper tool with less knobs would probably do just as well .
 I tend to have a lot of tension in my neck , shoulders , and lower back . The body back body is FANTASTIC . I can finally hit all the tension points . I wish it came with a little more suggestions on how to manipulate the buddy but trial-and-error is fine with me .
 I would give the actual product a 5 star rating ... but I 'm giving 4 stars b/c it did NOT come with the instructional packet/book that the site said it comes with ...
 It arrived fully assembled in a large but thin box and all of it was lightweight . A solid yet light piece of durable equipment with 11 therapy knobs , allows me to use 2 pointed knobs to get back under my shoulder blades and apply continuous pressure , almost effortlessly , on knots-trigger points that develop following strenuous work done by my arms and shoulder muscles . Almost instantly pain dissolves as trigger points are released . I 've received nice deep tissue massages many times before and in my opinion this tool provides equally as effective results on the specific muscles that its used on . Consider that your pain may in fact indicate the need for a full body alignment to be performed by a decent Chiropractor especially if the trigger points recur in the same area . Still this tool allows for a quick and convenient solution for curing pain effectively before you 're able to get Chiropractic care . The bodybackbuddy should easily fit in your check-in luggage . Makes for a nice gift even more so for single folks who do n't have a spouse-buddy to request/trade the favor of a love filled massage . Now off to get a back-scratcher ; - -RRB-
 I have a weekly deep-tissue massage w / a professional masseuse so I know where my pressure points are located and I am in-tuned w / my body 's muscles and tissue . With that said , I recommend this product if you know what you 're looking for on your own body .
 I purchased this along with the Trigger Point Therapy book . After reading a little bit about the various points of muscle and fascia that get knotted up I tried using the Buddy on my wife . This really helped her back pain subside . I would recommend this product without hesitation .
 I have had back and neck issues for many years . A friend recommended getting a ` Thera-cane ' . I bought the Body Back Buddy and have not been disappointed.It has rounded and pointed ends on either side for more options . There are several ends to reach painful areas-neck , back , shoulder . Just press and release - much relief from nagging pain . It works easily lying down , standing up or with a partner.The price is right too !
 I am a massage therapist , and I also have a car accident injury that does n't want to heal . I used a Theracane before at physical therapy , but I find the shapes on this tool allow more options and advantages to trigger point treatments . It is a bit big , but following the small pamphlet included does help in managing self-therapy angles . Overall , I am happy with the purchase .
 This is a very well made item . It definitely does what it says it is supposed to do . I like that you can use it in hard to reach places .
 Wish I would have found this sooner . I 've been to multiple specialist related to pain to no avail . Seems it has been trigger points from musculoskeletal issues . The back buddy in combination with the trigger point therapy workbook by Claire Davies has put me back in control .
 I have some neuro issues and this tool allows me to handle the issues as soon as they arise instead of simply taking medicine and hoping that the medicine alone is going to help me.I had a slightly more simplistic device , and this one is worlds apart from the old one . I ca n't say enough positive things about the design and the fact that if I wake up at night , have a spasm attack in the day or some other scenario - it 's this tool that I turn to first.Simply put - It 's EPIC
 This thing sure looks strange , but whoever figured it out did a fabulous job . It is easy to hold on to and apply pressure wherever you need it.If one end does n't work , just turn it around and the other end will.You do n't have to apply all the pressure with your hands either , you can use your arms to push on it.It is hard to describe , but after you have use it and tried it at different angles and directions , you will find that it is very effective at applying pressure on any tense or knotted up muscles just about anywhere in your body .
 This was amazing . Real limo sticks are made of wood from a guava tree . this plastic one does the job just as well if not better .
 This thing works on trigger points I did n't even know I had ! My right buttocks was bothering me and thought it might be sciatica . I started first in the buttock area then pressing near my hip and it felt really tender and my lower back popped ! Do n't know what happened all I know my buttock pain is relieved . This device comes with a nice info pamphlet . It is the perfect tool for self treatment . I have bought other devices similar to this in the past but this is the best !
 I bought this product after using it at a friend 's party.It 's perfect for when you 're watching tv or after a long day at work . Easy way to find those hard to reach places and apply just the right amount of pressure . Designed so you can hit different parts of the body without much effort .
 The Body Back Buddy is a brilliantly designed massage tool . Each knob has it 's own specialty and is adept at getting at the body 's natural trigger points . If your muscles get tight and sore -LRB- I think this applies to everyone -RRB- , I highly recommend this product . It really helps .
 The Back Buddy is remarkably simple in concept -LRB- I wish I would have thought of it first -RRB- and while made of a sturdy plastic , is fully up to delivering on its promises for its intended use . Simply put ; it says what it does and does what it says . And insofar as I am concerned ; it is worth every penny I paid for it .
 Bought this about a week ago and have used it daily to massage knots in my upper back . Worth every penny ; very glad I purchased it . Wish I had bought it a long time ago .
 This product is overpriced but I kept it because it does work . I do n't use it often but it 's nice to have something to activate those unreachable pressure points in my neck and back now and then . Now I do n't need to rely on my wife quite as often . I 'll come home from a bike ride and use this device to work out the pain in my upper back and lower neck . I 'm sure you could come up with something cheaper that would do the same thing as the Body Back Buddy but I do n't have the time to look around or make my own device so the $ 35 was worth it . Therefore , it gets a hesitant endorsement .
 This thing has given me relief from my neck pain . I have cronic pain in my neck and back for years . My neck pain is not completely gone but it is much , much better . Has not worked as well for my lower back pain , but it does help .
 I bought this for my teenage son who works out a lot and has soreness frequently . I myself have scoliosis and have daily back pain , but I am sort of used to it . Anyway , I woke up this morning laying on my back and when I tried to get up I was hit with painful spasms in my back that made it virtually impossible to move . I had to call my husband from the other room to come help me out of bed . Anyone who has experienced spasms knows how painful it is and it is very hard to even find a comfortable sitting or lying position . If you move just wrong , it 'll send you back into intense spasms . So I 'm on the couch trying to find a comfy way to sit and I thought of this gadget . I had my son bring it to me and started applying very firm pressure to different spots on my back . When I finished , I found that I could move much more freely , without any more spasms . Now , it was n't a 100 % cure , but it made my day much more pleasant and I was able to move around and do everything I needed to . What a relief ! I am a believer .
 I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday . He was the one who told me this is what he wanted . He loves it ! He is very happy with this .
 This was a gift for my daughter . Her chiropractor suggested it for her . She loves it .
 I purchased this product back in October , after using a friends at work . It is so awesome ! I had to have one after using my friends . I accidently ordered the wrong type , so I exchanged it for the blue newest model that is in the picture . It is slightly different than my freinds . Anyway they have the best customer service ! I called and emailed them when I realized I had ordered the wrong one . They responded very quickly to my phone call and email ! I was extremely impressed ! They sent the correct massage cane to me quickly . Most of all I love this product and everyone at my job and in my family wants it after they try it ! Excellent customer service !!!! I will buy more from this company for sure !
 Seems to really help my wire - she bought it . It reaches places you can not with out it . Love it
 I 'm traveling out of town on business for long periods of time and miss my weekly deep tissue massage therapist . This is a great way to get through between massages . I can press on trigger points and release tension easily . I use it almost daily for a few minutes and find fast relief . Love the product !
 I often have back spasms & keep this by my chair in the livingroom to use . May not use every day , but when I need it , it is a godsend ! Instead of having to try to press out the spasm with a wall corner or begging my husband -LRB- who can never get it right -RRB- , I use this & it really works . Bought a trigger point book also that helps me find the right place to press . If you have upper back spasms , shoulder spasms & do n't mind taking charge of your problem , this item really is for you !
 I am a professional athlete and I use this back buddy all the time . I ca n't just get a massage every day of the week , so I purchased this recently remembering when I saw one of my buddies using it a few years ago . It is great and a sturdy product . I have been very pleased and would recommend to anyone with upper back knots frequently . Also very durable as well . I am 275lbs and I really come down hard on this back buddy and it withstands the test .
 This was rated great by our PT ... he gave us recommendations on how to use it for even more relief from back pain .
 Recieve the Body Back Buddy last week . Have suffered with pain in shoulders for years . Always had to find somebody to work my pressure points . Not any more . My new best friend the Back Buddy can do all and more that was advertised . Some of the best money I ever spent .
 I sit in a vehicle at work for most of a ten hour shift . Staring at a computer and typing away in a swiveled , contoured position makes my neck ache . It is constructed very solidly and I use it as recommended for 10-30 seconds -LRB- 3-4 sets in each spot -RRB- when I feel the tense aching coming on and it relieves it . It gives you nice access to really anywhere on your body and it extremely useful for me . I also lift weights and work out five days a week and never realized after using this , just how tender and tight my rhomboids and other surrounding back -LRB- shoulder -RRB- muscles get . Very happy with the purchase .
 This device is great . Handles are in the right place , the hooks provide plenty of reach for a person w/a large chest & shoulders . This device is effective by using a properly designed fulcrum system that produces enough leverage & therefore pressure on the 1 &#34; ball tip to REALLY help me!Altho I originally purchased it hoping it would help me hit the trigger points in my glutes to help with hip pain , altho it reaches , I just ca n't get the torque -LRB- apply enough pressure -RRB- to be noticeable , least of all effective.Another problem area I have is in the low neck/high shoulder area . Sometimes pain & ` pressure ' seem to build to the point where I can hardly move & yelling out in pain , I ask my gf for a brutal acupressure application -LSB- loosely applied term , all i mean is that she grinds the localized area with great amounts of pinpoint elbow pressure -RSB- which solves the problem.HOWEVER , with this device I can apply all the pressure needed to alleviate the pain MYSELF!WARNING !!! ALTHOUGH EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE -LSB- your results may vary -LRB- ! -RRB- -RSB- you must know that you may have to really hurt yourself to help yourself . If you can tolerate the pain from the pressure you create -LSB- & if you do n't yell out or growl , it 's probably not enough pressure to do the job -LRB- altho i hope it is -RRB- . In that case , reapply with even more pressure . Get that blood flowing to that area & you 'll also produce endorphins which is your body 's method of creating it 's own ` painkillers ` QUESTION
 I have tried so many things - including but not limited to . . a vibrating hand held back massager , I bought a chair pad with a massager on it , used creams and back patches trying to release the knots in my back and while these things gave temporary relief ... . This Back Buddy has been the only thing that has worked in getting right into the knots and work them out . I do n't think that I will need to dole out any more money to pay for a back massage !
 The back buddy is ah-mazing . I was considering purchasing a thera-cane having just learned some trigger point therapy techniques from a friend.My friend has something like this also but not as many knobs and functions as the body back buddy.This is a sensational tool for myofascial release spots in your back and neck , one that can not be overlooked.For me , it 's a absolute must have .
 I am so glad I bought this . I constantly have sore shoulders and a tight neck ... this massage tool works great . It is amazing how much pressure you can apply without hardly any force at all . I really love it .
 Awesome product ! I never knew I would enjoy this so much ! i had it shipped to work , and everyone was curious . I let them try it , and now everyone wants one . I love it and I recommend to everyone .
 This is a great product . I recommend it to anyone with back or neck problems or who gets headaches .
 This cane works wonders . My back is perpetually stiff and this cane allows me to loosen up knots on my own . Everyone should have one !
 I have owned the Body Back Buddy -LRB- formerly the Better Back Buddy -RRB- for at least 8 years , if not longer . I use it daily at home to help control my fibromyalgia muscle pain . I bought a new one for my office , where many of us use it to relieve our neck , shoulder and back muscle tension.This is the best self-help tool I have ever owned , and I highly recommend it to anyone who experiences body pain .
 I use the back buddy regularly and even take it with me when I travel . I have had neck and shoulder problems for years and this allows me to work out knots and give me much needed relief between massages . I would highly recommend this item , anyone can use it .
 Because my husband is n't always available to rub my back when I REALLY need it , this Back Buddy has be perfect ! When I 'm at the computer , I rest it over my shoulder and every once in a while press on a sore spot for a while , go on with my work but can keep using it all day long !
 Great Tool , so many ways you can apply pressure , massage muscles , just unlimited uses and easy to hold on to ... would highly recommend this tool !
 Great gizmo for getting to the little knotted areas in your neck and back . I keep one at home and one in the office .
 I bought this for my fibro tender points . It does work well , however it could be better . Not bad for the price though . Be careful not to overuse because you will be sore !
 This is awesome ! I 'm just sad I waited so long to try it . I 've returned to school and study hunched over -LRB- or work at a desk -RRB- which tightens up my shoulder muscles . I carry stress in my upper back / shoulder area and the muscles are so tight they ` click ' when I find someone to try and rub them.Normally family and friends can not ` dig in ' as much as I 'd like or as long . -LRB- Can not afford a $ $ massage -RRB- . This baby does the trick ! I 'm taking it home for the holidays and my sister will likely try to take it . I just can not say enough about it . Try it & you will not regret it !! Thank You Paul Nash for designing it!Follow the direction , 10-30 seconds at each pressure point . Anymore and your body will respond as if it is hurt.I did it a couple times a day the first time . Skipped a day b/c I was sore and then used it again but not as long or hard but still found the relief I was looking for . I had a small headache behind my eyes , did n't think it could be allergies and used it on my shoulders , neck and the headache vanished.If I could carry this with me I would !
 My therapist recommened this product and I 'm so glad she did , I use it all the time and it brings me relieve from sore neck and shoulders .
 This is the best tool ever for those pesky knots in my back . There are 2 S-curves on this massager , one side on the S has a pointier knob and the other has a round knob -LRB- for a little less direct pressure -RRB- . The pointier knob side is my favorite and I use it to get relief from the tightness and knots in my shoulders . My favorite way to us it is as shown by the lady in the photo.I brought it into my office last week and my co-workers love it . A few of them went ahead and purchased immediately after trying , one planned to give it to her husband for a Xmas gift . Then this weekend my relatives are visiting and the Back Buddy has been in constant use . We took it with us to my mother-in-law 's house because no one wanted to be without it for the afternoon . In fact , someone even wanted to bring it in the car for the shopping trip we took today . It 's been going through a rotation of people -LRB- ranging from late 20 's to early 40 's -RRB- constantly this weekend . Yes , it looks rather awkwardly large and it 's really conspicuous but it 's fantastic ! If you have knots you want to work on , esp . in your back , get this now . I still prefer a foam roller for my legs/hips but for my back , this tool is invaluable . It also works great on the pressure points on your feet .
 I just received my BBB and I could n't be more pleased . It is very durable and after discovering only a fraction of the many uses for this product , I am convinced that this is the only tool that would ever let you reach those difficult spots -LRB- including those sneaky ones that you feel , yet nobody else can seem to find -RRB- without having a masseuse . Also , there are so many resources online to research trigger-point therapy and reflexology . It 's great to have such a simple pleasurable product that also sparked the curiosity in me to learn something I would n't otherwise know about.The only con I can think of -LRB- which might not even apply -RRB- is that where some other massage tools rely on the motion of the tool -LRB- like the kneading action of a massage chair , or pulsing of a hand-held massager -RRB- This one works much better as a trigger-point tool . Digging deep into a troubling knot and holding for a few seconds , then experiencing the rush of relief as you let go . This is not to say that you ca n't get some decent kneading going . Last night I spent almost a half hour discovering different spots in my neck , and I could feel the tension slipping away and tingling throughout my entire body.My guess is if you think you might want the Body Back Buddy , YOU 'RE PROBABLY RIGHT !!!
 The body back buddy works just as advertised . It 's good for working out those tight spots and also if you just need to scratch in those hard to reach places . The one piece of advise that I 'd offer would be to get the Trigger point therapy book . It helps show you exactly where that tension in your body comes from and exactly how to alleviate it . Great product -LRB- although it does look an erotic toy , something which the Marines I work with have let me know on more than one occasion -RRB- .
 I keep it near my desk at work and work out tension in my neck and shoulders , a couple of times a day , before it gets bad . This thing reaches any part of the body . No more waiting until someone 's available to give you a massage -LRB- and by that time , you 've already got a tension headache or very tense muscles -RRB- . I carry it in the car on long trips.For about half the price of a massage , this is a must have . It 's big and kinky looking and everyone will ask you about it , but I have n't seen a better-designed product for the job at hand .
 It 's amazing how easy it is to reach knots and apply a lot of pressure to knots in my hips and back . Love the design and sturdiness !
 I have knots in one shoulder that have been causing severe pain for years ... have been to doctors for injections , chiropractor for manual treatments and electrical stim , have tried ice and heat ... nothing worked . Direct pressure to the area is the only thing that gave relief ... but it is in a place on my body that I can not reach , so had to always ask my husband or family member to `` press on it '' for a long time . I now can use the Body Back Buddy whenever I get the pain and the constant pressure I can apply with the product almost immediately eliminates or reduces the pain . No more begging for someone else to do it for me .
 The back buddy lives up to its hype . Lightweight , accessible to various body types , and well-stationed knobs , I could n't ask for more . Overall , great product !
 This tool hits all the sore or tight muscles in my back and neck . No need for physical therapy or pricey massage therapists !
 After 10 years of considering back pain to be a constant in my life , a chiropractor virtually ended my back pain using trigger point therapy . I had n't realized how much life I was giving up due to back pain until the pain was gone . Unfortunately , when my back pain came back years later , I found that my new chiropractor did not practice trigger point therapy and the methods he did practice brought only partial relief . It was at this point that I started looking for another answer . The Body Back Buddy Classic has been that answer . Now whenever I get tense , painful knots in my back , I am able to message them out myself with the Body Back Buddy Classic . I find this device to save me much time , money and pain .
 The upper right quadrant of my back is really messed up , with a couple of major pain trigger points . One of my best friends had one of these and I had toyed around with it a few times and was impressed with how effective it was . Then a few months ago I started getting regular manipulations from a doctor . She recommended that I get a Body Back Buddy to help loosen up my back and shoulder . Along with a roller foam that I use to help arch my back a bit , it has helped reduce the pain in my back.I frankly ca n't imagine anyone not wanting one of these . If you have pain , it will help you deal with it . But even if you do n't have any spots where you have actual pain , it will help you relax and stretch . And heck , it just feels good . And the Body Back Buddy is so well designed that it can be adapted for just about any spot on your body , from the arch of your feel to your upper or lower back , to your calves , to the back of your neck , to your upper shoulders . I strongly recommend using the BBB in conjunction with one of the books available about pressure points.You should definitely get one of these . Yes , they work . A bargain for the price.One other thing . There is a similar product , the Theracane . I have toyed around with both . I definitely recommend the Body Back Buddy over the Theracane for a couple of reasons . One is that the double hooks , one ending in a ball and the other ending in a sharper point , to give very different kinds of pressure points . I just found that you could do more things with the BBB than the Theracane . Though frankly , either is going to do your body a lot of good .
 I 've known I have trigger points for years -LRB- Thanks , Clair Davies ! -RRB- , but since I have a Knobble , a boyfriend , and some sharp edges on my granite countertops , I thought a Back Buddy type tool would be redundant . How wrong I was ! I 've been having a lot of tension headaches lately , and finally thought I 'd give the Back Buddy a try.This incredibly bright blue tool arrived larger than I had imagined . It 's great for digging into all sorts of area that the booklet does n't illustrate . For instance , sit at your kitchen table , using the table to support the Back Buddy , and lean one of the long pokey parts into your neck to apply pressure to your sternocleidomastoid muscles . You can also balance the tool on the ground , kneel , and lean into the same pokey bit to massage sore hip muscles . Be creative ! I 've used it to help stretch and to unplug an item behind a large appliance.When not in use to massage sore muscles , you could probably also keep it around to club a burglar in the night.Oh - and be forewarned
 Like many other reviewers ' , my BBB did n't come with a `` 12 page instruction booklet '' . It came with a small -LRB- 2 '' square -RRB- 4-page advertisement for itself showing an athletic woman in Spandex holding it in various ways and smiling , with no text description of what she was doing . I put it aside for weeks , afraid of hurting myself trying to use it without knowing what I was doing.Eventually a severe back spasm led me back to it in desperation and I started gently `` playing '' with it . I was surprised to find that it 's relatively intuitive , despite looking intimidating . If you 've ever used a kitchen counter or table corner , square support post , or doorknob to rub your back against , the same instincts apply here -- you just have LOTS more options . Position some knob or another against a sore spot , apply gentle pressure , and wiggle . After a few seconds you 'll naturally gravitate toward the motion and degree of pressure that feels good and helps . It 's a little slow -LRB- I use it while watching TV or doing something else -RRB- but inexpensive compared to massage , and with practice you can get very good at controlling the amount , type , and direction of pressure -- something that can be difficult to communicate to another person.The length can make it cumbersome but also provides what I see as its greatest strength
 So I 've owned this for less than one week . I have had neck , shoulder and lower back pain for quite some time . I have been in some kind of constant 24/7 pain in my lower back for the past year and a half , Chiropractic does n't help . My shoulders and neck have been extremely stiff and painful for the past 6-7 months . I had an episode of vertigo in July due to it.I was getting ready to have my doctor get me back into physical therapy where they have done TPT -LRB- trigger point therapy -RRB- on me before with great results . Then I bought this.I know this is going to sound over the top , or maybe that I am exagerating , but I 'm not . Working my trigger points several times a day I have all but eliminated the tightness and stiffness in my neck and my lower back pain is almost non-existent . But , you have to keep it up , not over do it , and do it consistently . That being said , two days after I received this , I went out and bought Clair Davies book , The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook . I recommend this because it helps to know what you are looking for and how to address it . There is A LOT to learn , and I figure if I am going to poke and prod around on myself then I want to have a good idea on what I should do and how I should do it . Being to physical therapy before I learned from them , too , and already had an idea of what I was looking for with trigger points . In general though , remember for TPT to work , the trigger point is generally located away from the site of where you are experiencing pain , and also located on the same side of the body.Muscle wise , this is the best I have felt in a long time -LRB- and in such a short period of time -RRB- and I would recommend this tool . I would also recommend Clair Davies workbook -LRB- or any good TPT book -RRB- to go with it as a must have . Learn as much as you can so you can use it successfully .
 When I was contemplating whether or not to buy this , one of my main concerns was the quality of the material . I also was n't sure whether to buy this or the TheraCane.After receiving this in the mail , I am very pleased with the quality of the product . It is somewhat heavy and the plastic feels very strong and solid to me . It is not cheap toy plastic for sure . I talked to one of my friends who has tried TheraCane as well as this one . He said the TheraCane is too short and due to the bigger curve , it was more wobbly/flexible than back buddy . So I am very happy that I went with this.It is very easy to use and can be held in any way you like to reach hard to reach places on the back by myself .
 This is something you can use without the help of another and it is effective too . The knobs are nice for digging into those tight shoulder muscles .
 I am a massage therapist . This simple versatile tool , used correctly , is invaluable for relieving tension and pain . You can be as inventive as you want with it . I personally like to lay on the floor and lever my body against it to break up really hard areas of tension , such as the quadratus lumborum -LRB- the source of many people 's low back pain -RRB- . With this tool and some practice you can get to a lot of muscles that you just would n't be able to get to without a massage therapist doing some deep tissue.Here is how I recommend using it
 This item was supposed to include a manual which was not shipped and the company made no mention of missing manual . Contacted them asking for the manual . Turns out they ran out of manuals and offered $ 6 back for missing manual . I did n't like the fact that they just ommitted the manual hoping that I would n't notice it . To me that 's poor service.On a positive note , it is the best back massaging tool -LRB- non-electric -RRB- I have ever used and is far better than theracane imho . I own both and this one gives a lot more leverage and have more versatility than theracane . Only advantage of theracane is that is is easier to pack away in a tote to take on a trip . I would give this product even 6 stars if it were n't for their lousy service . I ordered 3 more sets of this w / accumassage . Had to pay $ 20 for shipping and they estimated 3-5 days shipping . 6 business days have passed -LRB- 10 days total -RRB- and nothing yet . The tool delivers , but the company does n't .
 This tool is amazing . I have chronic knots under my shoulder blades in my back , and this nifty gadget works them out easily without much effort on my part . My mom has now semi-confiscated it for her own use -LRB- ok , more like borrowed -RRB- . I just might have to purchase another one for myself soon !
 I ca n't live without my Buddy ! I can fix the pinched muscle under my shoulder blade now .
 I like the idea of this product and it does a really nice job of working the knots out . My only problem is the price ... I think $ 20 would be a much more reasonable price for what it is , but I suppose it 's still a fraction of the price of a massage so I 'll cease complaining right there . : -RRB-
 Finally ! As a therapist specializing in Sports and Deep Tissue massage , I am often asked by my clients `` who works on you ? '' Sadly my answer has always been `` no one '' . I have n't been able to find anyone with the skill level I insist on to perform body work on me.This tool allows me to get at the trigger points in my back , neck , shoulders and even my feet . It 's still not as good as being able to just relax and have someone else do the work , but at least I can get the major knots out . I highly recommend this product for self-therapy . One word of caution though ... If you 're not careful , you can do more harm than good by getting over zealous . Moderation is the watchword here .
 This item workes great ! I bought it for my girlfriend so she could rub her back right where it hurts instead of sending me on the drunken directions trying to find the spots that hurt ! Great item for guys and gals all around . I steal it from her occasionally and use it on myself after long shifts or big fires , it really hits the spot !! In short , GREAT price , GREAT item ! The end !!
 I am a licensed physical therapist asst. , who has specialized in myofascial release -LRB- gentle , sustained pressure techniques to release adhesions and realign the spine , neck , and pelvis -RRB- . If you want a tool for home use or even in your practice , this product is TERRIFIC for releasing adhesions and tight areas in the body . I personally own and use this product myself , as I was in a car wreck in 2010 , and have a spinal fusion from T7 TO L1 -LRB- with two Harrington rods and 10 screws -RRB- . BACK BUDDY PROS :1 -RRB- WELL CONSTRUCTED device , made of STURDY , THICK plastic material .2 -RRB- Has BOTH smooth , rounded points , as well as angled/pointed knobs to allow for less or more intense application of pressure .3 -RRB- EXCELLENT for HARD TO REACH AREAS - this product , as compared to the ` Theracane ' , offers more points and an additional ` curve ' to target hard to reach areas on the back , thus allowing many more options for use .4 -RRB- Comes with an easy to follow instructional guide which is EXTREMELY helpful , especially for those who are not familiar with how to use this type of device .5 -RRB- Has points spaced out PERFECTLY to target BOTH sides of the lower back at the same time -LRB- as well as precisely place points to target both sides of the neck -RRB- .6 -RRB- Lessens the need to go to a physical therapist if used properly .7 -RRB- REALLY WORKS to break up adhesions in the fascia for pain relief ! 8 -RRB- Cost is reasonable.CONS OF THE BACK BUDDY :1 -RRB- The product is undoubtedly STURDY , but is a bit on the HEAVY side . Be sure to read the instructions , and maybe even see a therapist so that you use this product properly - If not used properly , you will fatigue OTHER muscles during use , and that could result in adhesions in other areas . Try your best to RELAX when you use this product to get the best benefits . Let your body weight do the work for you instead of ` pulling down ' with your hands to apply pressure .2 -RRB- As compared to the ` Theracane ' , -LRB- which I have also used -RRB- , again , the Back Buddy is heavier and more cumbersome . If you have good range of motion and want a lighter tool , the ` Theracane ' may be a better option . Keep in mind , however , that the Back Buddy exceeds the Theracane because it has more points , and if your range of motion is limited , the Back Buddy is a better choice due to the ` extra curve ' that will help to reach places easier .
 After developing a persistent `` back of the body problem '' that extends from neck to hamstrings & calves I 've gone into research & solution mode trying everything from acupuncture -LRB- helpful -RRB- to assisted stretching -LRB- costly -RRB- to physical therapy three times per week -LRB- not as effective for the cost -RRB- . I bought the Body Back Buddy after watching a video on youtube on Myofascial Release/Myofascial Trigger Points ... the BBB is AMAZING !!! It allows me to hit my trigger points with very little effort , I feel like I 'm standing outside myself giving myself the PERFECT massage . I 'm regaining my flexibility after 9 days of use , I just use it whenever I 've got a moment -LRB- like watching TV -RRB- . I took it to the Pilates studio where I workout and the ladies tried it and fell in love ... my boss also ordered herself one from Amazon.I 'm generally a complainer , the sort of person who 's hard to please , but I really ca n't find any fault with the BBB , initially I thought it was pricey but that opinion is long out the window because it delivers time and again and my returning strength and flexibility is proof . I 'm very pleased with this purchase .
 I ordered the Body Back Buddy over a month ago as a last resort for a lifetime of middle-back pain . I am in otherwise excellent shape ... I run daily , do gymnastics , and lift heavy weights . With over 12 years in the active Army , I 've deployed on combat tours , ruck-marched hundreds of miles , and jumped out of airplanes . Sometimes after exercise , I would n't be able to breathe deeply due to the middle-back pain , right under my shoulder blades . To get rid of the horrible pain , I tried everything
 I 've been having pains in my upper back for over a year now , primarily due to the frequent typing/sedentary activities that engage in throughout the day . I 've tried all sorts of therapies and medications , all with very limited success . Massaging is definitely one of the best things that help with my pain , but it is not always easy to find someone to give you a massage , especially the kind that involves very specific trigger points . When my doctor first introduced me to TheraCane , I was totally sold on the idea . This was exactly the kind of tool that I was looking for . I looked around for the best combination of features/price , and decided to try out Body Back Buddy . It seemed to be even more functional than TheraCane , and even though I do n't necessarily need all the options right now I think it is a worthwhile investment down the road.The feature of the Body Back Buddy that I like the most are the dual `` hooks , '' each with its own spacing and a set of knobs of various shapes and sizes . I use the blunt knob for the more diffuse massaging , and the pointed one of the precise application of pressure . I use this massaging tool many times throughout the day , every time I feel the painful tension in my back . So far it has lived to its promise , and I am extremely satisfied with it.Body Back Buddy is sturdy and well built . At first it seemed too light and I was wondering if it could withstand various degrees of pressure , but it turned out to be more than fine . Its lightweight build also makes it ideal for traveling . Overall , a very well designed and useful product and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get an easy and effective self-massaging tool .
 Great tool . Feels great , but just be careful not to massage yourself too long , or , you will end up being a little sore .
 If you 're not impressed , please give it a day or two ! It does n't always -LRB- never , for me -RRB- give instant relief . But it does give relief that will last 48 hours or so ! I ca n't use all the ways it 's to be used because I have an unnatural fusion but it 's worth it !
 This product has been wonderful helping me get knotted muscles to relax ! The only con I have about this product is that it does n't come apart for smaller storage . Other than that it 's great . I even took it with me on vacation !
 This product really works ! Perhaps a lot of you are familiar with the pain that I 'm about to describe
 If you are looking for a good quick massage that you can do on your own , this is the product . Great !
 This product is everything it claimed to be and more . I had been going to a chiropractor for a couple of weeks without lasting results . As a rehab nurse I was looking for a way I could be more active in my treatment . A physical therapist with whom I work let me use a similar product and I was very pleased with it . I looked online and found this product which was more versatile and offered more `` little knobs '' for greater trigger point release . I am very satisfied with the Back body buddy and have already recommended it to friends and co-workers . Note
 This is my new best friend . I always have shoulder and upper back pains and now I can sleep better at night after using this very awesome trigger point massager . And most of all , I can save so much by no longer going to a spa just to have a deep tissue massage .
 There is not much more than I can say except that this item has become my new best friend . I can finally take charge of my aches and pains and alleviate them without relying on anyone else . On of the best purchases I have ever made !
 while i think the design could be better , i would recommend this for muscular back pain . it provides drug-free relief from pain for me . it 's not a cure-all but helps a lot .
 I bought the Body Back Buddy for my dad , and he absolutely loves it . He has suffered from degenerative disc disease and arthritis for years , and this tool has helped him find some muscle pain relief . thank you so much .
 This crazy looking tool is wonderfully effective in relieving sore , knotted muscle pain in my back and neck . I lift weights , and occasionally over do it . This thing saves me having to go to a chiropractor . I would suggest to anyone thinking about this thing to do a little research -LRB- internet -RRB- on trigger point therapy . Knowing how to `` dig in '' to a sore spot is helpful . I 'd also recommend you take it light the first few times that you use it , as it can make you sore if you over do it . I 'd also stay away from the video that goes for about five bucks on amazon . It 's worthless . If you or someone you know wants or needs frequent deep tissue massage , particularly in the back and neck , this is the ticket .
 Could not find this product in Australia and am so glad I made the effort to post it from the US . The body back buddy is so brilliant I dont know what I have done without it . Finally I can give myself muscle relieg .
 The Body Back Buddy is great . This is the only device I have found that allows me to pinpoint a tight spot in my back to work it loose . This is perfect for use in between massages . It is much better than using the door jamb . I can easily massage my feet also while watching TV .
 This product is just what i needed sitting here at work typing all day ... my co-workers are using it as well . hits all those tense shoulder spots and more !! Thanks
 Able to reach my back just where I wanted and provide the leverage on it that I wanted , and feeling the release I wanted , I smiled .
 This is a great product . A friend has a metal S hook product that has 2 different size wooden knobs on it that got me interested in the concept but this product is the best i have found . you can get to any point on the body you need to and apply whatever pressure , at almost any angle , you need . Its a great value !
 I wish I 'd bought one of theses a year ago when I first heard of it . I still think $ 30 is pretty steep for a piece of shaped plastic , but I never found it cheaper elsewhere and now that I 'm walking out the door pain-free , I 'm gon na say it was worth it . Definitely recommend that you buy this in conjunction with a foam roller to help stretch out the muscles after digging into them .
 this is a great tool for the home and office . I am a busy mother , who sometimes does n't have time to go for a massage . After 3 uses , this tool pays for itself . Go easy on the first time you use it . You would not be able to treat all the knots on your back with one session . Limit yourself to 30 minutes on the back , if you go more than that , you would be causing damage to the muscles . One session every 3-5 days is enough to start and then once a week , and then biweekly , and later as you need it . Great invention !!! it melted the pain away while I watched TV .
 Very good to relief the pain in the neck and lower back but not as easy to use as the Body Back Buddy Mini . It takes a little more practice .
 I just got this and used it for only a few seconds before I said out loud `` why did n't I buy this sooner ? '' It is rigid enough that I can use a lot of pressure and perfectly shaped so I do n't have to push too hard to get there . Fantastic !
 This is the most amazing tool that I have ever owned ! I highly recommend it to anyone who has body pain .
 I 've been imagining having something like this for some time , it does reach those unreachable spots very nicely . I am finding it to be like exercise equipment though , it sits on the sideline unused a lot . . though it does work , and help a lot when I use it!I bought this one instead of the other brand because it had the extra curve and extra bumps , but I do n't think I 'll ever use the extra ones because they are so sharply pointed . The rounded end is good enough for me . I 'm even thinking a softer/padded add on might be a good option for some people ?? I 'm sure I 'll be using this more as I get used to how to use it . It 's a good product for pressure points / trigger points / foot reflexology , do n't expect a `` gentle massage '' feeling .
 I love it , but the `` j '' shaped openings do n't seem as big as on one I used at physical therapy . I am a pretty big guy so I would have liked to see the openings a bit bigger to reach my trigger points.That being said , it is a great tool and I would buy it again in a second , it was worth every penny for trigger point relief in my mid to upper back and under the edge of the scapula .
 Works great , exactly as expected . My only complaint would be it 's weight and ample size , but it 's not an issue .
 Puts pressure where I need it ! I love that I can do my own trigger point therapy ! Who knows my sore spots better than me ? I have upper back pain right underneath my shoulder blades due to cubicle work . This gets it every time . And unlike chiropractic visit , there is no time limit . I call the shots ! It 's awesome . I purchased this tool based on my co-worker 's recommendation who recommended this tool to him . If you have back pain due to sore muscles , I would definitely recommend this !
 My massage therapist told me to get one of these , I can say its amazing for someone who has lots of knots in the back and shoulder area .
 After reading `` The Trigger Point Therapy Book , '' I purchased the Body Back Buddy to work on my trigger points . I unfortunately got a little to harsh with the use of the Back Buddy ... my nerves became inflamed . But I know now what pressure it takes to loosen the trigger points , especially in my back . Now I do n't have to spend so much money going to massage or chiropractic .
 A friend of mine turned me onto these . Saw it in his house and thought it was some kind of torture device . Once he explained how it worked though , and I was able to use it , I was sold.I workout a lot and often have stiffness in my back . I get massages on a regular basis , but sometimes I need something NOW ! Got one of these things and it helps me out considerably . For me , not as good as a professional , but it keeps me pain-free -LRB- more or less -RRB- until I can get on the table of my therapist.The one downside to this product is the size . It 's not portable , so if you want one for more than a single location , you 'll probably need to buy more than one . I need one for my office , which is what lead me to look here . This is a good price , by the way .
 A friend of mine , who is a message therapist , suggested this item to me . I 'm an active person -LRB- workouts , kayaking , orienteering , camping , working on the house , etc -RRB- and as such , I am constantly getting tight muscles and trigger points . The `` rolling around on a tennnis ball on the floor '' method was not getting the job done . The Body Back Buddy works beautifully for your back , neck , glutes , hamstrings , anywhere that you need to loosen up muscles and work trigger points to get rid of the pain and/or discomfort .
